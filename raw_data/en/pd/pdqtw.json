Rogers, Chief, San Mateo County Health Scott Gilman, Director, Behavioral Health and Recovery Services Subject: San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act Annual Update FY 2019-20 RECOMMENDATION : Adopt a resolution authorizing the approval and submission of San Mateo County's Mental Health Services Act FY 2019-20 Annual Update for Mental Health Services Act Programs and Expenditures to the State Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission and the Department of Health Care Services. BACKGROUND : In 2004, California voters passed Proposition 63, known as the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), which made additional state funds available to expand and transform mental health services. Since 2006, MHSA resources and expenditures have been approved by the Board as part of the larger County Health budget. State legislation requires that the MHSA Three-Year Program and Expenditure Plans and subsequent Annual Updates be approved by the County's Board of Supervisors. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Recovery Commission (MHSARC) reviewed the FY 2019-20 MHSA Annual Update on February 5, 2020, following a public hearing and 30-day public comment, and is recommending approval by the Board of Supervisors. DISCUSSION : On August 7, 2018, the Board approved the MHSA Three-Year Program and Expenditure Plan for FY 2017-18 through FY 2019-20. The enclosed Annual Update includes implementation highlights; program outcomes for FY 2017-18 and 2018-19; and expenditure projections. There are two key items in this annual update for Board approval: 1)Approve five new MHSA Innovation project proposals to submit to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). The MHSARC reviewed the Innovation project proposals on November 6, 2019, following a public hearing and 30-day public comment, and recommends that the Board approve. Page 1 of 3a. Addiction Medicine Fellowship Estimated Project Amount & Length: $663,125 / 4 years This will be the first Addiction Medicine Fellowship based in a local health safety net health system, serving as a model for California's 58 counties. b. Prevention and Early Intervention Services in Low-Income Housing Estimated Project Amount & Length: $925,000 / 4 years The proposed project will provide behavioral health resources, support, screening, referrals and linkages to young adults, ages 18-25, on-site at affordable housing properties. c. PIONEERS Program Estimated Project Amount & Length: $925,000 / 4 years Pacific Islanders Organizing, Nurturing, and Empowering Everyone to Rise and Serve (PIONEERS) will provide a culturally relevant, behavioral health program for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) college-age youth. d. Older Adult Homelessness Prevention due to Economic Stress Estimated Project Amount & Length: $750,000 / 4 years Isolated older adults will be screened for economic stress, behavioral health issues, and connected to homeless, housing, and behavioral health resources to prevent acute homelessness. e. Social Enterprise Cultural and Wellness Caf\u00e9 Estimated Project Amount & Length: $2,625,000 / 5 years The cultural arts and wellness-focused social enterprise caf\u00e9 will provide sustainable youth development and mental health programming for North San Mateo County. 2)Approve the ongoing release of unencumbered housing funds. On June 2, 2015, the Board approved the release of unencumbered San Mateo County MHSA housing funds following MHSARC review and recommendation to approve. Counties are now required to complete ongoing fund release authorization for both existing and future unencumbered funds that may be received by CalHFA on behalf of the counties (e.g. funds that are no longer required by a housing project, accrued interest, and/or other funds receive on behalf of the counties.) Currently, San Mateo County has an estimated $104,066 in accrued interest and loan payments held by CalHFA.Page 2 of 3Full-Service Partnerships (FSPs) The FSP service model provides intensive \"whatever it takes\" mental health services and support to eligible youth and transition-aged youth (TAY), adults, and medically fragile older-adult clients. Every year a summary chart of self-reported FSP outcomes is provided to the Board. This past fiscal year, one of our FSP providers for adults and medically fragile older adults changed its electronic healthcare record (EHR) system and is currently in the process of converting its data to the original analytic format. The data is expected to be available in Spring 2020. In lieu of the summary chart the following health care utilization outcomes, which are collected through Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS)' EHR system, capture BHRS FSP client outcomes one year prior to participation in FSP compared to one year after FSP participation. Healthcare Utilization (EHR data) Age Group Child TAY Adults OA Sample Size 210 176 313 47 Hospitalization 70% 21% 54% 33% 1 Year before FSP 10 24 120 12 1 Year After FSP 3 19 55 8 Psychiatric Emergency Services 54% 34% 29% 40% 1 Year before FSP 52 77 168 15 1 Year After FSP 24 51 120 9 The resolution has been reviewed and approved by County Counsel as to form. A client is considered \"maintained at the current or lower level of care\" if, during the fiscal year, they did not have a new admission to a higher level of care or had one or more new admissions to a program with the same or lower level of care. It is projected that 87% of FSP clients shall be maintained at a current or lower level of care. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : Measure FY 2018-19 Actual FY 2019-20 Projected Percentage of FSP clients maintained at a current or lower level of care85% 374 of 439 clients 87% 348 of 398 clients* *Based on data through 3/11/2020 FISCAL IMPACT : received $32.9 million in MHSA in FY 2017-18 and $33.5 million in FY 2018-19. We anticipate a reduction in MHSA revenue for FY 2019-20 because of the state implementation of \"No Place Like Home\" legislation. Funds that are not yet allocated through our internal planning process or Request for Proposals to the community are held in a Trust Account. This Account is also used to manage the fluctuations in funding that occur from year to year, as well as to support maintenance of effort and cost increases for current programs. There is no Net County Cost associated with this plan.

The County was formed in April 1856 out of the southern portion of then -San Francisco County. Within its 455 square miles, the County is known for a mild climate and scenic vistas. It is home to some of the most spectacular and varied geography in the United States that includes redwood forests, rolling hills, farmland, tidal marshes, creeks and beaches. The County is committed to building a healthy community. In collaboration with community - based partners, t he County provides access to health care services, especially to the underserved and unserved as well as creating a safe and convenient opportuni ties for physical activities. Much of the shoreline along the San Francisco Bay is part of the San Francisco B ay Trail. This trail provides residents and visitors alike with miles of biking and walking in the numerous park and recreation areas, and trails. The County has long been a cente r for innovation. It is hom e to numerou s colleges and research park s and is within th e \"golden triangle \" of thre e of the top research institution s in th e world : Stanford University, the University of Californ ia at San Francisco and th e University of California at Berkeley. Today, San Mateo County's bioscience, computer software, green technology, hospitalit y, financ ial management , health care and transportation compan ies are industry leaders. Situated in San Mateo County is San Francisco International Airport, the second largest and busiest airport in California, and the Port of Redwood City, which is the only deep -water port in the Southern part of the San Francisco Bay. These economic hubs have added to the rapidly growing vitality of the County. San Mateo County government protects and enhances the health, safety, welfare and natural resources of the community, and provides quality services that benefit and enrich the lives of the people of this community. We are committed to: The highest standards of public service; A common vision of responsiveness; The highest standards of ethical conduct; Treating people with respect and dignity.The 201 6 population estim ated by the U.S. Census Bureau was 764,797 \u2014 a 6.4 percent jump over the 2010 Census . Daly City remains the most populous city followed by San Mateo and Redwood City. The median age of San Mateo County residents was 39.3 years compared to the state's median age of 35.2 years , according to the 2010 Census . Projections indicate future decades will see a significant spike in the county's population 65 years and older. In 2015, the Census estimated 6 percent of the population was under 5 yea rs old, 21.2 percent were under 18 and 15 percent were 65 or older. As the County's population continues to shift, the racial and ethnic composition continues to diversify. More than 46% of the County population five years of age and older spoke a languag e other than English at home; of this population, 45% spoke English less than \"very well,\" according to the 2011 -2015 Census estimates. As of January 1, 2015, San Mateo County's threshold languages are Spanis h, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) , Tagalog and Russian (as identified by Health Plan of San Mateo) . The Health System identified Tongan , Samoan as priority languages based on a g rowing number of clients served and emerging languages as Arabic, Burmese, Hindi, and Portuguese. 8 MHSA BACKGROUND Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), was approved by California voters in November 2004 and provided dedicated funding for mental health services by imposing a 1% tax on personal income over $1 million dollars translating to ab out $2 9.7 million annual average for San Mateo County in the last five years through Fiscal Year 201 8-19. PRINCIPLES AND FUNDI NG BOUNDARIES MHSA emphasizes transformation of the mental health system while improving the quality of life for individuals li ving with mental illness. Core values include: Community collaboration Cultural competence Consumer and family driven services Focus on wellness, recovery, resiliency Integrated service experience MHSA programming is grouped into Components each with funding allocation and guidelines.

MHSAfunded activities further BHRS' vision, mission and strategic initiatives. 9 COMMUNITY PROGRAM PL ANNING 10 COMMUNITY PROGRAM PL ANNING (CPP) The San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) promotes a vision of collaboration and integration by embedding MHSA programs and services within existing infrastructures. San Mateo County does not separate MHSA planning from its other continuous planning processes. Given this, stakeholder input from system -wide planning activities is taken into account in MHSA planning. In 2005, BHRS devised a local planning process and structure to seek input from the broad San Mateo County stakeholde r community. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Recovery Commission (MHSARC), formerly the Mental Health Board, is involved in all MHSA planning activities providing input, receiving regular updates as a standing agenda item on the monthly MHSARC meeti ngs, and making final recommendations to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors (BoS) on all MHSA plans and updates. The MHSARC meetings are open to the public, and attendance is encouraged through various means: notice of meetings (flyers, emails) are sent to a broad and increasing network of contacts including community partners and County agencies, as well as consumer and advocacy organizations, and the general public. MHSARC commissioners are all members of the MHSA Steering Committee. MHSA STEERING COMMITTEE The MHSA Steering Committee was also created in 2005 and continues to play a critical role in the development of MHSA program and expenditure plans. In 2016, the MHSA Steering Committee was restructured to strengthen the representation of diverse stakeholders. The MHSA Steering Committee makes recommendations to the planning and services development process and as a group, assures that MHSA planning reflects local diverse needs and priorities, contains the appropriate balance of servic es within available resources and meets the criteria and goals established. The Steering Committee meetings are open to the public and include time for public comment as well as means for submission of written comments. The MHSA Steering Committee is co -chaired by a member of the San Mateo County BoS and by the Chair of the MHSARC. Comprised of over 40 community leaders representing the diverse San Mateo community including behavioral health constituencies (clients, advocates, family members, community pa rtners, County and CBO staff), and non -behavioral health constituencies (County leadership, Education, Healthcare, Criminal Justice, Probation, Courts, among others). Additionally, all members of the MHSARC are members of the MHSA Steering Committee. 11 MHSA Steering Committee Members Stakeholder Group Name Title (if applicable) Organization (if applicable) Family Member Sheila Bra t Chair Member Donald Mattei Chair San Mateo County Dist 1 Dave Pine Chair Board of Supervisor s, District 1 Client/Consumer - Adults Jairo Wilches Program Coordinator BHRS, OCFA Client/Consumer - Adults Michael Lim Client/Consumer - Adults Michael S.

Additionally, the MHSARC, San Mateo County's local mental health board, conducts a public hearing at the close of the 30 -day comment period. The Annual Update FY 201 9-20 (covering data from FY 20 17-18 and FY 2018 -19) was presented on December 4 , 2019 to the MHSARC . The MHSARC voted to open a 30 -day public comment period closing with a Public Hearing on February 5, 2020 . The MHSARC voted unanimously to submit the plan to the Board of Super visors . Please see Appendix 1 for the FY 19/20 MHSA Annual Update materials. No substantive publi c comments were received . The complete Annual Update is submitted to the San Mateo County local Board of Supervisors for adoption and to the County of San Mateo Controller's Office to certify expenditures before final submission to the State of California Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) and the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) . Various means are used to circulate information about the availability of the plan and request for public comment and in clude: Announcements at internal and external community meetings; Announcements at program activities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambassador Program, Lived Experience Academy, etc.); E-mails disseminating information to an MHSA distribution list of over 1, 600 community members and partners; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stakeholders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA webpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa INNOVATION (INN) PLANNING New Innovation (INN) Funding Cycle In San Mateo, the Community Program Planning (CPP) process for Innovation Projects begins with the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A comprehensive community needs assessment process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for s ervices, which are used as the basis for the development of Innovation projects. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innovation ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovation Idea Form were circulated through various means. Th e MHSA Innovation Idea Form requested narrative on the proposed idea/project and information to ensure the idea meets the 13 requirements for Innovation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County there was the requirement that the idea address the MHSA Three -Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of older adults across services and prevention activities Culturally relevant outreach and service delivery Integration of peer/family supports across services and prevention activities Integration of co -occurring practices across services and prevention activities Engagement services for transition -age youth (mentoring, education, peer support) Broader housing options to support individuals across the continuum of care 35 MHSA Innovatio n Idea Forms were submitted . All ideas were pre -screened against the Innovation requirements, twenty -one were moved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of diverse clients, family members, community service providers and staff. All projects were reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Impact/Effort assessment and scoring. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into project proposals . See Appendix 2 for the 5 INN Project Proposals pending Board of Supervisor (Bos) and Mental Health Services Oversight Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) approval . On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee met to review the 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerations for the projects. T he MHSARC voted to open the 30 -day public comment period and on November 6, 2019 reviewed the public comments received, voted to close the 30 -day public comment period and subsequently voted to submit the updated Innovation projects the BoS for approval. The MHSA Steering Committee and MHSARC approval materials and public comments received are inc luded in Appendix 3. Timeline - Innovation Projects 14 ISSUE RESOLUTION MHSA Issue Resolution Process (IRP) A required MHSA IRP for San Mateo County was adopted and submitted with the FY 16/17 Annual Update. The purpose is to resolve process -related issues with 1) the MHSA Community Program Planning (CPP) process; 2) consistency between approved MHSA plans and program implementation; and 3) the provision of MHSA funded programs. Since the establishment of the IRP process there have been no MHSA process -related grievances but there have been quality of care -related grievances filed with the BHRS Office of Consumer and Family Affairs (OCFA) for MHSA funded programs. Moving forward, a IRP section will be included in every Annual Update to provide a snapshot of MHSA -funded program grievances.

Statewide, MHSA represents a little under a third of community mental health funding. In San Mateo County, MHSA represents about 15% of the behavioral health revenue . The average annua l revenue for the last five years equals to about $29.7 million for San Mateo County . Annual revenue distributions are difficult to estimate and volatile. MHSA funding is based on various projections that take into account information produced by the Sta te Department of Finance, analyses provided by the California Behavioral Health Director's Association (CBHDA), and ongoing internal analyses of the State's fiscal situation. MHSA revenue is driven by the economy with only one tenth of 1% of tax payers are subject to the MHSA tax. The following chart shows annual revenue allocation for San Mateo County since inception. Below are factors that impacted the decreases and increases in revenues throughout the years: FY 05 /06 and FY 06/07 : funding included and Supports (CSS) only. FY 07/08 and FY 08/09: Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) and Innovations (INN) dollars were released in those years, respectively. FY 10/11 and FY 11/12: the California recession of 2009 led to decreased revenues FY 12 /13: Count ies began receiving monthly MHSA allocations based on actual accrual of tax revenue (AB100), resulting in a \"one time\" allocation. FY 14/15: changes in the tax law that took effect on January 1, 2013, led to many taxpayers filing in December 2012 resulting in a \"one time\" increase . FY 19/20: \"No Place Like Home\" legislation relies on MHSA. San Mateo County estimated cost would be $1.3 million, taken \"off Revenue PEI Revenue INN Revenue TotalAAGR: 11% Avg 5 -Year Revenue: $29,707,047 *projected revenue 17 FUNDING CONSIDERATIO NS Allocation of MHSA Funding The following represent the current guidelines for MHSA expenditure planning: 76% of total annual revenue must be allocated to CSS. o At least 51% of CSS must be spent on FSPs. 19% of total annual revenue must be allocated to PEI. o At least 51% of PEI must be spent on programs serving ages 0 -25. 5% of total annual revenue must be allocated to INN. Up to 20% of the average of previous 5 -year revenue may be transferred annually from CSS to Prudent Reserve, Capital Facilities and Technology (CF/TN) and/or Workf orce Education and Training (WET)* components. A maximum of 33% of the average Community Services and Supports (CSS) revenue received in the preceding five years maximum of 33% may fund the Prudent Reserve. Up to 5% of total annual revenue may be spent on administration and community planning processes. *A WET 10-Year Impact and Sustainability Report was developed with stakeholder input and submitted with the recent MHSA Three -Year Plan. The recommendation was to transfer $500,000 from CSS to WET annually to fund ongoing WET activities. Unencumbered Housing Funds On June 2, 2015, the release of unencumbered San Mateo County MHSA housing f unds was approved by our Board of Supervisors following MHSA Steering Committee and MHSARC review and recommendation to approve. DHCS Info Notice 16 -025 required Counties to complete ongoing fund release authorization for both existing and future unencumbe red funds that may be received by CalHFA on behalf of the counties (e.g. funds that are no longer required by a housing project, accrued interest, and/or other funds receive on behalf of the counties. Funds will be released annually by May 1s t. Currently, San Mateo County has an estimated $104,066 in accrued interest and loan payments , which we expect to receive this FY 19/20. Counties must spend the housing funds to provide \"housing assistance\" , which means rental assistance or capitalized operating subs idies; security deposits, utility deposits, or other move - in cost assistance; utility payments; moving cost assistance; and capital funding to build or rehabilitate housing for persons who are seriously mentally ill and homeless or at risk of homelessness . A community planning process will inform the use of the funds. 18 Reversion MHSA legislation requires that MHSA funding under the key components (CSS, PEI and INN) be spent within a 3 -year time or it must be returned to the State for reallocation to other mental health agencies. San Mateo County annual spending in CSS and PEI targets the 5 -year average revenue, which keeps us in the clear of reversion risk. INN requires project approval by the Mental Health Services Oversight Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) before funds can be expended. Assembly Bill (AB) 114 established that the 3-year reversion time frame for INN funds will now commence upon approval of the project plans; this will minimize the reversion risk for funds accrued while planning for new projects and/or awaiting approval. AB 114 and a subsequent Senate Bill (SB) 192 allowed Counties to submit a plan by J anuary 1, 2019 for expending their funds that were deemed reverted as of July 1, 2017. San Mateo County submitted plans for Innovations (INN) in the amount of $3, 832,545 and Workforce Education and Training (WET) in the amount of $423,610. Updates to these plans are included in their respective sections in this Annual Update. Target Reserve Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) Section 5847(b)(7) requires Counties to establish a Prudent Reserve to ensure the County programs will be able to serve clients should MHSA revenues drop. Until recently, counties had the discretion to establish their own appropriate reserve level. San Mateo County had $29 million in reserv e, 80% of annual revenue, as was recommended by an independent State fiscal consultant. The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Info Notice 19-017, released on March 20, 2019, established an MHSA Prudent Reserve level t hat does not exceed 33% of the average Community Services and Supports (CSS) revenue received in the preceding five years. For San Mateo County, this corresponds to $6.7 million. The Prudent Reserve can only be accessed when \"revenues for the Mental Health Services Fund are below recent averages adjusted by changes in the state population and the California Consumer Price Index\" subject to DHCS approval. In January 2019, t he San Mateo County MHSA Steering Committee reviewed and approved a recommended Total Operational Reser ve of 50% (Prudent Reserve + additional operating reserve), of the highest annual revenue, which currently equals $17 million. The Prudent Reserve remains at $600,000 and the additional Operational Reserve are in a local MHSA Trust Fund. This allows the flexibility in budgeting for short -term fluctuations in funding without having to go through the State's administrative process to access the Prudent Reserve, in the event that revenue decline is less than the State's thre shold or funding is needed in a timely manner. Future legislation may require a minimum Prudent Reserve level, at which point funds will be transferred appropriately. 19 MHSA FUNDING PRINCIP LES MHSA Funding Principles were developed to guide annual funding al locations and expansions; they also build from the County's and Health division budget balancing principles to guide MHSA reduction and allocation decisions when needed. Decisions regarding MHSA funding are based on the most current MHSA Three -Year Plan. Any funding priorities being considered outside of the MHSA Three -Year Plan priorities require MHSA Steering Committee approval and stakeholder engagement, which will include a 30 -day public comment period and public hearing as required by the MHSA legisl ation. The MHSA Funding Principles where presented to the MHSA Steering Committee in September 2018 for input and comment given a budget reduction planning throughout the County that was expected to have implications for MHSA funding. Maintain MHSA requir ed funding allocations Sustain and strengthen existing MHSA programs - MHSA revenue should be prioritized to fully fund core services that fulfill the goals of MHSA and prevent any local or realignment dollars filling where MHSA should. Maximize revenue so urces - billing and fiscal practices to draw down every possible dollar from other revenue sources (e.g. Medi -Cal) should be improved as relevant for MHSA funded programs. Utilize MHSA reserves over multi -year period - MHSA reserves should be used strategically to mitigate impact to services and planned expansions during budget reductions. Prioritize direct services to clients - indirect services are activities not directly related to client care (e.g. program evaluat ion, general administration, staff training). Direct services will be prioritized as necessary to strengthen services to clients and mitigate impact during budget reductions. Sustain geographic, cultural, ethnic, and/or linguistic equity - MHSA aims to r educe disparities and fill gaps in services; reductions in budget should not impact any community group disproportionately. Prioritize prevention efforts - at minimum, 19% allocation to Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) should be maintained and addit ionally the impact across the spectrum of PEI services and services that address the root causes of behavioral health issues in communities should be prioritized. Evaluate potential reduction or allocation scenarios - All funding decisions should be assess ed against BHRS's Mission, Vision and Values and when relevant against County and Health System Budget Balancing Principles. 20 PRIORITY EXPANSIONS Progress on MHSA Three -Year Plan Priority Expansions Component Updated Priority Expansions Estimated Cost Implemented Per Fiscal Year CSS General Systems Development Expansion of supports for older adults * $130,000 YES - Partial Senior Peer Counseling Field -based mental health and wellness services to expand access to Coastside $450,000 In Progress CSS Outreach & Engagement Expansion of culturally responsive outreach strategies $50,000 YES Chinese community outreach in North County TOTAL CSS $630,000 Component Updated Priority Expansions ** Estimated Cost Implemented Per Fiscal Year Prevention & Early Intervention Expansion of Stigma Free San Mateo, Suicide Prevention and Student Mental Health efforts* $50,000 Yes Suicide Prev ention mini -grants and county - wide stigma survey Youth mental health crisis support and prevention $600,000 In Progress Trauma -Informed Services training for 0 -5 providers* $150,000 Yes First 5 of SMC MOU After -care services for early psychosis treatment for reengagement, maintenance and family navigator support $230,000 YES (re)MIND/BEAM Aftercare Services TOTAL PEI $1,030,000 * Reprioritized from Previous Expansion Plan * Added based on the PEI Taskforce recommendations in Three Year Plan, approved by the MHSARC on February 6, 2018 21 EXPENDITURE UPDATES TO THE THREE -YEAR PLAN FY 17/18 - FY 19/20 San Mateo County departments continue planning for budget reductions starting fiscal year 2019 -20. As described i n last year's MHSA Annual Update, $2 million ongoing funds were allocated to core services for clients with serious mental illness (SMI) including Full Service Partnerships for Laura's Law eligible clients and Augmented Board and Care . Furthermore, available one -time funding will also include strategies to support the budget reductions impacting core services. One-Time Funding Availability The San Mateo County MHSA Trust Fund balance as of end of FY 2017 -18 totaled about $36 million . Given that San Mateo County recommended a Total Operational Reserve Goal of $16.5 million, as of July 1, 2018, there was $12.5 million in available one -time funding to advance MHSA program priorities ($3.9 of the $12.5 million must be spent in Prevention and Early Intervention projects). Funding priorities for the $12.5 million available one -time funds were developed and presented to the MHSA Steering Committee on January 30, 2019 and included: System Improvements to Core MHSA Services Technology -related Syst em Improvements Capital Facilities Improvements -if County owned and for MHSA services Workforce and Community Education and Training Stop Gaps for current Innovation programs and other budget reduction impacts A Plan to Spend Available One -Time Funding w as developed based on input received through the following stakeholder engagement processes: MHSA Three -Year Plan, 32 community input sessions with over 300 participants BHRS Budget Planning Stakeholder Meetings conducted in the fall of 2018. On April 22, 2019, the preliminary Plan to Spend was presented to the MHSA Steering Committee. Given the feedback received, the 30 -day public comment for the Plan to Spend was postponed pending additional analysis and input, including targeted input session s to further involve stakeholders and clients/family members and incorporating budget reduction impacts. The following community stakeholder groups were engaged in providing input into the Plan to Spend: MHSARC Older Adult Committee - June 5th MHSARC Adu lt Committee - June 19th MHSARC Youth Committee - June 19th Contractor's Association - June 20th Office of Consumer and Family Affairs/Lived Experience Workgroup - July 2nd Peer Recovery Collaborative - August 26th 22 On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee reviewed the updated Plan to Spend and provided comments. The MHSARC voted to open the 30 -day public comment period and on November 6, 2019 reviewed the public comments received, voted to close the 30 -day public comment period and subsequently vo ted to submit the plan to the Board of Supervisors for approval, which is still pending. The final Plan to Spend including all MHSA Steering Committee materials and public comments received are included in Appendix 2.

Previously, data for the most recent full fiscal year was not readily available by the deadline to submit Annual Updates to the State in December. This Annual Update includes an attempt to collect and report on the most recent data, therefore program highlights and data include both FY 2017 -2018 and FY 2018 -2019 . Moving forward, Annual Updates will include only the most recent data. 25 COMMUNITY SERVICES & SUPPORTS (CSS) 26 COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS Community Services & Support (CSS) provides direct treatment and recovery services to individuals of all ages living with serious mental illness (SMI) or serious emotional disturb ance (SED). Housing is a large part of the CSS. Required service categories include: Full Service Partnership (FSP) plans for and provides the full spectrum of services, which include mental health and non -mental health services and supports in order to advance the client's goals and support the client's recovery, wellness and resilience. General Systems Development (GSD) improves the County's mental health service delivery system. GSS may only be used for; mental health treatment, including alternative and culturally specific treatments; peer support; supportive services to assist the client, and when appropriate the client's family, in obtaining employment, housing, and/or education; wellness centers; personal service coordination/case management/personal service coordination to assist the client, and when appropriate the client's family, to access needed medical, ed ucational, social, vocational rehabilitative or other community services; needs assessment; individual Services and Supports Plan development; crisis intervention/stabilization services; family education services; improve the county mental health service d elivery system; develop and implement strategies for reducing ethnic/racial disparities. Outreach and Engagement (O&E) is to reach, identify, and engage unserved individuals and communities in the mental health system and reduce disparities identified by the County. O&E funds may be used to pay for strategies to reduce ethnic/racial disparities; food, clothing, and shelte r, but only when the purpose is to engage unserved individuals, and when appropriate their families, in the mental health system; and general outreach activities to entities and individuals. 27 FULL SERVICE PARTNER SHIPS (FSP) Within San Mateo Co unty, the i nitial FSP programs, Edge wood, Fred Finch, and Telecare, have been fully operational sin ce 2006. A fourth site, Caminar's Adult FSP, was added in 2009 . FSP programs do \"whatever it takes\" to help seriously mentally ill adults, children, transition -age youth and their families on their path to recovery and wellness. Edgewood Center and Fred Finch Youth Center serve children, youth and transition age youth (C/Y/TAY) using the Wraparound model and Caminar and Telecare offer Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) services to adults, older adults, and their families . Based on currently contracted number of slots , the average FSP cost per person is $25,547 . Clients enter and discontinue participation throughout the year, cost per person based on clients served was $14,981 . Cost per person figures do not speak to the span or quality of services available to clients either through BHRS or through contracted providers and may overlook important local issues such as the cost of housing, supported services provided, etc. *Calculated based on # of contracted FSP slots; there are reimbursements and other revenues sources associated with FSP's that decrease the final MHSA funding contribution. ** AOT FSP were added in (C/Y) 119 118 $37,845 Out-of-County FSP 20 17 FSP \"SAYFE\" & Comprehensive FSP \"Turning Point\" 85 102 103 $44,622 Transitional Age Youth FSP's 40 61 61 $52,527 Comprehensive FSP \"Turning Point\" 341 $17,783 Adult and Adult/Medically Fragile FSP 207 224 232 $16,908 Comprehensive FSP 30 39 40 $28,411 Assisted Outpatient Law\" FSP 50 N/A** 22 Integrated 28 47% 17%Black ; 4%American Native 3%Unknown Island ; 2%Multiple ; 2%Hispanic ; ; Native ; 1%Other ; Island 2%Hispanic 2%Tongan ; 1% ; 1% Hawaiian Native ; Asian Indian ; 0%FSP RACE/ETHNICITY DEMOG RAPHICS BY AGE GROUP Child/Youth and C lient Demographics combined FY 17/18 and FY 18/19 (total clients = 270) Percent of FSP Clients by Ethnicity Hispanic or Latino 53% Not Hispanic or Latino 41% Unknown / Not Reported 6% Adult and Older Adult FSP Client Demographics combined FY 17/18 and FY 18/19 (total clients = 535) Percent of FSP Clients by Ethnicity Hispanic or Latino 24% Not Hispanic or Latino 65% Unknown / Not Reported 10% Percent of Adult/Older Adult FSP Clients by Race Percent of C/Y and TAY FSP Clients by Race 29 FSP PERFORMANCE OUTC OMES BY AGE GROUP As part of San Mateo County's implementation and evaluation of the FSP programs, American Institutes for Research (AIR) analyzes FSP data to understand how enrollment in the FSP is promoting resiliency and improved health outcomes of clients living with a mental illness. Year -to-year outcomes are tracked for individual clients in FSPs. Information collected for FSPs include data in 10 domains; residential (e.g. homeless, emergency shelter, apartment alone) education (e.g. school enrollment and graduation, completion dates, grades, attendance, special education assistance), employment, financial support, legal issues, emergency interventions, health status, substance abuse, and for older adults, activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Data from FSP participants is collected by providers via self-reported intake assessment, key event tracking and 3 -month regular assessments. See Appendix 5 for the full FSP Evaluation Report for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 -18. Highlights are include d below for both FY 2017 -18 and FY 2018 -19. The full report for FY 2018 -19 will be included in the next MHSA Annual Update. The tables below present the percent improvement between the year just prior to FSP and the first year with FSP, by age group. In sum, the findings from self -reported outcomes (survey data) suggest that the vast majority of the outcomes improve for all reported age groups compari ng the year prior to joining FSP to the first year of FSP services .

The Telecare data is expected to be available in spring 2020. Healthcare utilization outcomes are calculated based on the San Mateo County EHR data system, thus it captured all FSP clients including Telecare FSP. a The number of clients who had any form of employment increased from zero to thr ee. Therefore, the percent of change was not reported . CHILDREN AND YOUTH ( C/Y) FSP & COMPREHENSIVE F POINT\" Part of the Full Service Partnership (FSP) , the SAYFE and Turning Point Child and Youth Programs are designe d to support the county's most vulnerable youth and their families in an effort to maintain and improve the youth's placement. In congruence with Edgewood Center's mission and values, the FSP work is informed by a core belief that children, youth, and fami lies are best served and supported in their unique family system, culture, and community. SAYFE The Short -term, Adjunctive Youth and Family Engagement (SAYFE) Program serves 40 youth and families at any one time by augmenting and extending the clinical work and existing treatment plan within: (1) the outpatient and Therapeutic Day School (TDS) progra ms and (2) 31 clients who are currently being served by Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) in a Regional county clinic. Turning Point C/Y The Turning Point Child and Youth (TPCY) Program i s a comprehensive program for 45 of the highest risk chil dren/youth living in San Mateo County. TPCY is designed to help children and youth achieve independence, stability, and wellness within the context of their culture, community, and family. Youths are primarily referred to this program through Human Serv ices Agency (HSA - child welfare), Juvenile Probation, San Mateo County Clinics, and Schools (typically with an IEP for emotional disturbance in place). Treatment is provided in an effort to help stabilize a youth in their home environment and prevent (or transition back from) a higher level of care (e.g., psychiatric hospital, residential facility, juvenile hall, etc.). All programs under the umbrella of the FSP are guided by a strong belief in: 1) Service Integration: Communities are strengthened by a fam ily-centered network of services and providers that partner with children, youth, and families and 2) Local Focus: Children, youth, and families receive the highest quality of care when services are provided and accessible within their community. The SAYFE and Turning Point programs utilize the Wraparound model of care for children, youths, and families. Wraparound is an intensive, holistic, evidence -based method of engaging with individuals with complex needs so that they can live in their homes and commun ities and realize their hopes and dreams. The Wraparound process aims to achieve positive outcomes by providing a structured, creative and individualized team planning process that when compared to traditional treatment planning, results in plans that are more effective and more relevant to the child and family. Additionally, Wraparound plans are more holistic than traditional care plans in that they are designed to meet the identified needs of caregivers (and family members) and address a range of life dom ains. Through the team -based planning and implementation process, Wraparound also aims to develop the problem -solving skills, coping skills, and self - efficacy of youths and family members. Finally, there is an emphasis on integrating the youths into the co mmunity and building the family's social support network. PROGRAM IMPACT & SUCCESS ES Building on several of the Wraparound principles, Edgewood is particularly skilled at engaging families and enhancing natural supports in a youth's life. The following success stories highlight the work that is as commonplace as it is critical to the work of the TPCY and SAYFE teams: 32 A 14 -year -old youth was referred to the After School Intensive services (ASIS) program by her TPCY treatment team due to having d ifficulty socializing with her peers, a need for anger management and developing coping skills. Her personal goal for attending the program was to get \"help being social.\" Upon meeting the youth, she presented as shy and reserved but was open to learning. ASIS provided a youth -centered, therapeutic, safe place for her to practice social skills, build healthy peer relationships, communication strategies, and try new coping skills through individualized and peer group interventions. She flourished in the prog ram and became a role model, helping lead group discussions, facilitating coping skill activities, and giving advice to peers newer to the program. On her graduation day, her peers and ASIS staffs praised and recognized all her accomplishments. She respond ed, \"I want to thank you all for helping me become more social and more confident with myself.\" A 6-year -old youth male was referred to Wraparound services by his school district due to high risk aggressive behaviors (both physical and verbal). He presente d with symptoms such as hitting, kicking, scratching, property destruction, offensive language, and inappropriate touching. The youth also had a history struggling with transitions and presented with rigid thinking, poor eye contact, speech delay, inapprop riate social interactions, and not being aware of other's emotions. His parents struggled to communicate effectively and had difficulty setting limits with youth. The youth and family have participated in individual therapy, family therapy, collateral supp ort, TBS services, ASIS program, family conferencing, and case management. The youth, now 8 -years -old, has made significant improvements in his overall mental health. Per mother's report, he is accepting limits set by parents, follows directions, and liste ns when they talk to him. Mother stated that she has observed him being more communicative with family members and he has increased his verbal and emotional vocabulary. They youth is receptive to boundaries set during individual therapy. He has been able t o utilize coping skills and positive replacement behaviors, such as deep breathing, fidgets, and puppet play during sessions. He has shown improvement in expressing his needs and wants during therapy and utilizes feeling words more effectively. He has been open about his triggers and is beginning to recognize when he starts to get upset. The youth appears more focused during session and has improved his ability to make eye contact. He has learned to be more mindful and aware of others' space at school and a t home. He has also learned to identify self -soothing techniques to calm his body when feeling dysregulated, like asking for 5 -minute break at school or asking to play with his dog while at home. The team believes youth is ready to graduate services to a l ower level of care to continue his successful recovery. A 10 -year -old youth was referred to SAYFE due to his aggressive behaviors, unhealthy dynamics in the home, and difficulty positively interacting with his peers. In the six months prior to his referra l, the youth had four Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) visits for suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and visual hallucinations. During his treatment, the youth gained the ability 33 to decrease aggressive behaviors by utilizing his coping skills (viz. , origami), verbalizing his needs and feelings, and creating his own safety plans to support with de -escalation when feeling upset. The youth benefited from working with his Behavior Coaches and attending the ASIS program. As a result, he engaged in positi ve interactions with peers. Mom learned how to positively approach the youth in efforts to reduce his escalations. She was highly proactive and engaged in services despite the multiple challenges to find housing for her family. The youth was not hospitaliz ed during his time within the SAYFE program and graduated successfully with new coping skills intact. SAYFE and Comprehensive FSP FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 102 103 Total cost per client based on clients served $37,185 $36,824 based on contracted slots $44,622 $44,622 CHALLENGES There are several challenges that have become impactful to the programming and service delivery. These challenges, their impact, and possible solutions are highlighted below. Cost of living in the Peninsula: The high cost of living continues to present a challenge for families (and staffs) who are unable to locate af fordable and suitable housing. Living in households with multiple members and frequent relocations impacts quality of life, privacy, safety, and continuity of services. o The strategies: The county is working to create more affordable housing and increase l iving wages. Staff also meet outside of the home to ensure youths have the emotional and physical space to engage in treatment and if a family relocates, staff work with them to ensure resources in the new location. Consistent staffing : It is difficult to recruit and retain staffs who are qualified (e.g., have the language capacity, lived experience, or necessary credentials) to adequately treat the population serve d. This requires that leadership and direct line staff carry additional workloads and famili es may experience several provider changes. Also, salaries do not match the astronomical cost of living in the county. o The strategies: Workloads were paired down to be more reasonable and to accommodate predictable short -term increases (due to youth/famil y crises or vacant positions). Translation services are used to meet the language capacity of a family. Worsening traffic: In recent ye ars, the amount of time community -based staff spend in their vehic les has increased significantly impacting the number o f appointments staff can have and staff safety on the roads. 34 o Teams divide the workload throughout the county to ensure families feel supported throughout the week. Management will also consider reducing caseloads to ensure staff are able to provide the sa me level of care and support to youth and families. Appropriaten ess of referrals: An influx of referrals that do not present as Wraparound cases (e.g., youths do not have an approved primary diagnosis, are not risk of out -of- home placement or have a lack of family involvement) or arrive in (seemingly preventable) crisis. The strategies: o Work with referring parties to clarify referral criteria and medication management. Support for the Latino and Spanish Speaking Community : The strategies: o Increase r ecruitment of bilingual/bicultural direct line staff to provide services to monolinguals Spanish Speaking families. o Bilingual/bicultural treatment team members invest time and energy into explaining services, translating documents, and interpreting for me etings. o Having bilingual leadership team provides support and advocacy during providers' meetings to advocate for Spanish Speaking families in the system. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 1% Unknown 18% 35 OUT -OF COUNTY FOSTER CARE SETTING S FSP East Bay Wrap Full Service Partnership - (EBW -FSP) is a community based program serving the needs of youth who are in Foster Care through San Mateo County but live out -of-county. EBW - FSP, provides intensive community -based care that is rooted in a positive, strengths -based approach . Youth and families receive individualized services (psychotherapy, behavioral interventions, and case management) to maximize the families' ability to meet their child's needs, and thereby reduce the potential for residential placement. Because they serve at-risk individuals with services that are difficult for them to obtain \"out of county,\" the FSP -SM has an \"open ended\" duration. Staff utilizes a variety of therapeutic approaches, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavior Modification, and Motiv ational Interviewing. All services are trauma -informed, and healing centered. Fred Finch Youth Center ( FFYC ) maintains a longstanding philosophy that the best road to change is one that is family -centered and strength -based. Staff understands that healthy changes are possible but can be difficult to implement. They meet youth and family where they are in terms o f readiness to change and use trauma -informed practice s. FFYC understands that behavioral challenges are a manifestation from unresolved trauma. They invite dialogue, treatment strategies and psycho -education to help the youth, family and treatment team better understand the impact of trauma. An essential feature of service is employing an unconditional commitment to positive outcomes, strengths -based and a \"whatever -it-takes\" strategy. Through building trust and helping address unmet needs, families often see small improvements in their well -being. They encourage families and youth to voice their preferences and priorities and from this, convey that they are respect ed and see n as experts in their lives. All staff are participating in Affinity Groups to dis cuss and put into action, ideas to be more aware of the impact of race and privilege in persona lly and professional ly. FFYC anticipate s this awareness will have a positive impact on creating a welcoming environment for all families. PROGRAM IMPACT The EBW program has been collecting CANS/ANSA since 2016 and is using this information to develop collaborative treatment objectives. Additionally, the department has set some outcome goals from the information gather from the CANS. Goals were selected based on th e acuity of clinical needs. The EBW program had the following goals and results: 40% of participants total domain score for child strengths will decrease (meaning that youth/families had more identified strengths) - Actual: 60% decrease (goal met) 35% of p articipants' total domain score for Behavioral/Emotional needs will decrease - Actual: 70% ( goal met) 25% total score in Living Situation Domain rating will decrease - Actual: 40% (goal met) 36 70% of Participants will have improvement in at least 1 domain - Actual: 80% (goal met) EBW has been consistently seeing improvement in these measurements. Some of the improvements are a result of having a strong clinical rapport with families and helping youth/families better identify their strengths and using those as sets to manage difficulties in their lives. Additionally, 100% of youth discharged to same level o f care, meaning that none of the discharges were to a higher level of living care. These services are reducing the severity of mental health issues in the youth that are being served. Prior to the AB1299, out-of-county youth faced challenges accessing mental health services in their community. Youth in the Child Welfare System often experience trauma and have significant mental health challenges. The EBW program would provide an intense level of mental health services to these vulnerable youth. The EBW program is firmly rooted in strengths -based approaches. Issues presented are \"unmet needs.\" By helping the youth and care givers to see the \"dysfunction\" from this stance, it helps reduce stigma and better education others on the impact of trauma and how it may manifest. In FY 2018 -2019 EBW met their internal goals of reducing needs scores in the following domains: Life Functioning, Child Strengths (which means improving strengths), and Behavioral/Emotional. They saw progress but did not meet their benchmarks for the Livin g Situation Domain. This is a common issue in that parents, care givers and youth often express the difficulty of living together. Out-of-County FSP FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 17 15 Total cost per client based on clients served $10,635 $12,053 based on contracted slots $9,040 $9,040 SUCCESSES One success has been expanding services to youth aged 18 -21. 'Donna', a young adult attending college at Cal State Easy Bay. Donna struggled with anxiety and relational issues. A clinician met with Donna at convenient locations and times to support Donna i n developing conflict resolution skills. Donna indicated that the preparation helped her and reported feeling more confident setting boundaries with people who were not fully supportive of her. She also stated that having an outlet to vent and be supported has been very important in her college success. 37 CHALLENGES One of the challenges EBW faces are large distances between their office and youth's location. EBW serves youth throughout the greater Bay Area, including near Sacramento, San Jose and Central V alley. EBW has also been under enrolled in their services. To mitigate this EBW has been in touch with many San Mateo County partners to expand services to 18-21-year -olds and continue to remind staff and other programs of their services. FFYC is contracte d to serve 20 out-of-county youth however have been averaging about 11 per month. With AB 1299, new CWW who are less familiar with services and an inability to get referrals from youth who are receiving FFA services, numbers have steadily declined. The Pro gram manager plans on attending staff meetings with CWW to inform them about services. birth Male 47% 33% Female 67% Decline Yes No 100% Decline to state 38 TRANSITION AGE YOUTH (TAY) FSP ENHANCED SUPPORTED EDUCATION Caminar 's Supported Education program at the College of San Mateo has been highly successful in supporting individuals with mental health/emotional needs in attending college and achieving academic, vocational, and/or personal goals. This program was established i n the spring of 1991 from collaboration with the College of San Mateo, Caminar, and the County of San Mateo 's BHRS program. The program 's unique approach combines special emphasis on instruction, educational accommodations and peer support to assist stude nts to succeed in college. Traditionally, the attrition rate for individuals with psychiatric disabilities has been exceptionally high as a result of anxiety, low stress tolerance, lack of academic and social skills, and low self esteem. However, this pr ogram has become an innovative leader in reversing this trend. Started in 2016 at Skyline College, Future Views supports potential students with an introductory class and one to one counseling and tutoring. In Addition to the campus presence, the Supporte d Education program has an extensive presence in the community, with regular groups and outings at Caminar 's residential programs, Cordilleras MHRC, Edgewood 's Drop In Center, and California Clubhouse. There is also have a weekly Drop In time for clients to get school and career assistance. The Supported Education program strives to reach out and engage individuals who can benefit from engagement in the supported education program. To this end, the supported education program team has reached out to a total of 54 community programs throughout the fiscal year, to reach out and engage clients into supported education services, thereby initiating a pathway of recovery, support and empowerment. Once engaged in the supported education program, clients begin to see their potential and the opportunities available to them. Classes and groups also build on recovery principals such as; WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan), resource education and linkage, empowerment through education and career development, leader ship potential, having a peer support group, and engagement utilizing active listening, motivational interviewing, and supportive engagement. Providing a pathway for clients into a new identity as a student, Peer Counselor, or other career pathway greatly increases personal self -esteem and helps re -write the 'client' narrative, thereby decreasing the stigma commonly associated with persons receiving mental health support and services. Caminar's Supported Education program provides such a pathway of opportu nity, and it remains essential that all of San Mateo clients are given information of and access to the supported education program. 39 PROGRAM IMPACT The supported education program focuses on connecting individuals with educational/vocational services and by providing individualized supports. With these supports, the cohort GPA and retention rates are as follows: Achieved an overall GPA of 3.3 Attained a retention rate of 84% Additionally, through the development of supports such as staff and student support groups, the individual client benefits from a supportive, nurturing and empowering environment that fosters self -reliance, self -care, and in turn decreases the isolation and stresses that often precipitates an increase in symptoms or a decrease in functioning. 100% Reported that their class experience was satisfactory or above 6 students are working, 8 are continuing school, 2 dropped due to medical reasons The program served 117 unduplicated clients, with 43 TAY (transition -age-adults) 86 groups and activities for TAY clients 282 engagement activities for TAY were offered (classes, groups, outings, one to one activities) Supported Education FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 112 117 Total cost per client based on clients served $1,637 $1,567 based on contracted goal (40) $4,584 $4,584 SUCCESSES FSP staff work very hard to serve clients to help provide for their safety and promote stability in the community while reducing the need to utilize higher levels of care. Between the high acuity of mental health challenges in clients, staff caseloads and the various regulations and mandates that dicta te activities, work in FSP requires almost super -human abilities of the staff that work in the program. Whenever a client doe s not attempt suicide, die by suicide, reduces the instance or intensity of suicidal ideation, remains (even if just longer) in stable housing for a year or reduces/eliminates utilizing PES or hospitalizations/incarcerations, it is a success. When a client starts a job or stays in a job even just a little bit longer, this is considered a success. Student Status Working Continuing school Medical drop 40 This academic year, the entire peer counseling class needs to be recognized for their inspiring perseverance, engagement, and support of each -other. Whichever di rection they chose (and they have specific academic and vocational goals) they are sure to not only have a positive impact, but also, and most importantly, they will be a support and inspiration to other clients for their inherent potential. Student class evaluation quote: 'I just want to say thank you for a great semester. I really enjoyed coming to class every week, you all made going to school for me very pleasant'. CHALLENGES 1. Housing - As known, the continued housing crisis has a direct impact on clie nt stability and overall health and well -being. While there are success stories, there continues to be more examples of struggle and distress. 2. Referrals/Connecting - the supported education program has a strong focus on outreach and engagement activities to reach as many clients and programs as possible, and to offer the support and program opportunities available. To this end, activities are continuously refined and focused in an attempt to reach as many community members as possible. 3. TAY - This age gr oup presents challenges in engaging and supporting in life and career goals. As age -appropriate, TAY often prefer doing activities with other TAY, as well as not wanting to identify with a 'specialized' program. While this is important for connection and s elf-esteem, it represents challenges for helping professionals in engaging, guiding, and supporting. Nonetheless, this is a critical are of focus, as helping to guide and support TAY in their growth, exploration, and development is both essential and highl y rewarding.

The program receives referrals from San Mateo County BHRS and can serve 50 transition age y outh clients at any given time. The purpose of the TAY FSP program is to assist each transition age youth and their family of choice to achieve stability and wellness within the context of their culture and community. A multidisciplinary team approach prov ides transition age youth with the opportunity to work with individuals in a variety of specialty areas, ensuring a holistic lens is applied to themselves and their lives. The program applies a person -centered approach, using \"whatever it takes\" to engage and support the transition age youth in addressing their needs and meeting their identified goals. Specialized services include case management, clinical treatment, skill -building, crisis prevention/intervention, peer/family support, medication management, housing support, community engagement, career and employment exploration, and linkage. 42 PROGRAM IMPACT In FY 18 -19, 61 clients were served in the TAY FSP program. 10 were graduates of the program, meaning they met their treatment goals and 3 dis -engaged an d discharged from the program prior to meeting their goals.

While that alone is quite a success, it is his commitment to the multiple people he now sponsors that makes Jeremiah s tand out. While dealing with his own struggles with a severe mental illness, tenuous familial relationships, and the general stress of navigating adulthood, this young man has also spent time and energy supporting others who are addressing their own recove ry. Selena was referred to the program due to persistent homelessness, substance use, and symptoms of mental illness. Selena grew up without a stable home or caregivers which resulted in her strong connections to her chosen family who lived in encampments across San Mateo County. Her treatment team was reliable, consistent and persistent. They accepted Selena's level of engagement which ebbed and flowed. They applied motivational interviewing techniques and focused on providing for her basic needs while offering unen ding hope. They introduced to new ideas and concepts including how to break down goals into manageable steps, weighing pros and cons, proactivity and prevention, and self -advocacy. She graduated from the program in 2019 after meeting her goals. At her grad uation party she told the team, \"you saved my life.\" Engagement of natural supports in the program continued to be a success in 2017 -2018. This year also saw an increase in engagement of fathers in the treatment of their emerging adult children.

In the last 5 years there has been an increase in emerging adults with severe mental illness, trauma and co -occurring substance use, physical health, or cognitive /neurological issues. In FY 17 -18, 51% of the emerging adults used substances to a degree that it had a noticeable negative impact on their daily functioning. The substance of choice among emerging adults continues to be marijuana. In FY 17 -18, 42% of the emerging adults served had a physical health condition that impacted their daily functioning and/or their mental health. This was a 20% increase from the previous year. In FY 17 -18, 30% of the emerging adults possessed cognitive/neurological i ssues which impacted identity and relationship development, daily functioning, and engagement in mental health treatment. This was a 17% increase from the previous year. Due to the increased prevalence of co -occurring substance use, physical health, and cognitive/neurological issues, efforts are being made to work more closely with medical and primary care providers, partnering with alcohol and other drug providers, and identifying experts who can provide training and guidance. Cost of Living & Housing C risis The two greatest challenges facing emerging adults, their families, and TAY FSP staff are the cost of living and the housing crisis in the Bay Area. Both continue to impact the day to day lives of the populations served and their natural support sys tems. Finding and maintaining affordable housing is difficult, finding and maintaining that same housing in areas with accessible public transportation and negligible community violence has become nearly impossible. Housing vouchers continue to be limited and landlords who accept them are even more so. Stress related to housing, finances, and safety all lead to strain on family systems, pressure on relationships, and prolonged recovery for those with a serious mental illness. Employees at Edgewood have been personally impacted by the Bay Area cost of living and housin g crisis. M any staff have had to face tough decisions regarding their personal and professional lives. Retention of existing staff and recruitment of new individuals has been a focus of attent ion across roles and programs . Moreover, they are equally concerned about the impa ct staff transitions have on the emerging adults and thus have made all efforts to manage the transitions with compassion and trauma informed interventions. 45 DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Russian 2% orientation 2% Another sexual orientation 5% race/ethnicity 20% 15% 46 TAY DROP IN CENTERS Located in San Bruno and Redwood City, the Drop -in Centers are community resource centers catering to individuals between the ages of 18 -25 years (up to their 26th birthday) offered by the Edwood Center for Children and Families . Each peer -led site serves as a safe and confidential space offering free resources, activities and workshops, and op portunities for socialization and peer connection. The Drop -in Centers provide regularly scheduled programming such as community outings, social activities, personal growth and wellness workshops, as well as access to computers, the internet, a clothes clo set, and food. Most importantly, Peer Partners lead activities that support 18 -25-year -old participants in building skills to successfully transition to adulthood. Peer Partners, young adults who have been through similar life experiences, are an invaluab le resource to the Drop -in Center. Peer workers know what it is like to go through uniquely difficult situations and life experiences and can share their experiences of recovery, growth, and resilience. Peer Partners who are living well represent hope that is often missing in the Drop -in Center participant's lives. Peer Partners facilitate a safe and welcoming environment through the use of empathy, validation, constructive feedback, and unconditional support; Peer Partners are trained in Youth Development, Harm Reduction, and peer counseling techniques. Peer Partners offer support and peer mentorship; give resources; and plan, implement, and co - facilitate groups and activities. Success at the Drop -in Centers is measured individually and is fluid according t o how each transition age youth participant defines self -efficacy. The primary focus is on building quality relationships so each may feel empowered and capable of voicing their needs and apply what they have learned to all facets of their lives. Goals of the Drop -in Centers are: Promote socialization and community connectedness Support academic and/or vocational exploration and growth Encourage the development of independent living skills Empower rising leaders and advocates PROGRAM IMPACT The drop-in centers were open 245 days during FY 2017 -18 Transition Age Youth Served Sam Trans Bus Tokens Provided Articles of Clothing Provided Health & Hygiene Products Provided 213 776 306 428 47 There is one simple, but specific intervention applied, which the Drop -in Centers are particularly proud of - the welcoming culture. This intervention includes more than creating an inclusive environment and training Peer Partners in engagement practices. Rather, it is an embo diment of welcoming to ensure both a visual and visceral experience of acknowledgment, appreciation, belonging and unconditional positive regard. This is a core intervention from which all others are built upon. The unintended impact of a welcoming culture includes, the broad spectrum of resource requests made by participants, and the need for continuous training of Peer Partners in recognizing signs of participant dependence on the program or Peer Partners in meeting their needs or addressing their persona l challenges. Claire is a long -time participant of Drop -in Center North. She often requests help of the Peer Partners in staying organized and understanding the requirements of her teachers at the College of San Mateo. These asks are consistent throughout the school semester and usually only require the Peer Partners to review organizational and time management methods and remind Claire of the services located on the campus. Still, Claire knows her requests will be met with patience, compassion, and support , rather than judgement or frustration. Javier has been coming to the DIC South location since it's opening in 2015. He had been an infrequent participant due to his symptoms of anxiety which often impaired his ability to leave his home. After the presiden tial election he was significantly impacted by the results and the subsequent decisions being made regarding immigration policy. He had built relationships with the Peer Partners and felt comfortable sharing his thoughts, even when they differed from other s. Javier knew the Peer Partners would help him and other participants engage in conversations in a healthy and respectful manner. There were a few weeks when he stopped coming but one evening he returned and explained that while isolating and withdrawing into the online community was his default, he found it did not alleviate the feeling of disempowerment. He began more frequent visits and talked more about solutions and learned ways \"to get involved\" which led to his feeling more empowered. Miguel and his girlfriend were regular participants. Often, they came for dinner and to study. Occasionally Miguel's brother would also come but unlike Miguel who has a quiet and serious presence, Jose's mood and affect were inconsistent. One evening Miguel and his girl friend asked to speak with a Peer Partner about \"how to get more help for my brother,\" and shared they and their family's efforts to support Jose who has schizophrenia. \"We don't really know what is out there and we have tried to keep it in the family, but we need help. You help lots of people with lots of things, we thought you could help us with this.\" Johnny comes to Drop -in Center North for dinner most nights, sometimes he will stay and talk with other participants or engage in an activity, but most nig hts he prefers to eat and leave. He reports appreciating the food and that Peer Partners respect his level of engagement. 48 TAY Drop -In Center FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 213 201 Total cost per client* *Funding for the C/Y and TAY FSP includes drop -in center services and is not separated out SUCCESSES In FY 2017-18, the Drop -in Center community partnerships continued to yield many innovative workshops and activities addressing the expressed interest and needs of transition age youth: Healthy Relationships College Access and Information Workshops Career Assessment and Job Development Inspirational Stories of Recovery Back to school fairs Thanksgiving dinners The application of a Positive Youth Development approach to the Drop -in Centers that is holistic, positive and preventative youth development philosophy has resulted in visible growth in transition age participants; applying for Peer Partner positions, giv ing feedback on programming, and taking ownership of weekly groups and activities. Roberto, age 23, has been a participant of Drop -in Center South for about a year. When he first started coming, he was quiet, reserved and often would withdraw to quieter a reas of the center. Despite his discomfort, he continued to come, albeit infrequently. He enjoyed spending one on one time with the Peer Partners and began to trust them enough to ask their advice and consider their suggestions. Their suggestions and encou ragement covered a wide variety of topics, including relationship building and trying new things. A year later Roberto has built friendships by approaching participants and starting conversations, shared his poetry, performed at Open Mic nights, and explor ed new foods and cooking with the Peer Partners. Matilda, age 20, started attending Drop -in Center South just under a year ago. When she initially began coming, she was accompanied by one of her mental health providers due to her discomfort in being in new situations and her symptoms of mental illness. Matilda did not engage in activities and only spoke with the manager on site or her treatment staff member, mostly she preferred to be alone. With continued persistence and the support of both her mental heal th treatment team and the Peer Partners, Matilda was able to find a way to engage in the Drop -in Center that best meets her needs and level of comfort. She now comes on her own, interacts with both Peer Partners and participants, engages in activities of h er choosing, and steps away to work independently when needing personal space. 49 In FY 2018 -19, partnerships with community organizations and businesses have been a continued success. Without partnerships with local educational institutions and community - based organizations annual Back to School Fair would not be possible . Representatives from Bay Area colleges and universities spread throughout the DIC sites on fair days. Food, raffle items, and new backpacks filled with school supplies are a result of donat ions from individuals and local entities including Help One Child, Jersey Mike's and EA Sports. Similarly, the annual Career Fair is built on community partnerships. Both events provide transition age youth with a plethora of resources in a safe and comfor table venue where they can get one on one attention. Thanks to a grant from the Sequoia Healthcare District, in 2019 the Drop -in Centers held the county's first Transition Age Youth Health Fair. This event brought together physical and mental health profes sionals to answer questions, link participants to services, offer practical skills, and provide on -site screenings. CHALLENGES In FY 2017 -18, the barriers faced by transition age youth in cluded accessing the Drop -in Centers locations and/or information about the events, resources and activities happening day to day. While Edgewood is now able to better meet the needs of transition age youth in the southern part of the county through the Drop -in Center South location, for transition age youth residing in the central and coastal sections of the county, as well as those without access to public transportation, the two sites are unable to meet their needs. Concerns have increased as transition age yo uth and their families struggle to attain or maintain safe and affordable housing and find themselves relocating to the edges of the county or to areas with few public transportation options. Additionally, the Drop -in Centers do not have an online/social m edia presence which makes it difficult for transition age youth to learn about the centers, their locations and hours, and the resources and services available to them. While accessibility will always be an issue in a county so large, Edgewood will continu e to look for innovative ways to meet the needs of all transition age youth across San Mateo County. This past year outreach efforts were increased through community partnerships and tabling at local resource fairs and community events. Both Drop -in Center sites have continued to give out bus tokens to transition age youth to help alleviate the cost of transportation and increase access to both locations. Local transition age youth providers have been encouraged to hold groups at both sites or bring transit ion age youth to both sites to help to decrease the barriers of accessibility. Regarding an online presence, the Drop -in Centers will begin working on a plan for a social media presence in 2019 and seeking funding for a website development project, both of which will include transition age participation and leadership. In FY 2018 -19, challenges faced are the same as in previous years: The cost of living continues to present as a challenge for participants and staff. 50 The lack of short -term and emergency TAY -specific housing means increased efforts in supporting participants in finding housing ; efforts to identify friends or peers they can stay with, providing sleeping bags and rain gear to those who must sleep outside, and finding bus/train routes to TAY -specific shelters in San Francisco and Santa Clara. The lack of a San Mateo TAY -specific website with services and resources is an ongoing challenge. While the DICs maintain lists and resource boards it is challenging to ensure the information is up -to-date. Many transition age youth participants cannot access the DICs as frequently as they like and if/when they are looking for support or a resource they turn to the internet (i.e., Google). DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FY 17/18 FY 18/19 16% 23% Decline to state 16% 21% ADULT S AND OLDER ADULT S FSP ADULT AND OLDER ADULT/MEDICALL Y FRAGILE FSP The FSP program, overseen by Telecare, Inc., provides services to the highest risk adults, highest risk older adults/medically fragile adults. Outreach and Support Services targets potential FSP enrollees through outreach , engagement and support services. These programs assist consumers/members to enroll and once enrolled, to achieve independence, stability and wellness within the context of their cultures and communities. Program staff are available 24/7 and provide serv ices including: medication support, continuity of care during inpatient episodes and criminal justice contacts, medical treatment support, crisis response, housing and housing supports, vocational and educational services individualized service plans, tran sportation, peer services, and money management. Services specific to Older Adult/Medically Fragile include maximizing social and daily living skills and facilitating use of in -home supportive agencies. Telecare FSP, via the integrated teams model uses dai ly morning huddles to assertively coordinate and track the various service needs for every individual the teams serve. Including benefits acquisition, psychiatric appointments and medication, case management and evidence -based rehabilitation and other prom ising practices, the teams proactively identify needs and gaps in service and provide, broker or advocate for those necessary services or resources. The concentrated effort of each team affords the opportunity to engage in continual improvement for clients lives by circling back on progress made in all the areas identified. 52 PROGRAM IMPACT Telecare implements recovery principles using intentional service delivery through evidence based and promising practices tailored specifically to an individual member's goals. Telecare FSP staff are extremely well positioned to provide personal services to each member's unique circumstances. Intervention tools , including but not limited to , Motivational Interviewing, Wellness Recovery Action Plans, Behavioral Activation, T rauma Informed Care as well as those specifically developed at Telecare (Recovery Centered Clinical Systems and Co -Occurring Education Groups) are part of the Telecare staff's standard work and are proactively selected prior to staff visiting a member with the intent of intervention efficacy in that individual's life. SUCCESSES For many years I went undiagnosed. This led me to a life of crime, prison, drugs, and mental Illness, my foremost culprit. It wasn't until I was referred to Telecare that my life changes. I was treated like a consumer and not as a criminal. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I received medications and it took a while to get it right. Telecare really has worked with me to ensure my overall wellbeing . I have been tre ated with respect and compassion. This was the first time 'ever' that I had a case manager -therapy and a full medical staff in one location. All this allowed me to understand my diagnosis, history which in turn facilitated me to get better. Today 10 years later, I continue to struggle with life and activities of daily living. However, I am able to work as a volunteer part time at the local food bank as well as advocate for others and also assisting with phone acquisitions for members and other activities wi th Telecare. I had been homeless since 2005. Today I am now five years living in my own apartment through a Telecare subsidy program. Telecare checks on me including emotional support as well. I was once not allowed to be around my grandchildren. Today I b aby sit them and they come to \"Granny\" house for vacations, Holidays. Something I never would have dreamed in my past. Today I am clean and sober. I make decisions for myself and actively show up for life. Thank you Telecare !! My motto: \"they care \"TELECAR E\"! Velisha Hi, my name is Ronald and I am a man in long term recovery. What that means is that I haven't took a drug or had a drink in 4 years and 8 months. I have changed a lot in the past 4 years. I began using when I was 14 years of age, I stopped whe n I was 31 years old. I still remember 53 what I was like when I was 13, before the drugs. I got good grades in school and I was my mother's little angel. But that all changed when I began my addiction. I turned into a liar and a thief. I stole many things, but the one thing that I stole that haunted me for a long time was my mother's peace of mind. I got clean for the first time when I was 19. But I wasn't ready to quit until I met my case worker Kevin. He helped me get clean and stay clean. This is the long est clean time that I ever had. Today I have a job in the recovery field as a recovery coach. I'm a paid member of NA (narcotics anonymous) and I have made many amends to people and family I've hurt. I was diagnosed with bipolar and schizophrenia during my addiction, but it suppressed when I got clean and did the work to stay clean. Today I love myself and I love God and others. Today I am better off without drugs and alcohol. Today I am happy and grateful.

The overall partnership with San Mateo County is incredibly strong and collaborative and the partnership demonstrates the best of governmental and contract agency dynamics. Nevertheless, fiscal realities exist, and the impact is extreme difficulty in recruiting psychiatrists, LVN's, and Case Managers as well as the fact the program now has no office where clients are permitted and for the existing prescribers from which to work. Male 64% Female 37% Decline to State 1% Sexual Orientation homosexual .5% Straight or heterosexual 11% Bisexual 1% to LDER ADULTS Caminar's FSP program is designed to serve the highest risk adults and highest risk older adults and medically fragile. Most adults with SMI served by FSP have histories of hospit alization, institutionalization, substance use, are not engaged in medical treatment and have difficulty participating in structured activities and living independently. Older adults have cognitive impairments and medical comorbidities. The purpose of th e FSP program is to assist clients to enroll, achieve independence, stability and wellness within the context of their culture and communities. The goal is to divert clients from the criminal justice system and acute long -term institutional levels of care an d succeed in the community. In addition, the program strives to help clients achieve their wellness and recovery goals, maximize their use of community resources, integrate client's family members or other support people into their treatment, achieve well ness, independence and improved quality of life. FSP has a high staffing ratio of staff to consumers, with a ratio of 10:1. There are frequent team meetings to discuss clients in crisis, hospitalizations, incarcerations, med non -compliance and homelessnes s. A psychiatrist is assigned to the client to provide medication evaluation and psychoeducation. Case managers assist clients with needs related to mental health services, rehabilitation, housing, employment, education, social and recreational activities and health 55 care. Consumer treatment includes a variety of modalities based on consumer needs, including case management, individual, group or family therapy, psychiatric medication prescription, and general medication support and monitoring. Consumer self -help and peer support services, include money management, assisting with employment opportunities, social rehab and assistance with referrals and housing. Caminar also provides community based -nursing to assist clients with improving medication compliance. FSP services are delivered by a multidisciplinary team, which provides 24/7, 7 days per week crisis response support, including in -home support services and services at other consumer locations as appropriate. Case managers help to plan for linkage to and coordination with primary care services, with the intent of the strengthening the client's ability to access healthcare services and ensuring follow up with detailed care plans. PROGRAM IMPACT Caminar reduces suicide by rapid and consistent engagement with clients and their collateral providers, case conferences, completing clinical assessments to assess danger to self and danger to others, increasing contact with clients who may be decompensating, 24/ 7 availability and the CPI protocol and training. All management staff is trained and certified to initiate involuntary hospitalization, when indicated. School failure and drop out is decreased through the Supported Education program and help lower unemplo yment by utilizing the Jobs Plus program, which provides skills training and referrals to employers looking for workers. Homelessness is a pervasive problem in the Bay Area and in San Mateo County, in particular. Through the Supported Housing program, a mu ltitude of housing options is provided to clients in need: Board and Care, SRO rooms, independent apartments, shelters, and unlicensed room and boards. Once a client is referred to Caminar services, specifically to the FSP team, staff attempts to initiate contact within two (2) business days. Clients are assessed rapidly and comprehensively by case managers, the psychiatrist and Clinic Manager/RN. The Clinic Manager/RN completes a Nursing Assessment for all clients admitted to the program. Furthermore, FSP also utilizes a Mediation Assistance Program (MAP) to increase medication compliance and to reduce the risk of clients overtaking or undertaking their medications. By utilizing the social rehabilitation model, which provides for a non -judgmental, normalize d environment which emphasizes the client as the lead in their care, Caminar works to reduce the stigma and discrimination. Linkage are made to outside community providers for primary care and ongoing collaboration with said providers and staff; this helps ensure that clients are receiving public health services. By partnering with other non -profit agencies, disparities in access to care are reduced . Finally, Caminar utilize Harm Reduction, MI, DBT and WRAP to help strengthen the gains made by clients and t o implement the principles of recovery throughout all programs. 56 Caminar Adult/Older Adult FSP FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 39 40 Total cost per client based on clients served $21,855 $21,308 based on contracted slots $28,411 $28,411 SUCCESSES Caminar has been successful in establishing morning wellness meetings held 5x a week, a medication assistance program (MAP), expanding their community -based nursing, implementing bi -weekly complex case conferences, beginning Dialectical Behavioral Therapy certifi cation in 2018 and maintaining peer support throughout their program. Jane Doe has a long history of being a very high utilizer of psych emergency services for the vast majority of her adult life. Her annual utilization usually involved dozens of visits t o psych emergency services. In the past nine months, she hasn't utilized any psych emergency services and has not expressed any suicidal ideation. She has stable housing and has been employed on a part -time basis. She has demonstrated a profound improvemen t in her functioning and increased awareness into her mental health diagnosis. Caminar staff has worked collaboratively to set appropriate boundaries with her by using a strength -based approach. Staff have provided individual and other rehab services and e ncouraged her to participate in the DBT group. The team and Jane have worked creatively to find individualized interventions that are well suited for her and this has been instrumental in supporting her in her admittedly impressive journey towards recovery . One such example is that she frequently uses the meditation room to relax, meet with her case manager and to listen to guided meditation exercises. Jane is engaged in services, has learned to talk about her challenges and seeks out support prior to exper iencing a crisis. She has made significant strides towards her recovery and is also becoming very supportive to her peers who may be experiencing challenging situations or situational stressors. CHALLENGES Challenges for Caminar include housing, housing s ubsidies, hiring clinical case managers, and clients experiencing major medical concerns and comorbidities that affect treatment. DEMOGRAPHICS FY 5.1% 2.5% White/Caucasian 64.1% 65.0% ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT In Fiscal year 2018 -19, Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) FSPs began receiving funding from MHSA in San Mateo County. Stakeholder meeting information was submitted in the previous MHSA Annual Update. Developed out of the County's adoption of Laura's Law (Assembly Bill 1421) in the summer of 2015 , AOT is a program that reaches out to people with a severe mental illness who are not connected to services and are challenged to live safely and stably in the community. The San Mateo AOT team engages people in receiving treatment to help improve their qualit y of life. The AOT team work s collaboratively with individuals, family members and partners to provide the right care, at the right place and right time. Their dedicated team helps decrease mental health crises, hospitalizations, incarcerations and homeles sness while helping people achieve and maintain their physical and mental health. See Appendix 6 for the full AOT FSP evaluation report, which purpose is to provide a detailed view on implementation of Laura's Law is progressing and to determine if any adj ustments are necessary to achieve the goals of the project. PROGRAM IMPACT The BHRS AOT program received 160 referrals for a total of 148 individual clients and 38 informational calls. Most referrals originated within San Mateo County and have come from a licensed or supervising mental health treatment provider followed by family members. There were 69 referred clients who were deemed ineligible for AOT services. Of these, 23 clients were referred to specific community services, including behavioral health clinics. Of the 39 eligible clients who were offered Caminar AOT FSP services, 22 clients enrolled in AOT FSP services as of December 31, 2018. 58 Among all AOT FSP clients, the episodes of hospitalizations and PES events were significantly lower during the 6 -months after the client enrolled in the AOT FSP , compared to the 6 -months before. The length of hospital stay was also shortened post enrollment vs. pre -enrollment. Other key events such as jail and homelessness have also reduced. The AOT Team filed two court petitions for two clients in CY2018. AOT (Laura's Law) FSP FY 18/19 Total clients served 22 Total cost per client based on clients served $40,484 based on contracted slots $17,812 SUCCESSES \"Both the problems and the symptoms experienced by people who are referred to AOT are very complex, often with dangers to their health and well -being, as well as the well -being of the community. It is not unusual that clients have been struggling for many years, essentially lost in a cycle of decompensations, hospitalizations, incarcerations, such that they have a limited capacity to understand and follow -up with their own care. A critical role of AOT investigations is to simplify the complexity of a case f or the care teams and the client. The client can experience some treatment success which encourages the client to engage further. Noticeably, an important part of this seems to be the enduring nature of AOT in continuing to support clients through their va rious struggles and successes. The program has been remarkable at filling a gap in services for people who were previously unreachable.\" - BHRS AOT Psychologist AOT received a referral for Ben, a young man with schizophrenia, who was living a very isolate d life. Ben had no relationship with his family and no friends. He tended to call and harass local police departments and authority figures due to command hallucinations. Ben was incarcerated and hospitalized due to the nature of these calls. These calls w ere putting both the client and the community at risk. Over two months, AOT built a relationship with Ben through weekly visits and being curious about his experience. Once trust had been established, Ben agreed to enroll in AOT/FSP. Since enrolling, his initial charges have been reduced and he has not returned to jail or the hospital. In addition, he has rec onnected with his family and demonstrated an ability to contain his impulses through skills learned working with AOT/FSP. Lastly, Ben is no longer living an isolated life, as he is participating in group therapy. 59 DEMOGRAPHICS FY 18/19 American/Alaskan 1% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 1% AUGMENTED BOARD AND CARE S In Fiscal year 2018 -19, Augmented Board and Cares (B&C) began receiving funding from MHSA in San Mateo County. Stakeholder meeting information was submitted in the previous MHSA Annual Update. The purpose of contracted B&C are to provide a support ed living environment for clients with severe mental illness (SMI). These placements are needed to afford SMI client's an opportunity to live in the community in a supported living environment. There is one BHRS staff that is the designated board and care liaison. This staff approves board and care referrals, completes assessments, oversees admissions and discharges to BHRS contracted Board & Cares. B&C serves adults with SMI that have completed a social rehabilitation program or are stepping down from a locked setting. They are psychiatrically stable, compliant with medications and in need of a supported living environment. Clients are Health Plan of San Mateo members, and either have Social Security Administration and/or General Assistance benefits. The B&C provides three meals a day, medication management which includes storing and administration of medications. They regularly collaborate with the client's treatment team and conservator about client's progress, and/or issues that impact the client's placement. The 60 Board and Care Operators work in collaboration with the BHRS board and care liaison. The purpose of the board and care liaison is to support the client's transition into the board and care, and ensure they address issues that impact placem ent. The Board and Care Liaison coordinates a training schedule for the B&C operators. The trainings increase the board and care operator's capacity to address the needs of the SMI clients in their care as well as fulfilling their CEU requirements. PROGR AM IMPACT B&C's improves timely access and linkages for underserved populations. Referred clients and the barriers that impact placement are tracked. For instance, some clients having behavior issues which were related to their histories of trauma. This led to the provision of more trauma informed training for B&C Operators to help them better understand the needs of SMI clients and use a trauma informed approach. B&C's reduces stigma and discrimination. The assessment procedure goes through a 15 -item checklist in order to determine eligibility for a board and care placement. Once considered eligible, cases are reviewed, and barriers are problem -solve d. It can be as simple as providing apple sauce so a client with swallowing difficulties can take their m eds and obtain agreements as to who will consistently provide the applesauce to the B&C. At times complex case conference will be needed where all parties involved such as conservator, treatment team and case managers discuss supports/resources needed to successfully transition a client to placement. Through the trainings and close coordination with the B&C operators staff learn that disruptive behavior is often driven by their diagnosis and not because they are \"bad\". BHRS makes every effort to ensure clients are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of having a mental illness. The Board and Care Operators receive trainings on diversity and equity topics such as: Cultural Humility training and Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity. B&C's r educes disparities in access to care . The BHRS contracted board and cares are specifically for clients that have mental illness and or co -occurring substance use issues. All clients placed at the board and cares are connected to BHRS regional clinics, and or a Full - Service Partnership Program, and thus their psychiatric and medical needs are attended to. B&C's i mplements recovery principles . Clients with substance abuse problems are appropriately referred to Substance Use Disorder (SUD) programs. The B&C ope rators are trained on the possibility of relapse and work with the client's treatment team and liaison to develop a plan to support the client. One B&C is specialized in serving clients with substance use issues. 61 Behavioral Health and Recovery Services Cl inicians offer recovery -oriented groups at different Board and Care sites. The groups include Seeking Safety, Illness Management and Recovery and a Dual Diagnosis Group. SUCCESSES Justo who was born in Juarez, Mexico has lived at the Co -Occurring focuse d Board and Care Bruce Badilla for 7 years. He immigrated to the United States with his family, moving to the Bay Area in 1978. Justo began struggling with Schizophrenia around the age of 18. By the time Justo came to Bruce Badilla Care Home he was copi ng with both mental health and substance use disorders. He had experienced multiple long -term hospitalizations, including state hospitalization, a period of incarceration and 5 years of homelessness. Since coming to Bruce Badilla Justo has been stable in the community, clean and sober for 7 years. He attends all his appointment with his treatment team and attends a combination of six meetings/groups a week. Justo is actively engaged in his recovery. He enjoys visits with his family, going to meetings a nd eating good food. He identifies his supports as his family and Bruce Badilla staff. He reports his strength as his ability to walk and talk. He reports his hope as to return one day to work as he once did as a mechanic in an auto shop. CHALLENGES Refe rrals exceed current bed capacity. Additional funding will help increase this bed shortage especially in certain identified areas. Specifically, more bed capacity for Females under 60 with Co -Occurring disorders and older adults that have complex medical issues. MATEO LODGE: SOUTH C OUNTY INTEGRATED FSP The South County Adult Behavioral Health Outpatient Clinic located in Redwood City and serves complex serious mental illness (SMI) adult client population . Due to the location of the clinic the program serve s as the catchment area providing services to individuals from the women's and men's county jail, Redwood House crisis residential, Cordilleras MHRC, three inpatient SUD treatment programs, and two homeless shelters. The typical client served are considered at risk of self-harm or neglect, recently hospitalized for mental health, poorly engaged in treatment, have co -occurring SUD disorders, often homeless, have trust issue stemming from mental health diagnosis, and have limited community resou rces. Mateo Lodge is contracted to provide 50 hours of Intensive Case Management (ICM), service s per week for 3 different levels of intensity (A - Task oriented case management 1 -2 months, B - Supplemental case management 4 -6 months, and C - FSP clinical case management 6 - 62 12months). The clients within the program receive 1 -3 hours of contact per week based on level of care needed and/or need identified to support client. ICM is a clinic referral -based program . The referring party completes a referral form indicating 'ICM Service Requested'. The ICM engages with the client within one week of the referral to complete a client focused needs assessment based on clients' stated need. The best outcomes for ICM clients exist when there is a warm handoff from the referring clinical team. The ICM collaborates with the treatment team to ensure targeted service that is based on client and referring party identified needs are addressed. Full Service Partnership (FSP) level C is utilized for clients that are high risk o f self - harm, loss of placement, or poorly engaged with outpatient services. The FSP level of care is initiated prior to referring clients to other FSP providers in attempts to service clients within BHRS outpatient clinics and to evaluate mental health lev el of care needed. Mateo Lodge also provides evening and weekend coverage on an as needed basis from the mobile support team. ICM staff support additional needs for voucher -based clients and provide quarterly home visits, monthly phone check in, and assis tance with negotiation with landlords, etc. in preparation for annual housing inspections, relocation if needed and redetermination paperwork/ appointments. The housing voucher programs include Permanent Supported Housing (PSH), Housing Readiness Program ( HRP), Moving to Work (MTW), and Mainstream Voucher Program. Case management staff makes every attempt to meet their clients in the community to ensure they have the basic needs of food, access to mental health services/primary care, and to further support their housing needs. Engagement strategies used are home visits (both scheduled and unscheduled), use of natural family support, case conference with outpatient community partners, hospital, jail, and joint home visits with a member of the treatment team. PROGRAM IMPACT The Embedded Intensive Case Management program services 6% of the South County Clinic population yearly for clients' that require community risk assessment/interventions, additional case management and/or deployed services out of the clinic setting. The ICM program is staffed with two part -time bilingual, Spanish/English, case managers. Staff development is targeted to further strengthen ICM awareness of community services and to deepen clinical knowledge of the population of clients served to employ/imple ment best recovery strategies and practice. The ICM staff participate in professional development including: Cultural Competency, SOGI, Assaultive Behavior, and all BHRS required documentation and compliance trainings. All the ICM attended Outreach Mental Health and Motivational Interviewing training. Additionally, ICM attend quarterly meetings with Mateo Lodge, weekly clinical supervision, and bi -weekly staff meeting at South County Adult Clinic. 63 The ICM staff members are trained in crisis intervention a nd provide valuable community assessments to ensure client safety, access to food/clothing/shelter, and improve access - linkage to services. Through outreach and hom e visits, the ICM staff improve clients' clinic services/attendance, evaluates medication co mpliance , report on safety concerns, and reduce client emergency services through engagement and accessibility to service providers. 30% of ICM referrals are for FSP level of care which are considered the high -risk clients in the community and have had a h ospitalization within 30 days of referral . Once an ICM client is stabilized, the client is relinked back to the program's clinic team and to other supported community programs that support client recovery. The ICM goal is to improve treatment participation , reduce symptom reduction through teaching coping skills and resiliency, enrollment in entitled benefits, promote independence, and assessment for additional services.

Remarkable outcomes are noted with 34% stabilizing client back to their treatment team and zero clients referred to higher level of care such as FSP or AOT. Flat reporting is noted for clients that continue to move out of county to seek a ffordable housing in other counties in California and clients that either decline services or unable to locate for engagement. 11%, two clients, died due to medical conditions while receiving ICM services which is indicative of the vulnerable complex at ri sk clients referred and receiving ICM services.

Reduction of negative outcomes is collected for the 30 days prior to referral and actual outcomes 3 months with ICM for 18 clients. ICM program is an effective program and intervention for clients that are high utilizers of psychiatric emergency services. ICM reported no suicide attempts and a 75% reduction in PES or psychiatric hospitalizations after 3 months of service. Two clients that were hospitalized were assessed and evaluated in the home by ICM and called police to initiated 5150 for clients that would otherwise not seek emergency services. Additional ly, with ICM support, 79% of clients were housed in temporary or permanent housing. Three clients were linked to outpatient treatment who were previously untreated for mental health. As clients engage with ICM, they become more integrated to the clinic services and are often further linked to primary care, Total Wellness, and are highly encouraged to attend therapy and rehabilitation groups to further bolster recovery. 30 day Prior to ICM Post ICM 3 months Reduction of Negative Outcomes 5 0 Suici de Attempts 12 3 Psychiatric Emergency or Hospitalizations 4 2 Incarcerations 14 3 Homeless 2 0 Housing Transition at Risk of Homelessness Integrated FSP - South C ounty FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 36 47 Total cost per client based on clients served $3,538 $2,710 based on contracted slots $8,491 $8,491 SUCCESSES A 21 -year -old transgender male , intellectua lly disabled client , diagnosed with M ajor Depressive Disorder was referred to ICM for stabilization of fleeting SI and PES utilization, assistance with connecting to LGBT services, a need for stabilization of family relationships, and to improve 65 psychiatric appointment attendance. Initially, the client appeared to present as a 13 -14-year - old with poor insight, limited adult skills, poor ADL's, and a poor candidate for hormone cross - sex therapy. The c lient stated their goal was to transition to male, obtain entitled benefits, and move out of family home. Initially the clients' e ngagement with his male ICM was slow as the client had significant trust issues. Through linkage to San Mateo Pride Center, teaching basic communication and life skills the client was able to be deemed appropriate for testosterone hormone therapy, has obtained entitled SSI benefits, completed name change, and is functioning at a young adult level. The client has decreased unprotected risky sexual behaviors, increased ADL's, and has improved self -image as his body is beginning to align with his internal sense of self. He now understands what adulating behavior is and how he can achieve goals through following up with commitments and communicating effectively with staff and peers. A 54 -year -old Hispanic female , double amputee from suicide by train attempt , diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Client was not compliant with medication treatment and caused two accidental fires in her apartment jeopardizing her housing placement and safety of others. She has had two 5150 , one with the ICM Case Manager due to at risk behavio rs and assaulting peers. Her ICM Case Manager was able to meet her language and cultural needs and effectively engage her and normalize her delusions. Through culturally appropriate interventions, the client is taking medications as prescribed, is having p ositive staff and peer interactions, is at minimum risk of homelessness, and is no longer performing risky ritual behaviors to ward off the \"demons\". She is attending all appointments and has started therapy. CHALLENGES Most of the referrals for the ICM program are to improve client's engagement with their treatment teams (not making it to appointments) and/or clients present as not stable and require outreach support or assessment. The difficult to engage client is typic ally medication non-compliant and/or homeless with limited family/social support. Use of culturally appropriate community agencies (faith based, Club House, pride center) has helped support recovery when limited financial and family support exists. The ma in barriers for the clients are limited housing, communication by telephone due to homelessness, co -occurring SUD disorders, trust issue stemming from mental health diagnosis and limited resources for undocumented clients. Assisting client s with task activ ities such as obtaining cell phone, assistance to coordinated entry, and other community resources improves client outcomes through building a working rapport and trust with the C ase Manager . Given the limited affordable housing in San Mateo County, conti nues to be a significant barrier for sourcing housing for clients . 66 to state 0% mobility disability 1% Chronic health condition 30% Lear ning disability 24% I do not have a d isability 30% Another d isability 1% Decli ne to No 100% GENERAL SYSTEM DEVEL OPMENT (GSD) General Systems Development (GSD) in San Mateo County has been primarily focused on supportive services for individuals with mental illness through integration of peer and family partners throughout the behavioral health system of care, and community peer run and peer peer focused wellness centers; system transformation strategies that support integration of services across various sectors impacting individuals with mental illness' lives including co - occurring subs tance use, dual diagnosis intellectual disability, criminal justice, child welfare, aging; and integrating evidence -base practice clinicians throughout the system. OLDER ADULT SYSTEM OF CARE OLDER ADULT SYSTEM O F INTEGRATED SERVICE (OASIS) The OASIS Program purpose is to provide outpatient field based mental health services for home -bound elderly individuals with severe mental illness and co -occurring medical diagnoses and functional limitations. The program assists elderly individuals to live in the community independently with improved quality of their lives. The targeted population served is the elderly ages 60+ with severe mental illness and co - occurring diagnosis due to mobility issues and functional limitations. Primary program activities and/or interventions provided include interventions such as psychiatric assessment and treatment, psychiatric medication evaluation and on -going monitoring, clinical case management, rehabilitation counseling, individual or family therapy, peer support, psychoedu cation, and collateral support with other community services. PROGRAM IMPACT In FY 2017 -18, OASIS served 267 cases, 36 cases non -duplicated. In FY 2018-19, OASIS served 248 clients, includ ing 77 non -duplicated case s and 51 cases were discharged from the program for a variety of reasons. Because of the fragility and complication of medical problems, 29.4% clients unexpectedly died from a medical condition, and there were 23.5% sent to Skill Nursing Facilities because of the need of higher -level care. Of the 51 clients discharged, there were 17.6% who refused to engage with a mental health provider but agreed to be followed by primary care provider for mild symptom of depression. 9.8% were given a diagnosis of dementia and were followed by primary care and Landmark medical group for continue treatment. 7.8% of them were transferred to region outpatient clinic as their mobility issues resolved and their symptoms were stabilized, no longer requiring field -based services. There were 9.8% who moved out of the county and 2% of them were lost follow up contact. Services 68 were provided in multiple languages including: Spanish 13.6%, Chinese 12.4%, Korean 1%, English 72%, and other languages 2%. With funding of MHSA, the OASIS program was able to continually provide services in Spanish and Chinese for those clients. Other languages beside English, i.e. Korean, the case manager utilized interpreter services to reduce the language barriers and to further engage the client in orde r to provide comprehensive follow -up care. Factors identified by OASIS are that the elderly population is experiencing a longer life span as compared to previous generations, but yet with more problematic psychosocial issues, i.e. financial difficulties , family relationships, housing problem, etc. With the limited resources in the county, OASIS case managers continually work with non -county contracted care homes in the community and are successful in placing a few clients who needed it the most. Unfortu nately, there still a lot of clients on the waiting list of various placements, the hope is that there will be more willingness from home owners in the community to accept the elderly and mentally challenged clients. OASIS FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 36 77 Total cost per client $12,931 $6,046 SUCCESSES 68-year -old Latina female with a severe history of childhood sexual abuse trauma and serious chronic illnesses. OASIS has consistently worked with the client for 7 years, after she was referred by her PCP due to the severity of her depression and her very poor medication compliance. Initially, the clients housing situation was very unstable, she had very little family support, was extremely isolated, and very symptomatic. She had limited coping strategies and was often suicidal. She made 3 serious suici dal threats, during the first few years of working with OASIS, that led to long term psychiatric hospitalizations, 2 rounds of ECT treatment and placement in transitional mental health program. The program worked with her to provide consistent and on -goin g psychiatric and case management services in the home. The program has worked very closely with her, first on stabilizing her by addressing her severe depression using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychotropic medications. Simultaneously, her psycho - social stressors were also addressed, these include her unstable housing, isolation, barriers to accessing medical care, and improving her relationship with her adult children. She is now in stable housing, is actively participating in an adult day progr am, is very compliant with her medical and psychiatric treatment (decreasing the need for long term hospitalizations) and has not had a psychiatric emergency in over 2 years. With sustained stability and use of healthy coping strategies, she has been work ing more directly on the issue of her sexual abuse trauma. 69 78 years old female client who was renting a room in an extremely chaotic drug house. Due to the housing crisis and limited availability of affordable housing, this was the only place she could afford. The client becomes very overwhelmed and anxious when confronted with having to make decisions for herself. After working with OASIS for approximately 2 -3 years, the client was able to take on the challenge of moving to a safe, secure, and afforda ble apartment. She has many obstacles that she is working on, but since her housing situation has been resolved, she is now able to focus on her mental and physical health. The client is working on improving her relationship with her daughter, after seve ral years of estrangement, and is now going to her medical appointments. CHALLENGES As the elderly population has continually increased, the OASIS team is working on further defining and clarifying criteria for referral to this field -based specialty team. This has become necessary as the clients entering the program continue to present with increasing complex medical conditions and case management needs in addition to their mental health issues. Another challenge is the housing issue and care home placement for the elderly clients. Facing the factor of hi gh cost of living in the Bay Area and in San Mateo County, lots of the clients were forced to move out from the county because they could no longer afford to live here. The limited resource of care homes in San Mateo county, also has the clients considerin g relocating to different living areas for their care needs. DEMO GRAPHIC 11% Russian at birth Male 22% 27% Female 78% 73% Decline to state In FY 17 -18 clients had a clinical diagnosis of mental illness with mobility issue due to multiple medical conditions. 70 SENIOR PEER COUNSELI NG, PENINSULA FAMILY SERVICE Senior Peer Counseling (SPC) , Peninsula Family Service is comprised of specially -trained volunteer counselors , more than 100 in total, to provide weekly visits to older adults to help manage transitions and life changes such as health concerns, mobility issues, caregiver needs, and grief. Special care is taken to connect participants with someone who shares simi lar life - experiences and perspectives, with support offered in languages such as English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, and Tagalog, and to participants who identify as LGBTQ+. The program provides weekly drop in support groups such as Stages in English, P latica in Spanish and Kapihan in Filipino, are also provided in various locations throughout San Mateo County such as in community centers, housing sites for older adults and the Pride Center. The program targets San Mateo County older adults in the unders erved populations, 55 years and older, who may be isolated, depressed, or suffer from anxiety. Volunteer peer counselors receive 36 hours of intensive training and undergo a thorough background check before being matched with a participant. Monthly clinica l supervision is provided to the trained peer counselors. In addition, the program provides a variety of in - service training to volunteers during the year. PROGRAM IMPACT Clients and counselors both felt that the program, generally, has done a good job me eting their needs. Client respondents' motivation for joining SPC was primarily companionship (combating loneliness/social support), assistance, and advice/helpful information. Clients reported that the program has helped them to feel a lot less lonely (73 %), more supported (78%), more connected to others (85%), and more positive about getting older (77%). It has also helped with coping skills, including asking for help (72%), sharing issues they are facing (71%), making decisions (66%), and dealing with gr ief and conflict (64%). Most respondents identified their peer counselor as a primary or secondary person they spoke with about issues. Both group and individual clients report high satisfaction with the program. Eighty -six percent of individual clients ar e satisfied a lot by the support their peer counselor provides. 83% of group clients also reported high satisfaction in the program. Senior Peer Counseling FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 570 840 Total cost per client $602 $409 71 SUCCESSES A Senior Peer Counselor (SPC) routinely visited her participant, an older gentleman who lived alone. She arrived one day to her regular appointment and the gentleman did not open the door. She was very concerned and called PFS and the emergency c ontact. She next called the police, who entered the home and found the participant on the floor and unresponsive. It was determined that he had been on the floor 2 -3 days . The participant had no family and the SPC visited him daily in the hospital. She kne w more about the client than his next of kin, who was related by marriage, but divorced. She was able to share the info she knew with the hospital staff who were caring for him. Without the SPC's quick thinking, it is unclear if the gentleman would have su rvived much longer, dehydrated and ill on the floor of his home. Paula, a woman who was recently widowed had no family and was not involved in the community. Without her husband, Paula felt alone in the world. The SPC counselor met with Paula weekly, assi sted her with getting Meals on Wheels, encouraged her to volunteer in her church, and took the bus with her, to help her become more independent. As their relationship grew and Paula's confidence increased, Paula began driving again, volunteered and made n ew friends at church and no longer felt so very alone, especially on holidays. Sarah, a 56-year -old single mother with a 19-year -old son with a disability , had fallen recently, hit her head and experiencing dizziness and migraines. She could not work, nor drive. Sarah's ex-husband was not paying alimony and they were struggling financially. The SPC counselor met with Sarah weekly. Through their communication, trust developed, Sarah's confidence grew. She started working part time and began to look at the p art she played in her situation. Sarah is feeling better about herself, she is looking at services to support her son as well. CHALLENGES Many SPC volunteers have reported feeling more comfortable attending clinical supervisions in their native language. A challenge faced for SPC has been finding a bilingual/bicultural Spanish - speaking clinical supervisor due to the limited hours the consultant works. The program spent 8 months searching and were able to finally find a great supervisor and in which the volunteers are provided with the support that they need. The peer counselors visit their participants diligently on a weekly basis , the counselors appear to face a challenge when tasked with completing visit forms in order to record their time as it takes staff some time to contact the volunteers to ge t their visit dates and hours. Additionally, SPC found it a challenge when attempting to have p articipants complete the SOGI questions. Training was provided to the sta ff and volunteers, but continued efforts will need to be made in order to increase the comfort level among the volunteers so that they feel more at ease administering the questions to their participants. 72 DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 1% CRIMINAL JUSTICE INTEGRATION PATHWAYS COURT MENTA L HEALTH PROGRAM The vast majority of the programs clients represent traditionally underserved populations; all have experience with the criminal justice system and a mental health diagnosis, many are low - income, and many have suffered discrimination and health disparities related to ethnic and gender identity. The four Pathways case manager's work with clients individually and intensively to ensure that they are connected in a timely manner with a warm handoff provided to needed services. Each client develops an individually -drive n treatment plan to address client - specific needs that are sensitive to history of minimal access to resources. Services accessed include public health services (e.g. Medi -Cal enrollment, benefits applications, linkage with a regional mental health clinic and primary care provider) as well as additional services with partner programs based on individual needs (e.g. chemical dependency treatment, housing agencies). Pathways clinicians also provide direct clinical services to all clients, including group and individual therapy and crisis management, in order to ensure low barriers to access needed care. Pathways also proactively works to combat stigma and discrimination, particularly with regard to mental health diagnoses and difficulties. Pathways encourages participants to speak openly about their experiences and partners with organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness to participate in activities such as the annual NAMI awareness walk, mental health month, and suicide prevention initiative s. Further, Pathways utilizes the peer support worker model to reinforce the recovery and human -centered approach to treatment. 73 PROGRAM IMPACT All 47 current clients served in FY 2017 -18 were able to reduce the duration and severity of mental i llness through their active participation in Pathways support and treatment groups as well as through intensive case management. Specifically, many clients also addressed concrete negative outcomes that result from untreated mental illness: Pathways is an alternative to incarceration, meaning that all enrolled clients are in Pathways and thus able to avoid incarceration by obtaining mental health treatment. 1 client who entered Pathways endorsing persistent suicidal ideation now denies any suicidal thought s 19 clients newly obtained stable housing 16 clients newly obtained employment 4 clients maintained previously acquired employment 5 clients enrolled in school (including community college and bachelors -level college) 2 clients were able to maintain children in their homes Pathways FY 17/18 Total clients served 47 Total cost per client $5,436 SUCCESSES John began Pathways endorsing chronic suicidal ideation and alcohol use that had impaired his ability to successfully complete regular probation. Once in Pathways, he entered residential alcohol and drug treatment. While this was initially successful, as he sustained periods of sobriety, John began to experience symptoms related to early childhood trauma. His suicidal ideation increased, and he immediately began meeting with a Pathways clinician weekly alongside daily meetings with his case manager, probation officer, or chemical dependency treatment provider. This increased clinical support alongside participation in groups with other clients who experienced similar trauma helped John identify sources of hope and gradually reduce suicidal thoughts. John then graduated his chemical dependency program and started work. He was able to avoid alcohol use for quite some time, in part due to the accountability from his Pathways clinical and probation team. John did drink once, but the team was quickly able to help John addres s the issue with a treatment rather than shaming approach. The team linked John to medication assisted treatment, and he was able to utilize medication to reduce his cravings while he continued to participate in therapy. At present, John denies all suicida l ideation and shares plans to work to support his daughter in her upcoming marriage . 74 CHALLENGES As many specialty court programs experience, Pathways enrollment numbers change in response to justice system developments. To increa se enrollment, Pathways continues to work closely with Correctional Health Services, the Sheriff's Office, and Behavioral Health and Recovery Services, seeking candidates who might benefit from the program. Pathways has also coped with staffing shortages a nd changes. The hope is for Pathways program to be fully staffed in the coming year to be able to support even more client events and caseload. DEMOGRAPHICS FY 17/18 FY 18/19 * 98% *due to staff transition, FY 2018 -19 is currently not available G.I.R.L.S PROGRAM StarVista's G.I.R.L.S. (Gaining Independence and Reclaiming Lives Successfully) is a court - mandated, intensive program that provides assessment, counseling, and case management services for incarcerated girls aged 13 -18. Participants learn how to deal with significan t 75 substance abuse and mental health issues. Adolescent girls are valuable and worthy of community support. Sustainable resources and programs are provided that promote the process of healing, educating and empowering each girl to achieve her greatest poten tial in her community. Services include: Individual counseling, Family counseling, Adolescent group counseling, Multifamily group counseling. PROGRAM IMPACT StarVista is proud to support the youth San Mateo County in the G.I.R.L.S program at Camp Kemp. During the '18 -'19 fiscal year the program has experienced 3 clients out of 21 complete the GIRLS Program successfully compared to 14 clients out of 38 in the previous y ear. There was also 1 High School Graduation and 1 8th Grade promotion. The Camp Kemp school environment seems to be a very successful part of the program and helps youth graduate who are found at risk to not reach graduation in school while living in the community. StarVista 's recent integration with Pyramid has brought additional team members with specific expertise. The Program Manager oversaw Camp Glenwood and Institutions teams in addition to the GIRLS Program, bringing these programs closer together resulted in increased flexibility with in coverage and the benefit of their knowledge and experience across each of the programs. The integration of programming has provided both the camps and the juvenile hall with opportunities for continuity of care and a dditional support for staff in each program . GIRLS Program FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 14 21 Total cost per client $6,384 $4,256 SUCCESSES GIRLS has had a very strong team, reflecting the efforts made through the recruitment of interns that can thrive within the Camp Kemp environment and improvements in training. The program was assisted by the multi -disciplinary team as it was welcoming and supportive of the new interns. Generally, the interns fit very well into the Camp Kemp environment and were skillful at building rapport with the youth, families and the multi -disciplinary team. Alcohol Other Drugs (AOD) group therapy has been well received by the clients who have been highly engaged . Additionally, AOD individual therapy was provided to two youths (funded by probation). The integration of AOD Individual counseling service in collaboration with individual, family, and group counseling services provided a significant amount of support t o youths struggling with substance use. The program successfully utilized the GIRLS Circle curriculum and is now providing healthy snacks as part of their group therapy sessions and has increased the use of sensory tools such as stress balls, tactile objec ts, and rocking chairs in group therapy to support self -soothing and emotional regulation. 76 CHALLENGES During the '18 -'19 fiscal year the program saw an increase in youth in the program whom were working with probation and HSA who were not returning to thei r family after staying at Camp. This created some challenges in terms of the traditional programming, which is currently oriented towards youth returning to their families. This was particularly evident at the multi - family group therapy sessions. The progr am saw several youths whose parents attended part of MFG, refused to attend, or did not participated in MFG groups. The program predicts that i f this continues, planning around this factor would be an important part of the multi -family group. There was an increase in the amount of youths who went AWOL and/or decided to serve their reminder of time at YSC. StarVista believes in the continuity of care, thus attempt s to provide services at the YSC were made , however, there were specific challenges the program encountered. It is reported that clinicians were only given a short amount of time with youth, space was limited at YSC, or codes called at YSC leading to closure to outside visitors . StarVista will continue to collaborate with Probation Services to facil itate the transiti on of services. Lastly, StarVista and BHRS, Aurora Pena m et at least once a month to discuss program strength and challenges to support each other and continuity of program collaboration. Maintaining the framework of Phase II treatment co ntinues to be a challenge for youth who attend school in the community. The number of youths in the community is often too small to set up a group therapy session that is more accessible to them and it is often challenging to get them to attend therapy at Camp Kemp. A new idea has been to set up a group therapy session at the San Carlos office for both GEP and youth in Phase II or III of the programs and to combine that with offering case management services. DEMOGRAPHICS FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Native American 5% Other 24% SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION CO-OCCURING RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES Voices of Recovery San Mateo County (VORSMC) is a non -profit 501\u00a9 3 peer -led organization that was established in 2010 with the purpose of advocating for and supporting the recovery community; people overcoming drug a nd/or alcohol addictions.

The program strives to coordinate local, state, and federal advocacy efforts. VORSMC partners with treatment providers, government entities and officials, community non -profits, faith -based organizations, and other organizations that provide recovery support services to individuals and impacted families. PROGRAM IMPACT VORSMC honors and embraces all unique strengths and challenges along the journey of recovery.

Growing up I succumbed to peer pressure and smoked my first joint at the age of 13. I tried cocaine at 16 and then progressed to try crank/meth at 22. My \"friend\" suggested to me she knew how I co uld lose weight. I was so desperate to lose weight and fit into society's standard of what a woman should look like as well as very low self -esteem and self -confidence. It was the perfect combination to become an addict and lose myself for years. I numbed my feelings and emotions for most of my adult life. I came into recovery at the age of 48. I have overcome addiction, domestic violence, homelessness, no self -confidence or self -esteem. Almost died or killed on several occasions. Today I embrace life. I va lue myself and am grateful for everyday that I wake up. I work for Voices of Recovery San Mateo County which allows me to share my story of recovery as an Advanced Level WRAP Facilitator, Recovery Coach and Peer Mentor and give others hope that \"if I can do it, you can do it\" As a WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) facilitator it has allowed me to adopt a WRAP plan into my daily life. I have been able to identify what my wellness looks like so that I can recognize pretty quickly when I am not in my welln ess and then put into place an action plan that is ready for me utilize to get back into my wellness before situations become a crisis in my life. Today I value myself and am grateful for the people in my life who are also my supporters, coworkers, adopted extended family members and sisters in sobriety. Today I love to give and receive hugs and in recovery I have learned that my mistakes and my past do not define who I am or where I am going in life.\" CHALLENGES The programs current challenge is not having the space to meet with participants and allow them the access to come and volunteer with us. CO-OCCURING CONTRACT S & STAFF BHRS contracts with nine AOD providers and funds co -occurring staff to enhance services provided to co-occurring clients . Additionally, two clinical contractors provide co -occurring capacity development trainings to BHRS staff and multiple agencies, consultation for complex co-occurring clients and system transformation support for relevant programs. PROGRAM IMPACT An annual survey asks clients about their treatment experiences, including co-occurring care coordination (staff work with my mental health care providers to support my wellness) , and quality of life outcome (as a direct result of the services I am receiving, I am better able to do things that I want to do) 79 Findings from 2017 T reatment Perception Survey Item Question Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree Care Coordination Work with MH Providers 4 (1.6%) 3 (1.2%) 2 (8.6%) 69 (27.0%) 119 (46.5%) Quality of Life Outcome Better Able to Do Things 3 (1.2%) 8 (3.1%) 21(8.1%) 80 (31.0%) 140 (54.3%) Findings from 2018 Treatment Perception Survey Item Question Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree Care Coordination Work with MH Providers 5 (1.3%) 8 (2.2%) 55 (14.8%) 95 (25.5%) 174 (46.8%) Quality of Life Outcome Better Able to Do Things 7 (1.9%) 6 (1.6%) 45(12.2%) 105 (28.4%) 202 (54.6%) Clients served staff Voices of Recovery FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total served 405 421 Total cost per client* $902 $868 CHILD WELFARE CHILD WELFARE PARTNERS The Prenatal -to-Three program supports families of pregnant women and children to age five who receive Medi -Cal services.

The word \"Puente \" means \"Bridge \" in Spanish, and it implies to hel p clients bridge what could be a life of dependence and isolation to a life of independence and integration with the whole community. Clients with intellectual disability have higher comorbid psychiatric disorders, face more stressors and traumatic exposu re in life, and experience more stigmatization and discrimination. Limits in communication/cognitive ability and aberrant brain development/function make it challenging for behavioral health providers to assess, diagnose, and treat these clients. Clinica l staff at the Puente Clinic are trained and experienced in working with adult clients with both intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions. In carrying out this unique function; Puente Clinic collaborates closely with the San Mateo County Branch of the Golden Gate Region Center (GGRC), which coordinates essential benefits (daily living, housing, etc.). Puente Clinic serves as the lead clinical team to receive psychiatric service referrals from GGRC. The team provides assessment, psychotherapy, an d medication management, and coordinates case management with GGRC social worker/case managers. Currently, Puente Clinic has one Full -Time Marriage & Family Therapist, two Half -Time Psychiatrists, and one Half -Time Nurse Practitioner. A typical client re ferred to Puente Clinic is someone having mild to severe intellectual disability, often with significant limits in communication ability, with one or more of the following conditions: 1. Returning to the community from a developmental center or a locked or delayed egress facility. 2. At risk for a higher level of care. 3. Requires in home services as clinically determined. 4. Had multiple psychiatric emergency services contact. 5. Complex diagnostic issues or poly pharmacy. PROGRAM IMPACT Puente Clinic continues to track the utilization of Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES), which is the triage center for acute psychiatric emergency in the county. The Puente Clinic ease s the transition of intellectually disabled clients with aggressions that endangerin g self or others from a locked or highly structured institutional setting to the much less restricted community environment. To achieve this, individual psychotherapy, medication management, and close collaboration with GGRC and its support teams are neede d to reduce disruptive and aggressive behaviors and to maintain stability in a high -risk client. 81 In FY 2018 -19, the total number of clients who needed PES intervention was 13, which is about 4.7% of the Puente Clinic total caseload. That is one person mor e than last FY 2017 -18 but is equal to the previous FY 2016 -17. These continuously low percentage numbers indicate that Puente Clinic has been able to provide effective outpatient -level services to avoid the use of higher -level intervention, like PES, and to maintain stability of most clients in its caseload. In more detailed analysis, of the 13 clients who needed PES services, the total number of PES visits was 43 in the FY 2018 -19, which is 5 PES visits more than FY 2017 -18. This was due to the increased utilization of PES by a few clients. On the other hand, there were only 3 clients in FY 2018 -19 had >4 PES visits over the full year, which is one client less than FY 2017 -18. This indicates that higher utilization of PES intervention was limited to only a few clients. Of the 6 clients with PES visits in both 2018 -19 and 2017 -18 fiscal years, 2 of them had a reduction of PES visit from FY 2017 -18 to FY 2018 -19, 2 had an increase of PES visits, and 2 had the same number of PES visits over the two years. Ove rall, these number counts show that the utilization pattern of PES remained the same between the two fiscal years and stayed low. It is worthwhile to note that, of the 12 clients with PES visits in FY 2017 -18, 6 of them had no PES visits in FY 2018 -19, thi s shows the positive effect of treatment. There were 7 clients with new PES visits in FY 2018 -19 with 50% of them being relatively new to Puente, and therefore their symptoms and conditions haven't become stabilized. Puente Clinic - Dual Diagnosis FY 17/1 8 FY 18/19 Total clients served 151 147 Total cost per client* $1,664 $1,709 SUCCESSES ML is a single, verbal, ambulatory non -conserved woman with diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, intermittent explosive disorder and mild intellectual disability. She is near 60 and has diabetic condition. She resided for most of her adult life in variou s board and care facilities in San Francisco. After her board and care closed in 2016, she was placed in a group home in San Mateo which was not equipped to manage her needs, resulting in more maladaptive behaviors. She began to decompensate and had multip le involuntary commitment to psychiatric treatment, police contact and hospitalizations for violence towards others as well as suicide attempts and ideations. She was ultimately transferred to a behavioral home created to support clients with extensive med ical and behavioral needs. Since the summer of 2018, ML began to settle down. With good care coordination between healthcare stakeholders including Puente Clinic, primary care, GGRC and dedicated 1:1 staff at the current care home, ML is now stable and doi ng well. 82 CHALLENGES AK is a single, verbal, ambulatory non -conserved woman in the mid -30s with diagnosis of seizure disorder, mood disorder not otherwise specified, impulse control disorder not otherwise specified and mild intellectual disability. She re sides in a small apartment with her mother. She is dependent on her mother for all activities of daily living. She was briefly placed in a group home and attended a day program, but her mother felt AK was not benefitting from either. At baseline, AK suffer s from chronic insomnia, explosive bursts of rage (when she does not get her way), compulsive behavior and irritability. In the last 5 years she has had 2 psychiatric hospitalizations and 5 psychiatric emergency visits for dangerousness to others. Since 20 15 her mental health treatment has been managed at Puente Clinic. There was a period of stabilization from late 2015 until summer of 2018 when AK was given her medications more regularly by her mother. From summer of 2018 her mother felt AK no longer need ed psychiatric medications and stopped giving them for several months, resulting in further decompensation. For the last year the clinic experienced a phase of playing 'catch up' from the prolonged break in medication. Prescriber continues to struggle with AK's mother for improved medication adherence and cooperation with medical tests including laboratory tests and electrocardiogram. Working with families who have their own ideas about treatment yet still seek assistance is a chronic challenge for Puente C linic. One other challenge presented by this case is that this client's intellectual disability service benefit is still managed by the Regional Center of Santa Clara County, instead of GGRC of San Mateo County, because she used to live in the Santa Clara County. Due to geographic disconnection and lack of existing collaboration model, it has been particularly difficult for Puente Clinic to advocate for this client in getting a full range of needed support. PEER AND FAMILY PARTNER SUPPORT S CALIFORNIA CLUBHOUSE California Clubhouse provides lasting and healthy behavioral changes for adults (18 years and older) living with serious mental illness. The Clubhouse environment encourages members to support each other in making healthier lifestyle changes and choices. Open at least 5 days weeks, the majority of Clubhouse activities occur during the Work Ordered Day (daily programming structured to engage members and staff side -by-side in meaningful work). The Work Ordered Day offers members the oppo rtunity to rediscover their talents and strengths 83 while rebuilding self -esteem and developing independence. Community support activities are centered in the work unit structure of the Clubhouse. They include helping with entitlements, housing and advocacy , promoting healthy lifestyles, as well as assistance in accessing quality medical, psychological, pharmacological and substance abuse services in the community. In addition to the Work Ordered Day, California Clubhouse offers supported employment and education services through the Career Development Center as well as a full range of social and recreational programming including evenings, weekends and holidays. The Clubhouse strips away the \"DIS Ability\" so that members can rediscover the talents, strength s and Abilities that have always been there but just got lost. Wholeness is restored through an emphasis on overall wellness, because after all, the mind is powerful and connected to the entire body. The program emphasizes that they do not have clients, customers, patients or consumers at California Clubhouse. Rather they acknowledge they have members, who have voluntarily joined the community not only to receive support but to share that support with others. The members own a stake in the Clubhouse as th ey work everyday side -by-side with staff in the Work Ordered Day to run the operations of the organization. They are the decision makers. With membership comes opportunity, rights, and personal choice but also requires accountability to something bigger th an yourself. PROGRAM IMPACT The California Clubhouse Career Development Center offers a multi -tiered approach to providing supported employment services to members. In addition to pre -vocational opportunities in the Work Ordered Day, volunteer positions in the greater community and independent employment supports, the Career Development Services focus heavily on assisting members in gaining meaningful paid employment: Transitional Employment (TE) is a unique feature of Clubhouses, a program specifically tailored for adults with persistent mental illnesses. It provides members an opportunity to be introduced or reintroduced to working, with part -time, time -limited job placements in local businesses. Members working TE are paid the prevailing wage for that position. The Clubhouse supports by providing on -the-job training, supervision and support. Members continue to be a vital part of the larger Clubhouse program during TE. Clubhouse staff fills in should any member be temporarily unable to work, providing employers guaranteed job coverage. Through this 84 program members return to work, earn a good wage, expand their experiences, rebuild working stamina and obtain current job references. Supported Employment (SE) is similar to Transitional Employment, except the employment is not time -limited and can be either part -time or full -time. The position belongs to the member and there is a competitive element to the interview process. In SE, the clubhouse develops and maintains a relationship with the employer, provi des resume and job search support, and assists with job site development and training. Ongoing support from the Clubhouse program and staff is provided as long as the member needs however, the clubhouse does not provide absence coverage.

HOPE is designed to reduce hospitalization and comorbidity for a targeted vulnerable mental health population through dedicated peer and family support and Clubhouse Supported Employment services. 85 Som e additional agency partners include: StarVista, HAP -Y with Starvista, San Mateo Medical Center, MHA, Caminar, Cordilleras, College of San Mateo, Latino Collaborative, Pride Initiative, HOPE House, Chinese Health Initiative, Job Train and Pacific Islander Initiative. Amaal, now 28 years old, shares how California Clubhouse's Young Adult Program helped change his life: \"Early on in my recovery I had a tendency to isolate and stay at home without being very productive. The YAP at the Clubhouse got me out of the house and interacting with more people my age with similar struggles. It helped me overcome my stagnation and get involved in the community. Through my participation at the Clubhouse I was able to go back to work and go back to school. I now work full time in the m ental health field and attend school part time with the goal of becoming a psychiatric nurse. The California Clubhouse Young Adult Program has truly helped me go above and beyond!\" The change that California Clubhouse makes in the lives of its members tak es many forms. For some, it is getting out of bed and going to the Clubhouse to break the cycle of severe isolation. For others, it is returning to paid employment after a lengthy break or not having a solid work history. The journey of Upward Mobility is unique for everyone, just as every person's mental health recovery is unique. -- Riley, Clubhouse Member CHALLENGES 1. Only 54% of funding was from San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. The remaining 46% is comprised of private donor, fo undation and corporate support. So, program implementation and growth are dependent on fundraising success. With limited resources, this can mean a competition for resources such as time between fundraising and program sustainability. 2. The program is not f unded directly for Supported Employment funding therefore, resources for the Career Development Center were capped 3. Data tracking and reporting; the program reports lacking the funding to purchase a comprehensive Clubhouse data tracking system that can hel p quantitatively and qualitatively measure program outcomes to provide empirical evidence to inform program development, management, evaluation, reporting, and improvement. 4. Data capture; the program decreased the size of membership application to remove additional barriers and delays for members to join. The program transitioned from 86 capturing demographic information in the written application to a process of in person Q & A with the member and a staff member. However, it was realized that some of the data points were not transferred over. Additionally, in the past demographics collected by the County were different and have recently expanded. 5.

These workers provide a very special type of direct service and support to BHRS consumers/clients: they bring the unique su pport that comes from the perspective of those experiencing recovery, either in their own personal lives, or as relatives of someone personally affected. They know firsthand the challenges of living with and recovering from a behavioral health diagnosis an d work collaboratively with the clients based on that shared experience. PEER SUPPORT WORKERS There are currently 18 peer positions throughout the behavioral health system of care: 1 Senior Community Worker on the Adult Services Team 9 Peer Support Worker positions in the BHRS adult system funded by MHSA.

She has helped me in many ways to be a bet ter parent, how to treat them and in the moral aspect and how I can adapt to my child. She also showed me how track changes in my child's mood and to learn the signs of substance use. Before working with my Family Partner, I had many problems with no answe rs. I still have problems, but I can manage them!!\" Ms. Gonzalez, Redwood City, CA CHALLENGES Family Partners ha ve noticed that new clinicians and supervisors that come to BHRS have little to no knowledge of what a Family Partner is, how to work with a Fam ily Partner or know of the benefits that the Family Partner can have with the families. In order to solve this, they are creating a training for new clinicians start working at BHRS so they understand better the role of the Family Partner and learn how to Family Partners can support the client's families and how to request a Family Partner. A brochure is being created so that clinicians can better explain to families the role of the Family Partner and how they can provide support. THE BARBARA A. MO UTON MUL TICULTURAL WELLNESS CENTER Multi -Cultural Wellness Center s for behavioral health clients and their family members provide culturally diverse community -based programs, support and linkages to behavioral health services, and other resources as needed for clients with mental illness. One East Palo Alto is the lead agency funded since 2009 to implement all aspects of the development and operation of the Barbara A. Mouton Multicultural Wellness Center (The Mouton Center) to build capacity to ensure long -term services are provided to Behavioral Health and Recovery Serv ices (BHRS) clients and community members in the East Palo Alto communit y. The Mouton Center is intended to create a safe and supportive environment for adults with mental illness and/or co - occurring addiction challenges and their families who are multirac ial, multicultural and multigenerational through various strategies including: Welcoming to African Americans, Latinos and Pacific Islanders and LGBTQ+ community; Include facility decor and furnishings that are welcoming to all members; Provide program act ivities in Spanish, Tongan and other languages; and Intentionally celebrate diversity by hosting monthly multicultural event s that bring the diverse members of the MCWC together to inform, engage and invite sharing of cultural wellness practices and streng ths. 90 PROGRAM IMPACT See Appendix 7 for the full evaluation report for the Mouton Center. Historically, the populations served by the program are the undercounted and underserved. The on-going interventions provide timely access and linkages to treatment. For example, during the initial screening of becoming a member, staff members engage the potential consumer member in conversation about mental health and mental concerns that they may have. During the verbal assessment, staff listen non -judgmentally, assessing for risk of suicide or harm to self or others, give reassurance that th ere are local programs and services that will address whatever their specific need or concern may be. Where appropriate, staff members make an immediate referral to the appropriate agencies in the SMCBHRS SoC, for assessment and follow up treatment as nee ded. In most cases, a \"warm handoff\" is conducted, accompanying the consumer member to the agency and depending on the request, participate in the initial assessment appointment. This has become a standard practice for all EPAPMHO partners particularly amo ng the monolingual speakers who need translation services and rely on an ambassador that they know and trust. Mouton Center FY 17/18 Total clients served 147 Total cost per client $1,272 SUCCESSES MCESBA Outreach worker Dee \"Mamadee \" Uhila in partnership with The Mouton Center, served a PI family, husband & wife in their late 90's, both of whom are from San Jose. They had been couch -surfing and heard about The Mouton Center and Dee Uhila thru another consumer. After two months, they secured housing. Through staff contact with the couple and their participation in the PI \"Know Your Rights Forum\" by MCESBA, the staff members learned so much about their many unmet needs. Due to the stigma associated with asking for help in the PI communi ty and the fear caused by their immigration status, they hadn't spoken with anyone about their needs and were embarrassed. Further, the family the couple was staying with were also unaware of community resources. Mamadee established a trusting relationshi p with the couple and they were encouraged to allow her to make a referral to Ravenswood Family Health Center. They applied for the Access and Care for Everyone (ACE) program. It took two months to get them through the registration process just to schedule an appointment to see Dr. Amy Wulf and received their ACE cards. The elderly couple had been in the U.S. for 10 years and had never seen a doctor. They are finally receiving ongoing medical care. As a result of addressing their immediate needs and establ ishing a trusting relationship, they are now able to participate in a conversation about mental health and wellness and how 91 participating in wellness programs can improve their quality of life. Currently their immigration issues and long -term housing needs are being addressed . CHALLENGES The program has experienced an on -going complaint among consumers pertaining to the wait time when trying to secure services or to receive services on a drop -in basis. The wait time in some cases for an appointment can be up to two or three months. Wait time if one drops into a medi cal clinic or services can be up to four hours. This is an unexpected interruption in one's day and prolongs ones' suffering with the medical or mental health condition. time when one drops in for services, especially for clients who are elderly. The need s of the PI community outweigh the capacity and the resources. The amount of time it takes to serve a client. It takes more than a 30 to 60 minutes initial contact to connect the individual or family to mental health services. Given that it is necessary to address the immediate needs before being able to address their mental health concerns, of which the concept of mental health is foreign in their culture, it takes a number of contacts before a referral can be made. The PI community is faced with unique ba rriers to accessing mental health services. The standard approach used by the County, many times are inappropriate given the cultural uniqueness of the community. With many of the resources needed being outside of the community, transportation is an on - going issue and determines whether or not a consumer and/or family, family member receive services. Bus tokens that are available have unfriendly user restrictions and defeat their own purpose. Not all clients qualify for taxi vouchers or free rides to medic al appointments because they don't have medical coverage, or their medical coverage doesn't provide such services. This makes it difficult to secure mental health services outside the community, making it to job interviews, housing interviews, submitting a pplications by specified deadlines, etc. Primary Language English 92 Sex at Birth Male 33% Female 67% Gender 2018 -19 full report will be included in the next MHSA Annual Update. EVIDENCED -BASED PRAC TICE (EBP) System transformation is supported through an ongoing series of trainings that increase utilization of evidence -based treatment practices that better engage consumers and family members as partners in treatment and that contribute to improved consumer qual ity of life.

BHRS has seen a consistent increase in representation of these communities in its system since the strategies were deployed. Strategies include pre -crisis response, and primary care -based linkages . PRE -CRISIS RESPONSE MATE O LODGE: FAMILY ASSE RTIVE SUPPORT TEAM ( FAST ) Mateo Lodge was contracted in May 2013 to provide pre-crisis response and in-home outreach services that offer engagement, assessment, crisis intervention, case management and support services to individuals with mental illness , famil ies and caretakers. FAST provides early interven tion and works with the family over 2 -3-month s. Services include behavioral health and community resource education, linkages to outpatient care and rehabilitation and recovery services, and short -term counseling, support, and case management. The FAST t eam consists of clinical case managers, peer and family partners, and a psychiatrist. PROGRAM IMPACT Reducing the duration of untreated mental illness. Many of the clients serve d have never received any effective mental health services. Often this group of clients do not believe that they have anything they need and refuse services. Therefore, any successful intervention will result in reducing the duration of untreated mental ill ness. Preventing mental illness from becoming severe and disabling. As is know n, the earlier the intervention the better the outcomes. If left untreated the illness can progress. The intervention often results in arresting this Suicide: There has never been a death by suicide of an active FAST team case Prolonged suffering: The interventions successfully connect to services which results in treatment to alleviate symptoms and suffering. Incarcerations At times during an intervention client may experience short term contact with criminal justice but the goal is to move them away from that system into the mental health system. Homelessness: Team members utilize funds for emergency housing, taking people off the street or as necessary out of the home in an effort to end homelessness for clients. School failure or dropout: Support is provided to keep clients in school. Removal of children from their homes: In the few case involving children CPS is engaged where necessary, but the goal is always when safe to reunite families. 94 Unemployment: Where appropriate clients are referred to appropriate service s Improves timely access & linkage to treatment for underserved populations: As this group by definition is not receiving services efforts are made to streamline access this is done with one on one assistance to open up any system barriers. Same day assist ance and walk in services with clients are used . Reduces stigma and discrimination: Team members are peers and family members that often know firsthand about issues of stigma and discrimination . Increases number of individuals receiving public health servi ces: All types of benefit s including SSI GA Food services are accessed. Reduces disparities in access to care: Clients are accompanied to system visits to ensure the best care possible. Implements recovery principles: Al clients are trained in the Recovery Model .

DEMOGRAPHICS Age 18-30 41% Pacific Islander Asian 12% 96 PRIMARY CARE - BASED EFFORTS RAVENSWOOD FAMILY HE ALTH CENTER Ravenswood is a community -based Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that serves East Palo Alto residents. Ravenswood provides outreach and engagement services and identifies individuals presenting for healthcare services that have significant needs for behavioral health services. Ravenswood outreach and engagement services are funded at 40% under CSS and the remaining 60% is funded through Prevention and Early Intervention. The intent of the collaboration with Ravenswood FHC is to identify patients presenting for healthcare services that have significant needs for mental health services. Many of the diverse po pulations that are now un -served will more likely appear in a general healthcare setting. Therefore, Ravenswood FHC provides a means of identification of and referral for the underserved residents of East Palo Alto with SMI and SED to primary care based me ntal health treatment or to specialty mental health. Ravenswood FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 406 375 Total cost per client $104 $113 97 PREVENTION & EARLY IN TERVENTION (PEI) 98 PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) PEI targets individuals of all ages prior to the onset of mental illness, with the exception of early onset of psychotic disorders. PEI emphasizes improving timely access to services for underserved populations and reducing the 7 negative outcomes of untre ated mental illness; prolonged suffering; homelessness; and removal of children from their homes. Service categories include: Early Intervention programs provide treatment and other service s and interventions, including relapse prevention, to address and promote recovery and related functional outcomes for a mental illness early in its emergence. Services shall not exceed eighteen months, unless the individual receiving the service is identi fied as experiencing first onset of a serious mental illness or emotional disturbance with psychotic features, in which case early intervention services shall not exceed four years. Prevention programs reduce risk factors for developing a potentially seri ous mental illness and build protective factors for individuals whose risk of developing a serious mental illness is greater than average and, as applicable, their parents, caregivers, and other family members. Services may include relapse prevention and u niversal strategies. Outreach for Recognition of Early Signs of Mental Illness to families, employers, primary care health care providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illnesses. Access and Linkage to Treatment are activities to connect individuals with severe mental illness as early in the onset of these conditions as practicable, to medically necessary care and treatment, including, but not limited to, care provided by county mental health programs . Stigma and Discrimination Reduction activities reduce negative feelings, attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, stereotypes and/or discrimination related to being diagnosed with a mental illness, having a mental illness, or seeking mental health services. Suicide Prevention programs are not a required service category. Activities prevent suicide but do not focus on or have intended outcomes for specific individuals at risk of or with serious mental illness. 99 PEI AGES 0 -25 The following programs serve children and youth ages 0 -25 exclusively and some combine both Prevention and Early Intervention strategies. MHSA guidelines require is 19% of the MHSA budget to fund PEI and 51% of PEI budget to fund program for children and youth. EARLY CHILDHOOD COMM UNITY TEAM (ECCT) ECCT employs both prevention (60%) and early intervention (40%) strategies. ECCT incorporates several major components that build on current models in the community, in order to support healthy social emotional development of young children. The ECCT comprises a community outreach worker, an early childhood mental health consultant, an d a licensed clinician and targets a specific geographic community within San Mateo County, in order to build close networking relationships with local community partners and support families. The ECCT delivers three distinct service modalities that serve at risk children and families: 1) Clinical Services, 2) Case management/Parent Education services, and 3) Mental health consultations with childcare and early child development program staff and parents served by these centers. In addition, the ECCT team conducts extensive outreach in the community to build a more collaborative, interdisciplinary system of services for infants, toddlers and families. The ECCT focuses services on the Coastside community - a low -income, rural, coastal community geographical ly isolated community - comprised of Half Moon Bay, La Honda, Pescadero, Moss Beach, Montara and the unincorporated coastal communities of El Granada, Miramar and Princeton -By-The-Sea. While comprised of very small cities and unincorporated areas located significant distances from one another, collectively Coastside comprises 60% of the total area of the entire County while having a small fraction of the population. To better serve this disperse community, ECCT has built strong relationships with key comm unity partners and successfully refers families to the local school district, other StarVista services, Coastside Mental Health clinic and Pre -to-Three Program , among others. Additionally, ECCT works with these partners to address gaps and needs in the co mmunity and to address the existing system of care for families with young children living in the Coastside areas. PROGRAM IMPACT Providers and Parents receiving consultation services are given an Annual Satisfaction Survey at the end of the year in order to collect data about services provided. In FY 2017 -18, 114 unduplicated children were served and 22 staff received consultation. In FY 2018 -19, 122 unique children were served and consultation services provided, 11 Community Worker Services, 21 staff rec eiving consultation services and 47 Families In Groups. 100 As a result of on -going mental health consultation, teachers at 20 staff at the 5 childcare programs are reporting greater ability to understand and respond to the social -emotional needs of children in their centers. The results from the annual survey of teachers (further discussed with regards to satisfaction below) show: 90% of respondents reported that consultation was very effective or effective in contributing to their willingness to co ntinue caring for a specific child with challenging behaviors. 85% of respondents reported that consultation was very effective or effective in helping them in their relationship with this child's family. 100% of respondents reported that consultation was very effective or effective in helping them think about children's development and behavior. 100% of respondents reported that consultation was very useful or very useful in thinking with them about supporting all children in their classroom. 100% of resp ondents reported that consultation was very useful or useful in helping them think about children's engagement in classroom activities. The 18 -19 fiscal year the program collected more parent surveys than the previous year. Results of the surveys collected from 6 Parents of the 12 children receiving intensive consultation services show: 100% of respondents reported the consultation was effective in supporting their relationship with their child 100% of respondents reported that consultation effective was in increasing their understanding of their child's behaviors and needs 100% of respondents reported that consultation was effective in assisting the teachers in adapting and/or responding to their child's needs 83% of respondents reported the consultant was involved in finding additional services for their child 100% of respondents reported consultation was effective in helping them think about their child's experience in daycare/pre -school As a result of mental health consultation services, 12 families have increased their capacity to understand their child's behaviors and to respond effectively to their social -emotional needs. These changes have been observed through informal conversations with parents over the course of their work with the consultant as w ell as from staff satisfaction survey results. Parents and teachers also informally noted differences in children's behaviors: progress towards achieving goals formed at the beginning of case consultation was evidenced in 12 of the 12 more intensive consul tation cases. This progress was noted through informal conversations with teachers during weekly meetings as well as meetings with parents. 101 ECCT FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 114 122 Total cost per client $3,588 $3,353 SUCCESSES One success is with a family who had been referred to ECCT by another therapist. The family was set up with goals to assist in providing the child in need with support in regulating and expressing his emotions and frustrations along with the assistance for the mother who was in need of ongoing parenting strategies and confidence building. This family had been very consistent ly attended weekly therapy sessions . The client, older sister and mother attend the sessions together - mother has a very high level of eng agement in the therapeutic process. The program staff were able to get in some collateral time by meeting at a park and keeping enough distance (while watching the kids) to discuss difficult issues and concerns for the mother. The treatment goals, with in put and collaboration with mother, have included reducing frequency and intensity of oppositional -defiance and aggressive behaviors, coupled with increasing child's abilities and willingness to appropriately and effectively express his feelings, desires, wants/needs and increasing mother's level of parenting confidence, increasing her capacity and tool box to implement positive discipline strategies. The mother has been able to support child's communication skills, use positive discipline techniques and is able to more effectively de-escalate child when he is agitated and dysregulated. The mother has been able to help child understand why he is upset when he is having a temper tantrum or becomes aggressive (making meaning of his behaviors, providing empathy and nurturing, perspective taking of what is bothering him in the home environment/family dynamics). Child's communication skills and frustration tolerance have significantly improved over the course of therapy. His verbal and physical aggression is much l ower in both frequency and intensity (ie: he used to become aggressive towards mother, sister and therapist in most sessions, now he is aggressive very infrequently in sessions). CHALLENGES 1. Due to the increasing cost of housing in the community, many of the families have had to move in with other families as a way to mitigate the cost of rent. This has created concerns for client confidentiality. Although the Half Moon Bay Library and the office space is a better alternative than the client's home, both o f these spaces still have confidentiality concerns. 2. Another challenge face is regards clients that age out of program. For many of these children the program experiences the challenge of transferring them to other services, whether those services are schoo l based or through Coastside Mental Health. 102 3. The program has also faced challenges in the consultation work which has required the staff to use a stance of \"being flexible\" very often and very intentionally. Although the team continues to witness the ongoin g trend of teachers' having less time to meet as a team, especially due to staffing shortages and constant ratio challenges, teachers continue to use consultation services within their limited time. Due to the flexible approach that attempts to \"meet teac hers where they are at\" the consultants have been able to meet with teachers when their schedule allowed. However, this year teachers reported extremely high levels of stress and burnout as well as feeling overwhelmed with children exhibiting challenging b ehaviors. 4. The ECCT program would also greatly benefit from having more funding to expand the 3 different roles within ECCT. One of the biggest reasons seeing a need for an expansion due to the populations that have not been able to directly connect to services. For example recently ECCT has made connections with Half Moon Bay High School to discuss providing support to teenage mothers. However, given the limited bandwidth the program is not able to follow through on providing parenting education or mental health work shops. PEI AGES 0 -25: COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS FOR SCHOOL AGE AND TAY PROJECT SUCCESS Project SUCCESS, or Schools Using Coordinated Community Efforts to Strengthen Students, is a research -based program that uses interventions that are effective in reducing risk factors and enhancing protective measures. Project SUCCESS is a SAMHSA model pro gram that prevents and reduces substance use and abuse and associated behavioral problems among high risk; multi -problem youth ages 9 -18. In coordination with San Mateo County Health System, Puente has adopted the Search Institutes Developmental Assets Pro file (DAP) as a measurement tool. The DAP incorporates the Search Institutes 40 developmental assets framework when addressing the needs of young people in the community. Project SUCCESS is designed for use with youth ages 9 -18 and includes parents as col laborative partners in prevention through parent education programs. Clinical staff trained in culturally competent practices ran all the groups. All Puente BHRS staff are either licensed or pre -licensed by the Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS). Project S UCCESS groups are offered on all three school campuses in the La Honda -Pescadero Unified School District. The school district's small size provides an opportunity for every student in the district, ages 9 -18, to participate in one or more Project SUCCESS a ctivities. All groups were offered in English and in Spanish. 103 Project SUCCESS FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 91 228 Total cost per client $3,009 $1,201 SUCCESSES Learning How to Love and Be Loved This summer 2019, 40 youth from Puente's Summer Youth Leadership and Employment program participated in a six -weeks Project S UCCESS group (once a week) with Puente behavioral health counselors. Aside from covering basic drug and alcohol prevention topics, as well as problem solving metho ds to help them at their workplaces (many of them were interns at a workplace for the first time), perhaps the most successful and inspiring lesson was given on relationships, specifically using the \"five love languages\" from Gary Chapman, Ph.D. Because h ealthy relationships are an integral piece in preventing substance abuse in teens, the program wanted to give the youth a better understanding of how they best receive love, and how others may be demonstrating love to them without their awareness. Each you th in the program took a love language inventory to discover their own love language(s). Youth were invited to explore how their top love languages may differ from parents, friends, or other family members and to be mindful of how they express love to othe rs; do their actions match that person's needs (their top love language)? Youth were also given the chance to discover \"self - love \" (self -care) tools based on their top love language to be used as coping skills when they are going through hard times or feel ing depressed or anxious. In addition, group leaders connected the value of love language awareness to the youth's workplaces and discussed how appreciation in the workplace is crucial to a successful and supportive work environment. Youth were asked to re cognize ways in which their colleagues and supervisors showed them appreciation throughout the summer and were given tools to problem solve and advocate for their needs if a lack of appreciation was present. As a representation of their newly learned rela tionship skills, youth created artwork based on how they interpret love languages through their own personal experiences. Youth were given the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box to make multi -media panels, which combined to form a display of hanging umbrellas called \"Love Reigns\". This display represents the many ways in which love shelters them and is a protective factor in the youth's lives. Their art was displayed at the town's local \"Pescadero Arts and Fun Festival\" in August 2019. CHALLENGES Project SUCCESS requires a large time commitment for both the staff that is implementing it and the school district staff that will be supporting it. The curriculum is very detailed and maintaining fidelity to the model can be very difficult with certain groups. The pre and post 104 testing is arduous especially for the region where there is limited access to the internet. The program has adapted by using the paper version of the DAP which then requires Puente staff time to input into the Search Insti tutes database. The screening requirements for entry into the different groups: users, non -users, COSAP etc. are prohibitive for the region. The school population is 330 -360 students each year, so in order to make sure that the program could maintain fi delity and have an adequate number of students for each cohort, Puente and the La Honda -Pescadero Unified School District decided to put all the youth ages 9 -18 through at least one 8 -week workshop. Fifth grade students, ages 9 -11, all go through the work shop. It was difficult, again, in middle school to find a way to maintain fidelity to the model and utilize the curriculum age appropriately. Puente decided to have all 8th grade students participate in an 8 - week group. Again, it was challenging to surv ey high school students and divide based on the Project SUCCESS curriculum. Outreach for parenting groups has been difficult , this led to a collaborat ion with Puente's Education team and Stanford University Haas Center for Public Service students and have a booth at Science Night. DEMOGRAPHICS Project SUCCESS is designed for use with youth their parents as collaborative partners The demographics below include both youth and their FY Sex Assigned ABUSE TREATM ENT (MBSAT) In August 2018, BHRS began piloting an alternate curriculum to Seeking Safety: The Mindfulness -Based Substance Abuse Treatment (MBSAT) 12 -session curriculum. All Seeking Safety providers were invited and agreed to participate in piloting of the curriculum. A new Request for Proposals for Trauma -Informed Co -occurring Services for Youth, which includes the MBSAT curriculum, was released and new agreements established with a target start date of July 1, 2020. MBSAT is a group -based curriculum incorporating m indfulness, self -awareness, and substance - abuse treatment strategies for use with adolescents dealing with substance use/abuse. MBSAT provides adolescents with the ability to improve their decision -making skills and reduce unhealthy behaviors -such as subst ance use -through learning emotional awareness and choosing how to respond (versus react) to stressful situations, how specific types of drugs affect the body and the brain, and how family, peers, and the external environment can contribute to drug use. MBS AT strives to offer youth an empowered approach to substance use prevention, rather than the norm that adolescents typically meet; programs that teach \"just don't do (drugs).\" MBSAT is designed for use with adolescents, broadly defined, and uses adult facilitators as leaders of the group to model authenticity and building healthy relationships. MBSAT was piloted with three agencies that have been implementing Seeking Safety (Puente de la Costa Sur , Star Vista and El Centro de Libertad ) in FY 17/18 & FY 18/1 9. This pilot was conducted in order to inform the Trauma Informed Interventions for youth RFP that will be replacing the Seeking Safety curriculum. As part of the pilot , groups were conducted to hear feedback from the youth regarding the curriculum but to also expand the prevention strategy to encompass what they identified as opportunities and barriers. See Appendix 8 for the MBSAT Focus Group Results. MBSAT - PUENTE DE LA COST SUR (PUENTE) Clinical staff trained in cultural humility and trauma -informe d care ran MBSAT groups for Puente. All Puente BHRS staff are either licensed or pre -licensed by the Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS). MBSAT is offered at Pescadero High School, in the La Honda -Pescadero Unified School District to students in grades 9 -12. The group was taught in English, with parents being offered education regarding group curriculum in both English and Spanish. PROGRAM IMPACT 106 Providing targeted intervention programs like MBSAT helps to foster strength in the 40 Developmental Assets, par ticularly in the areas of support, empowerment, positive values, social competencies, and positive identity. Puente has the ability to touch 100% of the service area's school aged youth and their families one or more times, creating a safety net for those who may struggle with mental illness. Prevention and intervention is the key to preventing mental illness from becoming severe and disabling. MBSAT is a prevention and intervention program designed to address strengths that foster positive mental health and wellness. Puente's BHRS team are embedded on all campuses and referral system is comprehensive. Prevention and interventions with MBSAT foster increased emotional awareness and building authentic, supportive relationships. An increase in these factor s can lead to freedom of expression and a greater likelihood to seek services in those students who are at a higher risk for suicide and mental illness. The Puente BHRS team has the ability to interact with all of the youth in the school district, there i s a long and strong partnership with the La Honda -Pescadero Unified School District administration, and there are diligent efforts to partner with teachers and other staff who work with the region's youth. MBSAT - Puente FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 8 12 Total cost per client $2,627 $1,751 SUCCESSES MBSAT participants reported overall positive experiences. One group member reported feeling a sense of \"inner peace\" after participating in the group, and that they now practice \"thinking before doing\". Another member reported that the group helped them to \"keep [their] sanity\". Group members successfully learned the informal mindfulness technique (Stop, Take a breath, Imagine future consequences, Choose - or S.T.I.C.) and practiced role - playing scenarios in which they employed this method of responding to s tressful situations. Perhaps the programs greatest success was the openness with which youth felt comfortable talking in the group about drug and alcohol use. Youth reported feeling \"understood\" and grateful for \"the deep talks we had on topics\". One yout h, now a graduate of Pescadero High School, often openly talked about his use of and feelings surrounding marijuana. He invested his time and effort into participating in the group and has now decided to study to become a Substance Use Counselor at College of San Mateo. It is firmly believed that MBSAT's model and values as a curriculum helped these youth to feel open to discussing substance use in an environment that fostered independent thinking, mindful responses to stress, and an increased sense of self -awareness. CHALLENGES 107 Some challenges faced were securing youth's time commitment each week, conflict with school sports' program schedules, and minimizing technology distractions during program. In order to mitigate the timing challenges in future groups , the program has coordinated with the La Honda -Pescadero Unified School District to hold the group during school hours, not conflicting with any of the youth's academic classes. In addition , the program created a space in which youth can intentionally, bu t optionally, make the choice to drop off their phones in the beginning of class in a drawer and retrieve them at the end. With hope that this helps to foster self -awareness in the students, while also making the space more conducive to practicing mindfuln 92% Sex Assigned at birth Male 83% Decline to state Race/Ethnicity White/Caucasian 8% * No data was collected for FY 17/18 due to the program being in transition. MBSAT - STARVISTA StarVista offered MBSAT groups to various community -based organizations in San Mateo County. These organizations offer programming and work with the aforementioned age groups at their facilities. StarVista attends the various sites and align s to be fitting in with their programming schedules. Flexibility and convenience are significant components of this program in order to make it as accessible as possible to the population. Groups are split up based on age if necessary (15 -17 and 18 -25). PROGRAM IMPACT The MBSAT program: 108 Improves timely access & linkages for underserved populations: By traveling to various facilities in the community where the underserved population congregates, resides or attends programming - it allows for greater accessibility allowing convenie nt attendance by participants in need. StarVista works with the partner agencies and the participants to determine the best time/access point for participation. Reduces stigma and discrimination: This program does not focus on telling the youth what to do and what not to do. This program focuses on teaching the youth to be more aware of the factors that lead to their decisions with hopes of making more informed decisions based on desired long -term consequences and outcomes. The program focuses on teaching youth to be more present in their lives and how to develop a healthy way to deal with challenges, such as family, peers, past trauma, and addiction. This also reduces societal stigma around emotional or mental health support by normalizing the conversation around increasing awareness and emotional management. Many youth who have been involved in the communities \"systems\" (juvenile justice, probation, homeless networks, foster care, etc) can feel powerless within these systems. As noted above, this program p rovides the youth with the strategies needed to overcome and empowers them to find solutions to life's challenges within themselves. Increases number of individuals receiving public health services: Because this program travels to where the underserved you th are already receiving services, it reaches individuals that would otherwise not have been receiving these public health services. StarVista works with partners if there is any unmet need reported or perceived by the clinician in an effort to ensure the youth's health needs are being met. Reduces disparities in access to care: By targeting underserved populations, this program directly increases the number of individuals receiving public health services, thus reducing the disparity in access to care. Tran sportation can often be a barrier to access and can increase these disparities for young people with limited resources. This program travels to the participants, removing transportation as a challenge in accessing services. Implements recovery principles: By emphasizing increased awareness and acceptance as core element of mindfulness, individuals can implement the principles that are critical to their recovery. Teaching mindfulness encourages implementation of self -actualize d, self -directed factors that are identified by the individual in recovery. Mindfulness is rooted in holistic, strength -based, person -centered, and self -directed elements - all key principles of recovery. Data collected through this pilot was drawn from t he Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) surveys and the Developmental Assets Profile (DAP). The DAP is a 58 -question survey and participants did not appear to appreciate the length of the survey nor the time it took to complete, therefore, there was l ess interest in this survey than the ERQ. 109 Advancements in Cognitive Appraisal Q#1 - When I want to feel happier, I think about something different: The Pre -survey indicated 22% reported Agree (11%) and Strongly Agree (11%). This metric improved in the p ost survey, with 73% reported Agree (55%) or Strongly Agree (18%). This could be an indicator that participants were more likely to seek optimism, which is a strong indicator for resilience. Q#5 - When I'm worried about something, I make myself think abou t it in a way that helps me feel better: In the Pre -survey, 50% reported Agree (39%) and Strongly Agree (11%) for Q#5 (When I'm worried about something, I make myself think about it in a way that helps me feel better.) This metric improved in the post surv ey, with 72% reported Agree (36%) or Strongly Agree (36%). Analysis of Q#5 indicates that participants made advancements in their ability to improve their thought processes and find ways to help themselves regulate and feel better. Q#7 - When I want to fee l happier about something, I change the way I'm thinking about it: In the Pre -survey, 33% reported Agree (28%) and Strongly Agree (6%) for Q#7 (When I want to feel happier about something, I change the way I'm thinking about it.) This metric improved in th e post survey, with 63% reported Agree (27%) or Strongly Agree (36%). Q#8 - I control my feelings about things by changing the way I think about them: In the Pre-survey, 44% reported Agree (33%) and Strongly Agree (11%) for Q#8 (I control my feelings about things by changing the way I think about them.) This metric improved in the post survey, with 73% reported Agree (45%) or Strongly Agree (27%). Advancements in Expressive Suppression Q#6 - I control my feelings by not showing them: The Pre -survey indica ted 39% reported Agree (17%) and Strongly Agree (22%) for Q#6 (I control my feelings by not showing them.) This metric improved in the post survey, with 36% reported Agree (27%) or Strongly Agree (9%). Analysis of this data indicates that participants redu ced the likelihood of suppressing their feelings through participation in MBSAT. Q#9 - When I'm feeling bad about something, I change the way I'm thinking about it: In the Pre -survey, 39% reported Agree (28%) and Strongly Agree (11%) for Q#9 (When I'm feeling bad about something, I change the way I'm thinking about it.) This metric improved in the post survey, with 45% reported Agree (36%) or Strongly Agree (9%). While this metric only slightly shifted, the results indicate youth do not feel as strongly about suppressing their emotions. Developmental Assets Profile (DAP) Findings : In the post -surveys, participants reported developmentally appropriate responses for their age range. Results indicated that a little over half (55%) the participants who complet ed the survey felt they had a family that provided them with clear rules (Q#52). Participants also reported that more than half (64%) reported their parents are good at talking with them about things 110 (Q#56). These results indicated that participants could improve in communication with their parents/caregivers. The DAP is a 58 -question survey and participants did not appear to appreciate the length of the survey nor the time it took to complete, therefore, there was less interest in this survey. MBSAT - StarVista FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served N/A 33 Total cost per client $3,184 SUCCESSES The most significant notable success of this program is seeing a shift in desire to change by the participants. So often, youth participants are barely in a contemplative stage of change. Most youth after participating in the full workshop are much closer to an active stage of change where they are actively working towards goals. This is an enormous step in improving their journey. Multiple youth reported using tools in their daily lives, showcasing their abilities when provided the encouragement and the sp ace. In addition, youth exhibited very positive bonds with group facilitators. CHALLENGES The most significant challenge has been participant consistency. Youth are often hesitant to embrace the workshop, at first, but slowly warm up to the process. If th ey don't warm up to it quickly, this can hurt their future attendance and potential growth. When youth are present, they are more often than not very engaged. Providing incentives, such as stipends, would likely increase participation and fidelity. Youth are often hesitant or resistant around filling out surveys, making tracking some outcomes difficult. Further emphasis will be placed on reliable completion and tracking of surveys. DEMOGRAPHICS No data was collected for FY 17/18 due to the program being in transition. FY 18/19 Primary Language English 97% Spanish 3% Sex Assigned at birth Male 39% Female RTAD (EL CENTRO) El Centro was still implementing Seeking Safety in FY 2017 -18 and FY 2018 -19 and began the MBSAT pilot in the fall of 2019. Therefore, program outcomes listed below are for the Seeking Safety program only. The purpose of Seeking Safety is to help at -risk individuals in the age range of 18 to 25 by providing interventions that address the impact of substance use disorder, particularly for those who have a trauma history such as Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The target population is Transition Age Y outh (TAY) who are struggling to break the cycle of substance use disorder and who are residing in urban Redwood City or rural Half Moon Bay. A significant majority percentage of the target population are bilingual households and/or whose income reflects a t or below poverty level standards. El Centro offers a 90-day treatment program that incorporates a Case Managed abstinence - based and relapse prevention model with cognitive behavior strategies that dramatically improves lives of youth. The approach to pro viding a Seeking Safety program combines weekly substance use disorder Individual Counseling and weekly Group Counseling sessions in both Half Moon Bay and Redwood City. Seeking Safety is an evidenced -based practice that focuses on environmental and trea tment solutions for substance use and Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder and relies on strong case management direction and referrals to community resources. Seeking Safety groups address the needs of this age group by utilizing a developmental framework that provides general supports for young adults, such as safety, relationship building, youth participation, community resources, and skill building. By incorporating these practices into the group framework, youth learned to build upon internal and external a ssets which are essential for a healthy transition to young adulthood. 112 Transitional Age Youth are offered information and counseling specific to the age group. The Seeking Safety curriculum was comprised of 25 topics including Safety: PTSD: Taking Back You r Power; When Substances Control You; Honesty; Asking for Help; Setting Boundaries in Relationships; Getting Others to Support Your Recovery; Healthy Relationships; of Yourself; Commitment; Respecting Your Time; Coping with Triggers; Self -Nurturing; Red and Green Flags; Detaching from Emotional Pain (Grounding); Life Choices ;and Termination., and is based on five central ideas: 1) safety as the priority, 2) integrated treatment of PTSD and substance abuse, 3) a focus on ideals, 4) identifying the four content areas of cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and case management, and 5) attention to therapist processe s. PROGRAM IMPACT El Centro utilizes a Case Managed approach that includes In -Take assessment, Treatment Plan development, Progress Notes and Discharge Planning. Client activities/participation is documented and includes group attendance (sign -in roster), topics covered, Pre/Post Test (when available), as well as Individual Counseling sessions and recommendations. The program is a 90-day program, or 12 sessions. Each group is 90 minutes each. Extended participation is recommended if needed.

A TAY client was in a very tough situation because of homeless and using methamphetamines since the age of 16. El Centro staff met him through outreach efforts at the homeless shelter where he initially signed up with us but shortly after went MIA. About 3 weeks later and he said he wanted to try again so he came back into the program and started to attend a few groups and Individual sessions. As part of his treatment goals he wanted to rebu ild his relationship with family members and hoped to be accepted back into his family that not want anything to do with him because he was still using. El Centro staff worked with him and built a plan to bring in his mother to educate and teach her about addiction and how a loved one at home could support a recovering addict. His mother agreed to be open minded when it came down to his addiction and understood that recovery is not easily obtained. She also agreed to come in to Family Fun Night with a coupl e of family members to support her son and they saw how he really wanted to make a change and was already making huge improvements. This client after 6 months in treatment is clean of any drugs and alcohol and actively participates in Recovery Services. He has also been giving a place to live at home and has been working a full-time job for the past two months. Mark is a 24 -year -old, si ngle, Hispanic male. He has multiple arrests, including felonies, which makes it difficult for him to find permanent work. He came to El Centro shortly after being released from jail to receive treatment for his addiction to Methamphetamine, Heroin, Cannab is, and alcohol. Treatment and guidance at El Centro enabled him to first attain abstinence and then recovery and sobriety from ALL drugs and alcohol. Through discussions with Mark, his counselor guided him toward the realization that he wanted to go back to college. With the assistance of the counselor, Mark signed up for college courses. While in individual counseling and Seeking Safety groups, which focused on addiction and PTSD, Mark began to build successes in other areas of his life as well. He was en couraged to re-establish his relationships with his family members, especially his mom. Through the support and referrals from his counselors (group and individual) he was also able to find permanent housing, ending his homelessness; and to find two part -time jobs. Finally, he was employed! Almost 10 months after successfully completing El Centro's outpatient program, Mark reported that he completed both his Fall and Spring courses with passing grades and is continuing in college for his second year. He als o reported that he continues to strengthen his relationships with his family, who are now his biggest support. Mark has commented multiple times that it is the encouragement, support, and guidance that he has received at El Centro that have empowered and e nabled him to build this foundation for himself. CHALLENGES There are challenges inherent in serving this population. 114 1) Since the TAY population is older than \"youth\" for the most part they are usually no longer in High School which, for those not on Probation, limits a leverage to attend. 2) While all TAY participants take a Pre -Test, a significant percentage do not make it past 6 sessions which eliminates the possibility of taking a Satisfaction Survey or Post -Test which can skew program assessment effo rts 3) Some individuals do not run willingly to engage in treatment and can be discharged prior to completion; however, re -enrollment is not unusual particularly when encouraged by Probation SKILLS Pro -Social Skills (TPS) is a ten -week program that uses \"Skill streaming\", an evidence - based, social skills training program designed to improve students' behaviors, replacing less productive ones. The purpose of TPS is to help elementary school children learn pro -social skills in order to improve their social and behavioral functioning in school. During the 2018 -19 academic school year, weekly TPS groups were held in five different San Mateo County, Human Serv ices Agency, Family Resource Centers (FRC) locations. The locations included the following schools: Taft (Redwood City), Hoover (Redwood City), Belle Haven (Menlo Park), Bayshore (Daly City), and the Puente de la Costa Sur resource center on the coast. The Teaching Pro -Social Skills program serves children at San Mateo County elementary schools where FRC services, including mental health, are provided. FRCs are available at schools that have high needs among the student population and a lack of other res ources available to the broader community. Research demonstrates that underserved students face greater academic and social struggles and benefit greatly from the opportunity to learn pro -social skills in a group that is culturally sensitive. The students at these schools, and their families, are underserved and are typically the ones referred to the TPS program. The TPS participants are able to receive an effective, social skills -based education while forming and improving relationships with their peers a nd school staff. All of the PSWs and the lead TPS Community Worker are fluent in Spanish, addressing the high proportion of Spanish speaking children and their families at the sites. PROGRAM IMPACT 115 During fiscal year 2018 -2019, from October 2018 to June 2019, ten TPS groups were provided at five HSA Family Resource Center schools with both Fall and Spring cohorts serving a total of 52 students. The following is a breakdown of the group and sites: Two (2) groups consisting of a total of 12 students at Bayshore Family Resource Center Two (2) groups consisting of a total of 11 students at Belle Haven Family Resource Cntr Two (2) groups consisting of a total of 11 students at Hoover Family Resource Center Two (2) groups consisting of a total of 9 students at Puente de la Costa Resource Center Two (2) groups consisting of a total of 9 students at Taft Family Resource Center Data about the students' classroom and playground behaviors is collected from the teachers through pre - and post -assessments. Students are assessed using a five point scale on the following skill areas: (1) Classroom Survival Skills; (2) Friendship -Making Skills; (3) Skills for Dealing with Feelings; (4) Skill Alternatives to Aggression; and (5) Skills for Dealing with Stress. The TPS pro gram demonstrated the following impacts on student participants: 1. Positive behavior changes in the classroom and on the playground, as directly observed by faculty and staff. 2. Improvements in skill area scores between the pre - and post -assessments, indicati ng significant progress for a majority of the TPS participants. Pre- and post -assessment scores demonstrated the following results: 1. Positive behavior changes were demonstrated in 93% (38 41) of skills taught. 2. Overall, there was a 27% increase in scores ac ross the 41 skills (from 2.7 to 3.4) from pre-assessment to post -assessment, indicating improved behavioral skills. Teaching Pro -Social Skills FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 56 52 Total cost per client $3,571 $3,846 SUCCESSES TPS was well received by the school teachers and administrators. During the 2018 -2019 school year, the following message was sent to a PSW from school personnel: \" [Student] has been showing lots of improvements at school and with other students. He was in a situat ion where he implemented the skill 'How to Stay out of Fights' to settle the issue and refrain from engaging.\" As a result of the positive outcomes from TPS participation reported by the school administrators, other schools have requested the service. For example, one of the administrators at Hoover school, who helped the PSW coordinate the TPS groups, transferred 116 to Roosevelt school in Redwood City and requested TPS groups at Roosevelt because she saw how it benefitted students at Hoover. CHALLENGES The full time Community Worker who was primarily responsible for leading TPS groups began employment in December 2018. Therefore, there were some logistical challenges beginning the groups in the Fall 2018 . Infrastructure has been added to supp ort the TPS team which will allow the initial implementation in the schools to be more consistent. The additional support includes monthly check -in meetings, cross -training other Community Workers to provide back -up if needed, as well as streamlining the T PS program coordination and documents. In previous years, the PSWs co -facilitated the groups. However, due to high clinical caseloads, increasing demands and greater emphasis on serving children with higher needs two Community Workers now co -facilitate th e groups with therapeutic consultation and support from the PSWs. DEMOGRAPHICS FY 17/18 Spanish 17% Another language 2% Sex Assigned for FY18 -19 included Caucasian, Latino, African American, Pacific Islander, Native American, Multi -Race and Other. Reporting template will be updated for FY19 -20 based on new MHSA requirements. PEI AGES 0 -25: EARLY CRISIS INTERVENTIONS 117 YOUTH CRISIS RESPONS E & PREVENTION The Crisis Intervention & Suicide Prevention Center (CISPC) has four main components with the sole purpose of providing crisis and suicide support to all ages of the San Mateo County community. The four compo nents include: a 24/7 Crisis Hotline, a youth website and teen chat service, outreach and training, and mental health services. The 24/7 Crisis Hotline is the only Crisis Hotline in San Mateo County, and it is run primarily by volunteers and hotline staff . The crisis hotline is an avenue of support for anyone who is in crisis, however, you do not need to be in crisis to call the hotline. Anyone can call the hotline - including people who are calling about a loved one, who just want to talk, who are looking for resources, or who are in crisis. CISPC's youth website, onyourmind.net, is a website specific to youth who want to learn more about mental health and resources in San Mateo County. There is a live -chat portion where youth can chat with trained youth volunteers. Youth utilize this service to talk about a number of different challenges, including stress at school, family or relationship problems, thoughts of suicide, concern about a friend, and more. CISPC's outreach and training involves educating the San Mateo County community on mental health and suicide prevention. CISPC staff provide psycho -educational presentations to over 5,000 elementary, middle, and high school youth on the topics of stress, healthy coping, mental health disorders, and suicide prevention. Additionally, CISPC staff also provides presentations and training to parents, school staff, agency staff, and members of the community on the topics outlined above, including cyberbullying and bullying, cultural humility, privilege, and non -suicidal self -injury. CISPC's mental health services are targeted to K -12 aged youth who live or attend school in San Mateo County. CISPC clinicians provide short -term mental health therapy to youth who are in crisis. CISPC clinicians are also able to go on -site to a school to conduct suicide risk assessments with youth to determine the level of need. PROGRAM IMPACT The CISPC program impacts the health outcomes of client served in several ways. All CISPC staff aid in reducing the stigma associated with men tal illness - this is seen through the psychoeducational presentations, work with clients in crisis, and conversations with hotline callers. Talking non -judgmentally and openly about mental illness paves the path for others to do the same, and in that the larger San Mateo county community benefit from reduced stigma of mental illness, which in turn allows for the greater community to be able to access mental health services without fear. 118 The early intervention work that CISPC does is imperative in mitigating undiagnosed mental illness from flourishing into unmanageable symptoms, which can sometimes lead to harm to self or others. All parts of the CISPC program (psychoeducational presentations, 24/7 hotline, live cha t, and clinical services) contribute to early intervention and improving access and linkage to appropriate resources. The presentations are meant for school aged youth, as well as adults in the community. Mental illness can often occur in early stages of l ife, and with the appropriate psychoeducation around healthy coping, stress management, mental health, and suicide prevention, the audience members report being more aware about mental health as well as resources in the local community. Additionally, CISP C's 24/7 crisis hotline is often times the first point of contact for many people seeking mental health services, or for those contemplating suicide. Because of its anonymity, callers find solace in being able to talk with a trained volunteer without fear of judgment. Appropriate resources and referrals are often given to callers who are open to continued help, which furthers their education around how best to support themselves (or others) when accessing mental health care.

The volunteer was able to offer support for this caller as she explained in depth the ways she feels depressed and the experiences she has had throughout her life. After talking with the volunteer for some time, they moved into discussing what the caller enjoys doing and how she pulls herself b ack during difficult times. She was able to verbally identify numerous ways of healthy coping with the volunteer, and explicitly stated how thankful she was to talk through everything she was experiencing, and how glad a service like this was available at 2am. A mother called the mental health clinician at the crisis center concerned about her adolescent son who was chronically suicidal and wanted the clinician to conduct a risk assessment with him. The mother had exhausted all other options when a school partner directed her to services. After determining that there was not an immediate danger to self, the clinician began working with the family for short term therapy. It became apparent that a large factor for the student's suicidal ideation was school. His mother reported having attempted to get educational assessments done in the past but felt as though the language and cultural barriers (they immigrated to the US over 8 years ago) had prevented the school from following through. The clinician worked wi th the mother and son to draft a formal letter of request for an Individualized Education Plan assessment. During the client's treatment, he had begun the IEP assessment process and reported that his suicidal thoughts had decreased to no thoughts of suicid e in over a month. CHALLENGES During the fiscal years 17 -18 and 18 -19 CISPC has identified lack of staff as a challenge in being able to serve the community in an efficient manner. Due to the high number of youth suicides that occurred in FY 17 -18, there w ere higher requests from the community around psychoeducational presentations as well as clinical services. There was only one designated staff person who conducts presentations, and a way CISPC had to address community need was 120 utilizing CISPC staff to co nduct youth and community presentations, even if it wasn't necessarily under their direct job duties. This ultimately put a strain on CISPC staff. During the 18 -19 fiscal year a large challenge has been ensuring that there is staff able to ensure all parts of CISPC's services are running. Due to the history of limited funding for the CISPC, one staff member is in charge of overseeing the youth peer website and teen chat component as well as the presentation component. This proved to be incredibly difficult to navigate, as presentations are typically done during the school time, and the teen chat resource is open in the evening time. EARLY INTERVENTION: EARLY CRISIS INTERVENTIONS SAN MATEO MENTAL HEA LTH AND REFERRAL TEA M (SMART) The SMART program is to prov ide San Mateo County's residents with a comprehensive assessment in the field, to offer an alternative destination to Psychiatric Emergency Services when appropriate or if needed to write a hold status and provide secure transportation to the hospital. The target population is any resident in psychiatric crisis regardless of age as identified by Law Enforcement. Primary program activities and/or interventions include consultation to law enforcement on scene. SMART can write a 5150 hold if needed and transpo rt the person to a 5150 -receiving facility. If the individual does not meet the 5150 criteria the SMART medic can provide support and transportation to an alternate destination, i.e. crisis residential facility, doctor's office, detox, shelter, home, etc. PROGRAM IMPACT SMART evaluates people in the field and able to connect people to behavioral health services that would otherwise not have occurred. Being able to transport people right on the spot to the appropriate services has increased connectivity and treatment for many community members. Many individuals are more likely to be forthcoming with a psychologically trained medic about what they are experiencing as compared to reporting to law enforcement. SMART medics are able to evaluate both physical and mental health issues including suicidal ideation and direct people to the appropriate resources. SMART responds to many people under 18 who are in crisis - often peer related problems in school. By addressing the youth's concerns and getting supportive and protective factors in place the youth is much more likely to remain in school. Getting supportive services to the youth's family helps the family unit to stay intact. SMART responds to many homeless severely mentally ill adults. By getting them evaluated and getting the right level of medications and placements this assist in reducing homelessness. SMART's first goal is to divert 10 % of calls where a 5150 was not already placed. AMR has succeeded in surpassing this goal. 121 FY 18 -19 AMR diverted 35.7% in th e first quarter,47.9% in the second quarter, 53.3% in the third quarter, 47.7 in the fourth quarter. SMART's second goal is to respond to 75% of appropriate calls for service. In FY 18 -19 AMR responded to 76.9% in the first quarter and 76.6% in the second quarter, 73.1% in the third quarter, 67.3% in the fourth quarter. SMART FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total calls per client $51 $56 SUCCESSES/CHALLENGES SMART identifies that a consistent success has been that since 2005 the program has and continues to assist many community members in receiving the proper services out in the field through AMR trained response. A noteworthy challenge has been to have law enforcement wait to write the 5150 holds b efore SMART arrives to do a thorough assessment. This is being addressed by continuing education of law enforcement. EARLY INTERVENTION : EARLY ONSET OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROG RAM - (RE)MIND The Early Psychosis Program (formerly PREP) and now (re)MIND is a program of the Felton Institute that specializes in early intervention for psychotic disorders. The Felton (re)MIND program delivers comprehensive treatment grounded in wellness, recovery and resilience to youth and young adults experie ncing early symptoms of psychosis. By intervening early with evidence -based, culturally responsive, and comprehensive assessment and treatment the Felton Early Psychosis Program is transforming the perception and impact of psychosis so that most cases of s chizophrenia spectrum disorders detected in the earliest stages are treated to remission. Individuals served regardless of insurance status include : Residents of San Mateo County between the ages of 14 and 35 -and- Identified as being at risk for the development of psychosis (having subthreshold symptoms that do not meet justification for a diagnosis OR having a first degree relative with a history of psychosis AND a recent significant decline in age appropriate functioning) -or- Have developed psychosis for the first time in the past two years The Felton (re)MIND Program provides a wide array of services designed to wrap around the individual, and their family members involved in treatment. Services begin with an outreach 122 and education campaign to help community members and providers to detect early warning signs. Once an individual has been identified and referred to the program, they receive a comprehensive, diagnostic assessment to determine their diagnosis to identify early intervention services. Following assessment, individuals participate in assessment feedb ack session(s) where they receive psychoeducation on diagnosis and treatment options. Besides early diagnosis, program services include: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp) Algorithm -guided medication management Peer and family Support Serv ices Psychoeducational Multifamily Groups (MFG) Supported Employment and Education using the Individual Placement and Support model Strength -based care management Access to computerized cognitive remediation training Community -building activities such (ex . program orientation for new participants) Graduation ceremony to acknowledge accomplishments and positive transitions PROGRAM IMPACT The Felton (re)MIND Program served 62 youth and young adults during FY 18/19 achieving the following outcomes: Hospitali zation reduction: A consistent 32 participants were enrolled for at least 12 months in FY 18/19. Out of 16 participants with prior hospitalizations within 12 months of enrollment, 14 (88%) experienced a reduction in acute hospitalization episodes and days hospitalized within the first 12 months of engagement into early psychosis services. Out of 16 participants with no prior hospitalization history, 11 (69%) continued to have no hospitalizations within the first 12 months of engagement into early psychosis services. Employment and education engagement: Of 32 participants enrolled for at least 12 months, 28 (88%) were engaged in part -time or full -time school or work during their first year of treatment. Medication Adherence: Initial and most recent annual ANSAs were used to evaluate medication adherence for 32 participants who have been enrolled for at least 12 months. Medication Adherence was assessed on the ANSA domain for Medication Compliance (ratings 0 through 3; with 0 indicating no need for im provement and 3 indicating highest need for improvement). Of these 32 participants, 22 (69%) either improved or maintained high medication adherence with an ANSA score of 1 or 0. 123 Symptom Reduction: Symptoms were rated on the ANSA domains for Psychosis and Depression (ratings 0 through 3; with 0 indicating no symptom presence and 3 indicating highest symptom severity). Out of 32 participants, 22 (69%) demonstrated an improvement or maintained low symptom severity (rating 1 or lower) in psychosis and 22 (69%) demonstrated an improvement or maintained low symptom severity (rating 1 or lower) in depression. Service Satisfaction: For service satisfaction surveyed in May 2019, of the 8 participants (3 Adults, 3 Family, 2 Youth) who completed this survey, 8(100%) e xceeded the 3.5 needed for the Satisfaction Scale to indicate satisfaction with the program. Satisfaction scores ranged from 3.667 to 5. RE (MIND) FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 110 62 Total cost per client $7,441 $13,201 SUCCESSES Multi -Family Group (MFG): As the program experienced the transition from the end of one cohort and the launching of another group of families and participants that engaged in the structured problem -solving intervention that is MFG. One of the greatest inte nded strengths of the MFG intervention is the community that develops between group members over the course of treatment. For the cohort that completed their year -long commitment to the group process, this sense of community was the strongest that this pro gram had ever seen. In fact, once they completed the group's 1 -year attendance, the group members themselves opted to carry forward the group process in each other's homes and to maintain their commitment to one another. Being a part of this process was aw e-inspiring and refreshing for staff and served to fuel the desire to repeat this process with new cohorts of families. CHALLENGES The Felton (re)MIND Program experienced two primary challenges in Fiscal Year 18/19. The first of which has already been ref erenced in Outcome Data: Service Satisfaction regarding the low return/completion rates of semi -annual surveys. The second is related to having one vacant clinical staff position for many months which contributed to developing a waitlist for assessment int o the program. 124 1% Sex Assigned at birth Male 63% 37% Sexual Orientation Straight or heterosexual 71% Bisexual 5% Questioning or unsure 11% Another sexual Decline to state 8% Gender Identity Male/Man/Cisgender 63% Chronic health condition 1.5% Learning disability 8% I do not have a disability 80% Another disability 1.5% Unknown 6% Veteran No 98% Decline to state 2% 125 EARLY INTERVENTION : PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PRIMARY CARE INTERFACE Primary Care Interface focuses on identifying persons in need of behavioral health services in the primary care setting. BHRS clinicians are embedded in primary care clinics to facilitate referrals, perform assessments, and refer to appropriate b ehavioral health services if deemed necessary. The model utilizes essential elements of the IMPACT model to identify and treat individuals in primary care who do not have Serious Mental Illness (SMI) and are unlikely to seek services from the formal mental health system. Primary Care Interface FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 1134 863 Total cost per client $997 $1,310 PREVENTION : COMMUNITY OUTREACH, ENGAGEMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING OFFICE OF DIVERSITY AND EQUITY (ODE) The Mental Health Services Act provided dedicated funding to address cultural competence and access to mental health services for underserved communities; in San Mateo County this led to the formal establishment of the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) in 2009. ODE advances health equity in behavioral health outcomes of marginalized communities. Demonstrating a commitment to understanding and addressing how health disparities, health inequities, and stigma impact an individual's ability to access and re ceive behavioral health and recovery services, ODE works to promote cultural humility and inclusion within the County's behavioral health service system and in partnerships with communities through the following programs: Health Equity Initiatives Health Ambassador Program Adult Mental Health First Aid Digital Storytelling & Photovoice Stigma Free San Mateo - Be the ONE Campaign San Mateo County Suicide Prevention Committee (SPC) 126 PROGRAM IMPACT The Office of Diversity and Equity measures progress along these 5 indicators. These definitions are influenced by (1) public health frameworks and (3) ODE's mission, values and strategy. 1. Self-Empowerment - enhanced sense of control and ownership of the d ecisions that affect your life 2. Community Advocacy - increased ability of a community (including peers and family members*) to influence decisions and practices of a behavioral health system that affect their community 3. Cultural Humility heightened self -awar eness of community members' culture impacting their behavioral health outcomes heightened responsiveness of behavioral health programs and services for diverse cultural communities serve 4. Access to Treatment/Prevention Programs (Reducing Barriers) - enhanced knowledge, skills and ability to navigate and access behavioral health treatment and prevention programs despite potential financial, administrative, social and cultural barriers. 5.

DEMOGRAPH ICS Demographics for ODE programs are included in each individual report's section. HEALTH EQUITY INITIA TIVES (HEI) The Health Equity Initiative (HEI) strategy addresses access and quality of care issues among underserved, unserved, and inappropriately served communities. ODE provides oversight to nine Health Equity Initiatives (HEIs) representing specific ethnic and cultural communities that have been historically margina lized: African American Community Initiative, Chinese Health Initiative, Filipino Mental Health Initiative, Latino Collaborative , Native and Indigenous Peoples Initiative, Pacific Islander Initiative, PRIDE Initiative , Spirituality Initiative, and the Dive rsity and Equity Council. HEIs are comprised of San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services staff, community -based health and social service agencies, partners from other County agencies, clients and their family members, and community members. HEIs are typically managed by two co-chairs, including BHRS staff and/or a community agency or leader. HEIs implement activities throughout San Mateo County that are intended to: Decrease stigma Educate and empower community members Support wellness and recover y Build culturally responsive services Through presentations, events, and trainings the HEIs reached the following number of people: Health Equity Initiatives FY 17/18 FY 18/19 129 Total clients served 2500 2800 Total cost per client $53 $47 DIVERSITY AND EQUITY COUNCIL (DEC) The Diversity and Equity Council (DEC) works to ensure that topics concerning diversity, health disparities, and health equity are reflected in the work of San Mateo County 's mental health and substance use services. The formation of the DEC can be traced back to 1998 when staff members formed the Cultural Competence Committee. This committee later became the Cultural Competence Council in 2009, which played an integral role in the formation of ODE. Mission, Vision, & Objectives The Council serves as an advisory board to assure BHRS policies are designed and implemented in a manner that strives to decrease health inequalities and increase access to services. Highlights & Acco mplishments In FY 17/18 the DEC reviewed the BHRS C ultural Competence Policy before each of two rounds of Quality Management editing (in Q1 and beginning of Q2 \u2014October). DEC feedback was incorporated into the policy which guided the way cultural competenc e was integrated into BHRS processes and teams. The group provided feedback to BHRS regarding implementation of CLAS, as well as language access policy. Co-chairs invited Board of Supervisors staff to meetings to build a bridge between its members and legi slative staff. Members provided feedback on the MHSA demographics form to ensure inclusive wording for communities served. They also provided feedback regarding barriers they have faced regarding enacting their cultural competence plans. Co-chairs attempted to provide more tangible skill -building opportunities that could increase the effectiveness of those in the room as they lead their programs and/or Initiatives. Lina Mira from Puente, one of the regular attendees, provided a presentatio n on a topic that has been identified as an area of challenge: outreach to isolated communities. Co-chairs used printed resources and small -group conversations to share tips for effective facilitation and outreach. With help from the Pride Center, the gro up created a forum to discuss the practice of using pronouns for introduction in hopes that members will spread this practice upon gaining a better understanding of it. Attendees expressed interest in the topic and indicated it was useful and new informati on for many. Attendees also named the DEC as a \"safe\" space in which they felt comfortable asking \"the stupid questions.\" In FY 18/19 4 clinicians have engaged the DEC through the South Asian Workgroup, made up of Health staff from different divisions who tabled together at a South Asian community event 130 (Holi) on 3/17 and reached 35 community members at the event. These clinicians are interested in applying cultural humility in their work and are currently gathering data on service usage and language acces s disparities related to the communities their communities. The clinicians heard about the DEC through an ODE presentation at a clinical meeting and elected to form their own group associated with the DEC. This indicates that ODE's work and the DEC's work is spreading and that there are additional champions in other parts of County Health. Through the Arab Workgroup's effort, 27 people came together to watch Soufra , a film on healing, at Westmoor High. They learned about the challenge of outreach in communities they're not yet familiar with. The Soufra event had many fewer attendees than expected even though it did get a lot of event RSVPs. 10 attendees had never en countered ODE's work before. 13 attendees reported willingness to take action based on the film, including \"volunteer with Arab Work Group,\" \"connect with other Middle Eastern clinicians,\" and \"learn how I can be an ally.\" 62% of attendees indicated they h ad experienced stress from living in the Bay Area as a Middle Eastern or Arabic -speaking person. This indicates that this marginalized community likely has a need not yet met by BHRS services. The DEC is continuing to explore the depth and details of this need. Again, through the Arab Workgroup, the DEC took Photovoices made in a FY17 -18 CSIP Intern project to community events and sparked conversation about wellness in Arab communities. At least 50 people stopped to look at them and talk more about what the y meant with viewers making comments like \"I've never seen this for us before\" or \"This is important\" or sharing their own stories of mental illness or thoughts of suicide or losses to suicide with the tablers. The Photovoices were also featured in a faceb ook live stream viewed by 300 people during the Westmoor Breakfast on 5/19/19. This is slowly decreasing stigma related to behavioral wellness in the local Arab community. AFRICAN -AMERICAN COM MUNITY INITIATIVE (A ACI) African American Community Initiative (AACI) efforts began in 2007 and were led by African American BHRS staff members committed to: increasing the number of African American clinicians working within BHRS; improving the cultural sensitivity of clinicians to better serve the African American community; and empowering African Americans to advocate for equality and access to mental health services. The AACI works towards these goals by providing support and information about mental health and recovery services to BHRS clients and San Mateo Count y residents. Mission, Vision, and Objectives 131 The AACI has defined its vision as working to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for African Americans in San Mateo County and has identified the following objectives as necessary steps toward s achieving this vision: Awareness : Increase overall community awareness and involvement of community members in African American Community Initiative Utilization/Access: Increase knowledge and utilization of mental health services of BHRS among African American community members in San Mateo County. Education/Training: Act as liaison between African American community and BHRS, assisting in linkage to services such as Black Infant Health and community trainings such as Mental Health First Aid, Photo Voice, and Applied Suicide Prevention. Employment: To advocate for the staffing of at least one African American clinician or peer - support provider (MFT, LCSW, and other providers) in each Community Service Areas of San Mateo County 's Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. Research: To provide feedback and inform San Mateo County BHRS regarding African American community as result of surveying through the Office of Consumer Affairs, focus groups, and community -based research. Outreach: Conduct at least one annual community -based event, such as in celebration of Black History Month, Juneteenth, or Kwanzaa to build support of AACI and to reach out tothe African American community. Partnership : Partner with other organizations and health equity initiati ves from the Office of Diversity and Equity to support AACI and AA clients and professionals as well as other diverse groups; link and collaborate with other entities that work in various capacities with African American community members. Highlights & Accomplishments One of the goals of The African American Community Initiative is to increase collaborative efforts with other HEI's in order to identify the health needs of communities of color and ultimately decrease disparities for communities of color. In October 2017 The African American Community supported the Spirituality Initiative by finding entertainment for the National Day of Prayer event. AACI was able to secure a gospel soloist for the National Day of Prayer. In addition, AACI tabled at the event to provide information about the initiative and recruit more members. Black History Month events in 2017 & 2018 focused on the mental wellness of African Americans of all ages. It acknowledge the chronic stress of racism and that everyday family challenges (such as securing resources, family stability) can add even more stress. The Initiative 132 offered workshops and activities that provided coping strategies for the whole family to mitigate stress. Participants remarked that the workshops and speakers were very helpfu l and meaningful. The event planning began in the annual AACI strategic planning facilitated by Leanna Lewis. The Initiative also conducted a member satisfaction survey, which offered insight into what members liked and disliked about AACI, recommendatio ns for improvements, and suggestions on future directions for the Initiative. As a result of this survey and other efforts by the co- chairs, the Initiative is able to prioritize goals for AACI based on what members want, which will lead to greater alignmen t with and impact for the community served. In FY 17-18 over 230 community members participated in AACI events. In FY 18-19, AACI participated in and/or hosted the following activities: Black History Month Celebration Intergeneration Dinner: Black Queer Pride (collaboration with Pride Center) Hosted Origins of African American Health Disparities provider training led by Leanna Lewis Hosted Unconscious Bias and Black Mental Health: Implications for the Mental Health of African American Communities , provider training led by Leanna Lewis 5 tabling opportunities 2 church -based psycho -education presentations CHINESE HEALTH INITI ATIVE (CHI) The Chinese Health Initiative (CHI) efforts began in 2007 by San Mateo BHRS staff members who were committed to providing and advocating for culturally and linguistically accessible and responsive services within the San Mateo County Health System. By collaborating with partners, conducting community outreach, and providing service referrals, CHI members work to empowe r Chinese residents to seek services for mental health and substance use issues. Mission, Vision, and Objectives The Chinese Health Initiative works to improve engagement and utilization of BHRS mental health and substance abuse services among the Chinese community. In order to ensure the services Chinese clients, receive are culturally -sensitive and appropriate, CHI works to increase provider capacity to serve Chinese clients by advocating for the hiring of Chinese staff who are able to reflect the cultur e and language needs of Chinese clients. Much of CHI's work is focused on reducing the stigma associated with seeking services for mental health issues and accessing care. Recognizing a need for targeted community outreach and engagement, CHI advocated 133 and received funding for a Chinese Outreach Worker position which has since been funneled into a contract with an outside agency. The Chinese Health Initiative has a one -year plan focused on three goals: Referring behavioral services to unique 60 Chinese speakers in 2019 Piloting a youth empowerment program by the end of FY 18 -19 Recruiting 5 new community members to volunteer/attend at CHI events/meetings Highlights & Accomplishments During FY 17-18 Chinese Health Initiative (CHI) created public spaces where members of the community, BHRS staff and other residents could feel comfortable openly talking about issues they would normally prefer to talk about in a private setting, namely immigration and suicide. With the opportunity to elevate these voices, community members feel more confident and less anxious about these issues. CHI outreach volunteers continued bridging Chinese Hospital patients to mental health care as primary care providers continued making mental health referrals. CHI continues to raise awareness about their work through outreach, tabling events and relationships with NAMI Chinese, Project Sentinel and Supervisor David Canepa's office. One such collaboration resulted in an Open Mic events with FMHI in South San Francisco to reduce mental health stigma. Approximately 70 people attended this event and 10 people shared their own stories and poems focused on hope, recovery and resilience. In FY 18/19 CHI achieved Goal 1, referring 60 unique Chinese -speakers to behavioral health services via the North County Outreach Collaborative (NCOC) Chinese outreach contract and Peter Shum's placement at the Chinese Hospital. CHI achieved Goal 2, piloti ng a youth empowerment program, through existing connections at Mills High School and by developing buy-in with students. CHI achieved Goal 3, recruiting 5 new members, by selecting tabling events intentionally and leveraging the co-chairs' networks outsid e of BHRS. CHI participated in multiple tabling events with attendance around 100 -200 people. At some events, CHI partnered with other HEIs, such as with FMHI at the PRIDE celebration, and with all other HEIs at the Solidarity event in Fall 2018. Seven to ten members participated in developing and translating a Wellness Survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese to assess needs in areas with dense Chinse populations. The survey was distributed in 2019 and the results will be used in planning 2019 -2020 priorities as well as to solicit further data at different outreach events. On July 11, 2019, the Chinese Health Initiative also held a strategic planning session during a meeting, allowing members to provide input on how the budget should be used for th e next 134 two fiscal years. In December 2018, the co -chairs solicited additional member feedback and applied it to last six months of the fiscal year. In FY 17-18 CHI members completed the following activities: Sing Tao Expo - approximately 30 attendees RUN2 fundEducation - approximately 10 attendees Millbrae Library Storytime in Mandarin - approximately 20 attendees Health Care Rights & Immigration Forum for the Chinese Community to educate Chinese community and reduce anxiety around complicated topics of health care and immigration rights (80 in-person, 250+ via Facebook Live) In FY 18-19 CHI members completed the following activities: North County Outreach Collaborative outreach worker position operational 6 tabling events AANHPI Proclamation at Board of Supervisors (collaboration with FMHI and PII) Peer support group at Mills High School (CSIP project) FILIPINO MENTAL HEAL TH INITIAT IVE (FMHI) The Filipino Mental Health Initiative (FMHI) formed as a result of a series of focus groups conducted in 2005 by San Mateo County BHRS. During these focus groups, community members, providers, and staff members discussed issues pertaining to men tal health, stigma, and barriers to accessing care among Filipinos living in San Mateo County. Following these focus groups, in 2006 interested members formed a group with funds made available from the Mental Health Services Act to support Filipino familie s not yet connected to services. In 2010, FMHI was formally established as one of ODE 's nine Health Equity Initiatives. Mission, Vision, & Objectives The FMHI seeks to improve the well-being of Filipinos in San Mateo County by reducing the stigma associate d with mental health issues, increasing access to services, and empowering the community to advocate for their mental health. The FMHI works to connect individuals to appropriate health, mental health, and social services through community outreach and engagement. By collaborating and working with providers, the FMHI also works to ensure that culturally appropriate services are available to Filipino residents. Highlights & Accomplishments In FY 17-18 FMHI intentionally partnered with political officials and strengthened their collaborations with other HEIs. This included forming a partnership with the Daly City Youth Health Center to fund Sala Talks mural project for LGBTQ API Youth. FMHI gave 4 community presentations reaching over 225 people. 135 In FY18 -19, FMHI deepened connection to cultural values. In particular, the Initiative focused on kapwa (\"togetherness\") by identifying, appreciating, and leveraging the different strengths of the co-chairs, members, and partners throughout the community. In part, this was accomplished by two retreats, one focused on FMHI and the other focused on the planned community center, as well as a core meeting survey to assess strengths and challenges. 60% of active members are from the community, only 10% are BHRS staff or contractors. FMHI submitted an MHSA Innovations fund proposal to create a social enterprise that incorporates a youth wellness program and cultural arts center, currently titled KultureArts. The Initiative founded the TRIBE Advisory, a group of members dedicated to the social enterprise. As part of that effort, TRIBE contributed towards an ongoing needs assessment that will help structure this effort, to be community -informed. Planning and executing the needs assessment required members and suppo rters to come together to determine the focus of the assessment questions and to outreach to the community to acquire data needed to support or shift what the Initiative has proposed. The co-chairs were invited twice to do presentations on FMHI's social enterprise planning and building power in community to address social issues in a sociology class at Skyline College. The first class had more than 20 students; nearly 80% of whom focused their final projects on creating programs or solutions to tackle menta l health issues in the Filipinx community as a result of the presentation. This early exposure to mental health challenges can help develop the next generation of community advocates and leaders in mental health. FMHI members consulted with Filipinx commun ity members in Solano County and helped that group create their own FMHI -Solano in Spring 2019. This is now the second FMHI group inspired by FMHI -SMC; FMHI -SF still communicates with the SMC founders as well. This exchange has opened the doors for trans -Bay collaborations (with FMHI -SF and FMHI -Solano) to address mental health community issues within Fil-Am communities on a systems level. FMHI also experimented with providing stipends to members for their service. A clear set of requirements or standards was established and members that met the standard by the end of the fiscal year were provided with a $50 gift card. This was an experimental step towards compensation for some of the effort that goes into operating an HEI. In FY16 -17, FMHI participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: LGBTQ+ API Youth Mixer (15 attendees) Suicide Prevention Month social media campaign on suicide prevention in which FMHI authored post on Filipinos and risk factors Colma Parol -Making event Health Rights & Immigration Forum LGBTQ+ API Youth Mural 136 In FY18 -19, FMHI participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: Created TRIBE Advisory group to work on KultureArts community center development Hosted 3 events, co -hosted 2 additional events Hosted 3 provider trainings Tabled at 4 events Hosted 2 community psycho -education trainings Led 1 communication campaign LATINO COLLABORATIVE While the Latino Collaborative (LC) efforts began in 2008, its founding members have been committed to giving voice to the Latino community since the late 1980s. During these initial meetings, a small group of Latino providers met informally to address issues pertaining to health disparities and access within the Latino community and San Mateo County mental health services. These meetings continued and in 2004, a core group of Latino providers requested a Latino -specific training for providers. At the time the County did not have the funds to provide the requested training. As a result, Latino providers organized regular meetings for San Mateo BHRS providers to come together to discuss client cases and strategies for serving the Latino population. Mission, Vision, & Objectives The Latino Collaborative 's mission includes critically exploring the social, cultural, and historical perspectives of Latino residents within San Mateo County. The Latino Collaborative gives a voice to the Latino community by working together to support mind, body, soul and healthcare practices that are culturally appropriate. The Latino Collaborative has defined its mission as: Creating stronger, safer, and more resilient families through holistic practices. Promoting stigma -free environments. Providing fair access to health and social services, independent of health insurance cove rage. Appreciating and respecting traditional practices. Recognizing and incorporating Latino history, culture, and language into BHRS Highlights & Accomplishments In Fy17 -18 the Latino Collaborative welcomed several presenters sharing local resources into its meetings. Because the majority of members have direct contact with the community via direct 137 services or outreach and prevention, these informational presentations can impact services. Presentations included: Project Sentinel on affordable housing The Chicana/Latina Foundation on women's empowerment Catholic Charities on immigration policies San Mateo County 's Environmental Health Dept. on healthy homes In recognition of the fear and concern resulting from federal politics, the Latino Colla borative spearheaded the Solidarity Event for family unity in August 2018 focused on family separation at the US southern border. 45 people attended. Names were not collected due to the nature of the event (focused on undocumented families) but anecdotally , most attendees were not familiar faces to the organizers. The HEIs worked together to put on this event. Evaluation data collected by responses written on posters in the room indicated that most folks identified at Latina/o/x, enjoyed the event, and came with family. Speakers included a Japanese man whose family was separated at Tanforan during WWII. This was the first all-HEI collaboration in a while and there is great desire for more connection between HEIs and their co-chairs. The Latino Collaborative also led an HEI co-chair social hosted at the Pride Center which allowed co-chairs to get to know each other better and build more trust for easier collaboration. The event was a Rosca, building on Latinx cultural traditions. It was well- attended, with all HEIs represented. The LC began partnering with the Office of Sustainability to highlight environmental justice issues and how they affect the Latinx community. The LC provided feedback on a Spanish -language Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) presentation from Pride Center staff member Andres Loyola. Her presentation will be refined based on LC feedback and ultimately contribute to a community presentat ion on SOGI that can help reduce stigma and mental health burden for LGBTQ+ Latinx community members. In FY17 -18, the LC participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: San Mateo County's annual Latino Health Forum: Sana Sana, Colita de Ra na, 75 people attended . This event focused on stories of hope and resiliency, there were presentations provided on immigration, dealing with community stress, and access to community resources. Bystander Intervention Training 3/29/2018 Rosca Provider train ing In FY18 -19, the LC participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: 138 Hosted annual Sana Sana, Colita de Rana - approximately 150 attendees Hosted Family Unity solidarity event - approximately 50 attendees Hosted 1 staff training Tabled at 2 events Hosted 2 community psycho -education events Drumming and Spirituality as a Method of Healing and Recovery (collaboration with NIPI and Spirituality ) NATIVE AMERICAN INIT IATIVE (NAI) The Native and Indigenous Peoples Initiative (NIPI) is one of the newer Health Equity Initiatives, established in 2012. Inherent to their work is building appreciation and respect for Native American and indigenous history, culture, and spiritual healing practices. Mission, Vision, & Objective NIPI has defined its mission as generating a comprehensive revival of the Native American and indigenous community by raising awareness through health education and outreach events which honor culturally appropriate traditional healing practices. NIPIs vision is to provide support and build a safe environment for the Native American and indigenous communit ies. NIPIs goal is to appreciate and respect indigenous history, culture, spiritual, and healing practices. The NIPI strives to reduce stigma, provide assistance in accessing health care, and establish ongoing training opportunities for behavioral health staff and community partners. The NIPI has further developed and articulated the following objectives: Increase Awareness: Improve visibility of the challenges faced by Native Americans and indigenous people and provide support for indigenous communities . Outreach and Education: Outreach to and educate San Mateo County employees and community partners on how better to serve indigenous communities. Welcome and Support: Welcome community members, clients, consumers, and family. Assist individuals in accessing and navigating the San Mateo County health care system. Strengthen our Community : Provide opportunities for Native Americans and indigenous peoples to strengthen their skills and create collaboration for guidance, education, and celebration of indigenous communities. Highlights & Accomplishments 139 The NIPI has not only provided mental health resources to San Mateo County residents but has also contributed to the professional development of San Mateo BHRS providers through trainings and workshops Initiative members have organized. In collaboration with the Latino Collaborative and the Spirituality Initiative, NIPI hosted a Drumming Circle training facilitated by Dr. Nunez, a leading proponent of using drumming to help those with behavioral health issues. Many different segments of the community participated in this event. Several participants said that it had a \"calming \" effect upon them and that they had not realized how drumming speaks to all human beings. Again, it is a tool for recovery and was a portent for trying different ways of treating those with mental illness. It was also a way that three of the HEIs worked together to bring a significant event to San Mateo County and to BHRS. NIPI has also hosted a dialogue on inclusion of Two -Spirt identity on demographics forms, helped to facilitate the Day of Prayer, PRIDE and Recovery Month events, supported the CH video discussion and name change conversations in the county. In FY17 -18, NAI participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: 1st SMC Indigen ous Peoples Day in EPA Provider training In FY18 -19, NIPI participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: Provider training - Native American Mental Health: Historical trauma and healing practices Provider training - Overcoming Trauma Through Digital Story: Telling, Healing & Walking Down the Red Road 2nd Annual Indigenous Peoples Day in East Palo Alto Drumming and Spirituality as a Method of Healing and Recovery (collaboration with LC and Spiritua lity) PACIFIC ISLANDER INI TIATIVE (PII) The Pacific Islander Initiative (PII) was initially formed by community members and BHRS staff in 2006 after a needs assessment conducted in 2005 identified particular areas of need among Pacific Islanders living in San Mateo County. The PII focuses on addressing health disparities within the Pacific Islander community by working to make services accessible and culturally - appropriate and by increasing awareness of and connections to existing mental and behavioral health services. Mission, Vision, & Objectiv es 140 The PII's mission is to raise awareness of mental health issues in the Pacific Islander community to address the stigma associated with mental illness and substance abuse. The PII envisions a healthy community that feels supported by service providers, is accepting of individuals experiencing mental illness or substance abuse challenges and is knowledgeable of the various resources and services that are available to address mental and behavioral health needs. The goals and objectives of the PII are orga nized according to four pillars identified by members: Service Accessibility Sustainability & Funding Mental Health Career Pipeline Community Partnership Highlights & Accomplishments FY 17-18 Highlights include: PI provider trainings Facilitating Journe y to Empowerment and Deconstructing Gender Roles in the Pacific Islander Community conversations Supporting National Day of Prayer by having 8 members sing a Tongan Hymn \"Eiki koe 'Ofa ' a au\", a traditional Weslyn hymn most Tongans know. Additionally, work with Jenn Awa, a consultant, has produced much needed dialogue and a lens that has helped the initiative translate its needs for the county. Her expertise and experience have begun to help the Initiative chairs be more cognizant of how to have the mos t impact with measuring tools to illustrate PII's impacts. The 2018 Strategic Planning Meeting, facilitated by Alisi Tulua, kicked off a new era of the Initiative. Fresh and staid partners alike gathered to discuss their hopes and goals for the Pacific Islander Initiative. Several partners who had purposefully disengaged from the group after losing trust in its leadership were able to return, speak about their experiences, and commit to re-engaging. With this tone shift, PII embarked on a year of long -term planning, building a comprehensive five-year plan that includes a youth leadership and mental health career pipeline program (PIONEER). PII also changed its meeting time from 6pm to 11am and began using a rotational schedule that brings the meeting to each region with many PIs (North, Central, and EPA) once per quarter. Each regional meeting is hosted by one of the three large organizations serving Pacific Islanders in that area (Asian American Recovery Services, Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center, and One East Palo Alto). The group gained 10 new members. Trust, engagement, and collaboration has greatly increased over the course of the past 12-18 months. 141 The Pacific Islander Initiative engaged with community members directly through 9 events and communit y trainings this year. PII tabled at one event, provided three psycho -education trainings, and hosted five Heal & Paint sessions in collaboration with community organizations. Following the popular One Life, One Love suicide prevention event in May 18, PII has continued to focus on reducing stigma and increasing awareness about suicide in Pacific Islander communities. As follow -up actions to the event, the Initiative created a suicide prevention communication campaign specific to Pacific Islanders, which has been shared on social media more than 300 times and viewed by more than 5,000 people. The group also began planning 'Olunga He Kaliloa, a culturally -rooted oral history project about experiences of suicide and loss. PRIDE INITIATIVE The PRIDE Initiative was founded in April 2007 and was one of the first LGBTQ focused efforts in San Mateo County. The Initiative is comprised of individuals concerned about the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and intersex individuals (LGBTQQI). Mission, Vision, & Objectives The PRIDE Initiative has defined its mission as being committed to fostering a welcoming environment for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and intersex (LGBTQQI or LGBTQ+) communi ties living and working in San Mateo County through an interdisciplinary and inclusive approach. The Initiative collaborates with individuals, organizations, and providers working to ensure services are sensitive and respectful of LGBTQ+ issues. PRIDE envi sions an inclusive future in San Mateo County grounded in equality and parity for LGBTQ+ communities across the County. PRIDE objectives have been defined as: Engage LGBTQ+ communities. Increase networking opportunities among providers. Provide workshops, educational events, and materials that improve care of LGBTQ+. Assess and address gaps in care. Highlights & Accomplishments FY 17 -18 accomplishment include, 6th annual Pride Celebration, developing the SOGI training curriculum, SF Pride event and TDOR bio s. In March of 2019, over 30 community members including Dana Johnson, PRIDE Initiative Co - Chair wore purple in solidarity and support of the Pride Center and caravanned to Sacramento to attend the presentation to the Mental Health Oversight and Accountab ility Commission. The Pride Center presented a wonderful presentation of their services and was provided a 2 -year 142 extension. Earlier in the year the PRIDE Initiative submitted a support letter for the San Mateo Pride Center, to the Mental Health Oversigh t and Accountability Commission -Sacramento for a 2-year extension of time and funding. In June of 2019, Co -Chair Dana Johnson marched in Supervisor David Canepa 's contingency at the San Francisco Pride Parade. In FY18 -19, PRIDE participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: 2nd Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) (collaboration with LGBTQ Commission) - approximately 80 attendees 7th Annual San Mateo Pride Celebration - 800 attendees Staff trainings: Pride Initiative presentation to Probation Staff Tabled at: HEI Internship -Amazing Dialogue, San Mateo County Fair -Pride Day, Staff Health Fair at the Medical Center SPIRITUALITY INITIAT IVE (SI) The Spirituality Initiative (SI) began in 2009, and works to foster opportunities for clients, providers, and community members to explore the relationship that spirituality has with mental health, substance use, and treatment. Mission, Vision, & Objectives The SI envisions a health system that embraces and integrates spirituality when working with clients, families, and communities. They have defined three core principles that guide their work: Hope. The Spirituality Initiative recognizes that hope is the simplest yet most powerful tool in fostering healing. Inclusiveness. The Spirituality Initiative acknowl edges that spirituality is a personal journey and that individuals should not be excluded from services based on their spiritual beliefs and practices. Cultural humility . The Spirituality Initiative encourages an attitude of respect and openness in order to create a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone. Highlights & Accomplishments In FY 17 -18 the Spirituality initi ative began developing a partnership with Mission Hospice and Home Care. They also continued to participate in two state wide phone -ins t hat occur monthly. The annual National Day of Prayer event gathers people of all faiths, religions, and understandings to celebrate the presence of all segments of the community and call their attention to those with behavioral health issues. Regarding improvements to the event, one faith leader said: \" just keep doing what you are doing as it is important for the community. \" 143 The event increases awareness about mental health issues in faith communities and establishes the Spirituality Initiative as a willing collaborator and ready resource. Ongoing spirituality trainings \u201410 completed in FY18 -19\u2014continue to educate and challeng e SMC BHRS clinicians to be open to listening and including spirituality in the recovery of those whom they serve. As found in SI's survey several years ago, 80% of the clients in SMC have expressed that spirituality is paramount to their recovery. Howev er, only half expressed that they felt welcomed to discuss such a matter with their clinician. The Initiative narrows that gap via trainings for providers. The trainings have advanced the discussions about spirituality and how clinicians can incorporate i t into care in BHRS clinics and programs. The Initiative's monthly meetings have become a hub for faith leaders, community advocates, and BHRS staff interested in spirituality and mental health. Presentations included: ODE/Annette Pakhchian and Reverend Terri: LGBTQ+ experiences with faith and religion Heart and Soul: Seeing Through Stigma peer panel AACI/ Isaac Fredericks (faith leader & BHRS clinician): Black History Month and the significance of African Americans in the USA Stanford School of Medicine: WELL for Life research project Health Policy and Planning: elections and social determinants of health Mission Hospice: Engaging Grief ODE Storytelling Program/Siavash Zohoori: Cultural Humility Video Series Help One Child: presentation of nonpro fit with mission to serve at -risk children and families In FY16 -17, SI participated and/or hosted the following events and activities: National Day of Prayer Spirituality 101 Provider & Community trainings Diversity and Equity Council monthly meetings Statewide County Liaison calls Mental Health Month Suicide Prevention Committee In FY18 -19, SI participated in and/or hosted the following events and activities: 3rd annual National Day of Prayer - approxi mately 40 attendees Drumming and Spirituality as a Method of Healing and Recovery (collaboration with LC & NIPI) Spirituality 101 - 10 BHRS staff & contractor trainings on the Spirituality Policy 3 mental health education trainings in community 144 Statewide County Liaison calls Suicide Prevention Committee HEALTH AMBASSADOR PR OGRAM (HAP) San Mateo County's Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) Health Ambassador Program (HAP) was created in 2014 out of a desire f rom community members, who are committed to helping their families and neighbors, improve their quality of life, continue learning, and increase their involvement in community services.

After enrolling and completing the 12 -week training, I knew that I needed to learn not only about parenting but perhaps more about mental and behavioral health -a concept so foreign for me at that time. Immediatel y after taking Parent Project, I was suggested to take Mental Health First Aid and then other courses related to alcohol and other drugs offered by San Mateo County's Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS), all of trainings at no cost. I got hooked ! This was the path I needed to take to understand and accept that life can be enjoyable while parenting 2 children with learning and behavioral challenges. After a couple of years of learning through these community trainings, the stigma of mental health issues was lifted, I accepted my reality and became stronger in advocating for my children at school and with medical providers. It became easier to talk about my story and share my experience with other parents/caretakers of my community. Throughout the H ealth Ambassador Program, I've connected with individuals who might have been experiencing challenges like mine. HAP has given me tools to encourage other people to seek the appropriate care and support available in San Mateo County. It's been very rewardi ng witnessing when members of the community are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health and substance abuse and are willing to break the stigma wall to seek for the appropriate help.\" On December 2018, Charo a Family Partner/Peer Support Worker became the 27th Health Ambassador , she is also the current HAP Program Coordinator . Charo's direct participation in each of the classes provides her a closer understanding of how the HAP curriculum works for community members, identifies areas to im prove and highlights successes. Currently , Charo is overseeing the Health Ambassador Program. 147 2) HAP Reunion 2019 The purpose of the Health Ambassador Reunion on February 12, 2019 was to reunite with Ambassadors after a year and a half of not following up with them due to program's staff turnover 16 Ambassadors attended to HAP Reunion 8 relocated 3 couldn't make it The most common request and comments received from HAP graduates were related with learning more about the new forms of drugs and alcohol substance that are available to youth. They are interested in knowing the new tactics of selling/getting/camouflage them. Ambassadors expressed concern of the current use at High Schools. \"HAP allowed me to learn about various drugs when my son eng aged with substance use. I am thankful for the resources available to me at that time. I would like to stay updated about new drug uses\" \"My daughter was straggle with depressive psychosis when I learned about BHRS. Through my involvement in HAP, I was ab le to learn about drug and substance use among youth. Now, 4 years after I took the trainings, I need and update\". Additionally, Ambassadors requested trainings about how to engage with youth when Social Media/Internet use is making youth become \"Zombie Ki ds\" and anti -social; Learn about tactics in communicating with youth about topics youth are exposed to on the internet; Positive Discipline. Also, at HAP Reunion , the opportunity of taking new trainings to improve personal skills and community empowerment was offered such as: Time Management, Conflict Resolution, Job Search, Team Work and Team Building, etc. Below are the results of the survey with the Ambassadors. 148 During April and May, 4 Health Ambassa dor attended to a Conflict Resolution and Team building trainings sponsored by BHRS. One of the attendees stated: \"This information can be used not only in a professional setting but also while encounter any relationship or groups, including my family\" . 3) Providing information on access to SMC BHRS mental health and substance abuse services. After listening the Ambassadors' needs during the annual reunion and after receiving several requests from community members involve in school support groups, the Healt h Ambassador Program in collaboration with Youth Leadership Institute (YLI) set up a drug abuse and mental health presentation at Aragon High School, in San Mateo city, on March 21, 2019.

Residents from 7 different cities in the County. 27 Ambassadors and other community members who attended would use the information for prevention, help their children, and to spread the knowledge to other members of the community. \"After this presentation it will be more difficult for my daughters to fool if they are using drugs\", a mother stated . \"I'd like other parents from my children's school to know this valuable information\". *Childcare and dinner were highly appreciated, in fact there was one of the reasons more males could attend with their spouse and the entire family. 4) CMHACY Conference for HAP On May 15th, 2019, 13 Health Ambassadors and potential Health Ambassadors attended to the California Mental Health Advocates for Children and Youth Conference in Pacific Grove, CA. Ambassadors learned from the following topics: 150 Navigat ing the Mental Health Rights of Children Parent Resilience Helping People Heal in Communities Parent and Youth Panel, gasping services during childhood life transitions \"The first workshop made me remember how hard was for me navigating the system to exercise the right to have a decent school for my son who faces ADHD. After achieving the Independent Education Program (IEP) he needed, I started seeing him smiling, then I felt and learned there was hope\". \"The workshop about Parent's Resilience helped m e realize that I am resilient. It made me rediscover my essence, my own personal leadership and that I am in control of my thoughts\". Another Ambassador shared, \"This conference is helping to see what I didn't do for my daughter when she was little, how ever, I am hopeful and grateful because of what I am learning here and the training I stated taking at the County. Now I understand and can help my daughter in new ways when she needs support while facing bipolar challenges\" 5) Courses Provided During FY 2018 -19 Parent Project: 166 attendees, 129 graduates MHFA Adults: 179 graduates MHFA youth: 327 graduates WRAP: 27 participants, 25 graduates ASIST in English: 2 participants Stigma Free: 25 participants Mental Health and Drug abuse presentation 50 participa nts HAP/AOD presentation: 27 participants NAMI Basics: 18 participants 6) HAP Presentations at Parent Project and Mental Health First Aid classes, School District Office and Parent Caf\u00e9 During a 45 -minute presentation, close to 350 parents/caretakers and school liaisons received information about mental health, the causes and conditions, and about stigma.

For the first time in HAP history 27 members of the community enrolled. 24 graduated. More male s came to the training ever, and they were coming to class in company of theirs spouses. At some point during the 8 -week class, there were 4 entire families, parents were taking the class while children were taking care of. In addition to childcare, a comp lete and nutritious dinner was provided for all participants. Participants from 5 different cities came to the training and some of them identified as alcohol and drug recovered individuals, parents of children with developmental and learning challenges, c aretakers of children with depression and suicide alienation. The baseline and end of the class questionnaires show a tremendous progress in the participants wellness responsibility. \"I didn't know I can work on my own wellness plan, in fact I only take ca re of others\", a woman shared after the 4th session. The training was provided in Spanish and was culturally appropriate, so participants were able to open -up and experience healing. \"I have never talked about my child illness in public because I feel jud ge, even some family members have alienated us because they don't understand nor want to know more about our child mental and behavioral challenges\", a father expressed after one session. \"I didn't feel embarrassed tonight because here are people who seem to be living a similar life like mine\" Below is some data collected during the WRAP training. 22.22%77.78% 0.00%50.00%100.00% Male FemaleSex assigned at birth 27 Adults8 ChildrenAttendees Adults Children 152 The impact of the WRAP training is observable by the baseline and end of the class questionnaires 24% Strongly Agree to know their triggers before an episode of illness. 55% Strongly Agree, at the end of the training While asked the question, I believe that I can educate others (clinicians and community members) about recovery health: 37% Agree, before the training 65 % Agree, after the training When asked, I have a list of tools I use to increase my sense of well -being: 8% Strongly Agree, before the training 75% Strongly Agree, after the training The responses to the statement: I feel SAFE due to the wellness and crisis plans that I have in place currently 37% Agree, before the class 100% Agree, at the end of the class 8) Ambassadors supported by connecting them to volunteer paid job and resources. Two Health Ambassadors participated with San Mateo County's Community Collaboration for Children' s Success (CCCS) on a Neighborhood Leadership Group collecting community input from specific areas in Daly City, as well as helping during the strategic planning process. The Ambassadors were paid $20 dollars for 40 -55 hours. For this opportunity, Ambassad or were able to use their bilingual skills, criminal justice and Half Moon BayRedwood City South San Francisco Menlo Park San Francisco San MateoEast Palo AltoFoster CityWhat city do you live in, work or represent in San Mateo County? East Palo Alto: 4.55% Francisco: 4.55% 153 mental health lived experience and their knowledge of the focus community. Likewise, the Ambassadors had the opportunity to speak up in settings that they were not. One example of that is a r eunion with Daly City Police Chief where both Ambassadors expressed concern for minority communities -Asian, Latino and Black - who reported not being taking care off as fast as other communities; profiling and lack of mental health - oriented services to min ority youth. \"I am very confident to talk on behave of the people I made the survey because I understand their needs, some of the youth I interviewed were friends of my children. They confided so munch on me because I was asking for their needs and listening attentively without judging them. They reported to feel underserved by the police, they though low enforcement don't understand the emotional trauma they carry with them and that they are treated like criminals\" One of those two Ambassadors is go ing to be the 2nd ever Chinese Health Ambassador. BHRS Health Ambassador supported activities/events: o Parenting in the Age of Social Media and Technology (4/3/19) workshop where 2 Ambassadors attended to gain knowledge and shar e it with other Ambassadors and community members. o Mental Health Awareness Month Kick off (5/4/18) where Health Ambassadors volunteered for 4 hours providing information to community members in Half Moon Bay.

Health Ambassador Program FY 18/19 Total clients served 45 Total cost per client $263 CHALL ENGES Program challenges: Staffing changes leading to difficulty scheduling and coordinating classes Limited staffing support to help with actual course Space available to offer trainings Childcare specialized for children with behavioral challenges Provide trainings in other lang uages. Some curriculums haven't been translated to other languages yet. Status of Limited Term Employment of program staff, leading to stop providing services to vulnerable communities. 155 PARENT PROJECT The Parent Project\u00ae was created specifically for anyone who cares for a child or adolescent displaying challenging behavior(s). The goal is to decrease unhealthy or dangerous behavior(s) in children and strengthen the relationships within families in a cul turally informed manner. It is a free, 12 -week course that is offered in English and Spanish. The classes meet for three hours each week in the evening time and are provided with free dinner and childcare. Parents/caregivers learn parenting skills and get information about resources and other support available in their communities. Parents/caregivers learn and practice skills such as appropriate ways to discipline; preventing or stopping alcohol, drug and tobacco use; improving communication skills; and imp roving grades and school attendance. The Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) is dedicated to addressing health disparities, health inequities, and stigma in the areas of mental health and substance use. One -way ODE works to achieve these goals is by prov iding free, public education programs to local community members, such as, the Parent Project\u00ae. The curriculum includes a mix of lecture, interactive activities, discussion, and homework assignments for parents and guardians. Primary program intervention i ncludes guest presentations from local resources including the Sheriff's office providing local resources on gang involvement in youth and alcohol and drug usage and from San Mateo County's Pride Center is also provided to teach parents/ caregivers LGBTQ+ issues with youth. Other guest presentations include the Health Ambassador Program, a program created in recognition of the important role that community members serve in effectively reaching out to others. The program additionally connects the group with any additional resources they may need i.e. behavioral health services and other such as Second Harvest, food bank, etc. PROGRAM IMPACT The Parent Project\u00ae focuses on connecting people to care. Because the Parent Project\u00ae is coordinated by San Mateo Count y's Office of Diversity and Equity, there is a direct connection to behavioral health and recovery services as well as a linkage to other departments in San Mateo County Health System. The priority is to ensure that participants of the Parent Project\u00ae can access appropriate care. The Office of Diversity and Equity ensures that the programs are culturally and linguistically appropriate for diverse communities. The Parent Project\u00ae course is offered in Spanish which is the primary threshold language of San Mat eo County. By removing the language barrier and outreaching to diverse communities , stigma and discrimination is reduced . The Office of Diversity and Equity serves as representative of services and direct connection to services to the Parent Project\u00ae participants. Through this connection the number of individuals receiving public behavioral health services is increased . 156 The Office of Diversity and Equity continues to be a point of access; portal to care; primary resource for care for the Parent Project\u00ae participants. Through the Parent Project\u00ae, the Health Ambassador Program, a program dedicated to further empowering community members to improve the health and wellbeing of individuals in their community. Health ambassadors: Teach youth and adult courses in their community. Assist in identifying needs in their community and helping to make a change. Share their thoughts with the County of San Mateo about wellness in their community. Work with other dedicated individuals. Participate in various volunteer opportunities Parent Project FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 103 157 Total cost per client $233 $153 SUCCESS ES The Parent Project\u00ae started in San Mateo County in 2012, it has maintained a 77% graduation rate and also over 1,000 graduates from the program. The Parent Project\u00ae has become an entry point for low income communities of color to engage in mental health by providing support for parents who want to do better for their children and families. This program is a means to the potential of deeper community engagement and civic participation for the communities. This is directly in line with ODE's goal of Community Empowerment: Deliberate opportunities exist for individuals with lived experience, families and community members to engage in decisions that impact their lives. The Parent Project\u00ae led to invaluable strategic partnerships with the SMCOE and other communi ty-based agencies. In addition, the participants request for continued engagement led to the development of the Health Ambassador Program (HAP). Health Ambassadors have opportunities to outreach within their communities and assist in identifying needs and partake in implementing changes. HAP requires additional capacity building courses and after graduation, connects parents to opportunities to serve on commissions and other decision -making bodies, speaking engagements and has even led to gainful employment with BHRS and other community -based agencies for some. For these reasons it is believed that the continuation of funding for the Parent Project\u00ae is essential to continue connected and responsive to the communities served . CHALLENGES Lack of official Par ent Project Program Coordinator position beginning 2018 157 Inability to adapt program and curriculum to other threshold languages (i.e. Chinese, Russian, Tagalog). Length of time of curriculum. While still maintaining an over 77% graduation rate, having ini tial interest and commitment to the program has been difficult.

The program targets population served is the community members and part ners in San Mateo County. Primary program activities and/or interventions provided is an 8 -hour training, outreach and promotion. PROGRAM IMPACT AMHFA training incorporates culturally humble questions, examples and resources to help increase access for mar ginalized communities. The program shares mental health facts and stories of hope and recovery which both help reduce stigma of mental health issues and conditions. AMHFA training shares local resources participants can refer to for professional behavior al health support, including those targeting marginalized communities. The program also partners with agencies that connect marginalized communities to care, including those serving older adults and incarcerated youth. AMHFA implements the recovery princi ples of support from others and providing hope since participants become gatekeepers provide hope and support to those facing mental health issues. 169 of the 179 graduates responded to the end of class evaluation.

Total Outreach Attendees by Collaborative, FY 2014 -2019 Note: The attendee numbers from previous FYs are slightly higher than those reported in the previous reports because some outr each data was reported after Abuse referrals (30.9%) 80 (17.8%) 200 64 143 Substance Referrals (7.3%) (14.4%) (10.4%) (4.3%) 202 (44.9%) 173 (37.1%) NORTH COUNTY OUTREACH COLLABORATI VE (NCOC) North County Outreach Collaborative outreach is conducted by Asian American Recovery Services (AARS), Daly City Peninsula Partnership Collaborative (DCP), Daly City Youth Health Center (DCYHC), Pacifica Collaborative, and Pyra mid Alternatives. The goals include: 1) establishing strong collaborations with culturally/ linguistically diverse community members; 2) referring 325 clients to BHRS for mental health and substance abuse services; 3) establishing strong linkages between community and BHRS. PROGRAM IMPACT NCOC continues to improve timely access and linkages for underserved populations by making sure when a person is in their waiting room they are immediately greeted and seen in a timely manner. NCOC are also advocates for reducing stigma and discrimination in services. Staff continue to attend and participate in Office of Diversity and Equities HEI's, share NCOC updates and reports back to the COT team all updates. In FY 2017 -2018, there were 4,256 attendees at individual and group outreach events across the five provider organizations in the NCOC. NCOC FY 17/18 FY 18/19 cost per client $30 $44 SUCCESSES AR is a 17 -year -old, cisgender male student, from Brazil, who was referred to DCYHC for counseling with symptoms of major depression, anxiety, and substance use. He started seeing a counselor at the health center and continued to see a DCYHC clinician at h is school. Other major issues presented to the counselor included immigration, loss of MediCal benefits, substance use, and academic struggles. DCYHC clinician worked closely with the school's Wellness Counselor to assist him with school work and create a safe place to talk about his mental health challenges. Immediate, short term solutions were provided such as 164 recommendations to attend immigration workshops provided by the county, assistance to reinstate his MediCal benefits, referral to Pacifica Resour ce Center to help with his legal and substance use issues, and assistance to connect him with resources so he could complete his Senior Exhibition Project. The collaborative partnership with Pacifica Resource Center (PRC) not only provided the student with a safe, immediate, and direct services; the agency also addressed the general issue of substance use in a systemic level that would help students and their families prevent or recover from substance abuse. Not only that, the relationship with PRC and DCYH C had deepened in which trust was developed even more that partner agencies could rely on each other to provide complementary services to disadvantaged youth and their families. In the end, AR passed his classes, his social life bloomed, and he graduated o n time in May of 2019 . EAST PALO ALTO PARTN ERSHIP FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTREACH The East Palo Alto Partnership for Behavioral Health Outreach (EPAPBHO) collaborative is comprised of community -based agencies from the East Palo Alto region of San Mateo Co unty to provide culturally appropriate outreach, psycho -education, screening, referral and warm hand - off services to East Palo Alto region residents. One East Palo Alto (OEPA) served as the lead agency and work in collaboration with El Concilio of San Mate o County (ECSMC), Free at Last (FAL) and the Multicultural Counseling and Educational Services of the Bay Area (MCESBA). EPAP BHO is committed to bridging the mental health divide through advocacy, systems change, resident engagement and expansion of local resources leading to increased resident awareness and access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services. EPAPMHO provides the following services including: Technical assistance to BHRS initiatives to increase community education activities and integration of mental health services with other community organizations. Community Outreach and Access (marketing and publicity, including translation). Promote incre ased East Palo Alto resident participation in County -wide mental health functions and decision -making processes. Sustain and strengthen education materials for and conduct outreach to residents regarding mental health education and awareness. PROGRAM IMP ACT In FY 2017 -2018, there were 511 attendees at individual and group outreach events across the three provider organizations in the EPAP BHO. 165 Outreach workers (also known as promotores/health navigators ) EPAMHO created connections and facilitates access f or marginalized populations through culturally and language appropriate outreach and education. EPAP BHO also forms strong collaborations with local community -based agencies and health and social service providers. Organizations leverage their influence, r esources, and expertise, especially in providing services that address cultural, social and linguistic needs of the community. Collaboratives benefit from having regular meetings to share resources and problem solve, having a clearly defined infrastructure and consistent strategy and, offering ongoing presence and opportunities for community members to engage in services. Finally, EPAPMHO's work increases the number of individuals receiving public health services, helps to reduce disparities in care and pri oritizes using recovery -based principles in their work. EPAPBHO FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served cost per client $328 $281 SUCCESSES MCESBA Outreach worker Dee \"Mamadee\" Uhila in partnership with The Mouton Center, served a PI family, husband & wife in their late 90's, both of whom are from San Jose. They had been couch -surfing and heard about The Mouton Center and Dee Uhila thru another consumer. After two months, they secured housing. Through contact with them and their partic ipation in the PI \"Know Your Rights Forum\" by MCESBA, their unmet needs were identified . Due to the stigma associated with asking for help in the PI community and the fear caused by their immigration status, they hadn't spoken with anyone about their needs and were embarrassed. Further, the family they were staying with were also unaware of community resources. Mamadee established a trusting relationship with the couple and they were encouraged to allow her to make a referral to Ravenswood Family Health Ce nter. They applied for the Access and Care for Everyone (ACE) program. It took two months to get them through the registration process just to schedule an appointment and receive their ACE cards. The elderly couple had been in the U.S. for 10 years and had never seen a doctor. They are finally receiving ongoing medical care. As a result of addressing their immediate needs and establishing a trusting relationship, they are now able to participate in a conversation about mental health and wellness and how participating in wellness programs can improve their quality of life. Currently their immigration issues and long -term housing needs are also being addressed . 166 As with many served , the couple made sure that they communicated that they were Samoan, native language speakers and Christians. Connecting them with a faith community of their choice furthered t he establish ment of a trusting relationship which is essential in being able to serve them and connect them to the appropriat e community and mental health services. CHALLENGES Challenges that MCESBA staff deal with are similar to past years as follows: Long wait times to secure services or receive services on a drop -in basis. Needs of the Pacific Islander community outweigh the capacity and resources. The PI community is faced with unique barriers in accessing mental health services. The standard approach used by the county is often inappropriate given the cultural uniqueness of the community. Reliable transportation and transportation services that everyone qualifies for. STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION REDUCTION #BE THE ONE CAMPAIGN #BeTheOneSMC is San Mateo County's anti -stigma initiative which aims to eliminate stigma against mental health and/or substance use issues in the San Mateo County community. #BeTheOneSMC can mean many things to different people. #BeTheOneSMC can mean that ONE in four people have a mental health condition yet less than half are getting the help they need\u2014many because they are afraid others will judge them. #BeTheOneSMC can also mean that ONE person or organization can make a difference in supporting wellness and recovery for others. SUCCESSES Within the #BeTheOneSMC , the program manager and supportin g staff are especially proud of the Art of Wellness Festival (MHAM Kick -off) hosted at Cuhna Middle School in Half Moon Bay. The program staff is especially proud of this intervention because the event reached a new audience (Coastside community) that ofte n are marginalized and have limited access to behavioral health services and was shaped through a collaborative process and included local community members as key speakers. A young woman with a severe mental health condition was shot by a police officer a nd her brother spoke up at the event. CHALLENGES 167 Challenge 1 - Understaffed: The top challenge for stigma reduction program is that it is understaffed. About 20 -25% of a full time Community Health Planner position is dedicated to coordinating stigma discrimination reduction program for the County. There are high expectations for this position to plan countywide Mental Health Month activities, facilitate community driven planning committee, coordinate communication campaigns and provide education as needed. This position gets some but not consistent/reliab le support from (1) BHRS ODE/Communications staff and (2) planning committee members (who usually volunteer small tasks that require more time for co -chair to train/orient). Potential Solutions: o Limit scope of work for SDR in SMC o Contract the communicat ion campaign work o Utilize Each Mind Matters consultants Challenge 2 - Media Engagement: There is no longer SMC Health System support for communications, so there wasn't as much MHAM communication promotion (especially media) as previous years. Potentia l Solutions: o Get dedicated staff time outside of coordinator position to lead (not just support) communication campaigns throughout the year o Work with SMC Health Communications to do more with the press so the limited capacity of the SP coordinator can h ave more reach and impact DIGITAL STORYTELLING & PHOTOVOICE The Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) storytelling program empowers community members to share their stories of recovery and wellness to heal and to address issues within their communities. Participants engage in workshops that help them create and shar e their stories in different forms. Beginning with a framing question, facilitators support participants to share their stories as Photovoices or Digital Stories. Considering structural impacts on wellness such as racism, discrimination, and poverty, these workshops broaden the definition of recovery and reduce stigma. The stories shared are both personal and powerful. For some, they have created a sense of connection, and for others, they have opened the doors to treatment and recovery. Stories captured in San Mateo County shed light on important social issues including stigma against mental health and substance abuse and support the empowerment of others with lived experience to share their stories. 168 PROGRAM IMPACT In FY 17 -18 the Photovoice program began o ffering facilitator trainings, to empower community members to capture and share their stories. 25 people were trained as facilitators during the first year. In FY 17 -18 photovoice workshops were facilitated focusing on Arab and Arab American mental wellne ss (6 high school participants), death and dying with the hospice community, experiencing incarceration in partnership with Correctional Health Services and the Sheriff's office, substance use and suicide, spirituality in recovery, substance use in East Pa lo Alto, stigma of behavioral health, youth health ambassadors and housing advocacy. The program also published a video series with practical applications of cultural humility in clinical settings including, (1) Cultural Humility Introduction, (2) Workin g Through an Interpreter, (3) Using Gender Pronouns, (4) Developing Trust and Partnership, and (5) Gender Inclusive Restrooms (in progress). The program also focused on improving communications about and accessibility of the stories created. Fiscal year 18-19 was filled with many accomplishments for the Storytelling program. The Storytelling program trained 42 more facilitators to host workshops on the topics of: immigration, incarceration, and youth mental health. Further, the first ever mental health graphic novel was created, and the process was led by a Behavioral Health and Recovery Services consumer! There were also significantly positive outcomes on participant self -efficacy. Participants continue to report positive feedback on the storytelling pro gram and continue to report growth through the pre - and post -program questionnaires. \"I feel people with mental illness are persons of worth, at least on an equal basis.\": Strongly agree increased from 77% to 91%. \"I see people with mental illness as cap able people.\": Strongly agree increased from 69% to 86%, for an increase of 17%.1 \"People with mental illness are able to do things as well as other people.\": Strongly agree, increased from 69% to 82%.1 \"I'm kind to myself when I'm experiencing suffering.\" Agree to Strongly Agree increased from 33% to 70% \"When I'm going through a very hard time, I give myself the caring and tenderness I need.\" Agree to Strongly Agree increased from 25% to 73% 2 \"I'm tolerant of my own flaws and inadequacies.\" Ag ree to Strongly Agree increased from 34% to 74% 2 \"I try to be loving towards myself when I'm feeling emotional pain.\" Agree to Strongly Agree increased from 38% to 87%.2 169 It's likely that a number of evaluations and questionnaires were completed inaccurat ely due to repeating choices (i.e. participant circles all 9s/strongly agree for questions measuring belief of mental health stigma as they rush out of the workshop and turn in their evaluation) and incongruence to participant affect during the workshop. Consequently, a procedure has been developed for the evaluation stage of the storytelling workshops. The procedure will be added to the facilitator curriculum. Digital Storytelling FY 17/18 FY 18/19 Total clients served 47 Total cost per client $1,163 SUCCESSES & CHALLENG ES Youth at Menlo Park non -profit, Safespace, shared their experiences and lessons learned from coping with mental health challenges. Safespace works to educate and help young people advocate for better mental health services throughout their local schools and community. Stories include themes of hardship and resilience and include both youth and adult perspectives. Fun fact: this was the first youth -led and facilitated Photovoice workshop! The Storytell ing program led a workshop to create San Mateo County's first -ever graphic novel about behavioral health. The Graphic Novel Photovoice was impactful because the stories shared are aimed towards clients and community members who are averse to other resource s because graphic novels are very approachable and easy to read. Further, the workshop and advocacy were led by San Mateo County BHRS consumers. People in the Promotoras & Family Advocate program at Nuestra Casa shared their stories in response to the framing question, \"What does Nuestra Casa mean to you?\". The question, a double meaning of \"our house\" and name of the organization hosting the workshop, was an opportunity for people to share their stories with relevance to the federal issues on immigration. Stories include themes of mental health recovery, housing, and discrimination. Fun fact: this was the first Photovoice workshop facilitated in Spanish ! Unfortunately, t he end of FY 18 -19 brings the Storytelling Program closer to the end of the Storytelling Coordinator position. The next few months, the Storytelling Coordinator will work to solidify storytelling partnerships and develop a succession plan for Storytelling work to succeed once the position ends.

The primary program activities and/or interventions provided include: 1. Suicide Prevention Committee (SPC): The purpose of th e SPC is to provide oversight and direction to suicide prevention efforts in San Mateo County. The SPC meets every month. The target population is a diversity of community partners, suicide survivors and the San Mateo County community at large. For 2018 -2019, SPC focused on two projects (1) Suicide Surveillance and (2) Suicide Prevention Month. 2. September Suicide Prevention Month (SPM): The purpose of SPM is to encourage all in the community to learn how all have a role in preventing suicide. The 2018 SPM included a: (1) proclamation, (2) calendar of events, (3) communication campaign, (4) film screening and panel event and (8) other events hosted by community partners. 3. Suicide Prevention Training: Throughout the year, San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services provides a variety of suicide prevention trainings, including: Parenting Skills & Family Relationship Programs o Parent Project - Changing Destructive Adolescent Behavior (Adolescent) o Gatekeeper Trainings Applied Suicide Intervention Skil ls Training (ASIST) o Mental Health First Aid - Adult and Youth o Question Persuade Refer (QPR) 172 o Reconozca Las Se\u00f1ales (Spanish) Crisis Intervention Trainings o Crisis Intervention Training In FY 17 -18, the May Mental Health Awareness Month event had about 30 peo ple in attendance. Number of clients served in FY 2018 -19 is an estimated 1,500 SUCCESSES A highlight of the suicide prevention program for 2018 -2019 is that the September Suicide Prevention Month (SPM) featured an S -Word Film Screening & Panel event at the San Mateo High School Theater. There was a diverse panel (youth, older adult, parent, th erapist) and over 100 people that attended. Hosting the event at the school was intentional because the San Mateo Union High School District experienced a cluster of suicides in September 2017. Another highlight is also that the Suicide Prevention Committee's structure and membership is enhancing. For 2018 -2019, SPC started meeting monthly and had 12 committee meetings with 150 people in attendance during the year. CHALLENGES Challenge 1 - Understaffed: About 20 -25% of a full -time positio n is dedicated to coordinating suicide prevention for the County. There are high expectations for this position to run a coalition, facilitate strategic planning and action planning, coordinate events and coordinate trainings. This position gets some but n ot consistent/reliable support from (1) BHRS ODE/Communications staff, (2) SPC members and (3) co -chair from StarVista (who has limited capacity with their role as director of the crisis center). Potential Solutions: o Allocate more consistent staff time to support SPM and SP communications work o Limit scope of work for SP in SMC o Contract out communication campaign work o Utilize Each Mind Matters consultants Challenge 2 -Balancing Interest of SPC Members and SP Roadmap Interests: The meetings are more infor mation sharing and guest speakers and less about advancing the SP Roadmap. While there is limited time in each meeting, members are more interested in working on tangible, short -term projects, learning about resources and suicide death cases in the county. Potential Solutions: o Improve member engagement (e.g. action completed within meeting, assign action item for next meeting) 173 o Co-Chairs decide projects and then recruit members based on those projects o Spend less time on information sharing o Dedicate more meeting time to strategic planning, oversight and evaluation Challenge 3 - Media Engagement: There's no longer SMC Health System support for communications, so there wasn't as much SPM communication promotion as previous years. Potential Solutions: o Get d edicated staff time outside of coordinator position to lead (not just support) communication campaigns throughout the year o Work with SMC Health Communications to do more with the press so the limited capacity of the SP coordinator can have more reach and impact o Contract out communication campaign creative planning and content creation, including hashtags and videos DEMOGRAPHICS San Mateo county is in the process of determining a process to collect demographics on social media engagement, presentations and community -based partnerships. 174 INNOVATIONS (INN) 175 INNOVATION S (INN) INN projects are designed and implemented for a defined time period (not more than 5 years) and evaluated to introduce a behavioral health practice or approach that is new; make a change to an existing practice, including application to a different populat ion; apply a promising community -driven practice or approach that has been successful in non -behavioral health; and has not demonstrated its effectiveness (through mental health literature). The State requires submission and approval of INN plans prior to use of funds. The development MHSA Innovation Projects is part of the comprehensive Community Program Planning (CPP) process . Current INN projects in San Mateo County include: The San Mateo County Pride Center, the Neurosequential of Therapeutics (NMT) in an Adult System of Care, and the Health Ambassador Program for Youth (HAP -Y). Please see Appendix 10 for full FY 2017 -18 INN Evaluation R eport s, the FY 2018 -19 INN Evaluation R eport s will be included in the next MHSA Annual Update. Below are some current FY 2018 -19 Highlights. THE SAN MATEO COUNTY PRIDE CENTER The San Mateo County Pride Center (The Pride Center) is a formal collaboration of four partner organizations: StarVista, Peni nsula Family Services, Adolescent Counseling Services, and Daly City Partnership. The Pride Center also works collaboratively with the Pride Initiative of the Office of Diversity and Equity and the County of San Mateo LGBTQ Commission, co -sponsoring and co nsulting across many events, efforts and policy priorities. While it is not new to have an LGBTQ center providing social services, there is no model of a coordinated approach across mental health, social and psycho -educational services for this marginalize d community. FY 2018 -19 Implementation Updates Pride Center continued to operate many of the programs, services, and events that Center staff and participants launched during the first year. These ongoing activities include: o Providing psychotherapy services for individuals, groups, couples, and famili es o Providing case management services o Operating the Center as a \"one -stop shop\" and resource hub for LGBTQ+ community o Hosting multiple peer support groups o Operating Youth Programs, for participants ages 10 to 25 o Operating Older Adult Programs, for people ages 50 and older 176 Pride Center Participants by Race (n=193) Alaskan multiracial 15% 25% 24% 29% 8%0 to 15 16 to 25 26 to 39 40 to 59 60 and older Figure 1 Center Participants by A ge (n=199) o Running many different educational events, social activities, and community -based programs o Training public agencies and private organizations on matters of sexual orientation and gender identit y, both at the Pride Center and throughout the county o Conducting year -round outreach across San Mateo County o Partnering with other LGBTQ+ inclusive county events and programs Pride Center Population Served During the 2018 -2019 program year, nearly 3,000 pe ople accessed Pride Center programs, trainings, and services. This includes 1,213 unique individuals who completed a sign -in sheet onsite, and 1,526 people who participated in a training held by Pride Center staff. During the program year, 88 people access ed psychotherapy services. As of June 30, 2019, 34 unique individuals were actively receiving clinical services. Among all participants who accessed therapy during the program year, the average duration of service was six and a half months. Among participa nts who had completed clinical services, the average duration of service was five months. During FY2018 -19, a total of 201 new participants completed the demographic survey. 177 Demographic Comparison The table below highlights key differences and similarities between A) participants receiving clinical services in FY2018 -19, and B) all participants from the Pride Center since inception . The comparison shows that among clinical service participants, high er proportions were children or transition age youth, transgender or gender nonconforming, and Latinx. Among new participants , higher proportions were children, male, and transgender women. Category A. Clinical Participants FY2018 -19 B. All Pride Center Participants Age A higher percentage of clinical participants were age 25 or under. A slightly higher percentage of new participants in FY18 -19 were children ages 0 - 15. Race A higher percentage of clinical participants identified as Latinx/o/a, and a lower percentage identified as White. The racial breakdown was generally the same for new FY2018 -19 participants and participants across all years. Sex at Birth A higher percentage of clinical participants reported that they were assigned male at birth. A slightly higher percentage of new participants in FY18 -19 reported that they were assigned male at birth. Sexual Orientation A higher percentage of clinical participants identified as pansexual and a lower percentage identified as heterosexual. Slightly lower percentages of new participants in FY18 -19 identified as gay/lesbian or as heterosexual, and slightly higher identified as bisexu al or pansexual. Gender Identity A slightly higher percentage identified as gender nonconforming. A slightly higher percentage of new participants in FY2018 -19 identified as transgender women, while a slightly lower percentage identified as cisgender wom en. Clinical Services Baseline Data The Client Self -Assessment asks clinical participants to rate how they felt about their mental health and their ability to cope with stress in the last 30 days. Participants Initial Screening Experiences in you rate your ability to cope with stress in the last 30 days?How would you rate your mental health in the last 30 days? Excellent/Good Fair/Poor 178 NEUROSEQUENTIAL MODE L OF THERAPEUTICS (N MT) - ADULTS The Child Trauma Academy (CTA) developed NMT as an alternative approach to addressing trauma, typically used with children, that is grounded in neurodevelopment and neurobiology. NMT is not a single therapeutic technique or intervention. Rather, NMT uses a ssessments to guide the selection and sequence of a set of highly individualized therapeutic interventions (e.g., therapeutic massage, drumming, yoga, expressive arts, etc.) that best match each NMT consumer's unique strengths and neurodevelopmental needs. While the NMT approach has been integrated into a variety of settings serving infants through young adults, there is no literature or research of NMT in a strictly adult setting or population. BHRS is adapting, piloting, and evaluating the application of the NMT approach to an adult population with a history of trauma. This expansion to and evaluation of NMT in an adult system of care is the first of its kind. Implementation Updates In FY18 -19, BHRS began training two new cohorts of providers within the adult system of care, including NMT certification training (Phase I) and NMT Train -the-Trainer training (Phase II). Phase I training began in January 2019 and includes 16 providers from the Adult System of Care. As more providers are certified or begin NM T training, the volume of adult consumers participating in NMT services continues to grow. During Year 3 of the pilot, 77 consumers were open to NMT services, compared to 40 in year 2 and 20 in year 1. BHRS created and filled an NMT Program Specialist pos ition to support NMT training and the NMT pilot. NMT Population Served In FY18 -19, 77 adult consumers were enrolled in NMT services, all of whom represent the target population. o 27% (n=21) were transition age youth (TAY, ages 16 -25) o 72% (n=56) were adult s (ages 26+) o 36% (n=28) were part of the criminal justice re -entry population (including both TAY and adults) 179 Characteristic Consumers % of Total Gender (N=77) Female 49 64% Male 28 36% Race (N=71) White 24 34% Black or African American 5 7% Asian/Pacific Islander 5 7% Other Race 19 27% Two or More Races 18 25% Ethnicity (N=70) Hispanic/Latino 31 44% Not Hispanic/Latino 39 56% NMT Outcomes Percent of Consumers with Increased and Decreased Assessment Scores, N=28 NMT is enhancing the consumer experience of care and improving recovery outcomes. Compared to more traditional therapy, consumers generally appreciate the individualized approach of NMT and the alternative interventions. The interventions also appear to be supporting consumers to better understand, recognize, and/or cope with triggers and past experiences of trauma and are helping consumers to progress in their recovery. NMT is helping create a more trauma -informed system of care. NMT training and implemen tation continues to support NMT clinicians \u2014and often providers who work with NMT clinicians \u2014to implement a more trauma -informed approach to care with their caseloads and in their clinics overall. In particular, the Phase II training is supporting providers to take a more system -level approach and providers are examining how the NMT principles and interventions can be implemented more widely within their clinics or programs to create a more trauma -informed environment. 22%36%25%25%29% 14%10%7%11% 64%54%68%64%71% CognitiveRelationalSelf-RegulationSensory IntegrationTotal Brain MapDecrease PR OGRAM FOR YOUTH ( HAP -Y) HAP -Y serves as a youth -led initiative where young adults act as mental health ambassadors to promote awareness of mental health, reduce mental health stigma, and increase service access for young people. The HAP -Y Innovation project is the first to offer formal evaluation of a training designed for youth peer educators and its effectiveness and impact on community awareness and stigma, increasing access to mental health services for youth, and addressing systemic changes, as well as supporti ng youth ambassadors' wellness and recovery. Implementation Updates StarVista continued to expand HAP -Y into different areas of San Mateo County, ensuring a wider geographic representation of young people. StarVista aimed to recruit students from parts of San Mateo County that had not been represented among the first three cohorts. Cohorts 4 and 5 both had a majority of Latina/o/x youths, several of whom noted the cultural and social barriers in their families that made mental health a taboo topic. Ambassa dors in Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 presented and spoke to over a thousand young people in a variety of school -based and community -based venues. The ambassadors from Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 completed a total of 89 presentations during their time with HAP -Y. StarVista staff recruited HAP -Y alumni to participate in additional peer education and speaking opportunities. Some former HAP -Y program participants have maintained contact with StarVista staff, and during this program year StarVista began soliciting HAP -Y alumni to continue serving as panelists or speaking at community events when the opportunity arises. Youth Ambassador Demographics HAP -Y Ambassador Demographics for Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 (n=34) Age: 100% of ambassadors were 25 or younger at the time of survey, wi th nearly all participants between the ages of 16 and 25. Language: Almost all (94%) of ambassadors listed English as their primary language, or listed English along with another language. Race: About two -thirds (68%) of participants identified as Latinx, and 26% identified as white. Most of Cohorts 4 and 5 were Latinx, and a slight majority of Cohort 6 participants were white. Ethnicity: A majority of ambassadors (59%) were Mexican/Mexican American/Chicanx, including nearly all of Cohorts 4 and 5. No more than three youth identified with any other ethnicity. 181 Sex at Birth: 88% of ambassadors indicated that they were female at birth. Others were male at birth or declined to answer. Gender Identity: Nearly all ambassadors (88%) identified as cisgender women at the time of survey, including all 14 members of Cohort 4. Sexual Orientation: About two -thirds (68%) of ambassadors identified as heterosexual or straight, and 18% identified as bisexual. Education: Nearly all (94%) of participants were in high school at the time of survey, including all members of Cohorts 4 and 5. Building Youth Capacity Participating in HAP -Y provides ambassadors with concrete tools and knowledge to support their own mental health and wellbeing, as well as help their peers and loved ones. Because many HAP -Y ambassadors have lived experiences of mental health challenges, the program is well suited to help these participants build resilience and practice self -care. Many HAP -Y ambassadors gain the self -assurance to speak up about difficult matters, and/or challenge other people's misconceptions about mental health. HAP -Y participants reported some of the highest gains on the Self -Determination Survey for questions about confidence, self -esteem, and comfort with advocacy. Enhancing Mental Health Knowledge and Decreasing Stigma Most audience members found the HAP -Y presentations useful and expressed high levels of satisfaction with both the presentation and the presenters. Many ambassadors presented to freshmen classes, and some expressed concern that some audience members may not yet have the maturity or life experiences to see the presentation as important. Following the presentation, nearly all audience members reported that they knew wher e to access help for their mental health struggles. The HAP -Y presentations provide concrete information about mental health resources available to young people in San Mateo County. Following the presentation, over 90% of audience members indicated that th ey now knew how to find mental health supports, or phone - or online -based services. Increasing Youth Access to Mental Health Services Many HAP -Y audience members indicated that the presentation had provided them with resources they could use in the future to seek support for themselves, family members, and/or friends. Some audience members indicated that they were experiencing a mental health challenge and requested individual follow -up support from StarVista. 182 HELP@HAND (TECH SUITE) With MHSOAC approval, San Mateo county began working on the Help@Hand , formerly Tech Suite, in September 2018 and joined the statewide County Behavioral Health Technology Collaborative along with 14 other city and county behavioral health departments . The Help@Hand project trying to discover if technology fits within the Behavioral Health System of Care. Innovative digital applications for smartphones and other mobile devices have great potential to empower consumers by engaging them as full partners in the ir behavioral health care, supporting self -care, and offering access to people who face barriers in working with a face -to-face provider. The project may discover technology does not work well within the Behavioral Health System of Care. If technology fit s, it will be an incredible change in a positive direction. Listed below are some of the accomplishments in San Mateo County to -date.

Clients and families/caregivers are given training to help others by providing skills to promote wellness and other positive mental health outcomes, they are able to work collaboratively to deliver client -and fami ly-driven services, provide outreach to unserved and underserved populations, as well as services that are linguistically and culturally competent and relevant, and include the viewpoints and expertise of clients and their families/caregivers. WET was desi gnated one -time allocation totaling $3,437,600 with a 10-year reversion period. In the spring of 2017, the BHRS Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) hired an independent consultant to assess the impact of WET and identify priorities that would shape the f uture landscape. WET activities will continue to be funded by MHSA at $500,000 per year. As part of the mission of the Office of Diversity and Equity, which is \"...in collaboration with and for community members, the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) adva nces health equity in behavioral health outcomes of marginalized communities throughout San Mateo county; the WET Team, informed by broader social justice and equity efforts, a wellness and recovery orientation and two advisory committees, strives to equip the workforce, consumers, and family members for system transformation by planning, coordinating, and implementing a range of initiatives, trainings, and program activities for the Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) workforce, consumers/family members, and community partners. There are several distinct populations served directly by the WET Team. The BHRS Workforce, people contracted by San Mateo county to provide behavioral health services, consumers and family members and subgroups of those populations actively participate in the program activities. For example, WET program areas such as the BHRS Clinical Internship/ODE Internship programs are implemented for Interns and other non -licensed/certified staff/community providers to gain knowled ge and supervised professional experience in a local government setting. One of the broader objectives of the internship programs is to attract and retain a diverse workforce to better serve the San Mateo County communities. As a program area of ODE, the WET Team also focuses on providing program activities that are in alignment with the best practices established by ODE and policies implemented by the County and this includes model ing the ODE Team values across the work. For instance, pronouns are disclos ed when introducing ourselves at trainings and meetings. The WET Team program areas may be categorized into three broad areas. Training and Technical Assistance, Behavioral Health Career Pathways and WET Workplace Enhancement Projects. The annual 186 training plan and education sessions to provide up -to-date information on practices, policies and interventions approved for use in BHRS is an integral component of the Training and Technical Assistance area. Interns who have obtained an internship in one of the more than 20 clinic and program training sites can collaborate with the County's Health Equity Initiatives in the Cultural Stipend Internship Program which is supported by the Behavior Health Career Pathways program area. As part of the BHRS Workforce Enha ncement Projects, the WET team was actively involved in the successful, inaugural BHRS Mentorship Program. PROGRAM IMPACT The WET Team of the Office of Diversity & Equity provides programs that build the capacity of the workforce, community providers, and consumers and family members. Primarily providing training/education/development. It is imperative for underserved, marginalized community members and populations to have timely access and links to services, in their many forms provided by the county. Th ose communities include ethnic/racial communities, communities' members with limited English proficiency and member of the LGBTQ communities. However, there are sometimes barriers which may hinder the timely access. Some of those barriers might include l ack of language services, lack of cultural humility, lack of knowledge of trauma informed care practices and/ or recovery as a lifestyle. WET activities help to reduce stigma and discrimination by training providers, community members. Most workforce educ ation activities have an indirect impact however, without it , members of the community may suffer lack of access to services or insufficient services. By attending some events as a constant presence, trust is built and communit ies are more likely to reach out when they or someone they know may need of services. Equity is a core principle in WET trainings . Total number of WET Implemented/Supported trainings: Interpreters/SOGI: Total number of Trauma/Resiliency Related Trainings: Total of Members: Total number of AOD/Integrated Behavioral Health: 14 Total of Health Disparities Trainings: 2 Other **: 39 *Many trainings are open to consumers and family members. Many consumers and family members attend the training that are not directly for or provided by them. **Other trainings include: ABC's of Child Family Treatment(CFT), Crisis Response Team, (Clinical)Supervisors' Training, Internship orientation, Photovoice, BHRS New Hire Orientation, 187 Prevention & Management of Assaultive Behavior, Ch ild & Adolescent Needs & Strengths (CANS) Training, and Law & Ethics for Behavioral Health Providers. SUCCESSES Two of the main initiatives for the 2018 -2019 fiscal year were to implement Cultural Humility training for all BHRS staff and providers and to work toward a more integrated, cohesive BHRS by creating training opportunities that address the needs of the Clinical and Substance Use providers and consumers and family members. As a result, the Cultural Humility Cohort was expanded and significantly i ncreased the number of training sessions offered across the county. Similarly, the most well attended and evaluated Law and Ethics trainings was offered . Attendees noted: \"This course exceeded my expectations! I learned so many new things about myself through this experience and others.\" \"The information given, the courage of vulnerability, the support, the patience and the encouragement.\" \"The speaker 's ability to connect detailed historical information to current day scenario\" \"all the real -life example s, made the material stick in my mind\" CHALLENGES One of the greatest and most consistent challenges to implementing WET program activities is the lack of access to a central, no cost, high capacity training venue. This challenge has created training ca ncelations, increased program costs, and diminished effectiveness in reaching audit targets. The WET team has implemented several stop gap measures to mitigate the challenge, however a permanent solution would mitigate the impact. 188 HOUSING 189 HOUSING MHSA Housing funds provide permanent supportive housing through a program administered by the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) to individuals who are eligible for MHSA services and meet eligibility criteria as homeless or at -risk of being homeless. BHRS collaborated with the Department of Housing and the Human Services Agency's Shelter Services Division (HOPE Plan staff) to plan and implement the MHSA Housing program in the County. In September 2014, AB 1929 was passed which all owed counties to request and use unencumbered MHSA Housing Program funds to provide housing assistance. The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution approving the request to release of these funds; a total of $1,073,038 was received from the Housing Program to be held in trust for housing assistance services. A plan for the use of unencumbered Housing funds was presented to the MHSA Steering Committee in March 2017 and BHRS contributed the unencumbered to the Affordable Housing Fund admini stered by the Department of Housing for the development of affordable housing, which led to 12 additional MHSA units as demonstrat ed below.

Virtually all of San Mateo's behavioral healt h facilities are not owned but leased by the County, and a considerable portion of services are delivered in partnership with community -based organizations. Through a robust stakeholder process it was decided to focus all resources of this component to fu nd eClinical Care, an integrated business and clinical information system (electronic health record) as well as ongoing technical support. The system continues to be improved and expanded in order to help BHRS better serve the clients and families of the S an Mateo County behavioral health stakeholder community. 192 APPENDICES APPENDIX 1 .

For the second year of ambassador presentations, StarVista aimed to recruit stude nts from parts of San Mateo Cou nty that had not been represented among the first three cohorts. Cohorts 4 and 5 both had a major ity of Latina/o/x youths, several of whom noted the cultural and soci al barriers in their families t hat made mental health a taboo topic. Ambassadors in Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 presented and spoke to over a thousand young people in a variety of schoolbased and communitybased venues. The ambassadors from Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 completed a total of 89 presentations during their time with HA PY. StarVista staff recruited HAPY alumni to participate in additi onal peer education and speaking opportunities. Some former HAPY program partic ipants have maintained contact with StarVista staff, and during this program year StarVista began soliciting HAPY alumni to continue serving as panelists or speaking at communi ty events when the opportunity arises. Youth Ambassador Demographics Table 1: HAPY Ambassador Demographics for Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 (n=34) Age: 100% of ambassadors were 25 or younger at the time of survey, with nearly all participants between the ages of 16 and 25. Language: A l m o s t a l l ( 9 4 % ) o f a m b a s s a d o r s listed English as their primary language, or listed English along with another language. Race: About twothirds (68%) of participants identified as Latinx, and 26% identified as white. Most of Cohorts 4 and 5 were Latinx, and a slight majority of Cohort 6 participants were white. Ethnicity: A majority of ambassadors (59%) were Mexican/Mexican American/Chicanx, including nearly all of Cohorts 4 and 5. No more than three youth identified with any other ethnicity. Sex at Birth: 88% of ambassadors indicated that they were female at birth. Others were male at birth or declined to answer. Gender Identity: Nearly all ambassadors (88%) identified as cisgender women at the time of survey, including all 14 members of Cohort 4. Sexual Orientation: About twothirds (68%) of ambassadors identified as heterosexual or straight, and 18% identified as bisexual. Education: Nearly all (94%) of participants were in high school at the time of survey, including all members of Cohorts 4 and 5. November 26, 2019 | 2 Progress Toward Learning Goals Building Youth Capacity Participating in HAPY provides ambassadors with concrete tools and knowledge to support their own mental health and wellbeing, as well as help their peers an d loved ones. Because many HAPY ambassadors have lived experiences of mental health challenges, the program is well suited to help these participants build resilience and practice selfcare. Many HAPY ambassadors gain the selfassurance to speak up abou t difficult matters, and/or challenge other people's misconceptions about mental health. HAPY participants reported some of the highest gains on the SelfDetermination Survey for question s about confidence, selfesteem, and comfort with advocacy. Ambassadors became more confident in the ir presentation skills over the course of multiple presentations. Enhancing Mental Health Knowledge and Decreasing Stigma Most audience members found the HAPY presentations useful and expressed high levels of satisfaction with both the presentation and the presenters. Many ambassadors presented to freshmen classes, and some of th ese ambassadors expressed conce rn that some audience members may not yet have the maturity or life experiences to see the pr esentation as important. Following the presentation, nearly all audience members reporte d that they knew where to access help for their mental health struggles. The HAPY presentations provid e concrete information about mental health resources availabl e to young people in San Mateo County, including crisis hotlines and StarVista's peerrun online chatr oom for youth. Following the p resentation, over 90% of audience members indicated that they now knew how to find mental health supports, or phone or online based services. Increasing Youth Access to Mental Health Services Many HAPY audience members indicated that the presentation had provided them with resources they could use in the future to seek support for themselves, fa mily members, and/or friends. Some audience members indicated that they were experiencing a mental health challenge and requested individual followup support from StarVista. MHSA Innovation Evaluation: FY1819 Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics (NMT) in an Adult System of Care Implementation Updates In FY1819, BHRS began training two new cohorts of providers wi thin the adult system of care, including NMT certification training (Phase I) and NMT Trainth eTrainer training (Phase II). Phase I training began in January 2019 a nd includes 16 providers from t he Adult System of Care. As more providers are certified or begin NMT training, the volu me of adult consumers participating in NMT services continues to grow. During Year 3 of the pilot, 77 consumers were open to NMT services, compared to 40 in year 2 and 20 in year 1. BHRS created and filled an NMT Program Specialist position to s upport NMT training and the NMT pilot. NMT Population Served In FY1819, 77 adult consumers were enrolled in NMT services, a ll of whom represent the target population. o 27% (n=21) were transition age youth (TAY, ages 1625) o 72% (n=56) were adults (ages 26+) o 36% (n=28) were part of the criminal justice reentry populatio n (including both TAY and adults) Characteristic Consumers % of Total Gender (N=77) Female 49 64% Male 28 36% Race (N=71) White 24 34% Black or African American 5 7% Asian/Pacific Islander 5 7% Other Race 19 27% Two or More Races 18 25% Ethnicity (N=70) Hispanic/Latino 31 44% Not Hispanic/Latino 39 56% November 26, 2019 | 2 Percent of Consumers with Increa sed and Decrease d Assessment Sc ores, N=28 NMT is enhancing the consumer experience of care and improving recovery outcomes. Compared to more traditional therapy, consumers generally appreciate the individualized approach of NMT and the alternative interventions. The interventions also appear to be supporting consumers to better understand, recognize, and/or cope with triggers and past exper iences of trauma and are helping consumers to progress in their recovery. NMT is helping create a more traumainformed system of care. NMT training and implementation continues to support NMT clinicians\u2014and often providers who wor k w i t h N M T c l i n i c i a n s \u2014 t o implement a more traumainformed approach to care with their ca seloads and in their clinics overall. In particular, the Phase II training is supporting providers to take a more system level approach and providers are examining how the NMT principles and intervention s can be implemented more widely within their clinics or programs to create a more traumainform ed environment. 22%36%25%25%29% 14%10%7%11% 64%54%68%64%71% CognitiveRelationalSelfRegulationSensory IntegrationTotal Brain MapDecrease Maintain Increase Alaskan multiracial 15% 25% 24% 29% 8%0 to 15 16 to 2526 to 3940 to 59 60 and older Figure 1 Center Participants by Age (n=199) MHSA Innovation Evaluation: FY1819 Pride Center Findings Implementation Updates Pride Center continued to operate many of the programs, servic es, and events that Center staff and participants launched during the first year.

This includes 1,213 uniqu e individuals who completed a signin sheet onsite, and 1,526 people who participated in a training held by Pride Center staff. During the program year, 88 people accessed psychotherapy servi ces. As of June 30, 2019, 34 unique individuals were actively receiving clinical services. Among all participan ts who accessed therapy du ring the program year, the average duration of service was six and a half months. Amon g participants who had completed clinical services, the average duration of service was five months. During FY201819, a total of 201 ne w participants completed the demographic survey.

Please provide a brief narrative summary of the challen ge or problem that you have identi fied and why it is important to solve for your community. Addiction Related Co-Occurring Conditions Addiction to drugs and alcohol affects more than 23 million Ame ricans and continues to rise.1 Although addiction is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the United States and contributes significantly to healthcare costs, only 10% of people with addiction receive any type of treatment, and far fewer re ceive life-saving medication s. In San Mateo County in in 2016, 2.9% (1,112) of emergency department (ED) visits and 21.3 % (505) psychiatric emergency services (PES) visit s and 18% (449) of hospital admission were by people with substance use disorders (SUD) . By 2018, ED and PES visits had i ncreased to 1,560 (4.1%) and 1,018 (47.1%) respectively. According to the National Institut e of Health, \"multiple nation al population surveys have found that about half of those who experience a mental illness during their lives will also experience a substance use disorder and vice versa.\" In fiscal year 2017-201 8, co-occurring substance use disorders were present in 40-50 % of the 400 clients served at our San Mateo County Edison Clinic for complex behavioral he alth and medical health related to HIV, as well as 95% of the180 youth detained at the Youth Services Center. Addiction Medicine Workf orce in the Public Sector Now more than ever, with the opio id crisis, providing addiction treatment is critical. The current addiction treatment workforce is severely under-equipped to mee t the needs of the millions of Americans living with SUD.2 In addition, many individuals who seek treatment in the public sector face a variety of barrier s to care and are subject to so cial determinants of health. While San Mateo Health has expanded treatment for addiction, many local providers have inadequate training in addiction medicine, and treatment sites are often siloed and in need of broader coordination and integrat ion. An Addiction Medicine Fel lowship would develop a workforce with expertise to make a significant impact on the lives of those individuals suffering from substance use disorders in our most underserved communitie s. 1 Defining the Addiction Treatmen t Gap, Open Society Foundations (2010). 2 Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health (2016) Primary Problem: Workforce Capacity to Address the Rising AddictionRelated Conditions INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 3 | Page In the entire San Mateo Co unty Health, including Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS), fewer than ten primary care and psych iatry providers prescribe medications for opioid use di sorder, even though these medications cut the mortalit y rate in half. In February 2019, our ED providers bega n participating in the California Bridge Program ( https://www.bridgetotreatment.org/ ) and administering buprenorphine. While this has bee n a step forward, we are now i n a position where we lack sufficient outpatient providers wh o can continue the treatment and our contracted community Medication Assisted Treatment (MA T) clinic has reached capacity . In this crisis, we have an opportunity to train additional physicians especially in primar y care and psychiatry, to provide this care. An Addiction Medicine Fellowshi p focused on co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders in a co unty/community setting would adv ance us towards the goal of providing high quality, coordi nated treatment of addiction wher e it is needed the most. Addiction Medicine Fellowships p repare medical providers with t he training they need to recognize and treat pat ients with substance use disorders. It i s estimated that the minimum number of addiction medicine fellowships needed to meet the pro jected need for addiction physicians in the U.S. is 125 bu t there are currently only 75; all sponsored by academic centers, the Veterans Administr ation, and nonprof it organizatio ns such as Kaiser Permanente. The first 11 Addiction Medicine F ellowships in academic centers were the model for the rest. However, many individuals with substance use disorders do not have access to care at such sites. Having an Addiction Medi cine Fellowship housed within a county government entity would train a workforce to treat individuals in the most unders erved communities where the toll is the highest. Our fellowship wo uld then be a model for all of California's 58 counties to train their respective workforce in add iction medicine specific for their populations, an opportunity to support retention of a ddiction specialists across counties. PROPOSED PROJECT Describe the INN Projec t you are proposing. A)Provide a brief narrative overview description of the propos ed project. The propos ed project is an accredited Addiction Medicine Fellow ship sponsored by San Mateo County that is tailored to addressing the needs and prior ities of the public sector including; 1) treating the most vulnerable communities with co- occurring substance use disorders, 2) working with peer substance use counselors, and 3 ) advancing equity on multiple levels including contri buting to equity projects in cl inical and community settings. This Addiction Medicine Fellow ship would be the first to be sponsored by a County health agency. \"Your [proposed] program is breaking new ground and demonstrating that all stakeholders are needed to address our state and national addiction medicine workforce needs.\" Executive VP at American College of Academ ic Addiction Medicine (ACAAM) INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 4 | Page Addiction M edicine Fellowship The field of Addiction Medicine recognizes addiction as a disea se and that impacted individuals are vastly underserved. Addiction Medicine Fellowsh ips are a promising approach to develop a workforce wi th expertise in addiction tre atment.3,4 These fellowships are multispecialty training programs that focus on the provision of care for persons with unhealthy substance use, SUD and other addictive d isorders. An Addiction Medicine Fellowship targets candidates from all the m ajor medical fields, such as internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and psychiatry, which can provide counties the flexibilit y to choose candidates depending on where the need is greatest at a given time. For exa mple, one year a physician from family medicine may be accepted, and another year a physician from psychiatry. Fell owship graduates would add to the county and state workfo rce in addiction medicine, pr oviding expert addiction care to our co-occurring clients and valuable consultation to c olleagues. Many individuals seeking treatme nt in San Mateo County do not h ave access to addiction medicine specialists th rough the HMO Kaiser Permanent e, the VA, or academic centers at Stanford a nd UCSF. Our public sector-sponso red fellowship would train physicians to provide add iction treatment to our safety n et population, thereby directly addressing health inequities in our county. Few fellow s in existing fellowship programs get similar training. If A ddiction Medicine is to impa ct public health, a fellowship in a public health system is essential. This project will select applic ants who are dedicated to working with the safety net population and have demonstrated this in their previous trainin g and activities. Our current Psychiatry Residency prog ram follows this selection pro cess and has been successful in bringing on 50% of program graduates per year to our workforce. While there is no guarantee a graduate will choose to become our empl oyee, we expect that by training fellows dedicated to working with the public sector , they will choose to work with this population some where in California. Recruitment of fellows will be fa cilitated by our Psychiatry Re sidency Program as well as by the American College of Ac ademic Addiction Medicine (ACAA M), which provides a website listing fellowship pr ograms and assists with referral s (https://www.acaam.org/fellowship-resource-center/career-center/ fellowship-program- openings/ ). The Psychiatry Residency Program also serves as a potential \"feeder program\" of qualified and highly interested applicants. The project will select \"facult y\" from our county physicians an d contracted physicians who are experienced in treating addiction to support the learni ng of the fellows. This will include at least one psychiatris t and one emergency department physician who are 3 Rasyidi E, Wilkins JN, Danovitc h I. Training th e next generati on of providers in addiction m edicine.

Additionally, the fello wship Program Director is a psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist. We will also pa rticipate in a consortium of Bay Area Addiction Medicine fell owships for educational activit ies, such as case conferences and a journal club, to critically evaluate recent articles in the academic literature. The fellow will also attend the California Society of Addiction Medicine (CSAM) and American Society of A ddiction Medicine (ASAM) confer ences. In addition to standard traini ng opportunities in hospital and outpatient settings, an Addiction Medicine Fellowship a t San Mateo would offer addition al unique public health training opportunities. One exam ple is the Street Medicine elec tive with training opportunities on a field-based m edical and psychiatric service caring for individuals experiencing homelessness as we ll as farmworkers with little ac cess to care at our clinics. Another possible opportu nity would be providing Medica tion-Assisted Treatment (MAT) in our jails, where our inc arcerated population is only b eginning to be offered treatment for addiction. Peer Supports The addiction fellows will work closely with peer case managers , through our existing BHRS Integrated Medication-Assi sted Treatment (IMAT) program. IMAT case managers hire individuals with lived experi ence and are the fir st point of contact for referrals made through the medical center, emergency department , mental health clinics and other primary care settings. IMAT case managers provide co unseling and assist with linkage to a bro ad array of services, such as residential programs, mutual support groups, food banks, and housing programs and other support serv ices for clients in need of or receiving substance abuse treatment. To ensure support at all stages of the recovery spectrum, clients will a lso be linked to our current M HSA-funded Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) ser vices and peer supports offered by Voices of Recovery, http://www.vorsmc.org/wellness-recovery-action-plan.html . Health Equity and Cultural Humility The mission of San Mateo County Health is to serve safety net p opulations. While academic center-run fellowships may expose trainees to some com ponents of public sector work, no other program w ould include the depth of traini ng we would offer. Fellows in our Addiction Medici ne program would receive foundational training in social determinants of health, barriers to accessing care, and cultura l humility. The addiction medicine fellow wou ld participate in employee-wid e trainings including Cultural Humility 101, Becoming Visible: U sing Cultural Humilit y in Asking Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) questions, and Working with Interpreters. The psychiatry residency program under which the fellowship would b e housed is cutting- edge in its active teaching of structural humility and promotio n of physician work to advance health equity on multip le levels. In a ddition to their clinical work with a diverse population, residents engage in learning sessions across discip lines (health providers, community workers, policy advoca tes) to review health disparities in our communities and find opportunities for interv ention at the individual, institutional, and policy levels, such as Culturally and Linguistic ally Accessible Services (CLAS ) standards. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 6 | Page Fellows would be required to participate in this classroom lear ning as well as to engage in a community advocacy activity outside their usual work responsibilities. The advocacy activity aims to emphasize physi cian responsibility to understa nd and address health inequities and to provide an oppor tunity for collaboration with community leaders. Examples include becomi ng a board member of a local substance u se organization or speaking at a school-based mental health conference. This unique San Mateo training experience already serves as a model for other psychiatry resid ency programs and would no doubt serve as a model for future Addiction Medicine F ellowships as well.

Hire program coordinator, identify faculty supervision, clinica l competency committee and program evaluation committee. Develop website content,promote fellowship review applications, interview and hire fellow. The Addiction Medicine Fellow will receive a 2-week clinical an d organizational orientation and with clinical supervision will: Provide a new Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) consultation service in the hospital. This service will coordin ate care with the Psychiatry consultation service. Engaging patient s in the hospital will provide an early start to treatment and increase subsequent outpatient engagement. Add to the workforce of the team providing integrated treatment of co-occuring addiction and mental health disorders within the primary care setting. This team has received close to 3000 referrals since 2015. Provide psychiatric and substance use disorder evaluations and treatment in the HIV Clinic and Pain Clinic, both of which have a high percentage of patients with co-occuring disorders. Current ly, these clinics offer mental health treatment but lack expertise in treating co-occurring addiction. Provide psychiatric and substance use disorder evaluations and treatment on the Street Medicine team, which treats both the homeless and farmworkers. As an elective, assist with implementation of MAT in Correction al Health, where many inmates have co-occuring disorders. Provide training in substance use disorders and co-occuring disorders to other providers and clinicians. In all clinical settings, will work closely with peer case mana gers who will provide counseling and assist with linkage to a broad array of services, such as residential programs, mutual support groups, food banks, and housing programs. Develop sustainability and retention strategies - work closely w ith the San Mateo County Workforce Education and Training team to inform st rategies that resonate with fellows Project implementation activities: INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 8 | Page B) Identify which of the three project general requirements spe cified above [per CCR, Title 9, Sect. 3910(a)] the project will implement. Increases the quality of mental health services, including meas ured outcomes C)Briefly explain how you have determined that your selected a pproach is appro priate. Based on a comprehensive review of the needs in addiction-relat ed conditions and treatment, the following key cons iderations wer e identified: 1. Workforce capacity: considering the current opioid crisis and the prevalenc e of co-occurr ing mental health and substance use conditions amongst behav ioral health care clients, the current a ddiction treatment workforce i s severel y under capacity to meet the needs of co- occurring clients. 2. County government context: County services are on the ground in t he community providing s afety net services a nd early intervention. An addict ion fellowsh ip spons ored by the County should be developed to leverage these l earning opportunit ies for fellows. 3. Behavioral health equi ty and cultural humility: core principles for behav ioral health include cultural humility and advanc ing behavioral healt h equity. An addiction fellows hip sponsored by the County will need to be in tegrated into the active teac hing of structural hu mility and reducing health disp aritie s. Thes e considerations are the su pporting evidence for the propos ed intervention and selected approaches for this pro ject. Appendix 1. Theory of Change illustrates the pathways between these three key considerations, the interventions or activities, expected outcomes, and learning objectives. D)Estimate the number of individuals expected to be served ann ua lly and how yo u arrived at this number. Based on c urrent San Mateo County outpatient visits and consult ation with other Bay Area fellowship directors, the expected impact is as follows: 1,400 combined initial evaluatio ns and follow-up visits per ye ar Increase engagement with outpatien t care after hospital discha rge Decrease visits to Emergency De partment and Psychiatric Emerge ncy Services Decrease hospital admissions Decrease alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use (measured by s elf-report and urine drug screens) Improved mental health (meas ured by mood and anxiety scales)INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 9 | Page E) Describe the population to be served, including relevant dem ographic information (age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/ or langu age used to communicate). BHRS offers services primarily fo r individuals w ho are eligible for Medi-Cal or Medicare, as well as to those i ndividuals of the safety net population who are not eligible for Medi-Cal or Medica re. BHRS provides services to approximately 15,000 individuals annually. Of those i ndividuals referred to our Int egrated Medication Assisted Treatment program in 2016-2017, 77% identified as male , 23% as female; 50% 38% Hispanic, 6% 2% Asian, and 4% English, 17% Spanish, 3% Other; 25% were homeless. At the integrated primary care outpatien t clinic where the fellow will practice, 85% are Hispanic. RESEARCH ON INN COMPONENT A)What are you proposing that distinguishes your project from similar projects tha t other counties and/or providers have already tested or implemente d? This Addiction Medicine Fellowshi p would be the first to be spo nsored by a County health agency. The key differences with the proposed project ar e as follows: Sponsored and fully implemented wi thin a County government ent ity to develop specific workforce capacity and skills, increasing acces s to tr eatment. Experiences and expectations of the fellows are integrated wit hin the context and priorities of community behav ioral health. For ex ample, fe llows can provide treatment to farmwork ers and the homeless, fellows will be expe cted to par ticipate in one advocacy activity and health disparity learning sessions. B) Describe the efforts made to investigate existing models or approaches clos e to w hat you're propo sing. Have you identi fied gaps in the liter ature or existing practice that your project would seek to address? Please provid e citations a nd links to where you have gathered this information. The literature review identified research gaps on these subject s and areas of focus for this project: INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 10 | Page Gaps in the literature and practice Proposed intervention A review of the list of accredited addiction medicine fellowship s in the US reveals none housed in a county entity. Correspondence with Executive Vice President of Academic College of Academic Addiction Medicine (ACAAM) ,(formerly The Addiction Medicine Foundation (TAMF), confirmed we would be the first addiction medicine fellowship housed in a count y entit y. The proposed projec t would create an addiction medicine fellowship in our county health system, housed under our community psychiatry residency program. A more in-depth review of the fellowship rotations reveals a lack of on the ground community services and health equity intervention experiences. S tanford Psychiatry outpatient clinics do not accept Medi-Cal or our locally funded health care program for low-income adults. The UCSF fellowship s erves safety net patients but accepts candidates only from Internal Medicine and Family Practice, not Psychiatry. Kaiser rotations are within the Kaiser hospital and clinics. The VA fellowship accepts only Psychiatry candidates and the rotations are within the Veterans Administration system, Ka iser, and Alta Mira (a private treatment center ). The proposed project will provide the fellows with the context and priorities of community behavioral health. For example: Elective Street Medicine exper ience with the homeless and farmworkers advocacy activity such as becoming a board member of a local substance use organization or speaking at a school-based mental health conference review of local health disparities and identification of opportunities for interven tion Links County_ August 26, 2019 11 | Page LEARNING GOALS/PROJECT AIMS The broad objective of the Innovative Component of the MHSA is to in centivize learning that contributes to the expansion of effective practi ces in the mental heal th system. Describe your learning goals/specific aims and how you hope to contri bute to the expansion of effective practices. A)What is it that you want to learn or better understand over the course of the INN P roject, and why have yo u prioritized these goals? This project will allow us to pilot a new approach to having an Addiction Medici ne Fellowship sponsored by a count y government entity. Given that substance us e dis orders and mental health diso rders have very high rate of co occurrenc e (at least 50% in both direct ions), this can be a mode l for all of Califor nia's 58 counties to t rain their respective workforce in addiction medicine specific for t heir populations. T he specific learning goals to this project are as follows: B) How do your learning goals relate to the key elements/approa ches that are new, changed or adapted in your project? The two key differences with the proposed project include: Sponsored and fully implemented wi thin a County government ent ity to develop specific workforce capacity and skills. (Learning Goal #1) Experiences and expectations of the fellows are integrated wit hin the context and priorities of county behavior al health. (Learning Goal #2 and #3) The learning goals are directly connected to the needs, strategies (including the approaches that are new in the proposed project) and outputs as depicted in Appendix 1.

Specifically, please identify how each goal will be measured and the prop osed data you intend on using . An independent evaluation consult ant will be contracted and monitored by the MHSA Manager in collaboration with the BHRS program coordinator to f ormally evaluate the innovation project. The following depicts a rough evaluation pl an given that the consultant will be hired after the project is approved. The outputs for Learni ng G oal #1 could include: Number co-occurring clients served Number of co-occurring client visits per month Some baseline data exists, while other indicators will be collected as a baseline and tracked throughout the project to inform Learning Goal #1. Measures an d methods could include: Percent improvement as measured by: o Decreased hospitalizati ons (baseline available) o Decreased ED/PES visits (baseline available) o Increased engagement in outpat ient care (# visits) o Decreased alcohol, tobacco, and drug use (self-report and drug screens) o Improved mental health (mood and anxiety scales) Additionally , demographics and quality of life indicators can be collected at intake. The outputs for Learni ng G oal #2 could include: Number of community opportuniti es and types that fellows part icipate in. Fellows will be assigned to engage in at least one advocacy activity outside their usual work responsibilities that focuses on building oppor tunities for com munity change. Additionally, interviews with fellows can help us determine the level of engagement , the level of confidence in impacting community, policy, etc. and satisfaction with the fellowship.

COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING Please describe the County's Community Pr ogram Planning (CPP) process for the Innovative Project, encompassing inclusion of stakeholders, representatives of unserved or under- served populations, and indivi duals who reflect the cultural , ethnic and racial diversity of the County's community. In San Mateo, the CPP process for Innovation Projects begins wi th the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A comprehensive community needs assessme nt process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for services, which a re used as the basis for the development of Innovation projects. Appendix 2 illustrates and describes the Three-Year Plan CPP process for San Mateo County. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innova tion ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovati on Idea Form were circulated t hrough various means: Flyers are sent to/placed at C ounty facilities, as well as ot her venues like family resource centers and community-based organizations; Announcements at numerous inter nal and external community mee tings; Announcements at program activ ities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambassador Program, Lived Experience Ac ademy, etc.); Does an addiction medicine fello wship improve coordination and integration of addi ction treatment?Learning Goal #3INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 14 | Page E-mails disseminating inform ation to over 1,500 community mem bers and partners; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stake holders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA w ebpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa, the BHRS Blog www.smc bhrsblog.org MHSA Innovation brainstorming sessions held with groups that requested it (Lived Experience Workgroup, MH SARC Older Adult Committee). The MHSA Innovation Idea Form requested narrative on the propos ed idea/project and information to ensure the idea meets the requirements for Innov ation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County we had the requirement that the idea address t he MHSA Three-Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of older adults across services an d prevention activities Culturally relevant out reach and service delivery Integration of peer/family suppor ts across services and prevention activities Integration of co-occurring pr actices across services and prevention activities Engagement services for trans ition-age youth (mentoring, education, peer support) Broader housing options to suppor t individuals across the con tinuum of care We received 35 MHSA Innovation Idea Forms, which speaks to the need for innovation in serving some of our most vulnerable communities' needs. All sub mitted ideas were pre- screened against the Innovation r equirements, twenty-one were m oved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of diverse clients, family members, community service pro viders and staff. All projects we re reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Im pact/Effort assessment and scor ing. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into full Innovation project proposals for approval by the Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission (M HSOAC). On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steer ing Committee met to review the 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerations for the projects. The MHSARC voted to open the 30- day public comment period and reviewed substantive comments, including MHSOAC comments, during the public hearing and closing of the public comment period on November 6, 2019; all comments are included in Appendix 3. MHSA GENERAL STANDARDS Using specific examples, briefly describe how y our INN Project reflects, and is consistent with, all potentially applicable MHSA General Standards listed below as set forth in Title 9 California Code of Regulations, Section 3320 (Please refer to the MHSOAC Innovation Review Tool for definitions of and references for each of the General Standards.) If one or more general standards could not be applied to your INN Project, please explain why. A) Community Collaboration The planning and implementation of the fellowship would bring t ogether stakeholders from all parts of the system in order to provide both state of the art training for the fellow and addiction treat ment for our clients.INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 15 | Page B)Cultural Compet ency The traini ng context for fello ws will include cultural humility and health equi ty concepts. This will support culturally responsive servi ces for some of the most vulnerable cli ents. C) Client/Family-Drive n Client recipients of services wi ll be driving the services prov ided. Clients and family members will be engaged in an advisory capacity. The evaluatio n contractor will gather input on the evaluation questions and strategies, develo p quarterly progress reports to share preliminary findings and gather input from an advisory group made up of clients and family members. T he Mental Health Substance Abu se and Reco very Commission Adult Commi ttee, which is made up of clients, family members and providers will be an ideal resource for this role. D) Wellness, Recovery, an d Resilience-Focused Supporting wellness, recovery and resilience is accomplished th rough relationships and social networks, fl exibilit y, respect and responsiveness, a nd taking a wholistic approach that considers overall health, stable housing, indepen dence, etc. Th ese principles are key to th e strategies of the proposed project; a ddiction medicine believe s that people can recover and supports individuals through their rec overy. E) Integrated Service Experien ce for Clients and Famili es Pre-launch planning will be critical to offering an integrated service experience for recipients. Fellows will need to be well-informed on the full range of services at BHRS and the community and build relat ionships with gatekeepers to e nsure a coordinated referral and warm hand-off proce ss. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN EVALUATION Explain how you pl an to ensure that the Project eval uation is culturally competent and includes meaningful stakeholder participation. As mentioned earlier, the evaluation contractor will engage an advisory group of diverse clients, family members and prov iders to gather input on the evaluation questions, strategies and on quarterly progress repor ts. Cultural and language demogr aphics will be collected and analyzed as part of the quarterly reports to ensure equal acces s to services among racial/ethnic, cultural, and li nguistic populations or communities. The quarterly reports will be used to inform and adjust as needed the direction, outreach str ategies and activities. INNOVATION PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE Briefly describe how the County will decide whether it will continue with the INN project in its entirety or keep particular elements of the IN N project without utiliz ing INN Funds following project completion. Will individuals with serious mental illness receive services from the proposed project? If yes, describ e how you plan to protect and provide continuity of care for these individuals upon project completion. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 16 | Page The advisory group will be engaged in the evaluation and adjust ments of the project. In addition, th e MHSA Steering Committ ee will be a venue for vetting next steps with diverse stakeholders. If the evaluation indicates that the proposed project is an effective means of improving the quality of services for individual with co-occurr ing conditions, and there is availability of MHSA Community Services and Supports, General S ystems Development funding, a proposal of continuat ion would be brought to the MHS A Steering Committee and the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Recovery Commission for approval and to a 30-day public comment process to secure ongoing MHSA funding. A sustainability and workforce retention plan will be developed. COMMUNICATION AND D I SSEMINATION PLAN Describe how you plan to communicate results, newly demonstrated successful practices, and lessons learned from your INN Project. A) How do you plan to disseminate information to stakeholders w ithi n your county and (if applicable) to other counties? How will progr am partic ipants or other stakeholders be involved in communication efforts? MHSA implementation is very much a part of BHRS' day-to-day bus iness. Information is shared, and input collected with a diverse group of stakehol ders, on an ongoing basis. All MHSA information is made available to stakeholders on the MHSA webpage, www.smch ealth.org/bhrs/mhsa. The site includes a subscription f eature to receive an email notification when the webs ite is updated with MHSA develo pments, meetings and opportunities for input. This is currently at over 1,500 subscr ibers. The BHRS's e-journal, Wellness Matters is published the first W ednesday of every other month and distributed electronically to county wide partn ers and stakeholders, and serves as an information di ssemination and educational tool , with a standing column written by the County's MHSA Manager. The BHRS Blog also provides a forum for sharing and dissem inating info rmation broadly. In addition , presentations and ongoing progress reports are pro vided by BHRS, and input is sou ght on an ongoing basis at the monthly Mental Hea lth and Subs tance Abuse and Reco very Commission meeting at the MHSA Steering Commi ttee meeting; at meetings wit h community partners and advocates; and internally with staff. Opportunities to prese nt at statewide conferences will also be sought.

Community Planning Process for MHSA ThreeYear Plan From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Plan FY 20172020 Community Program planning (CPP) process In December 2016, a comprehensive Community Program Planning (C PP) process to develop the MHSA ThreeYear Plan was kicke d off by our local mental hea lth board, the Mental Health and Substance Use Recovery Commi ssion (MHSARC). Planning was l ed by the MHSA Manager and the Director of BHRS along with the MHSARC and the MHSA Ste ering Committee. A draft CPP process was presente d to and vetted by the MHSARC. The MHSARC was asked for their input and comments on the process and what other stakehol der groups should we be reaching out to in each of the CPP Phases. STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED Input was sought from twenty ni ne diverse groups and vulnerable populations to include perspectives of different backgrounds and interests including g eographical, ethnic, cultural and From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 social economic, providers and re cipients of behavioral health care services and other sectors, clients and their family membe rs. See the full list of input s essions below. Additionally, a PreLaunch sessi on was held with clients/consum ers hosted by the Peer Recovery Collaborative, a collabo rative of peerrun agencies in cluding California Clubhouse, Heart and Soul and Voice of Recov ery. At this session informat ion was presented and shared to help prepare clients/consumers for the CPP Launch session where they would be providing input and public comment. Discu ssion items included, 1) Backgr ound on MHSA; 2) What to expect at the CPP Launch session; and 2) How to prepare a publi c comment. Extensive outreach was conducted to promote two key public meet ings, the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017 and the CPP Prioritization Session on April 26, 2017. Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Samoan. Stipends to consumers/clients and their fami ly members, language interpreta tion, child care for families and refreshments were provided at each of these sessions. Over 270 participated in the se ssions, 156 demographic sheets w ere collected and of these 37% identified as clients/consumers and family members and 36 stipe nds were provided. The majority of participants at these two public meetings (64%) represented central and south geographical areas of the county. There are institutional barriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (trust, transportation, cultural and language, etc.). In an effort to account for this, two additional Community Prioritization Sessions were conducted in East Palo Alto and the Coastside. In the future, we will add a community session in the north part of the county as of aConsumer/Client Provider ofBehavioral HealthServices Provider of Healthand Social Services Decline to state Disability Represented Grou ps From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Date Stakeholder Group 12/7/16 MHSARC and Steering Committee (Input Proces 2/15/17 MHSARC Adult Committee 2/15/17 NAMI Board Meeting 2/16/17 Filipino Mental Health Initiative 2/21/17 Coastside Community Service Area 2/21/17 Northwest Community Service Area 3/1/17 MHSARC Older Adult Committee 3/2/17 Central Community Service Area 3/2/17 Peer Recovery Collaborative 3/3/17 Diversity and Equity Council 3/3/17 Northwest SchoolBased Collaborative 3/7/17 Pacific Peer Recovery Collaborative Session) 3/9/17 East Palo Alto Community Service Area 3/9/17 Central School Collaborative 3/13/17 MHSA Steering Committee (CPP Launch) 3/14/17 African American Community Initiative 3/16/17 Ravenswood SchoolBased Mental Health Collaborative 3/17/17 South Community Service Area and Child/Youth Committee 3/23/17 Chinese Health Initiative 3/23/17 Latino Youth Committee Alto (Communi 4/18/17 Coastside Prioritization Session) 4/19/17 4/20/17 Native American Initiative 4/20/17 Contractor's Association 4/21/17 Latino Immigrant Parent Group 4/24/17 Veterans 4/25/17 TAY recipients of services 4/26/17 MHSA Steering Committee (CPP Prioritization) From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 PHASE 1. NEEDS ANALYSIS To build off of the previous Commu nity Program Planning (CPP) p rocess in FY 2014/15, stakeholders including clients, f amily members, community partn ers and organizations were asked to think about current serv ices as they relate to the gaps in services identified in FY 2014/15 (listed below), specific service categories and populat ions served to identify any additional gaps in services: Cultural humility and stigma Timely access Services for peers and families Services for adults and older adults Early intervention Services for children and TAY Cooccurring services Criminal justice involvement For Phase I and the initial input sessions, stakeholders where asked the following questions, based on the priority gaps ident ified in previous years for con tinuity: From your perpective, do these M HSA services effectively [e.g. serve the cultural and linguistic needs of your target communities, address timely acc ess for your target communities, serve the behavioral healthcare needs of clients a nd families, etc. ]? What's working well? What improvements are needed? Probes: Do these services addr ess principles of wellness and re covery? stigma? Are current collaborations effective in reaching and serving ta rget communities? What is working well? What's missing? All comments received up to the d ate of the CPP Launch Session on March 13th were grouped into themes and presented a t the CPP Launch. Additional input was sought regarding both the needs/service gaps and whet her there were any voices (or communities) missing from t he Needs Analysis phase. The CPP Launch Session was a joint MHSARC and MHSA Steering Committee meeting and included a facilitated community input. Agenda items i ncluded 1) an MHSA Housing propos al for use of unencumbered housing funds 2) public c omment from clients, families and community members on priority needs a nd gaps in mental health services, and 3) breakout g roups to begin developing strategies t o address the key needs/ service gaps identified. About 120 clients, families, community members and stakeholders attended the CPP Launch Session. PHASE 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The Strategy Development Phase w as kicked off at the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017. Findings from the initial input sessions were shared at the CPP Launch Session including relevant strategy ideas. From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 While the above six need/gaps in services were identified, ther e was also an overarching theme that arose from the input sessions, which brought to surface co mmon questions in MHSA planning: do we build upon existi ng MHSAfunded programs or do we create new programs? Input session participants identified the need to consider both . It has been 10 years since the inception of MHSA and most progr ams have not received additiona l resources (aside from Cost of Living increases to the contracts) to expand services and/or clients served, especially for those programs that are resulting in positive behavioral health outcomes. Three key next steps for the CPP process were identified at the CPP Launch Session: Additional input sessions with vulnerable populations and key s takeholders identified. Additional strategy development sessions in isolated and higher need communities, in particular East Palo Alto and the Coastside/South Coast region. Follow up meetings with all MHSAfunded programs to identify pr iority program challenges, needs and possible st rategies to address these. PHASE 3. PLAN DEVELOPMENT The final Phase of the CPP Proc ess was kicked off at the CPP Pr ioritization Session on April 26, 2017. The meeting goals were threefold: 1. Present strategy recommendations, results from the Community In put Sessions and prepared public comments in s upport of each recommendation. 2. Provide meeting participants the opportunity to bring forward a ny additional strategy recommendations and to prioritize the additional recommendation s. 3. Prioritize across all strategies proposed (MHSA Steering Commit tee only) to help identify the recommendations to include i n the MHSA ThreeYear Plan. Appendix 3.

Comment Response I would like you to consider co llaborative care with peer certi fied addiction specialists, peers prov iding services and supports in the community Thank you for your input on including a peer component and spec ifically involving Peer Certified Addicti on Specialists, we will add thi s to the proposal. This is critical to r ecovery principles. Currently a s proposed, the IMAT team will provide case manag ement for patients seen by the fellow in the hospitals and clinics. Why MHSA funding and not primary health or drug MediCal dollar s for a medicalbased fellowship. Addiction is a specialty that to uches on all fields of medicine , including mental health. Substance use diso rders and mental health disord ers have a very high rate of cooccurrence (at least 50% in both directi ons). Given this, addiction specialist will receive training in the diagnos is and treatment of mental health disorders. We want people suffering from addiction to be served wherever they enter our health system. In San Mateo County Health, people with only the most serious of menta l illnesses are treated in clinics purely devoted to mental healt h; all others with mild to moderate, and often severe, disorders are treated by primary care providers with the help of integrated behavioral h ealth teams. Most primary care provid ers, hospitalists, and psychiat rists are not trained to treat substance u se disorders. This is one reas on that only ten percent of people with addict ions receive any MH treatment and why MHSA can provide a great opport unity to fill this much needed g ap. Oneyear fellowship then what? Where are the certified addictio n fellows housed, in hospital or BHRS clinics? This proposal is for 3 years, so we would hopefully be able to train 3 fellows, adding to the workforce o f physicians able to treat th is very underserved population. If it is successful, we hope our posit ive findings will help us secure additional f unding. The fellow will be rota ting through various locations such as the int egrated mental health team wit hin primary care, the hospital wards, emergency department, and spe cialty clinics such as the Pain Clinic and Edison Clinic. Additional Public Comments Received Received 7 Public Comments (incl uded below) in support of the A ddiction Fellowship Innovation Project Proposal. Email from Monika K., October 24, 2019 Hi, I am an addiction psychiatri st in San Francisco and part pr esident of the California Society of Addiction Medicine (CSAM). There is an ongoing shortage of qual ified addiction medicine providers in the Bay Area and ac ross the state as well as the c ountry. I would strongly support the planned Addiction Medicine F ellowship for San Mateo County. Local training will aide developing a local addiction medicine work force and improve ac cess and quality of care for patients. Sincerely Monika Koch MD PhD FASAM Public Comment Form submitted October 27, 2019 by Lori D.K., MD , Veterans Administration Physicians need increased training in addiction medicine, and w e need new leaders in th is field to serve our next generations of patients. While Substance Use Di sorder(SUD) is an eq ual opportunity illne ss, often the persons most severely affected by SUD(s) lose their jo bs, health insurance, and famil y support. It is the San Mateo County Health System that serves as the 'safety net' for these individuals. Training Addiction Fellows to work in the County Health System can increase service delivery immediately, and bolster the county's workforce to effectively care for this population over the longterm. Governor Gavin Newsome plans t o spend 500 million dollars over the next five years to improve the health and reduce recidivism of California's justiceinvolved populati on. California Prisons and Jails have a new mandate to provide Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT) with Bupr enorphine or Naltrexone to incarcerated persons who have opioid use diso rders. Throughout the state, t his may affect as many as 70,000 of CDCR's 130,000 prisoners. MAT has been p roven to lower mortality and prevent overdose, especially during the first two weeks after an inmate is released from incarceration. However, who will continue caring for these patients and providing these medi cations? It will be the Count ies who will need to provide reentry services. The San Mateo County Fellowship can proactively address this is sue. The Addiction Medicine Fellowship can provide a skilled physician workforce to enable continuity of care for its residents, and to make this initiative a success. Email from Anna L., October 28, 2019 We have a shortage of physicians trained in treating addiction. Substance use disorders occur in about 50% of people with mental illness, a nd worsen their prognosis. Peo ple with mental illness, like all people, receive treatment in hospitals a nd primary care, mental health, and specialty clinics, so all physicians need to be able to recognize and either treat or refer for treatment . This fellowship would train physicians of all backgrounds to diagnose and treat people with substance use dis orders. County safety net health systems can benefit immensely by addictio n medicine training opportunit ies such as this, and if San Mateo County Health is successful in this pro ject, it will be a model for al l California counties. Sincerely, Anna Lembke, MD Associate Professor, Psychia try and Behavioral Sciences Medical Director, Addiction Medicine Program Director, Addiction Medicine Fellowship Chief, Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic Stanford University School of Medicine Public Comment Form submitted October 30, 2019 by Vivian L., Sa n Mateo Medical Center I am an Infectious Diseases (ID) physician, and Chief of ID at San Mateo Medical Center (SMMC). Addiction is a driver of infection, specifically viral hepatitis, HIV and sexually transmitted infections. The creation of an Addiction Medicine Fellowship program at SMM C would serve an esse ntial function of integrating the myriad of provid ers who provide services to pat ients with addiction. It would increase the workforce trained in Addiction Me dicine, promote collaboration within SMC Healt h System and in surrounding counties. SMMC would also be the first Addiction Me dicine fellowship program based in a local health safety net health system, serving as a model for Califor nia's 58 counties. I urge you to support this essential and wise investment. Email from Jean M., November 4, 2019 Yes, I am in favor of the addiction fellowship application. To sum up my comments, I believe it is a lot of return on investment, that the p roposal is well written and amb itious to get the most out of the training program for the county. I like that they trainees will be expec ted to also develop ad vocacy skills and do education/outreach as part of their experience. Best, Jean Email from Paula L., November 5, 2019 I am writing as a primary care internist and addiction medicine physician to support MHSA funding for an addiction medicine fellowship embedded in the public health sys tem of San Mateo County. Such a program has the potential to greatly imp rove the health and wellbeing of county residents of all ages in both urban and rural settings. In San Mate o and other counties in Califor nia, there is a tragically unmet need for a nimble health professional workf orce that can identify and trea t unhealthy alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. Many primary care and behavioral health providers in prac tice today have rec eived little or no evidencebased education in addiction medicine during their tra ining; they lack the confidence and skills needed to identify, prevent and manage this complex, stigmatize d, but common disorder. Alcohol and tobacco still kill and injure mor e people than most other disea ses. An opioid and methamphetamine epidemic strike daily at the heart of our community. This has only escalated in the Bay Area as income disparities widen and the role of social determinants of health are magnified. Despa ir grows, families are broken and lives are lost. The b enefit of a public health appro ach to substance use disorders and the potential of a public sector addi ction medicine fellowship is m ultiplicative. A fellowship not only expands the public health addiction medi cine workforce available in the county, but it also develops providers with the leadership skills and experti se to teach and support primar y care and behavioral health providers in the larger system of health care. S ubstance use disorders are prev entable and treatable. Prevention and treatment saves lives. Respectfully submitted, Paula J . Lum, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine Program Director, UCSF Primary C are Addiction Medicine Fellowsh ip HIV, ID and Global Medicine Division, University of California, San Francisco and San Francisco Gener al Hospital Email from Farah Z., November 6, 2019 Hi Ms. Estremera, I hope you are well! I wanted to send you my comments in strong support of Addiction Medicine Fellowship proposal for San Mateo County. As a psychiatrist, I work on a regular basis with diverse patient population struggling with CoOccurring substance use and Me ntal health disorder. Despite SUD prevalent in our patient population, a very small percentage of patients receive treatment. The patien ts who are willing to engage in SU treatment struggle in finding the providers and treatment due t o many barriers. Addition Medicine Fellowship through County system will help overcome one of the barriers by generating and retaining the workforce of competent physician s for treating complex illness of addiction. Therefore, I fully support this project. Thank you!

Please provide a brief narrative summary of the challen ge or problem that you have identi fied and why it is important to solve for your community. Young Adults and Mental Health According to the National Instit ute of Mental Health, young adu lts (1825 years) have the highest prevalence of mental ill ness, including severe mental i llness. 1 However, young adults with mental illness receive ment al health treatment at a lower rate than adults. Young adults also have higher rates of co-occu rring mental illness and subst ance use disorders. In the United States, in 2018: About one in four young adults aged 18 to 25 (26.3%) had any m ental illness in the past year and 7.7% had a serious mental illness; 7.2% of young adults had co-occ urring mental illness subst ance use disorder.2 In fiscal year (FY) 2016-17, in Sa n Mateo County specifically: Only 4.9% of eligible Medi -Cal 18 to 20-year-old benefic iaries received specialty mental health services. Behavioral Health and Recovery Services, Youth to Adult Transi tion Program serves 300 youth annually, which include s 225 youth who are admitted t o psychiatric emergency services. The program p rovides intensive mental healt h services to 18 to 25- year-olds eligible for Medi-Cal and with serious mental illness . The program receives referrals from Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES), inpatient hospitals, the youth and adult system of care and Childr en Protective Services. Transition into adult hood can be a stressful process, and exace rbated for youth living in poverty, as young people become more self-sufficient, independe nt and begin making decisions that can significantly s hape their lives. This is an important period fo r both promoting linkages to behavioral health se rvices, increasing protective f actors and reducing risk factors and the negative consequences of untreated mental illness. Ensu ring prevention and early intervention for low-income yout h, prior to PES visits and hosp italizations, and meeting the behavioral health needs of this a ge group is an important prior ity for San Mateo County. 1 https://www.nimh.nih.gov/healt h/statistics/mentalillness.shtm l 2 Substance Abuse and Mental Heal th Services Administration (SAM HSA), U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services (HHS RTI International.

Young adults who experience poverty are at risk of adverse mental hea lth and life outcomes including lower school achievement, delin quency, depression and anxiety 3. Families living in poverty face an increased risk of both community and i ndividual trauma4. These families are rarely successfully connected with the m ental health services they nee d. This is exacerbated for youth from vulnerable cultural/ ethnic families. Studies have fo und that youth of color experience higher levels of mental health difficulties due to r acial discrimination, stigma, tendency to not engage in help-seeking behaviors and lack of cu lturally relevant support services. The most common racial or ethnic group living below t he poverty line in San Mateo County is Hispanic. In San Mateo County, 29% of famili es are considered below pover ty based on the California Self-Sufficiency Standard. 5 More impactful is the fact that i nequality conti nues to increa se with the top-income families earning almost 15.8 times more than low -income families.6 San Mateo County has a Gini Co efficient (distribution of househ old income compared to the number of households) of 0.46, one of the highest inequalities among Bay Area counties.

A) Provide a brief narrative overview description of the propos ed project. The proposed project will provide prevention and early interven tion services including behavioral health resources, supports, screening, referrals and linkages to young adults, ages 18-25, on-site at a ffordable housing properties, m inimizing stigma and reducing barriers to accessing behavioral health care. Affordable housing properties off er that ideal space to provide culturally and linguistically competent service s to communities in need, which are often communities of color. There are a total of 86 affordable apartment properti es (2,783 units) in San Mateo County 9 serving low income communiti es. These are housing properties targeting the general low-incom e population, families and farm workers and does not include specialty or supportive h ousing for seniors, people wit h disabilities, MHSA housing, etc. The proposed projec t is prevention and early inte rvention-focused and targets low-income as the ri sk factor for poor behavioral healt h outcomes. Currently, there are supportive s ervices for seniors and indivi duals living with mental illness. There are educational act ivities such as after-school program for youth, managing assets, English-language fluency, computer literacy, p hysical health screenings and linkages offered at low-income housing. The prop osed project will focus on providing behavioral health prevention and early inter vention services including linkages, specifical ly targeted to young adults. Co-location of services in affordable housing complexes By coordinating access to behaviora l health and social services with affordable housing, low-income residents can have improved health outcomes and qual ity of life, including housing stability. 10 The California Reducing Dispar ities Project (CRDP), an MHSA- funded project and the largest inv estment from a State, in the nation, to look into diverse community perspectives on mental health disparities, re leased the Strategic Plan to Reduce Mental Health Di sparities in 2018. The strategic plan includes recommendation for increasing access to unserved, underserved a nd inappropriately served communities. Co-locating services in spaces where people are comfortable is the first strategy recommended as a first step in making servic es more available to those in need. It makes sense to build supports around the hom e setting. Affordable housing as a hub for services is described in four m ain models 11: Health or social services ar e provided by an outside agency Services and amenities made avai lable to everyone in a buildin g complex by the housing organization Integrated supportive services on-site available to residents with special needs 9 County of San Mateo, San Mateo County Consolidated Plan, 2018 22 10 Carder, PC, Luhr, G, West, M, Morgan, B. 2016.

INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 5 | Page Services on-site available to residents and nearby community These models have been widely r esearched in specific population s such as, the elderly, people living with ment al illness or disabilities, and youth exiting the juvenile justice system and at risk of ex periencing homelessness. Strate gies are primarily focused on supportive and integr ated services. In terms of prev ention, the majority of program focus on environmental fac tors in the physical homes. There is no model targeting prevention and early interventions for young adults s pecifically and even those targeting high risk youth document that further research is needed to determine how to best serve youth between the ages of 18-25 in these sett ings. 12 Behavioral health prevention and early intervention for young adults Despite the high need for mental health services, low-income yo uth are least likely to be connected with high-qual ity mental health care.13 There is a pressing need to develop promising strategies to ensure greater access to approp riate early intervention services among those with the highest risks for developing beha vioral health disorders. Specifically, programs that are c lient driven, culturally respo nsive, target individuals in their natural contexts and take a comprehensive approach that a ddresses relevant social determinants (e.g., housi ng or food insecurity) may be a ssociated with increased engagement. The proposed program will target young adults at af fordable housing properties and surrounding community. A behavioral health youn g adult peer educator and a harm reduction specialist w ith experience in mental healt h and are culturally and linguistically competent to work with the community being serve d, including being affirming of LGBTQ i ndividuals and able to foster a welcoming p lace for all, may provide: Preventative behavioral heal th and harm reduction workshops Peer support group(s) Social determinants of health and behavioral health screenings (specific tools to be determined) Referrals and linkages to resour ces for mental health and subs tance use Crisis support A Young Adult Youth Advisory Board will be established early on in the start-up phase of the project to inform the serv ices, activities, outreach str ategies and evaluation throughout the life of the project. If young adults could be provided behavioral health information , supports and be screened for mental illness early , there is a strong possibilit y that those young adults will increase their overall qua lity of life and lessen the impa ct that undiagnosed mental illness creates by preventing cr ises and connecting them to res ources and treatment services. 12 Bardine, Darla, et al., \"Addre ssing the Intersections of Juven ile Justice Involvement and Youth Homelessness: Principles for Change,\" 2017.

Increases access to mental health services to underserved group s C) Briefly explain how you have de termined that your selected a pproach is appropriate. Based on a comprehensive review of published literature, web-ba sed searches, the following were identified as key c onsiderations for the project activities and approach: 1. Early Intervention: Poverty contributes to onset of behav ioral health challenges, early intervention for low-inco me young adults is critical. 2. Ease of access: Co-locating services in sp aces where young adults are comfortable will increase access and combat stigma. 3. Comprehensive and cultur ally relevant approach: Young adults are more likely to engage with programs that are client driven, cultural ly responsive and take a comprehensive approach that addresses relevant social de terminants Project startup - hire peer educator and harm reduction specialist(s), identify screening tools and referral resources, establish crisis protocols, etc. Establish Young Adult Advisory Board for the project and conduc t assessment (interviews/surveys) t o detetermine relevant activit ies, workshop topics and outreach/inc entive strategies for young adu lt engagement. Create \"safe\" settings and acti vities at housing properties for young adults to discuss amongst peers and engage in topics that are relevant to their every day stressors, needs and interests decreasing barriers and stigma related to accessing behavioral health services. Conduct Preventative and Harm R eduction Workshops and Peer Support Groups. Screen young adults for behavioral health issues and social determinants of health to pr ovide appropriate linkages. Refer and provide warm hand-offs to connect the young adults to appropriate behavioral health services and supports. Once identified additional prevent ive interventions may be put in place to support and reduce identified stressors. Project implementation activities:INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 7 | Page (e.g., housing or food insecurity). These findings were used as su pporting evidence for the propose d interventions and selected approach for this proje ct. Appendix 1. Theory of Chang e illustrates the pathways between these five key considerations, the interventions or act ivities, expected outcomes, and learning objectives. D) Estimate the number of individuals expected to be served ann ually and how you arrived at this number. The project team will outreac h to young adults living at afford able housing complexes. There are a total of 86 affo rdable apartment properties (2,783 units) in San Mateo County serving low income communities. The expected reach based on this data is as follows: 80 workshops offered at 10 affordable housing complexes 150 young adults participate in s ervices provided on-site o 90% increased knowledge about behavioral health. o 90% reduced stigma 120 number of young adults screened 30% will be referred to socia l and/or behavioral health servic es 70% of young adults referred to b ehavioral health service will receive treatment 80% of the young adults who are found to have mental illness a nd receive treatment will report: o Increased understanding of their emotions o Increased understanding of mental illness E) Describe the population to be served, including relevant dem ographic information (age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/or language used to communicate). In San Mateo County, 29% of famili es are considered below pover ty based on the California Self-Sufficiency Stand ard. 8% of the White populatio n live below the poverty line; compared to 20% of Latinos and 5% of Asians. RESEARCH ON INN COMPONENT A) What are you proposing that distinguishes your project from similar projects that other counties and/or providers have already tested or implemen ted? Co-location of services is a wel l-documented best practice part icularly as it relates to co-locating services in schools and primary health care setting s or co-locating various health and social services, and co -locating services in support ive housing for seniors and individuals living with mental illness. The key differences with the proposed project include: INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 8 | Page Co-locating prevention and early intervention services targeting young adults in affordable hous ing complexes. Integrating comprehensive approach that considers cultural relevance and addresses social determinants of health. The innovation will offer a 1) cultur ally responsive prevention and early intervention services including linkages to 2) young adults that are 3)co-located in affordable housing complexes. B) Describe the efforts made to investigate existing models or approaches close to what you're proposing. Have you identified gaps in the liter ature or existing practice that your project would seek to address? Please provid e citations and links to where you have gathered this information. Literature searches were conduct ed through the San Mateo Medica l Center Inter Library Loan system, G oogle Scholar and Google search engine. T he subjects searched included: \"co-location of mental health services;\" \"co -location of mental health services in affordable housing complexes;\" \"affordable housing as service hubs;\" \"young adults and mental health outcomes;\" \"mental health and l ow-income families.\" Gaps in the literature and practice Proposed intervention A search for co-location of services in affordable housing revealed a gap in best practices for behavioral health prevention and early intervention for young adults. Most co-location of services target special populations ( elderly, homeless youth, people living with mental illne ss or disabilities, etc.). Strategies are primarily focused on supportive and integrated direct services vs. prevention. The proposed project will develop a best practice for: 1) targeting young adults 2) focus on prevention Links used to San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 9 | Page LEARNING GOALS/PROJECT AIMS The broad objective of the Innovative Component of the MHSA is to incentivize learning that contributes to the expansion of effective practice s in the mental health system. Describe your learning goals/specific aims and how you hope to contribute to the expansion of effective practices. A) What is it that you want to learn or better understand over the course of the INN Project, and why have you prioritized these goals? B) How do your learning goals rel ate to the key elements/approa ches that are new, changed or adapted in your project? As stated, prior, the two key di fferences with the proposed pro ject include: Co-locating prevention and early intervention services targeti ng young adults in affordable housing complexes. (Learning Goal #1) Integrating comprehensive approa ch that considers cultural rel evance and addresses social determinants of health.

Specifically, pl ease identify how each goal will be measured and the proposed data you intend on using . An independent evaluation consult ant will be contracted and mon itored by the MHSA Manager in collaboration with the BHRS program monitor and the Aging and Adult Services program coordinator to formally e valuate the innovation project . The following depicts a rough evaluation plan given that the c onsultant will be hired after t he project is approved. Given recent research has shown that poverty may contribute to the onset of mental illness. Young adults who experience povert y are at higher risk of adver se mental health and life outcomes including lower school a chievement, delinquency, depre ssion and anxiety. Baseline data for young adults residing in low-income housing is unavail able. School-based data only speaks to youth through age 18. Indi cators will be collected at intake as a baselin and tracked throughout the project. The outputs for Learning G oal #1 could include: Number of workshops offered Number of young adults participating Percent of youth whose mental health improves (suicide ideatio n, anxiety, depression), as determined by pre/post screening. Improved educational, delinquenc y outcomes as determined by pr e/post self- assessment Additionally, demographics of participants will be collected and pr e/post questions on youth risk for mental illness , protective factors , risk factors , etc. Does co-location of behavioral health prevention and early intervention services in affordable housing complexes reach you ng adults at risk for mental illness?Learning Goal #1INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 11 |Page The outputs for Learning G oal #2 could include: Increased knowledge about behavi oral health (pre/post) Reduced stigma (pre/post) Additionally, interviews with young adults engaged in conversat ions and focus groups with workshop participants c an help us determine the level of trust and rapport that was established, the level of confidence in getting support services when/if needed , and satisfaction with the services provided. The outputs for Learning G oal #3 could include: Number of young adults screened Number referred to social and/ or behavioral health services 70% of young adults referred to behavioral health service wil l receive treatment. 80% of the young adults who are found to have mental illness and receive treatment will report: o Increased understanding of their emotions o Increased understanding of mental illness. Additionally, occasional intervie ws with young adults that were referred to services can help us determine whether the youth engaged in support , the level of satisfaction and outcomes of the referrals .

How will the County ensure quality as well as regulatory compliance in these contracted relationships? All BHRS service agr eements (contracts, MO U's) are monitored by a BHRS Manager that has the subject matter expertise. C ontract monitors check-in at le ast monthly with service providers to review challenges, s uccesses, troubleshoot and sta y up-to-date on the progress of the project. Additionally, r eporting deliverables are set i n place in the agreements and linked to invoicing. Payments o f services are contingent on the reporting. Evaluation contracts are monitored in a s imilar fashion by the MHSA Manage r in collaboration with the assigned BHRS Manager. COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING Please describe the County's Community Program Planning (CPP) process for the Innovative Project, encompassing inclusion of stakeholders, representatives of unserved or under- served populations, and individuals who reflect the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity of the County's community. In San Mateo, the CPP process fo r Innovation Projects begins wi th the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A compr ehensive community needs assessme nt process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for services, which a re used as the basis for the development of Innovation proj ects. Appendix 2 illustrates and describes the Three-Year Plan CPP process for San Mateo County. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innova tion ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovati on Idea Form were circulated t hrough various means: Flyers are sent to/placed at C ounty facilities, as well as ot her venues like family resource centers and community-based organizations; Announcements at numerous inter nal and external community mee tings; Announcements at program activ ities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambass ador Program, Lived Experience Ac ademy, etc.); E-mails disseminating inform ation to over 1,500 community mem bers and partners; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stake holders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA w ebpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa, the BHRS the BHRS Blog www.smcbhrsblog.org MHSA Innovation brainstorming sessions held with groups that requested it (Lived Experience Workgroup, MH SARC Older Adult Committee). INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 13 |Page The MHSA Innovation Idea Form r equested narrative on the propos ed idea/project and information to ensure the idea meets the requirements for Innov ation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County we had the r equirement that the idea address t he MHSA Three-Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of o lder adults across services an d prevention activities Culturally relevant out reach and service delivery Integration of peer/family suppor ts across services and preve ntion activities Integration of co-occurring pr actices across services and pre vention activities Engagement services for trans ition-age youth (mentoring, educ ation, peer support) Broader housing options to suppor t individuals across the con tinuum of care We received 35 MHSA Innovation Idea Forms, which speaks to the need for innovation in serving some of our most vulnerable communities' needs. All sub mitted ideas were pre- screened against the Innovation r equirements, twenty-one were m oved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of di verse clients, family members, community service providers and staff. All projects we re reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Impact/Effort assessment and scor ing. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into full Innovation project proposals for approval by the Mental Health Oversigh t and Accountability Commission (M HSOAC). On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee met to review t he 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerati ons for the projects. The MHSARC voted to open the 30-day public comment period and reviewed MHSOAC comments, during the public hearing and closing of the public comment period on November 6, 2019. No ot her substantive comments were received. All comment s are included in Appendix 3. MHSA GENERAL STANDARDS Using specific examples, briefly describe how y our INN Project reflects, and is consistent with, all potentially applicable MHSA General Standards listed below as set forth in Title 9 California Code of Regulations, Section 3320 (Please refer to the MHSOAC Innovation Review Tool for definitions of and references for each of the General Standards.) If one or more general standards could not be applied to your INN Project, please explain why. A) Community Collaboration The proposed project will require collaboration with youth to e nsure the most culturally relevant engagement strategies are employed; with service provi ders to bring appropriate services to the y oung adults and allow for linkages and warm hand-offs; and the community at-large since service will be available to t he surrounding community. B) Cultural Competency In order to deliver culturally r esponsive servic es, ideally a p eer staff that's bilingual/bicultural Spanish speak ing, with personal experience with mental health, to represent the low-inc ome young adults being served. This will support trust-build ing and linkages. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 14 |Page C) Client/Family-Driven As mentioned above, young adults wi ll be driving the linkages m ade and development of any additional resources and interventions needed. The eval uation contractor will gather input on the eval uation questions and strategies, develo p quarterly progress reports to share preliminary findings and gather input from an advisory group made up of young adults, clients and family members. The Mental Health Substance Abuse and Recovery Commission Older Adult C ommittee, which is made up of clients, family members and providers may be an ideal resource for this role. D) Wellness, Recovery, an d Resilience-Focused Supporting wellness, recovery and resilience is accomplished th rough relationships and social networks, flexibilit y, respect and responsiveness, a nd taking a wholistic approach that considers overall health, stable housing, indepen dence, etc. These principles are key to the strat egies of the proposed project in cluding hiring bilingual/bicultural peer ment al health worker to conduct the o utreach, focusing the outreach on trust building, conversations and a process that ai ms to creating safe spaces and reduce stigma and shame. E) Integrated Service Experien ce for Clients and Families A request for proposal process w ill select the service provider that will own the contract for these services. Pre-launch planning and ongoing collaborat ion will be critical to offering an integrated service ex perience for recipients. Staf f will need to be well- informed on the full range of ser vices at BHRS and the communit y and build relationships to ensure a coordi nated referral and warm hand-of f process. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN EVALUATION Explain how you pl an to ensure that the Project eval uation is culturally competent and includes meaningful stakeholder participation. As mentioned earlier, the evaluati on contractor will engage an advisory group of diverse young adults, clients, family mem bers and providers to gather i nput on the evaluation questions, strategies and on quarter ly progress reports. Cultur al and language demographics will be collected and analyzed as part of the quarterly reports to ensure equal access to services among racial/ethnic, c ultural, and linguistic communit ies. The quarterly reports will be used to inform and adjust as needed the direction, outreach str ategies and activities. INNOVATION PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE Briefly describe how the County will decide whether it will continue with the INN project in its entirety or keep particular elements of the INN project without utilizing INN Funds following project completion. Will individuals with serious mental illness receive services from the proposed project? If yes, describe how you plan to prot ect and provide continuity of care for these individuals upon project completion. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 15 |Page The advisory group will be engag ed in the evaluation and adjust ments of the project. In addition, the MHSA Steering Committee will be a venue for vetting next st eps with diverse stakeholders. If the evaluation indicates tha t the proposed project is an eff ective means of increasing access to behavioral health services for at risk older adults and ther e is availability of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) funding , a proposal of continuation wo uld be brought to the MHSA Steering Committee and the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Re covery Commission for approval and to a 30-day public comment process to secure ongoi ng PEI funding. Contractors will be asked to develop a sust ainability plan as part of their project proposal. COMMUNICATION AND D ISSEMINATION PLAN Describe how you plan to communicate results, newly demonstrated successful practices, and lessons learned from your INN Project. A) How do you plan to disseminate information to stakeholders w ithin your county and (if applicable) to other counties? How will program participants or other stakeholders be involved in communication efforts? MHSA implementation is very much a part of BHRS' day-to-day bus iness. Information is shared, and input collected with a diverse group of stakehol ders, on an ongoing basis. All MHSA information is made available to stakeholders on the MHSA webpage, www.smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa. The site includes a subscription f eature to receive an email notification when the webs ite is updated with MHSA develo pments, meetings and opportunities for input. This is c urrently at over 1,500 subscr ibers. The BHRS's e-journal, Wellness Matters is published the first W ednesday of every other month and distributed electr onically to county wide partn ers and stakeholders, and serves as an information di ssemination and educational tool , with a standing column written by the County's MHSA Manager. The BHRS Blog also provides a forum for sharing and disseminating info rmation broadly. In addition , presentations and ongoing progress reports are pro vided by BHRS, and input is sou ght on an ongoing basis at the monthly Mental Hea lth and Substance Abuse and Reco very Commission meeting at the MHSA Steering Commi ttee meeting; at meetings wit h community partners and advocates; and internally with staff. Opportunities to prese nt at statewide conferences will also be sought.

Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Samoan. Stipends to consumers/clients and their fami ly members, language interpretation, child care for families and refreshments were provided at each of these sessions. Over 270 participated in the se ssions, 156 demographic sheets w ere collected and of these 37% identified as clients/consumers and family members and 36 stipe nds were provided. The majority of participants at these two public meetings (64%) represented central and south geographical areas of the county. There are institutional barriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (trust, transportation, cultural and language, etc.). In an effort to account for this, two additional Community Prioritization Sessions were conducted in East Palo Alto and the Coastside.

NEEDS ANALYSIS To build off of the previous Commu nity Program Planning (CPP) p rocess in FY 2014/15, stakeholders including clients, f amily members, community partn ers and organizations were asked to think about current serv ices as they relate to the gaps in services identified in FY 2014/15 (listed below), specific service categories and populat ions served to identify any additional gaps in services: Cultural humility and stigma Timely access Services for peers and families Services for adults and older adults Early intervention Services for children and TAY Cooccurring services Criminal justice involvement For Phase I and the initial input sessions, stakeholders where asked the following questions, based on the priority gaps ident ified in previous years for con tinuity: From your perpective, do these M HSA services effectively [e.g. serve the cultural and linguistic needs of your target communities, address timely acc ess for your target communities, serve the behavioral healthcare needs of clients a nd families, etc. ]? What's working well? What improvements are needed? Probes: Do these services addr ess principles of wellness and re covery? stigma? Are current collaborations effective in reaching and serving ta rget communities? What is working well? What's missing? All comments received up to the d ate of the CPP Launch Session on March 13th were grouped into themes and presented a t the CPP Launch. Additional input was sought regarding both the needs/service gaps and whet her there were any voices (or communities) missing from t he Needs Analysis phase. The CPP Launch Session was a joint MHSARC and MHSA Steering Committee meeting and included a facilitated community input. Agenda items i ncluded 1) an MHSA Housing propos al for use of unencumbered housing funds 2) public c omment from clients, families and community members on priority needs a nd gaps in mental health services, and 3) breakout g roups to begin developing strategies t o address the key needs/ service gaps identified. About 120 clients, families, community members and stakeholders attended the CPP Launch Session. PHASE 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The Strategy Development Phase w as kicked off at the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017. Findings from the initial input sessions were shared at the CPP Launch Session including relevant strategy ideas. From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 While the above six need/gaps in services wer e identified, ther e was also an overarching theme that arose from the input sessions, which brought to surface co mmon questions in MHSA planning: do we build upon existi ng MHSAfunded programs or do we create new programs? Input session participants identified the need to consider both . It has been 10 years since the inception of MHSA and most progr ams have not received additional resources (aside from Cost of Living increases to the contracts) to expand services and/or clients served, especially for those programs that are resulting in positive behavioral health outcomes. Three key next steps for the CPP process were identified at the CPP Launch Session: Additional input sessions with vulnerable populations and key s takeholders identified. Additional strategy development sessions in isolated and higher need communities, in particular East Palo Alto and the Coastside/South Coast region. Follow up meetings with all MHSAfunded programs to identify priority program challenges, needs and possible st rategies to address these. PHASE 3. PLAN DEVELOPMENT The final Phase of the CPP Proc ess was kicked off at the CPP Pr ioritization Session on April 26, 2017. The meeting goals were threefold: 1.Present strategy recommendations, results from the Community In put Sessions and prepared public comments in s upport of each recommendation. 2.Provide meeting participants the opportunity to bring forward a ny additional strategy recommendations and to prioritize the additional recommendation s. 3.Prioritize across all strategies proposed (MHSA Steering Committee only) to help identifythe recommendations to include in the MHSA ThreeYear Plan.

Please provide a brief narrative summary of the challen ge or problem that you have identi fied and why it is important to solve for your community. Older Adult Homelessness According to the Elder Index1, 43% of all adults age 65 years and older do not have enough income to meet their most basic needs. In San Mateo County, that's over 38,000 elders struggling to make ends meet. On the March 10, 2019 Sunday San Francisco Chronicle, the front-page article Homeless After 50 as Safety Net Fails 2, discussed the growing older adult homeless population and expectation that this trend will contin ue to increase. As the article states this problem is especially acute in the Bay Area, where housing costs, including rents, have risen dramatically over the past decade. In San Mateo County, the cost of living is outpacing the fixed incomes and low to moderate assets of older adults, especially for those over 75 years old. In recent years, San Mateo County In fiscal year (FY) 2018-19, San Mateo County Adult Protective Services, a voluntary service unless the person is significant ly compromised, received approx imately 30 referrals of older adults who were evicted or at imm inent risk of eviction; a 30% increase from FY 2015-16. In FY 2015-16, there were 31 housing re lated cases with 7 pending evi ction compared to 191 housing related cases in FY 2017-18 with 23 pending eviction. San Mateo County's TIES Lines, the 24- hour information and emergency response line for older adults a nd people with disabilities, received 3,301 housing related calls and 598 calls regarding ho melessness. With most of these calls, the older adult is calling at a desperate time, e.g. \"Just evicted!\", and few options are available. Referrals are made to homeless programs and shelter s. Yet, homeless shelters are not designed to serve older adult s. Older adults often have phy sical and cognitive challenges including incontinence, multiple medications, usage of durable medical equipment such as walkers and wheelchairs, hearing aids and glasses. As a result, many older adults choose to live in their vehicles over a shelter. Research has found that nearly half of the older homeless adult s are becoming homeless for the first in their lives afte r the age of 50. This cohort of o lder adults have had fewer adverse life experiences and reached more adul t milestones than those with e arlier homelessness. Some researchers have raised the question of whether some individual s who became homeless after age 50 would respond to less intensive intervention than those with earlier homelessness - 1 https://www.ncoa.org/economicsecurity/moneymanagement/elderi ndex/ 2 https://projects.sfchronicle.com /2019/visuals/homelessafter50 / Primary Problem: Housed older adults at risk of homelessness due to economic and emotional stress INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 3 | Page particularly if their homele ssness were addressed early.3 These increase in o lder adult evictions and homelessness led representatives from H uman Services Agency Center on Homelessness, Aging and Adult Services, Behavioral Health and Recovery Services, and several community-based homeless and behaviora l health agencies met to engage in a LEAP process 4 on older adult homelessness that led to further defining the problem and focus on preventing economic stress. Economic & Emotional Stress The National Association of Area Agencies on Aging 2018 Housing and Homelessness5 report, identified indicators that would put older adults at risk of homelessness including, the cost of rental housing, shortages of affo rdable housing, physical and f inancial challenges to pay for home repair and maintenance, and limited federal funding for ho using programs. These challenges create significant \" economic and emot ional stress\" f or the older adult. The physical and mental health consequences o f high social stress include: a nxiety, poor nutrition, medication non-compliance, depression, poor decision maki ng, isolation, and homelessness. Economically and emotionally stressed older a dults are reluctant to seek hel p due to embarrassment, stigma, anxiety, and depression, putting themselves at risk of homeless ness. Older adults who experience stigma and embarrassment older over their economic s tress don't reach out to a peer or a non clinical person to share thei r distress. Compounding any socia l isolation, they may currently be experiencing. There is a cohort of older adults who don't want to contemplate losing their housing; don't discuss worries with others; don't trust or know how to use technology for housing resources; and as voiced by one older adult: \"hope they are not alive to deal wit h a housing crisis arises.\" These older adults are also least likely to reach out for behavioral health services. Older adults often minimize their anxiety and other m ental health related issues. In San Mateo County: In FY 2016-17, 3.5% of adults age 65+ MediCal eligible (19,732 ) received at least one specialty mental healt h service6 In FY 2018-19, the Older Adult System of Integrated Services ( OASIS)7 program, whic h serves adults age 60+ with severe mental illness, served 77 und uplicated client s. In FY 2018-19, the Senior Peer Counseling Program, which offer s emotional support to adults age 55+, served 840 unduplicated clients. 3 Brown, R.

Adult Protective Ser vices social worker INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 4 | Page PROPOSED PROJECT Describe the INN Projec t you are proposing. A)Provide a brief narrative overview description of the propos ed project. The propos ed project will reac h-out and engage isolated older a dults who may be at risk of becoming homeless. Trust and safety will be established to reduce shame/stigma. Older adults will be screened for economic stress , behavioral health issues, and connected to homel ess, housing and behavioral healt h resources for planning, and support, to prevent acute homelessness and to slo w the growing older adult homeless population trend. Reaching out to isolated older adul ts at risk of becoming homeless The proposed project will focus on strategies that prevent hous ing loss in late life and provide early support for currently housed older adults at risk of becoming homeless based on the indicators cited in the literature. Identifying th ose at high risk of losing housing in late life and working to prevent housing loss or pro vide early support to help older adults remain in their homes is recommended in the research as an effective strategy to prevent progression to chronic homelessness in these adults.8 The Older Americans Act (OAA) C ongregate Nutrition and Home-Delivered Meals Programs can provide ideal entry points to reach-out to isolated older adults at risk of becoming homeless. These programs provide nutrition services to homebound older adults who have potentially the greatest economic or social nee ds. In FY 2018-2019, approximately 4, 950 eligible 60+ older adults received meals at a nutrition site; and approximately 1,185 eligible 60+ older adul ts received Home Delivered Meals in San Mateo County. Bot h programs are staffed with non clinicians and volunteers. The proposed project will hire two full-time be nefited positions, one mental health program coordinator and one peer worker/coach to fulfill the projects' objectives. The peer worker/coac h will be an older adult with \"lived experience\" as a current or past consumer of behavio ral health services. They will partner with the two nutrition programs in two dispar ate cities, engage and establis h trust with the older adult meal recipients through individual and group conversations abou t economic stress and behavioral health. 8 Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016). Pathways to Homelessness among Older Homeless Adults: Results f rom the HOPE HOME Study. Plos O ne, 11(5). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155065 The innovation will create a new partnership between Human Services Agency Center for Homelessness providers, Older American Act pr ograms, Behavioral Health and Recovery Ser vices, and Aging and Adult Se rvices. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 5 | Page Reducing shame/stigma The proposed project wil l provide isolated older adults with a \"safe\" place and person(s) with whom they can engage in conversations related to social an d economic stresses and behavioral health. The \"Behavioral Health Coach Model9\" is a successful strategy that has been implemented in Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) pr operties; by addressing behavioral issues such as disruptive behaviors and hoarding, le ase violations and evictions were reduced for a specific cohort of older adults. T he program also reduced stigma. As residents became aware and saw other residents engag ing with the coaches, they were more likely to self-refer and to refer others to the program. Economic stress The proposed project will develop a screening tool, which curre ntly does not exist, that incorporates the risk factors ci ted in the literature. Several risk factors have been examined by research to identify predictors of homelessness amo ng older adults and include the inability to afford rent increases after retirement ; unexpected disability preventing gainful employmen t to afford rent; apartment fire; l ongterm hoarding behavior leading to eviction; and loss of partner who shared th e cost of housing 10. Brown, et.al. 2016, had similar findings and acknowledged littl e was known about pathways to homelessness among o lder adults in the United State s, yet cited research conducted on older adults in Eng land, which found death of a sp ouse, retirement, loss of housing tied to employment, wor sened mental health problems, cognitive impairments contributing to homelessness in late life. Older adults under economic stress will be linked to housing support services in the community such as, the Pacifica Resource Center and Fair Oaks C ommunity Center in RWC - both Core Service Agencies for emergency housing, rent/mo rtgage, utilities and basic need services; Life Moves in SM, Project WeHOPE in EPA an d St. Vincent de Paul, and Dignity on Wheels, Legal Aid and APS Linkages case ma nagement services. Behavioral health issues The proposed project will screen for behavioral health issues, which often go undiagnosed in older adults. These behavioral health issues may contribute to an older adult's reluctance to seek help when their housing is threatene d. Koychev, et.al., 2016, found anxiety disorder in the elde rly to be twice as common as dementia and 4 6 times more common than major depression . Anxiety was associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress, and cont ributed to the onset of disabilit y. Porensky's, et.al., 2009, found anxiety severity in late life Generalized Anxiety Disor der to be associated with disability and health related quality of life impairments above and beyond the impairments accounted for by depression and medical burden. Older adults with behavioral he alth needs will be linked to services in the community such as Peninsula Family Service , Senior Peer Counseling progra m and/or the San 9 National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, https://www.n4 a.org, Housing and Homelessness: Services and Partnerships to Address a Growing Issue (2018) 10 Shinn, M., Gottlieb, J., Wett, J .

Referrals and warm hand-offs The proposed project will connect older adu lts to housing and b ehavioral health linkages for planning and support to prevent homelessness. Thi s narrow list of resources includes: San Mateo County Human Services Agency, Center on Homelessness ; San Mateo County Core Service A gencies (safety net services); San Mateo County BHRS Senior Peer Counseling program; and community-based bereavem ent, general counseling and crisis services. B) Identify which of the three project general requirements spe cified above [per CCR, Title 9, Sect. 3910(a)] the project will implement. Increases access to mental health services to underserved group s Project team will outreach to i solated older adults through the Congregate Nutrition and Home-D elivered Meal programs. Provide a \"safe\" stigma free c onversation with the home deliver ed meal recipients, on social and economic stresses that may possi bly create an opportunity for economic stress, anxiety and/or depression screening. Create \"safe\" settings at two s enior centers, where congregate nutrition and home delivered meal p rograms exist, for older adu lts to engage in one-on-one with a peer worker/coach and discuss amongst each other, topics relat ed to social and economic stres ses, housing options and planning, to mi tigate the risk of homelessn ess. Develop an economic stress tool, which currently does not exist , that incorporates the risk fact ors cited in t he literature. The peer worker/coach will scr een older adults to identify behavioral health issues and economic stresses that would put older adults at greater r isk of homelessness. Refer and provide warm hand-offs to connect the older adults to appropriate behavioral health services and supports. Once identified additional prevent ive interventions will be put in place to support and reduce identified stressors. Project activities:INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 7 | Page C) Briefly explain how you have de termined that your selected a pproach i s appro priate. Our approach is based on a comp rehensive review of published li terature, web-based searches, and through the developm ent of a LEAP process Improve ment Charter (IP). An IP is a single page living do cument that is visual and descr ibes a problem to be improved. An IP will have a: Business Case; Current State; Fut ure State and Action Plan - in addition to a stated Ta rget Problem and Hypothesis. As mentioned earlier, representatives from Human Services Agency Center on Homelessne ss, Aging and Adult Services, Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services, and se veral community- based homeless and b ehavioral health agencies met to discuss older adults and homelessness and to develop an in itial IP on older adult homele ssness in San Mateo County. The following key learni ngs and characteristics of newly homeless older adults were identified as part of the LEAP IP: 1. S ocially Isolated: older adults were socially isolated prior to becoming homeless 2. Shame and Stigma: older adults did not reach out for help due to s tigma 3. Predictors of Homelessness: there are economic stress warning si gns prior to becom ing homeless 4. Behavioral Health Issues: may contribute to an older adult's reluctance to seek help when t heir hous ing is threatened 5. Preventative Interventions: for housed older adults, less intensive preventative interventions could mitigate the ri sk of becoming homeless These findings were used as su pporting evidence for the propose d interventions and selected approach for this proje ct. Appendix 1. Theory of Chang e illustrates the pathways between these five key considerations, the interventions or act ivities, expected outcomes, and learning objectives. D)Estimate the number of individuals expected to be served ann ua lly and how yo u arrived at this number. A mental health couns elor will out reach to isolated older adult s through the Home- Delivered Meal and Congregate Nutr ition Programs at two senior centers in the cities of Pacifica and Redwood City. These two sites have voiced the most concern about homeless older adults at their ce nter. Pacifica and Redwood City also had the two highest unsheltered homelessnes s count from the 2019 San Mateo County One Day Homeless Count11 (116 and 221, respectively) and t ogether make up 37% of the to tal homeless count. In FY 2018-2019 approximately 4, 950 eligible 60+ older adults r eceived meals at a nutrition site; and approximately 1,185 eligible 60+ older adul ts received home delivered meals in San Mateo County. 11 https://hsa.smcgov.org/sites/hs a.smcgov.org/files/2019%20One%2 0Day%20Homeless%20Count%20report.pdf INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 8 | Page In Pacifica, there were 446 undup licated nutrition site older adults and 131 unduplicated home delivered meal recipients. In Redwood City, there were 230 unduplicated nut rition site ol der adults and 146 unduplicated home deliver ed meal recipients. The expected total annual reach based on this data is as follo ws: 340 home visits by the peer worker/coach 277 initial conversations to build rapport with homebound olde r adults 24 forums held with 6 partici pants on average attending each f orum 75 older adults screened at senior centers 120 homebound older adults screened 195 linkages to behavioral health and housing resources E) Describe the population to be served, including relevant dem ographic information (age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/ or langu age used to communicate). The project aims to serve the so cially and economically challen ged 60+ years of age older adult in the Pacifica and Redwood City communit ies. San Mateo county has a diverse and growing older adult populatio n in general. Yet, Re dwood City is more suburban with a large mono-lingual Spanish speaking community, while Pacifica is a coastal semi-rural community. As the \"baby boomer\" generation ages, our Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in itiativ e is identifying a gro wing number of older adults who identify as lesbian, gay t e 54% 43% 40% Percent of Households Who Are Rent Burdened 48% 55% 52% Percent of Residents Living below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 13% 25% 20% 12 U.S. Census Bureau, 20122016 American Community Survey 5year Estimates INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 9 | Page RESEARCH ON INN COMPONENT A)What are you proposing that distinguishes your project from similar projects that other counties and/or providers have already tested or implemente d? As mentioned, prior, the \"Behavioral Health Coach Model\" is a s uccessful strategy that has been implemented in low incom e older adult properties to he lp address behavioral health needs that resulted in lea se violations or evictions. Th e key differences with the proposed project include: Implementation of the model in co llaboration with the Older Am erican s Act (OAA) Congregate Nutrition and Home-Delivered Meal Programs as a mean s of r eaching isolated older adults at risk of homeless ness. Integrating economic stress conversations and screenings B) Describe the efforts made to investigate existing models or approaches close to what you're proposing. Have you identified gaps in the liter ature or existing practice that your project would seek to address? Please provide citations and links to where you have gathered this information. Literature searches were conduct ed through the San Mateo Medica l Center Inter Library Loan system, G oogle Scholar and Google search engine. T he subjects searched included: \"preventing older adult homelessness\"; \"econ omic stresses and ; \"pathways to older adult homelessness\"; \"stress a nd depression in homeless older adults\"; \"anxiety and depress ion in older adults \"; \"stress and depression in the elderly\". The li terature revi ew identified re search gaps on these subjects and areas of focus for thi s project. Gaps in the literature and practice Proposed intervention Searches for \"economic stress\" and \"stress in the elderly\" mostly produced literature with a clinical/ patholo gical focus. The proposed project will focus on prevention and early intervention efforts. The literature provided s ome insight into older adults' mental health that m ay contribute to their experience with \"economic stress\" and reluctance to seek help if their housi ng situation is at risk and into older adults. The proposed project will incorporate behavioral health screenings and linkages. Searches for screening tools determined that there are NO good screening tools to predict homelessness. The proposed project will develop a screening tool for economic stress-based indicators cited in the literature. Searches for older adult homelessness prevention strategies identified the need for adapting interventions for i ndividuals who become homeless after age 50, which may respond to less intensive interventions than those with earlier homelessness. There is a lack of strategies that focus on preventin g housin g loss in late life.The proposed project will engage housed older adults and provide referrals and warm hand-offs to services and supports to mitigate the risk of homelessness.

Describe your learning goals/specific aims and how you hope to contribute to the expansion of effective practices. A) What is it that you want to learn or better understand over the course of the INN Project, and why have you prioritized these goals? This project will allow us to pilot a new approach to preventin g older adult homelessness through the engagement of isolated older adults in much needed services and supports, including behavioral health services. This has a strong potenti al of statewide learning given that effective ways of reaching and engaging isolated old er adults continues to be a priority for MHSA Prevention and Early Intervention, as is ev ident in recent legislation Senate Bill 1004 which prioritized older adults as one of the p opulation groups lacking adequate mental health services. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 11 | Page The specific learning goals to this project are as follows: B) How do your learning goals rel ate to the key elements/approa ches that are new, changed or adapted in your project? As stated, prior, the two key di fferences with the proposed pro ject include: I mplementation of the Behaviora l Health Coaching model in coll aboration with the Older Americans Act (OAA) Congr egate Nutrition and Home-Deliver ed Meal Programs as a means of reaching isolated ol der adult s at risk of homeles sness. (Learning Goal #1 and #2) Integration of economic stre ss conversations and screenings (Learning Goal #3) The learning goals are directly connected to the needs, strategies (including the approaches that are new in the proposed pr oject) and outputs as depicted in Appendix 1. Theory of Change. Does outreach through congregate nutrition and home delivered meal programs r each isolated older adults?Learning Goal #1 Can peer workers/coaches in these settings (older adult nutrition programs) engage older adults in conversations about economic stress and behavioral health?Learning Goal #2 Does the pairing of behavioral health and economic stress screening for older adults lead to linkages that prevent moresevere behavioral health issues and prevent homelessness?Learning Goal #3INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 12 | Page EVALUATION OR LEARNING PLAN For each of your learni ng goals or specific aims, descr ibe the approach you will take to determine whether the goal or objec tive was met. Specifically, pl ease identify how each goal will be measured and the proposed data you intend on using . An independent evaluation consult ant will be contracted and monitored by the MHSA Manager in collaboration with the BHRS program monitor and the Ag ing and Adult Services program coordinator to formally e valuate the innovation project. The following depicts a rough evaluation plan given that the c onsultant will be hired after t he project is approved. The outputs for Learning G oal #1 could include: Number of home visits with ol der adults completed in partners hip with home delivered meals program Number of forums held with seni or centers in partnership with congregate nutrition program Number of older adults attending the forums Measures and methods could include: Demographic surveys of parti cipants that include questions on existing social supports, networks and participation can help us determine whether the approach reaches isolated older adults. The proposed screening for economic stress and behavioral health issues will allow us to determine if the approac h reaches older adults at risk of homelessness . These indicators will serve as baseline data and will be tracke d throughout the project to inform Learning Goal #2. The outputs for Learning G oal #2 could include: Number of economic stress and behavioral health- related conversations held with homebound older adults Number of economic stress and behavioral health- related forums held and participants attended Does outreach through congregat e nutrition and home delivered meal programs reach isolated older adults at risk of homelessness ?Learning Goal #1 Can peer workers/coaches in these settings (older adult nutrit ion programs) engage older adults in conversations about economic stress and behavioral health?Learning Goal #2INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 13 | Page Measures and methods could include: Interviews with homebound olde r adults and focus groups with f orum participants can help us determine the level of trust and rapport that was established, the level of confidence in getting support services wh en/if needed, and satisfaction w ith the services provided. These indicators will serve as baseline data and tracked throug hout the project to inform Learning Goal #2. The outputs for Learning G oal #3 could include: Number of screenings complet ed with homebound older adults Number of screenings completed at senior centers with older a dults Number of linkages made to behavioral health services Number of linkages made to housing support resources Measures and methods could include: Interviews with older adults that were referred to services ca n help us determine whether older adults engaged in support , both behavioral health and homelessness supports, the level of satisfaction and outcomes of the referrals . These indicators will serve as baseline data throughout the pro ject to inform Learning Goal #3. Additionally, BHRS old er adult client numbers are ava ilable and referrals can be tracked to inform behavioral health linkages. Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements CONTRACTING If you expect to contract out the INN project and/or project evaluation, what project resources will be applied to managing the County's relationshi p to the contractor(s)? How will the County ensure quality as well as regulatory compliance in these contracted relationships? All BHRS service agr eements (contracts, MOU's) are monitored by a BHRS Manager that has the subject matter expertise. C ontract monitors check-in at le ast monthly with service providers to review challenges, s uccesses, troubleshoot and sta y up-to-date on the progress of the project. Additionally, r eporting deliverables are set in place in the agreements and linked to invoicing. Payments of services are contingent on the reporting.

COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING Please describe the County's Community Program Planning (CPP) process for the Innovative Project, encompassing inclusion of stakeholders, representatives of unserved or under- served populations, and individuals who reflect the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity of the County's community. In San Mateo, the CPP process for Innovation Projects begins wi th the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A comprehensive community needs assessme nt process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for services, which a re used as the basis for the development of Innovation projects. Appendix 2 illustrates and describes the Three-Year Plan CPP process for San Mateo County. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innova tion ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovati on Idea Form were circulated t hrough various means: Flyers are sent to/placed at C ounty facilities, as well as ot her venues like family resource centers and community-based organizations; Announcements at numerous inter nal and external community mee tings; Announcements at program activities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambassador Program, Lived Experience Ac ademy, etc.); E-mails disseminating inform ation to over 1,500 community mem bers and partners; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stake holders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA w ebpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa, the BHRS the BHRS Blog www.smcbhrsblog.org MHSA Innovation brainstorming sessions held with groups that requested it (Lived Experienc e Workgroup, MH SARC Older Adult Committee). The MHSA Innovation Idea Form requested narrative on the propos ed idea/pr oject and information to ensure the idea meets the requirements for Innov ation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County we had the requirement that the idea address t he MHSA Three-Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of older adults across services an d prevention activities Culturally relevant out reach and service delivery Integration of peer/family suppor ts across services and prevention activities Integration of co-occurring pr actices across services and pre vention activities Engagement services for trans ition-age youth (mentoring, educ ation, peer support) Broader housing options to suppor t individuals across the con tinuum of care We received 35 MHSA Innovation Idea Forms, which speaks to the need for innovation in serving some of our most vulnerable communities' needs. All sub mitted ideas were pre- screened against the Innovation requirements, twenty-one were m oved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of di verse clients, family INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 15 | Pa ge members, community service providers and staff. All projects we re reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Impact/Effort assessment and scor ing. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into full Innovation project proposals for approval by the Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission (M HSOAC). On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee met to review the 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerations for the projects. The MHSARC voted to open the 30-day public comment period and reviewed substantive comments, including MHSOAC comments, during the public hearing and closing of the public comment period on November 6, 2019; all comments are included in Appendix 3. MHSA GENERAL STANDARDS Using specific examples, briefly describe how your INN Project reflects, and is consistent with, all potentially applicable MHSA General Standards listed below as set forth in Title 9 California Code of Regulations, Section 3320 (Please refer to the MHSOAC Innovation Review Tool for definitions of and references for each of the General Standards.) If one or more general standards could not be applied to your INN Project, please explain why. A) Community Collaboration Collaboration has been integral to the development of this project. Human Services Agency Center on Homelessness, A ging and Adult Services, Behavi oral Health and Recovery Services, and several community-based homeless and behavioral health agencies who represented the needs and concerns of older adults served, met to discuss older adults and homele ssness and to develop an initial improvement plan on older adult homelessness in San Mateo County. The proposed project will require continued partnerships for success specifically between the Older Americans Act ( OAA), Human Services Agency Ce nter for Homelessness, Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS), A ging and Adult Services (AAS), local senior centers and the older adult service recipients. The Congregate Nutrition and Ho me-Delivered Meal Programs and senior centers provide services for ol der adults who have the greatest economic or social needs. The staff and volu nteers are gatekeepers and they have access to an ideal entry point to reaching isolat ed seniors at risk of homelessness. They are a trusted service and space in the community that will be i ntegrating a mental health counselor into rout ine activities and collaborating regularly with AAS to troubleshoot, strategize and monitor the success of the program. Older adult recipients will be engaged in safe conversations a bout economic challenges and behavi oral health, their par tnership and input i nto the process will drive the linkages made and the develop ment or procurement of additional preventive interventions that m ay be needed to support and redu ce identified stressors. B) Cultural Competency The older adult population in the two target area s considered f or this projectINN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 16 | Page are culturally different. In order to deliver culturally respo nsive services, ideally the peer worker/coach w ill be a mature adult with bilin gual/bicultural Spanish speaking skills, with per sonal experience with housing challenges, to represent the low-in come older adults bei ng served in both c ommunities. This will support trust-building and linkages for some of the m ost vulnerable older adults. C) Client/Family-Drive n As mentioned above, older adult recipients of services will be driving the linkages made and development of any additional resources and interventions n eeded. This program is a prevention strateg y target ing individuals that have not be en diagnosed with a mental health condition. Older adults will be engaged in an ad visory capacity. The evaluation contractor will gat her input on the evaluation quest ions and strategies, develop quarterly progress repor ts to share preliminary finding s and gather input from the advisory group. T he Mental Health Substance Abuse and Reco very Commission Older Adult Committee , which is made up of clients, family memb ers and providers is an ideal resource for this role. D) Wellness, Recovery, an d Resilience-Focused Supporting wellness, recovery and resilience is accomplished th rough relationships and social networks, fl exibilit y, respect and responsiveness, a nd taking a wholistic approach that considers overall health, stable housing, indepen dence, etc. Th ese principles are key to the strat egies of the proposed project in cluding hiring bilingual/bicultural peer work er/c oach to conduct the outreach, focusing the outreach on trust bui lding, conversations and a process that aims to cre ating safe spaces and reduce stigma and shame. E) Integrated Service Experien ce for Clients and Famili es A memorandum of understandin g will be drafted between AAS and B HRS, who will be the primary monitors of the work , outlining responsibilities an d expectations for this project. A AS in turn will contra ct with appropriate community service providers. Pre- launch planning and ongoing coll aboration will be critical to o ffering an integrated service ex perience for recipient s. The peer worker/coach will need to be well-informed on the full range of services a t BHRS and the community and bui ld r elations hips with gatekeeper s to ensure a coordina ted referral and warm hand-off process. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN EVALUATION Explain how you pl an to ensure that the Project evaluation is culturally competent and includes meaningful stakeholder participation. As mentioned earlier, the evaluat ion contractor will engage an advisory group of diverse clients, family members and providers to gather input on the evaluation questions, strategies and on quarterly progress reports. Cultural and language demographics will be collected and analyzed as part of the quarterly reports to ensure equal access to services among racial/ethnic, cultural, INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 17 | Page and linguistic populations or communities. The quarterly reports will be used to inform and adjust as needed the direction, outreach strategies and activities. INNOVATION PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE Briefly describe how the County will decide whether it will continue with the INN project in its entirety or keep particular elements of the INN project without utilizing INN Funds following project completion. Will individuals with serious mental illness receive services from the proposed project? If yes, describe how you plan to prot ect and provide continuity of care for these individuals upon project completion. The advisory group will be engag ed in the evaluation and adjustments of the project. In addition, the MHSA Steering Committee will be a venue for vetting next st eps with diverse stakeholders. If the evaluation indicates that the proposed project is an eff ective means of increasing access to behavioral health services for at risk older adults and ther e is availability of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) funding , a proposal of continuation wo uld be brought to the MHSA Steering Committee and the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Re covery Commission for approval and to a 30-day public comment process to secure ongoi ng PEI funding. Contractors will be asked to develop a sustainability plan as part of their project proposal. COMMUNICATION AND D I SSEMINATION PLAN Describe how you plan to communicate results, newly demonstrated successful practices, and lessons learned from your INN Project. A) How do you plan to disseminate information to stakeholders w it hin your county and (if applicable) to other counties? How will program participants or other stakeholders be involved in communication effort s? MHSA implementation is very much a part of BHRS' day-to-day bus iness. Information is shared, and input collected with a diverse group of stakeholders, on an ongoing basis. All MHSA information is made available to stakeholders on the MHSA webpage, www.smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa. The site includes a subscription f eature to receive an email notification when the webs ite is updated with MHSA developments, meetings and opportunities for input. This is currently at over 1,500 subscr ibers. The BHRS's e-journal, Wellness Matters is published the first W ednesday of every other month and distributed electronically to county wide partners and stakeholders, and serves as an information di ssemination and educational tool , with a standing column written by the County's MHSA Manager. The BHRS Blog also provides a forum for sharing and disseminating info rmation broadly. In addition , presentations and ongoing progress reports are pro vided by BHRS, and input is sou ght on an ongoing basis at the monthly Mental Hea lth and Substance Abuse and Reco very Commission meeting at the MHSA Steering Commi ttee meeting; at meetings wit h community partners and advocates; and internally with staff.

Community Planning Process for MHSA ThreeYear Plan From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Plan FY 20172020 Community Program planning (CPP) process In December 2016, a comprehensive Community Program Planning (C PP) process to develop the MHSA ThreeYear Plan was kicke d off by our local mental hea lth board, the Mental Health and Substance Use Recovery Commi ssion (MHSARC). Planning was l ed by the MHSA Manager and the Director of BHRS along with the MHSARC and the MHSA Ste ering Committee. A draft CPP process was presented to and vetted by the MHSARC. The MHSARC was asked for their input and comments on the process and what other stakehol der groups should we be reaching out to in each of the CPP Phases. STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED Input was sought from twenty ni ne diverse groups and vulnerable populations to include perspectives of different backgrounds and interests including g eographical, ethnic, cultural and From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 social economic, providers and recipients of behavioral health care services and other sectors, clients and their family membe rs. See the full list of input s essions below. Additionally, a PreLaunch session w as held with clients/consum ers hosted by the Peer Recovery Collaborative, a collaborative of peerrun agencies in cluding California Clubhouse, Heart and Soul and Voice of Recov ery. At this session informat ion was presented and shared to help prepare clients/consumers for the CPP Launch session where they would be providing input and public comment. Discu ssion items included, 1) Background on MHSA; 2) What to expect at the CPP Launch session; and 2) How to prepare a publi c comment. Extensive outreach was conducted to promote two key public meetings, the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017 and the CPP Prioritization Session on April 26, 2017. Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Samoan. Stipends to consumers/clients and their fami ly members, language interpretation, child care for families and refreshments were provided at each of these sessions. Over 270 participated in the se ssions, 156 demographic sheets w ere collected and of these 37% identified as clients/consumers and family members and 36 stipe nds were provided. The majority of participants at these two public meetings (64%) represented central and south geographical areas of the county. There are institutional barriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (trust, transportation, cultural and language, etc.). In an effort to account for this, two additional Community Prioritization Sessions were conducted in East Palo Alto and the Coastside.

NEEDS ANALYSIS To build off of the previous Commu nity Program Planning (CPP) p rocess in FY 2014/15, stakeholders including clients, f amily members, community partn ers and organizations were asked to think about current serv ices as they relate to the gaps in services identified in FY 2014/15 (listed below), specific service categories and populat ions served to identify any additional gaps in services: Cultural humility and stigma Timely access Services for peers and families Services for adults and older adults Early intervention Services for children and TAY Cooccurring services Criminal justice involvement For Phase I and the initial input sessions, stakeholders where asked the following questions, based on the priority gaps ident ified in previous years for con tinuity: From your perpective, do these M HSA services effectively [e.g. serve the cultural and linguistic needs of your target communities, address timely acc ess for your target communities, serve the behavioral healthcare needs of clients a nd families, etc. ]? What's working well? What improvements are needed? Probes: Do these services addr ess principles of wellness and re covery? stigma? Are current collaborations effective in reaching and serving ta rget communities? What is working well? What's missing? All comments received up to the d ate of the CPP Launch Session on March 13th were grouped into themes and presented a t the CPP Launch. Additional input was sought regarding both the needs/service gaps and whet her there were any voices (or communities) missing from t he Needs Analysis phase. T he CPP Launch Session was a joint MHSARC and MH SA Steering Committee meeting and included a facilitated community input. Agenda items i ncluded 1) an MHSA Housing propos al for use of unencumbered housing funds 2) public c omment from clients, families and community members on priority needs a nd gaps in mental health services, and 3) breakout g roups to begin developing strategies t o address the key needs/ service gaps identified. About 120 clients, families, community members and stakeholders attended the CPP Launch Session. PHASE 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The Strategy Development Phase w as kicked off at the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017. Findings from the initial input sessions were shared at the CPP Launch Session including relevant strategy ideas. From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 While the above six need/gaps in services wer e identified, ther e was also an overarching theme that arose from the input sessions, which brought to surface co mmon questions in MHSA planning: do we build upon existi ng MHSAfunded programs or do we create new programs? Input session participants identified the need to consider both . It has been 10 years since the inception of MHSA and most progr ams have not received additional resources (aside from Cost of Living increases to the contracts) to expand services and/or clients served, especially for those programs that are resulting in positive behavioral health outcomes. Three key next steps for the CPP process were identified at the CPP Launch Session: Additional input sessions with vulnerable populations and key s takeholders identified. Additional strategy development sessions in isolated and higher need communities, in particular East Palo Alto and the Coastside/South Coast region. Follow up meetings with all MHSAfunded programs to identify priority program challenges, needs and possible st rategies to address these. PHASE 3. PLAN DEVELOPMENT The final Phase of the CPP Proc ess was kicked off at the CPP Pr ioritization Session on April 26, 2017. The meeting goals were threefold: 1.Present strategy recommendations, results from the Community In put Sessions and prepared public comments in s upport of each recommendation. 2.Provide meeting participants the opportunity to bring forward a ny additional strategy recommendations and to prioritize the additional recommendation s. 3.Prioritize across all strategies proposed (MHSA Steering Committee only) to help identifythe recommendations to include in the MHSA ThreeYear Plan.

Thank you for your input on incl uding Board and Care residents, we will add this to the proposal. As fo r expansion of the senior peer program, this would not qualify for Inno vation funding as it is a curren t program we have been successfully providing.

Please provide a brief narrative summary of the challen ge or problem that you have identi fied and why it is important to solve for your community. Native Hawaiian/Pacific Is landers & Mental Health Communities of color represent 61% of San Mateo County's popula tion and yet continue to be disproportionately impacted by negative health outcomes. Nat ive Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (NHPI) in S an Mateo County (11,543) 1 account for the largest NHPI population in the Bay Area and are anticipated to double in size by 2040. Add ressing behavioral health inequities impacting the NHPI comm unity in a culturally relevan t manner, is a priority for our County. NHPI value family, church and community. Interconnected ness plays a central role in NHPI identity and yet the NHPI comm unity is often excluded from societal benefits as they experience some of th e highest disparities across various healt h indicators. In San Mateo County: Specialty mental hea lth service penetration rates are lowest f or both youth (1.8%) and adult (2.6%) Asian/Pacific Islander racial group2. In fiscal year 18/19, our Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) served 260 NHPI. NHPI youth in San Mateo County schools (grade 9, 11) reported the highest rates of depression related feelings and s eriously considered attempting suicide in the previous year.3 Pacific Islanders have one of t he highest rates of uninsured a t 19.8%4. The Mental Health Services Act is explicit in the legislation t hat developing culturally relevant strategies for underserved populat ions is a priority. This was core to the California Reducing Disparities Project (CRDP) pr oject, an MHSA- funded project and the largest investment from a State, in the nation, to look i nto diverse community perspect ives on mental health disparities. Most recently, the MHSOAC initiated Youth Innovati on Project shared findings from their youth focus groups and online surveys. Not surprisin gly, lack of cultural competence was identified as a pri ority along with increasing p reventative mental health services in schools. Yet, there are minimal examples of effecti ve NHPI specific programs that promote mental wellness and link the community to services. 1 U.S. Census Bureau, 2018 estimates, https://www.census.gov /quickfacts/sanmat eocountycalifornia 2 Performance Outcomes Adult Spec ialty Mental Health Services Re port, March 22, 2018, https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/pos/ .

Primary Problem: High rates of depression and suicidality amongst NHPI youth INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 3 | Page NHPI College-age Youth College-aged youth are a critical group to engage in behavioral wellness and broader community impact. Many college students experience first onset of mental health and substance use issues during this time. 5 Three out of five co llege students experience overwhelming anxiety6 yet, few seek services. This is exacerbated for youth from vu lnerable cultural/ethnic families. Studi es have found that students of c olor experience higher levels of mental health difficulties due to racial discrimination, stigma , tendency to not engage in help- seeking behaviors and lack of culturally relevant support servi ces7. There is an association between mental health challenges and lower academic achievement and higher dropout rates, especially for ethnic/cu ltural minority groups. Among Pa cific Islanders, 47% of Guamanians, 50% of Native Haw aiians, 54% of Tongans, and 58% of Samoans entered college, but leave with out earning a degree.8 NHPI make up 1.7% (484) of the San Mateo District Community Col lege student enrollment 9. Specifically, for NHPI student s, the gap between accessing beha vioral health services on campus is the expectation tha t they would access services becau se they are in need - experiencing a challenge, cri sis, or trauma. Understanding and supporting cultural identity is critical for college-age youth mental health.10 A variety of studies s how that ethnic minority college students may have fewer i ndirect experiences with help- seeking, such as knowing family members or close friends who have sought professional ps ychological services; may perceive on-campus psychological services as irrelevant and not culturally competent; and may not perceive health service u tilization as an established c ultural practice. Need for Culturally Responsive Behavioral Health Services NHPI's associate individuals wit h mental illness or mental heal th issues as sick or demon- possessed; they are extremely root ed in their faiths and believ e serving God and prayer are the only cures for healing. This highly emphasized stigma force s NHPIs to internalize their emotions and just get over it w hen faced with mental health cha llenges. This stigma serves as an heirloom being passed down from generation to generation. For NHPI students, seeking and speaking to a counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist is such a foreign concept because NHPI families typically deal with their issues at home. Speaking to someone outside of their family unit is disc ouraged because of shame and dishon or to their family name. Another factor is that there ar e few to no NHPI counselors, the rapists, or psychiatrists. This same stands in regard to medical care and higher education.

The current state of behavioral he alth services is not meeting the needs of the NHPI community because the services a re designed without the NHPI co mmunity in mind. NHPIs are expected to utilize behaviora l health services simply becau se they are available when in actuality they do not connect, r esonate, nor appeal to the comm unity. NHPI Leadership Development There is a lack of investment i n personal and professional lead ership development of NHPI to champion solutions for healthier outcomes for their community. Improving behavioral health services in a culturally respons ive way for NHPIs begins with i nvesting in NHPI young leaders. Young people are plugged into their families, respecti ve churches, schools, sports, student groups, and often are res ponsible for caring for their elderly family members. This population of NHPIs have the potential to be the change agents in demystifying and dismantling mental illness and m ental health stigma in their co mmunity. The investment can fund intent ional programming designed by and for NHPI youth to promote linkages, awareness and education about behavioral and emotional health that is culturally relevant to NHPI st udents, and lead to both 1) devel oping NHPI leaders in the community, including potentially a pipeline of NHPIs into the p ublic behavioral health field to that could help transform cultu rally responsive behavioral heal th care services, and 2) begin shifting the cultural norms o f NHPI community to support their emotional wellbeing and behavioral health outcomes. San Mateo County Public Health Chronic Disease and Injury Preve ntion previously sponsored a leadership developmen t program with San Mateo High School NHPI youth. It was through these sessions tha t the need for trauma-informed em otional wellbeing-focused spaces was critical to develop ing resilient youth NHPI leaders. An NHPI student disclosed that they were seeing a therapist in secret because they did no t want to be ostracized by their family. Unfortunately, their visi ts did not last. NHPIs would r ather suffer in silence than bear the weight of shame because fear of being vulnerable, feeling e xposed, and losing face among their families and communities. An NHPI leadership program focus ed on higher educ ation eventual ly had to designate a separate space for students to decompress, take a break, and pr ocess because the material being covered brought up a lot o f past traumas and triggers tha t have not been addressed. It was a lot for NHPI students to hold on to and process while in that space. Thereafter, that space became a staple in the pr ogram. After the program finishe d, NHPI students would express their need for that spac e once they were back in their everyday routines. PROPOSED PROJECT Describe the INN Projec t you are proposing. INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 5 | Page A) Provide a brief narrative overview description of the propos ed project. The proposed project, Pacific Is landers Organizing, Nurturing, and Empowering Everyone to Rise and Serve (PIONE ERS) provides a culturally rel evant behavioral health program for NHPI college-age youth that prioritizes the mental wellbeing of students and their respective co mmunities through empowerment, leadership and advocacy. There is no behavioral health prevention program foc used specifically on NHPI college-age youth; the innovation will offer a cult urally responsi ve behavioral health prevention program for the NHPI community. The PIONEERS program will incr ease access to behavioral health services for NHPI college-age youth by 1) addressi ng mental health challenges 2) increasing awareness about the importance of emotional health; 3) building the capac ity of NHPI advocates for behavioral health; and 4) impro ving culturally competent se rvices and treatment for NHPI students on co llege campuses. The PIONEERS program will tar get NHPI college-age youth and run by a community- based behavioral health provider to support linkages to direct treatment for youth who may need it. The CalMHSA Student M ental Health Program (SMHP), a statewide PEI initiative funded by MHSA, set out to improve student mental he alth across all 114 community college campuses, awa rded 30 campus-based grants to e xpand and enhance the capacity to address t he mental health PEI needs of their students, faculty, and staff. A formal evaluation o f these programs by RAND Corpor ation found that campuses are in critical need o f direct services and referrals to county and community agencies are often met with limit ed (or temporary) resources. T he proposed project will also develop a new partnership in San Mateo County between San Mateo County Community Colleges, Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services and community-based behavioral health providers, which will be core to supporting a much needed service on campuses. Cultural responsiveness Two identified barriers to access ing care for NHPI youth are 1) behavioral health stigma and 2) the cultural humility nec essary to work with NHPI youth regarding behavioral health. Educating the campus abo ut suicide, mental illness, and emotional wellbeing cannot be a cookie-cutter approa ch; educating the campus about all things behavioral health must be equitable and re levant to the population served. The three local campuses of the S an Mateo County Community Coll ege District (SMCCCD), Skyline College, Coll ege of San Mateo, and Ca\u00f1ada Col lege, were examined to determine the level of mental h ealth services and r esources available to students on campus. Each campus had standard personal counselin g offices staffed with licensed mental health prof essionals. All three campuses c learly defined that students need to make an appointment, counseling sessions are b rief, and are limited to the academic calendar. Each ca mpus had different resources a vailable: drop-in center; wellness center; mental health peer educators; and educ ational trainings and workshops. Not one campus had any specific efforts on campus fo cused on vulnerable INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 6 | Page ethnic populations. The closes t program was a peer-to-peer supp ort service offered at College of San Mateo. The services and resources are open to al l and do not focus on any specific ethnic group. Based on research outside of San Mateo County, Universities in California offer more mental health resource s. California State University, Long Beac h has a program called Project OCEAN (On-Campus Emergenc y Assistance Network) that was federally funded by Substance Abus e and Mental Health Services Administra tion (SAMHSA) between 2008-11, MHSA PEI funded th rough CalMHSA between 2012-1 4 and was permanently institutionalized in 2014 through Student Affairs b ased on impact of the program. Project OCEAN's is a peer education program that suppo rts the mental health concerns of all students. The CalMHSA SMHP initiative m ade significant momentum around st igma reduction and mental health awareness on co llege campuses, and yet, the p rograms did not look at cultural disparities and needs of some of the most vuln erable youth. The proposed project was developed by the BHRS Office of Diversity and Equity, Pacific Islander Initiative with cultur e responsiveness at the core and throughout each phase of the project and community input i n the process. The PIONEERS p rogram will include culturally focused strategies w ith the goal of participants dev eloping protective factors for NHPI college-age youth as th ey understand cultural and ment al health connections and develop leadership skills. Leadership and community advocacy Individual focused behavioral he alth prevention programs alone can develop protective factors for youth and linkages to needed behavioral health supp orts. A comprehensive approach integrating social and c ommunity-level strategies can have an exponential impact on behavioral health outcome s. It is well documented tha t improving behavioral health outcomes requires broader approaches that consider socia l determinants of health including community and so cial context (social integrati on, support systems, community engagement). Pertinently, t he NHPI community embraces a collectivist culture, a prevention approach t hat integrates developing youth NHPI leaders (and hopefully contributors to a trans formed behavioral health workf orce) and giving back to their communities, especially gi ven the broad hea lth disparitie s impacting NHPI, is not only smart practice but culturally relevant. Based on final research outside of the United States, there is a plethora of mental health content for NHPI in Aotear oa/New Zealand. Le Va (www.lev a.co.nz). Le Va is ran by NHPI professionals who pr ioritize mental health, provide education and trainings for the NHPI community on how to work with the NHPI community, and build the capacity of NHPI's to thrive in the health and disability workf orce. There is nothing like Le Va that exists in th e U.S. for NHPI's. The proposed project (PIONEERS P rogram) will consist of 4 key c omponents: INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 7 | Page 1) YOUTH ADVISORY CIRCLE An advisory circle of NHPI col lege-age youth and the Pacific I slander Initiative will be recruited early in the project start-up phase. The adv isory circle will inform all aspects of the PIONEER S program includ ing the final program curriculum, activities, outreach strategies, evaluation and dis semination of the findings. While all current com ponents of the project where dev eloped based on learnings from youth themselves through other community leaders hip development and behavioral healt h spaces, youth will continue t o play a critical role in the evolution of this project. 2) PIONEER INSTITUTE The 5-day PIONEER program provi des cultural education alongsid e discussions and discoveries of self, identity , history, community, mental h ealth, issues, institutions, policies, and other topics that develop young lea ders' knowledge, skills, and network. Pending review and input from t he youth advisory circle for th e project, some of the topics addressed in the 5-day PIONEER curricu lum may includ e: o Lifelines: Pacific Islanders' lineage a common history and more importantly share genealogy wit h one another. This connectednes s is foundational to the way Pacific Islanders relate to one another , a bond that predates Western interruptio n. As communities continue to grow in the United States, they are also dispersed across the country d iminishing bonds that once held families and nations together. Sharing one 's journey and story is the first step to lear ning about one another and s parking warmth that can only be reig nited when embracing kin. o Migration Stories: The exploration of the cu rrent state of the Pacific Islander community in the U.S. n eeds to start with the genesis of the community in this co untry. That starts at the inception of the idea to cut the umbilical cord from the mot herland in the pursuit of a grea ter source of life for future generations . The stories of the migrant gene ration hold the visions that brought them thousands of miles across the oce an; stories, and therefore visions, th at are nearly lost on the cur rent generation. Hearing th ese stories breathe life back into these visions as parents and elders pass these st ories to the students. Allowing students time to share their story with their peer, then visualize it on paper, gives them time to think more deeply a bout their indivi dual story whi le drawing a bond with their peer's journey. T he process of comparison aut omatically sets the stage for contrasting t he visions in their stories to their current experiences. This prepares stud ents' minds for further explorat ion of issues in the Pacific Islander communities. o Community Memberships: Part of understanding oneself is to understand where we bel ong and that isn't limited to our famili es. Belonging is wherever we place ou rselves in any given situation at any given time. These assignments ar e determined by p ersonal values and belief systems. These groupings a re often socially constructed according INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 8 | Page to societal expectations and norms. Understanding where we assi gn ourselves; how we prioritize thos e assignments; and recognizing the privileges and constraints that th ey come with affords a greate r understanding of others while ope ning up the po ssibilities for acceptance and embrace of those diffe rent from ourselves. o Power of Resistance: Leaders like Nat Turner, Sojourner Truth, and Marcus Garvey resisted and revo lted against the disdain of Blac k people by White oppressors. Nat Turner was the first slave to lead a r ebellion; Sojourner Truth escaped slavery and became an ab olitionist; Mar cus Garvey was a Black Nationalist. T hese leaders paved the way for future leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Ang ela Davis. As Pacific Islanders, our people s uffered oppression through co lonization of our homelands. Many of our i slands were occupied by military forces, used for atomic bomb testing, o r stolen for its natural resourc es. Resistance has been something our ancestors demonstrated even b efore migrating to the United States. When Hawaiian language was bann ed in 1896, Queen Liliuokalani and the Hawaiian people snuck letters to each other written in Hawai ian language wr apped in flowers; when Mamoe est ablished the Mau a Pule, a resistance group against German rule, he was exil ed from his homeland to Saipan; when Tupua Tamasese led a peaceful mar ch in Samoa, he was killed by German forces. Leaders of our i slands understood the necessity of having a voice, the power in or ganizing and standing together, the importance of resisting what they felt was wrong ! Many died in the resistance that is now part of our legacy as Pacific Islanders. o Mana Room: Mana is a term used in Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia that is the foundati on of our world view. Mana is a form of spiritual energy; hea ling energy; powerful energy; a sacred for ce existing in the universe. Mana is positiv e energy transmitted through la nd, the environment, sacred obj ects, and people. 3) MANA SESSIONS PIONEER Mana Sessions will be pr ovided once a month in the fal l. These sessions provide safe space to d ecompress, engage in group disc ussions centered around mental health a nd wellness, and skills building workshops. 4) FORWARD MOVEMENT PROJECTS Identify opportunities to give back or be of service to their community; lead workshops and discussions with h igh/middle schoo l students and the broader community. Apply knowledge acqu ired from PIONEERS to determine what students' needs are, develop workshops, and provide it for them . INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 9 | Page B) Identify which of the three project general requirements spe cified above [per CCR, Title 9, Sect. 3910(a)] the project will implement. Increases access to mental health services to underserved group s C) Briefly explain how you have determined that your selected a pproach is appropriate. The planning of the PIONEERS pr ogram has involved stakeholders from the system of care and the community, including NHPI youth. The idea was bro ught forward by the Pacific Islander Initiative (PII) , a collaborativ e of providers , community leaders, clients/family members. PII s takeholders have been working on the idea for years prior to applying for innovati on funds taking into account lear nings from a previous youth leadership development p rogram and deep understanding of the cultural barriers to accessing behavioral health care services. Based on a compr ehensive review of published literature, web-based s earches, the following were id entified as key considerations for the projec t activities and approach: 1. NHPI College-Age Youth - There is a need for promising sustainable practices that address the mental health needs of NHPI college-age youth. 2. Cultural Relevance - Cultural identifica tion and responsivene ss is critical for t he mental health of NHPI youth as th ey explore the opposing values of two cultures. 3. Health Disparities - Significant disparities in quality of life and behavioral he alth outcomes exist for NH PI communities. Hire NHPI staff that have exper ience and rapport serving the NH PI community in San Mateo Count y and represent the different neighborhoods across the county with high NHPI population. Work with faculty and campus sta ff to set up the program sched ule and get any infrastructure needed in place prior to launch Recruit advisory circle of NHP I college-age youth and the Pacif ic Islander Initiative to inform the program c urriculum, activities, outrea ch strategies, implementation and evaluation. Work with the advisory circle to finalize the PIONEERS program. Identify potential co mmunity opportunities and NHPI leaders and partners to support PIONEERS' youth in their forward movement p roject. Work with evaluators to set up a continuous feedback process, evaluation tools and plan. Conduct outreach to engage NHPI co llege-age youth from both on- campus and the community. Launch the first cohort of NHPI student PIONEERS.

Appendix 1. Theory of Chang e illustrates the pathways between these five key considerations, the interventio ns or activities, expected outcomes, and learning objectives. D)Estimate the number of individuals expected to be served ann ua lly and how yo u arrived at this number. An NHPI Peer Couns elor will engage NHPI youth on local college campuses. In FY 2017- 2018, there were 484 NHPI yout h enrolled in San Mateo Dis trict Community Colleges and about 450 NHPI youth in grades 9-12. T he expected annual reach is: 45 NHPI college-age youth engage in PIONEER program services o 90% develop protective factors (cultural and mental health awar eness, self-identity and coping skills) o 90% attitudes and knowledge to wards mental health improve o 80% youth mental hea lth improves (suicide ideation, anxiety, d epression) o90% NHPI youth referred to behavioral health services; 85% fol low through and engage in services 30 NHPI community youth engaged through the program's communit y advocacy component o 90% of all NHPI youth attitudes and knowledge towards mental h ealth improve o 90% reduced stigma and improved awareness E) Describe the population to be served, including relevant dem ographic information (age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/ or langu age used to communicate). The PIONEERS program will targ et NHPI college-age youth. While data is limited for this community, we know that the NHPI com munity experiences som e of the highest dis parities across various healt h indicators. The Census Bureau reports that 17.6% of the NHPI c ommunity lived below poverty, compared to a national poverty rat e of 11.7% for Asians and 11.6% for Whites. RESEARCH ON INN COMPONENT A)What are you proposing that distinguishes your project from similar projects that other counties and/or providers have already tested or implemente d? The key differences with the pr oposed project compared to other college mental health programs include: Cultural responsivenes s to NHPI youth Community advocacy connection as NHPI college-age youth engage in broader NHPI community impactINN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 11 |Pag B) Describe the efforts made to investigate existing models or approaches close to what you're proposing. Have you identified gaps in the liter ature or existing practice that your project would seek to address? Please provid e citations and links to where you have gathered this information. A comprehensive online and litera ture search was conducted for College mental health program s and lessons learned (online) Best practices for college mental health strategies (literatur e) Need for culturally responsive college mental health programs (literature) Gaps in the literature and practice Proposed intervention No culturally specific, comprehensive college mental health program s for NHPI community. Culturally relevant outreach and engagement strategies (peer educators, cultural events) but a cookie-cutter approach to mental health.The proposed project will incorporate cultural responsiveness into every phase and aspect of the program. Community colleges and two-year institutions experience greater challenges, than 4-year universities, with providing mental health services. The proposed project will develop a new partnership between community colleges and, county and community behavioral health providers. No examples of college mental health programs that consider NHPI social determinants of behavioral health outcomes.

Describe your learning goals/specific aims and how you hope to contribute to the expansion of effective practices. A)What is it that you want to learn or better understand over the course of the INN Project, and why have yo u prioritized these goals? B) How do your learning goals rel ate to the key elements/approa ches that are new, changed or adapted in your project? As stated prior, the two key differences with the proposed proj ect i nclude: Cultural responsiveness to NHPI youth (Learning Goal #1 and #2) Community advocacy connection as NHPI college-age youth engage in broader NHPI community impact (Learning Goal #3) The learning goals are directly connected to the needs, strategies (including the approaches that are new in the proposed pr oject) and outputs as depicted in Appendix 1. Theory of Change. E VALUATION OR LEARNING PLAN For each of your learning goals or specific aim s, describe the approach you will take to determine whether the goal or objective was me t.

Due to unavailable baseline dat a specific to NHPI youth mental health outcomes, the following indicators will be co llected as a baseline and tracke d throughout the project to inform Learning Goal #1. Measur es and methods could include: Number of NHPI college-age youth that engage in PIONEER progra m services o Percent of youth whose mental health improves (suicide ideatio n, anxiety, depression), as determined by pre/post screening. Additionally, occasional interv iews or planned focus groups wit h students that engage with the PIONEERS program can help us determine the level of satisfaction and narrative for the impact this project m ay have on NHPI student's emotional health . Demographics of youth that engage will also be collected. Some baseline data exists, while other indicators will be colle cted as a baseline and tracked throughout the project to inform L earning Goal #2.

Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements CONTRACTING If you expect to contract out the INN project and/or project evaluation, what project resources will be applied to managing the Count y's relationship to the contract or(s)? How will the County ensure quality as well as regulatory compliance in these contracted relationships? All BHRS service agr eements (contracts, MO U's) are monitored by a BHRS Manager that has the subject matter expertise. Contract monitors check-in a t least monthly with service providers to review challenges, s uccesses, troubleshoot and sta y up-to-date on the progress of the project. Additionally, r eporting deliverables are set i n place in the agreements and linked to invoicing. Payments o f services are contingent on the reporting. Evaluation contracts are monitored in a s imilar fashion by the MHSA Manage r in collaboration with the assigned BHRS Manager. Does integration of leadership and community advocacy improve quality of life outcomes for NHPI?Learning Goal #3 Capacity BuildingINN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 15 |Pag COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING Please describe the County's Community Pr ogram Planning (CPP) process for the Innovative Project, encompassing inclusion of stakeholders, representatives of unserved or under- served populations, and indivi duals who reflect the cultural , ethnic and racial diversity of the County's community. In San Mateo, the CPP process for Innovation Projects begins wi th the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A comprehensive community needs assessme nt process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for services, which a re used as the basis for the development of Innovation projects. Appendix 2 illustrates and describes the Three-Year Plan CPP process for San Mateo County. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innova tion ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovati on Idea Form were circulated t hrough various means: Flyers are sent to/placed at C ounty facilities, as well as ot her venues like family resource centers and community-based organizations; Announcements at numerous inter nal and external community mee tings; Announcements at program activ ities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambassador Program, Lived Experience Ac ademy, etc.); E-mails disseminating inform ation to over 1,500 community mem bers and partners; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stake holders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA w ebpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa, the BHRS the BHRS Blog www.smcbhrsblog.org MHSA Innovation brainstorming sessions held with groups that requested it (Lived Experienc e Workgroup, MH SARC Older Adult Committee). The MHSA Innovation Idea Form requested narrative on the propos ed idea/pr oject and information to ensure the idea meets the requirements for Innov ation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County we had the requirement that the idea address t he MHSA Three-Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of older adults across services an d prevention activities Culturally relevant out reach and service delivery Integration of peer/family suppor ts across services and prevention activities Integration of co-occurring pr actices across services and pre vention activities Engagement services for trans ition-age youth (mentoring, educ ation, peer support) Broader housing options to suppor t individuals across the con tinuum of care We received 35 MHSA Innovation Idea Forms, which speaks to the need for innovation in serving some of our most vulnerable communities' needs. All sub mitted ideas were pre- screened against the Innovation requi rements, twenty-one were m oved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of di verse clients, family members, community service pro viders and staff. All projects we re reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Im pact/Effort assessment and scoring. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into full Innovation project proposals for approval by the Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission (M HSOAC). INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 16 |Pag On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee met to review the 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerations for the projects. The MHSARC voted to open the 30- day public comment period and reviewed MHSOAC comments, during the public hearing and closing of the public comment period on November 6, 2019. No other substantive comments were received. All comments are included in Appendix 3. MHSA GENERAL STANDARDS Using specific examples, briefly describe how yo ur INN Project reflects, and is consistent with, all potentially applicable MHSA General Standards listed below as set forth in Title 9 California Code of Regulations, Section 3320 (Please refer to the MHSOAC Innovation Review Tool for definitions of and references for each of the General Standards.) If one or more general standards could not be applied to your INN Project, please explain why. A) Community Collaboration The proposed project will require partnerships for success, bet ween NHPI college-age youth, Community Colleges, Coun ty BHRS, and community behaviora l health services. The planning of the PION EERS program has involved stakeholders from the system of care and the community, including youth. The idea wa s brought forward by the Pacific Islander Initiative ( PII), a collaborative of provi ders, community leaders, clients/family members including youth. The collaboration with PII will continuethrough implementation in an advisory role to the project. B) Cultural Competency The entire pro ject is rooted in cultura l values and the underst anding that cultural shapes mental health. Prog ramming will leverage the co llectivist culture of the NHPI community. C) Client/Family-Driven As mentioned above, PII will continue to play a role in the imp lementation of this project. This program is a prev ention strategy targeting indiv iduals that have not been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Clients and family m embers will be engaged in an advisory capacity through the PII or as independe nt member of an advisory board. The Mental Healt h Substance Abuse and Recovery Commission Older Adult Committee, w hich is made up of clients, family members and providers will be an ideal resource for this role. The evaluation contractor w ill gather input on the evaluation questions and strategi es, develop quarterly progress reports to share preliminary findings and gather input from the advisory group. D) Wellness, Recovery, an d Resilience-Focused Supporting wellness, recovery and resilience is accomplished th rough relationships and social networks, flexibilit y, respect and responsiveness, and taking a wholistic approach that considers overall health, stable housing, indepen dence, etc. These principles are key to the strat egies of the proposed project in cluding hiring peer mental health workers that have experienc e serving the NHPI community in San Mateo County to conduct the programming, focusing on stigma reduction and trust building conversations and a process that aims to creating safe spaces a nd reduce stigma and shame.INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 17 |Pag E) Integrated Service Experien ce for Clients and Families A request for proposal process wi ll select the service provider that will own the contract for these services. P re-launch planning and ongoing c ollaboration will be critical to offering an integrated service experience for recip ients. PIONEERS program peers will need to be well-infor med on the full range of servic es at BHRS and the community and build relationshi ps with gatekeepers to ensure a coordinated referral and warm hand-off process. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN EVALUATION Explain how you plan to ensure that the Proj ect evaluation is culturally competent and includes meaningful stakeholder participation. As mentioned earlier, the evaluat ion contractor will engage an advisory group of diverse clients, family members and providers to gather input on the evaluation questions, strategies and on quarterly progress reports. Cu ltural and language demographics will be collected and analyzed as part of the quarterly reports to ensure equal access to serv ices among racial/ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations or comm unities. The quarterly report s will be used to inform and adjust as needed the direction, out reach strategies and activit ies. INNOVATION PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE Briefly describe how the County wi ll decide whether it will contin ue with the INN project in its entirety or keep particular elements of the IN N project without utiliz ing INN Funds following project completion. Will individuals with seri ous mental illness receive services from the proposed project? If yes, describe how you plan to protect and provide continuity of care for these individuals upon project completion. The advisory group will be engaged in the evaluation and adjust ments of the project. In addition, the MHSA Steering Commi ttee will be a venue for vetti ng next steps with diverse stakeholders. If the evaluation indicates that the proposed pro ject is an effective means of increasing access to behavioral health services for at risk old er adults and there is availability of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) funding, a proposal of continuation would be brought to the MHSA Steering Committee and the Mental Health and Substa nce Abuse Recovery Commission for approval and to a 30-day public comment process to secure ongoing PEI funding. Contractors will be ask ed to develop a sustainability plan as part of their project proposal. COMMUNICATION AND D ISSEMINATION PLAN Describe how you plan to commu nicate results, newly demonst rated successful practices, and lessons learned from your INN Project. A) How do you plan to disseminate information to stakeholders w ithin your county and (if applicable) to other counties? How will program INN Project Plan #2 _ San Mateo County_ August 26, 2019 18 |Pag participants or other stakeholders be involved in communication efforts? MHSA implementation is very much a part of BHRS' day-to-day bus iness. Information is shared, and input collected with a diverse group of stakehol ders, on an ongoing basis. All MHSA information is made available to stakeholders on the the MHSA webpage, www.smchealth.org/bhrs/mh sa.

Planning was l ed by the MHSA Manager and the Director of BHRS along with the MHSARC and the MHSA Ste ering Committee. A draft CPP process was presente d to and vetted by the MHSARC. The MHSARC was asked for their input and comments on the process and what other stakehol der groups should we be reaching out to in each of the CPP Phases. STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED Input was sought from twenty ni ne diverse groups and vulnerable populations to include perspectives of different backgrounds and interests including g eographical, ethnic, cultural and From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 social economic, providers and re cipients of behavioral health care services and other sectors, clients and their family membe rs. See the full list of input s essions below. Additionally, a PreLaunch sessi on was held with clients/consum ers hosted by the Peer Recovery Collaborative, a collabo rative of peerrun agencies in cluding California Clubhouse, Heart and Soul and Voice of Recov ery. At this session informat ion was presented and shared to help prepare clients/consumers for the CPP Launch session where they would be providing input and public comment. Discu ssion items included, 1) Backgr ound on MHSA; 2) What to expect at the CPP Launch session; and 2) How to prepare a publi c comment. Extensive outreach was conducted to promote two key public meet ings, the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017 and the CPP Prioritization Session on April 26, 2017. Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Samoan. Stipends to consumers/clients and their fami ly members, language interpreta tion, child care for families and refreshments were provided at each of these sessions. Over 270 participated in the se ssions, 156 demographic sheets w ere collected and of these 37% identified as clients/consumers and family members and 36 stipe nds were provided. The majority of participants at these two public meetings (64%) represented central and south geographical areas of the county. There are institutional barriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (trust, transportation, cultural and language, etc.). In an effort to account for this, two additional Community Prioritization Sessions were conducted in East Palo Alto and the Coastside.

NEEDS ANALYSIS To build off of the previous Commu nity Program Planning (CPP) p rocess in FY 2014/15, stakeholders including clients, f amily members, community partn ers and organizations were asked to think about current serv ices as they relate to the gaps in services identified in FY 2014/15 (listed below), specific service categories and populat ions served to identify any additional gaps in services: Cultural humility and stigma Timely access Services for peers and families Services for adults and older adults Early intervention Services for children and TAY Cooccurring services Criminal justice involvement For Phase I and the initial input sessions, stakeholders where asked the following questions, based on the priority gaps ident ified in previous years for con tinuity: From your perpective, do these M HSA services effectively [e.g. serve the cultural and linguistic needs of your target communities, address timely acc ess for your target communities, serve the behavioral healthcare needs of clients a nd families, etc. ]? What's working well? What improvements are needed? Probes: Do these services addr ess principles of wellness and re covery? stigma? Are current collaborations effective in reaching and serving ta rget communities? What is working well? What's missing? All comments received up to the d ate of the CPP Launch Session on March 13th were grouped into themes and presented a t the CPP Launch. Additional input was sought regarding both the needs/service gaps and whet her there were any voices (or communities) missing from t he Needs Analysis phase. The CPP Launch Session was a joint MHSARC and MHSA Steering Committee meeting and included a facilitated community input. Agenda items i ncluded 1) an MHSA Housing propos al for use of unencumbered housing funds 2) public c omment from clients, families and community members on priority needs a nd gaps in mental health services, and 3) breakout g roups to begin developing strategies t o address the key needs/ service gaps identified. About 120 clients, families, community members and stakeholders attended the CPP Launch Session. PHASE 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The Strategy Development Phase w as kicked off at the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017. Findings from the initial input sessions were shared at the CPP Launch Session including relevant strategy ideas. From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 While the above six need/gaps in services were identified, ther e was also an overarching theme that arose from the input sessions, which brought to surface co mmon questions in MHSA planning: do we build upon existi ng MHSAfunded programs or do we create new programs? Input session participants identified the need to consider both . It has been 10 years since the inception of MHSA and most progr ams have not received additiona l resources (aside from Cost of Living increases to the contracts) to expand services and/or clients served, especially for those programs that are resulting in positive behavioral health outcomes. Three key next steps for the CPP process were identified at the CPP Launch Session: Additional input sessions with vulnerable populations and key s takeholders identified. Additional strategy development sessions in isolated and higher need communities, in particular East Palo Alto and the Coastside/South Coast region. Follow up meetings with all MHSAfunded programs to identify pr iority program challenges, needs and possible st rategies to address these. PHASE 3. PLAN DEVELOPMENT The final Phase of the CPP Proc ess was kicked off at the CPP Pr ioritization Session on April 26, 2017. The meeting goals were threefold: 1. Present strategy recommendations, results from the Community In put Sessions and prepared public comments in s upport of each recommendation. 2. Provide meeting participants the opportunity to bring forward a ny additional strategy recommendations and to prioritize the additional recommendation s. 3. Prioritize across all strategies proposed (MHSA Steering Commit tee only) to help identify the recommendations to include i n the MHSA ThreeYear Plan. Appendix 3.

Please provide a brief narrative summary of the chal lenge or problem that you have identified and why it is important to solve for your community. Filipino/a/x Youth & Mental Health Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S. and Filipinos are the third largest subgroup.1 In San Mateo County, according to the 2010 Census, Filipinos m ade up 11% of the San Mateo County population (80,349) and the City of Daly City, had the highest concentration of Filipino/ a/x Americans of any municipa lity in the U.S; making up 32% of the city's population. Ye t, there is limited published r esearch on mental health challenges impacting Filipino/a /xs and even less literature on promising practices,2 especially focused on adolescent youth. Filipino/a/xs are often g rouped with Asian Americans which masks cultural-specific considerations for unme t mental health needs. This was highlighted repeatedly by the California Reducing Disparities Project (CRDP) Asian Pacific Islander (API) Population Report, an MHSA-funded project and the largest investment from a State, in the nation, to look into diverse community perspectives on mental health disparities. Throughout the entire report it was stressed that API is a heterogenous grouping and that data and strategies should address the diverse needs of ethnic subgroups. Out of the 56 promising practices reviewed by CRDP, only six targeted Filipino/a/x and only one targeted Filipino/a/x exclusively, the Filipino M ental Health Initiative (https://www.smchealth.org/filipino-mental-health-initiative), which is a collaborative of community-based partners, county staff, clients, family members and community stakeholders that developed this innovation project proposal. The limited studies available on Filipino/a/x youth suggest di sparities with regards to behavioral health outcomes for Filipino/a/x communities. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 45.6% of Filipina American adolescents have experienced suicidal ideation, the highest rate of suicidal ideation at among all racial and ethnic groups,3 as well as higher rates of depression at 13.6% compared to o ther Asian American females.4 Research has shown an association between self-esteem and Filipino/a/x youth5. 1 https://www.pewresearch.org/fact tank/2017/09/08 /keyfactsabo Y.

Page 3 of 31 Empirical evidence also suggests that depression affects Filipi no/a/x youth and adolescent health risk behaviors i ncrease with each generation of Filipino/a/x youth.6 In San Mateo County, 53% of y outh clients in Probation and 43 % in Behavioral Health and Recovery Services come from the same 4 zip codes, tw o of these are where we have high concentration of Filipinos, the City of Daly City (33% Filipino) and South San Francisco (20% Filipino). In San Mateo County, specialty mental health service penetrat ion rates are lowest for both youth (1.8%) and adult (2.6% ) Asian/Pacific Islander racia l group7. In fiscal year 18/19, our Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) 3% (5 58) of clients served reported as Filipino. Social Determinants of Health Unfortunately, San Mateo County disaggregated data for Filipino youth outcomes is largely unavailable. The California Health Kids Survey reports on Asian as an ethnicity with no further racial breakdown. Yet, w e know that mental health chal lenges can impact youth's quality of life indicators and poor health outcomes disproporti onately impact communities with poor social determinants of health (SDOH) such as unstable housing, low income, unsafe neighborhoods, or substandard education. 8 Young people need jobs , skills, support and emotional and physical safety in order to succeed academica lly and ultimately have positive behavioral health outcomes. According to a nationwide st udy, Filipino/a/x youth have one of the highest high school dropout rates and one of the highest rates of teen suici de ideation and attempts9. Locally, at Jefferson Union High School District, Filipino/a/ x students make up 30% of the student population, 20% of dropouts and only 42% of graduat es met University of California (UC) and California S tate University (CSU) requireme nts. At South San Francisco Unified , Filipino/a/x students make up 24% of the student population, 8% of dropouts, and ju st 19% of graduates met the U C and CSU requirements.10 Cultural Identity There is a significant amount of research that suggests that t he stronger a youth's cultural/ethnic identity, the hi gher their resilience and the m ore likely it is that they experience positive life outcomes11. In a study looking at Asian American youth from emerging communities found that both ethnic expl oration and eth nic belonging was significantly correlated with h igher self- esteem and lower dep ressive symptoms.12 Based on the research of E.J.

Asian American Journal of Psychology. 2014 Page 4 of 31 regarded Filipino Psychologists , there is a strong correlation between cultural identity formation and mental health and wellness of Filipino/a/x adoles cent youth: A bicultural clash exists betw een collectivist (Filipino/a/x) and individualist (American) value system, which leads to a lack of a stable sense of cultur al identity; this in turn leads to mental health issues related to decreased self efficacy and self worth.13 \"Ethnic identity development i s particularly critical for mino rity adolescents since they have, in addition to their ordi nary development issues, the add ed burden of exploring the values of both their host soc iety and their original cultur es...\".14 Furthermore, with respect to his torical trauma, Nadal (2011) ex plains that considering their distinctive cultural values and colonial history of over four c enturies of colonization under Spanish and American rule, it has been proposed that there exis t long-standing effects of internalized oppression handed do wn the generations detrimental ly impacting the Filipino/a/x community's state of mental health. The high rate s of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, anxiety, s ubstance use, adolescent pregnan cy, and higher public school drop out rates (compared with Asians and non-Hispanic Wh ites) within the Filipino/a/x youth population (esp ecially those recently immigr ated) has been attributed to this intergenerational trauma, and challenges with cultural ide ntity formation. Considering, the varying experi ences cross-generationally; the generational gap has served as a barrier to addressing ment al health issues and impacting h elp-seeking behaviors amongst the Filipino/a/x populati on. According to the research of Nadal and David, as one of the most collectivistic people in the world, family dynamics reflect more of a family- centered structure where parents are a significant part of chil dren's lives. Mental health stigma carries both a societal and cultural stigma for the Fili pino/a/x community, whereby the shame is doubled with not onl y wanting to avoid bringing ne gative attention upon the individual but also am ongst the family system. An upstream, holistic, cultural- based, integrative approach for Filipino/a/x Youth can lead to developing protective factors and improving ment al health outco mes and access to behavioral health services for at-risk Filipino/a/x youth. Thro ugh offering a natural entry point for the community to access inte rgenerational- specific activit ies and interactions, the youth will have an opportunity to bri dge the generational gap that ha s historically hindered access to forms of ancestral healing. PROPOSED PROJECT Describe the INN Project you are proposing. A) Provide a brief narrative overview description of the propos ed project. The proposed project is a cultur al arts and wellness-focused so cial enterprise caf\u00e9 that offers youth development and mental health programming on site. The social 13 Nadal, K.

Ethnic id entity as a predictor of problem behaviors among Korean American adolescents. 2004. Adolescence . 39 (155), pp. 601 622. Page 5 of 31 enterprise caf\u00e9 will hire and tr ain at-risk youth from Northern San Mateo County and serve as a culturally affirming space for Filipino/a/x youth an d the community. The social enterprise model has pro ven to be a more sustainable app roach when it comes to stable and diversifi ed funding streams. Most of the ex isting community organizations that offer some el ements of the proposed project rely heavily on grant writing and fundraising. A youth can expect to experienc e an integrated system of thera peutic care and support through their peers, mento rs, and clinically trained an d culturally responsive program staff provided by the cent er. Individually, the youth w ill be offered clinical and case management support for academic/career exploration and leadership development in an area of interes t, such as in the arts and wel lness fields. With arts and wellness at the heart of the programming, the youth will be in an environment that embraces arts as a means to healing individually and colle ctively, so workshops and relevant skill building acti vities may be arts-based. Tailo red curriculum will allow them to gain hard skills in ment al health and wellness manageme nt, life management, financial wellness, business and entrepreneurship, and leadership while critically examining the ways systemic oppression may imp act healthy cultural identity formation as it relat es to the aforementioned. Vocatio nal, on-the-job training, as staff of the social enterpr ise, matched with mentorship thro ugh local Filipina/o/x business leaders and owners will p rovide them a pipeline to bot h traditional and non- traditional career paths; and build ing their professional netwo rk. Collectively, operating within a cohort model, the opportunity to share cultu rally affirming spaces and interactions, from a clini cal standpoint, can cultivate an emotional corrective experience by increasing their self-esteem and a stronger sense of belonging and empowerment by being with others who culturally identify simila rly. By the end of their term, they will be asked to leverage their chosen arts mo dality that speaks to them to address a social issue, s uch as curating an art exhibit with their peers themed around mental health stigm a in the Filipino/a/x communit y. The caf\u00e9 and cultural center itself will se rve as a platform to host such ac tivities. Furthermore, it is a natural entry point for both a pl ace of informally and formally gathering in community, as well as accessing mental healt h support. The social enterpri se promotes cross- cultural and intergenerational co nnection and interaction throu gh activities offered at the center and caf e, so youth will be encouraged to engage acc ordingly. Social Enterprise - Cultural Arts-Focused Cafe Social enterprises advance a so cial mission and provide financi al sustainability. The cultural arts focused cafe will p rovide at risk youth from Nort hern San Mateo County an employment and training opport unity as they learn all aspect s of running a caf\u00e9, and gain transferable skills rela ting to financial literacy & w ellness and entrepreneurship. Employed youth will develop leadership and o ther critical life skills including problem solving, teamwo rk, critical thinking, and cre ativity, among others. The social enterprise business model will include profit genera tion to support the financial sustainability of the caf\u00e9 and its programming. Culture and wellness focus Page 6 of 31 Building off the research on the importance of cultural identif ication and a proven understanding of wellness-focus ed interventions and their long- term impact on behavioral health outcomes, the cultural arts focused cafe will be rooted in a foundation of Filipina/o/x Cultur al Values: Kapwa (togetherness ) and Ginhawa (total wellness). The centralized gatheri ng space will serve as a plat form to collectively address intergenerational and an cestral trauma and wounds. The caf\u00e9 will celebrate Bayanihan (\"community\" in Tagal og), honor diversity, and promot e holistic health through arts & wellness practice s. By exploring the Filipino/a/ x and Filipino/a/x American experience and history of the Philippines, the caf\u00e9 ai ms to bridge multiple generations through various cultura lly-specific educational and expressive arts engagement and elevate youth to be the next generation leaders of social change, wellness ambassadors, and cultural preservationists. While the cafe is inspired by the Filipino/a/x experience, anyone interested in learning about th e Philippines is welcome and encouraged to collabor ate in building multicultural awareness and community. Leadership development and mental health programming Hiring and training at-risk yout h to work at and eventually man age the caf\u00e9 is critical to providing youth with basic needs of employment, job skills a nd leadership development. The cafe has the pot ential of impacting more Filip ino/a/x youth in Daly City and neighboring communities. The caf\u00e9 will also offer progra mming that is holistically desig ned around social determinants of health and issues i mportant to Filipino/a/x you th in Northern San Mateo County. The programming wi ll leverage successful program s, such as the Skyline College Kabab ayan Learning Community 15 that focuses on education relating to the Filpino/a/x & Filipino/a /x cultural experience; and Daly City Youth Health Center's Elements for Success16 program, a school-to-car eer transition program, along with expanded service. It will consist of five components that have been developed over the past six years by community stakeholders wit h youth input and continue to be refined: Career Path/Purpose ( school-to-career prep) Wellness Ambassadors (wellness and mental health linkages) Rite of Passage Work (cultural identity formation) Leadership Development (i.e. capst one arts-based projects to ad dress mental health & wellness related soci al issues facing the community) Youth Production Line & Manage ment (financial wellness) This programming component of the caf\u00e9 is represented in the C ommuniTREE framework, below, which uses a tree as a metaphor to depict the values that ground this work (SOIL), the supports needed (ROOTS) for success, the strategies that will get us there (BRANCHES), the re sulting youth capacity (LEAVES) and health outcomes (FRUITS) we expect to impact. 15 https://www.skylinecollege.edu/kababayan/ 16 https://www.dalycityyouth.org/elements.html Page 7 of 31 Page 8 of 31 Work with social enterprise c onsultants to finalize business pl an.

Increases access to mental health servic es to underserved group s C) Briefly explain how you have determined that your selected approach is appropriate. Based on a comprehensive review of publis hed literature, web-ba sed searches, the following were identified as key considerations for the project activities and approach: 1.Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) - Disparities in health exist for Filipino/a/x youth and lead to negative outcomes in mental heal th, upstream strategies that intervene at the ro ot causes of disparities are needed 2.Behavioral Health - Disparities in behavioral health outcomes exist for Filipino/a/x youth 3.Cultural Identity - Cultural identification is cri tical for the mental health of Filipino/a/x youth as they explore the opposing values of two c ultures 4.Promising Practices - There is a need for promis ing sustainable practices that address the mental health needs of Filipino/a/x youth These considerations serve as supporting evidence for the propo sed interventions and selected approach. The Theory of Change for this project, Appendix 1, illustrates the pathways between the supporting evidence for th e interventions, the interventions or activities, expected outcomes, and learning ob jectives. D)Estimate the number of indivi duals expected to be served ann uall y and how you arrived at this n umber. The local Daly City Youth Health Center sees 69 Filipino/a/x yo uth ages 13-22 for behavioral health counseling based on a recent annual report. W hile the caf\u00e9 program will not have direct mental health services onsite, the re will be a robust referral network that connects youth to systems of care, includ ing behavioral health counseling. The caf\u00e9 will not hav e the stigma associated with s eeking behav ioral health services and it is complete ly based on employing cultura lly relevant engagement strategies for youth (various arts modalities, such as workshops & training in c ulinary arts, liter ary, visual and performing arts , and multi-media/digital arts, etc.). Therefore, we ex pect a higher number of youth to engage in services. Additionally , a recent survey created for the innovation stakeh older process supported the idea that a cultura lly affirming space will encou rage participation. Please see annotated Appendix 2 for a summary of survey results including themes from 4 focus groups conducted. There was a subset of questions specified for only youth about the likelihood of participating in the caf\u00e9 program . 91 respondents were youth between the ages of 13-24. Y outh indicated they would \"ve ry likely\" engage in the following areas of the progr am: 29 in leadership skills dev elopment; 32 in on the job training; 26 in entrepreneurship. Page 11 of 31 Based on 2018-19 enrollment figu res, 3,553 students from the lo cal high school districts identify as Filipino . At Skyline College, 5,782 of s tudents identify as Asian (with no ethnic subgroup breakdown ). Every year, 75-100 Filipin o students participate in Skyline College's Kababayan Lear ning Community, which is a p rogram that focuses on activities related to the Filipino/a/x, Filipino/a/x American experience and assists students in transferring to a four-year university. The following represents expec ted annual reach through outreach , unique visitors at the caf\u00e9, and engagement in the programming. Demographics, refe rral data, and outcomes, will also be captured to ensure the program is servin g its target audience. 4000 outreach encounters throu gh direct promotion at the schoo ls 2,000 unique visitors at the caf\u00e9 300 youth referred to service s; 150 receive behavioral health services 90 participate in mental health related programming at the caf \u00e9 40 youth participate in the full programming at the caf\u00e9 (coho rt participants) o 90% participants develop cultur al pride and sense of belonging (includes cohort participant s and unique visitors) 10-12 - youth hired from target cities, including Daly City o 90% youth develop leadership and critical skills: problem solv ing, teamwork, critical thinking, creativity, etc. o 90% youth develop leadership and other skills: advocacy, finan cial literacy, etc. E) Describe the population to be served, including relevant dem ographic information (age, gender identi ty, race, ethnicity, sexual orie ntation, and/or language used to communicate). The social enterprise caf\u00e9 wil l reach out to transitional age y outh (16-24) within northern San Mateo County cities of Daly City and South San Fra ncisco that have a high concentration of Filipino youth.

The key things that distinguish the proposed project from other programs include: Culturally responsive approach to Filipino/a/x youth. As noted earlier, through the CRDP review of promising prac tices there was no program exp licitly targeting the Filipino/a/x comm unity, this proposed approach is completely rooted in Filipino/a/x cultural v alues and has cultural identif ication as a core component of developing protec tive factors for youth. A holistic approach to the yout h development programming. Othe r similar projects typically focus one or tw o \"branches\" as presented in the CommuniTREE framework above. The ca fe will provide a holistic a pproach including school tocareer wellness and mental health linkages, cultural identity formation, leadership development through art and fina ncial wellness. This is based on significant community input and vetting on wha t would support Filipino/a/x youth and t heir behavioral health outcomes . For the social enterprise model , there is no other social enter prise targeting community mental health most are focused on vocational training goals and strategies. The cafe social ent erprise will not only impact th e youth employed but will provide integrated on-si te programming for Filipino/a/ x youth in the community. B) Describe the efforts made to investigate existing models or approaches close to what you're proposing. Have you identified gaps in the liter ature or existing practice that your project would seek to address? Please provid e citations and links to where you have gathered this information. 19 Lucile Packard Foundation for Ch ildren's Health, kidsdata.org Page 13 of 31 Field and market research were conducted on comparable existing models in our local community and across count ies and there ar e no programs d esigned specifically to support this popu lation through a social enterp rise model. The closest effective model we found was a so cial enterprise, Old Skool Caf \u00e9, in San Francisco, which is mostly focused on vo cational training and not tying in strategies to help cultivate healthy cultural ident ity formation and its impact on mental health & wellness. Additionally, intervie ws with leaders in youth focuse d programming in Northern San Mateo County, such as, executive staff at Daly Cit y Youth Health Center, CIPHER at Skyline Coll ege, and Skyli ne Kababayan Learni ng Community took place to better understand the gaps in service for this pa rticular population. In terms of the business aspect of the social enterprise, we me t with local business leaders and entrepreneur s (including, but not limited to, Antig ua Cafe (South San Francisco), Poke Time (Daly Cit y/San Francisco)/Tuna Kahuna (Bu rlingame), & Frozen Kuhsterd (San Francisco B ay Area)) to advise on start-up costs and general business consultation.

The proposed project is a culturally responsive approach to Filipino/a/x youth. The approach is completely rooted in Filipino/a/ x cultural values and has cultural identification as a core component of developing protective factors for youth. No disaggregated data for Filipino youth behavioral health. The proposed project will measure youth assets and mental health indicators of all youth engaged. While this does not give us community wide data, it will provide a snapshot of how Filipino youth are faring in San Mateo County. For the social enterpr ise model, there is no other social enterprise targeting community mental health. The cafe social enterprise will not only impact the youth employed but will provide integrated on-site programming for Filipino/a/x youth in the community including a holistic approach to the youth development programming. This is based on significant community input and vetting on what would support Filipino/a/x youth and their behavioral health outcomes. Page 15 of 31 LEARNING GOALS/PROJECT AIMS The broad objective of the Innovat ive Component of the MHSA is t o incentivize learning that contributes to the expansion of effective practices in the mental health system. Describe your learning goals/specific aims and how you hope to contribute to the expansion of effective practices. A)What is it that you want to learn or better understand over the course of the INN Project, and w hy have you prioritized the se goals? B) How do your learning goals relate to the key elements/approaches that a re ne w, changed or adapted in y our project? As stated prior, the three key differences with the proposed pr oject i nclude: Culturally responsive approach to F ilipino/a/x youth with cultu ral identification and cultural values at the core. (Learning Goal #2) A holistic approach to the y outh development programming. (Learning Goal #1) Social enterprise model targeting community mental health with an integrated approach to engage the broader Filip ino/a/x youth community. (Learning Goal #1) An additional Learning Goal #3 related to sustainability of the integrated model of services within a social enter prise is included. The learning goals are directly connected to the needs, strategies (including the approaches that a re new in the proposed project) and outputs as depicted in Appendix 1. Theory of Change. Does an integrated approach to a social enterprise that includes on-site programming improve mental health and outcomes for the Fili pino/a/x youth en gaged? Learning Goal #1 Does a culturally affirming space increase access to behavioral health and services for Filipino/a/x youth? Learning Goal #2 Can a holistic social enterprise model imp rove quality of life indicators for Filipino/a/x youth? Learning Goal #3 Page 16 of 31 EVALUATION OR LEARNING PLAN For each of your learning goals or specific aims, describe the approach you will take to determine whether the goal or ob jective was met. Specifically , please identify how each goal will be measured and the proposed data you intend on using . An independent evaluation consult ant will be contracted and mon itored by the MHSA Manager in collaboration with the BHRS program monitor to forma lly evaluate the innovation project. The following depicts a rough evaluation plan given th at the consultant will be hired after the project is approved. Due to unavailable baseline data specific to Filipino/a/x youth mental health outcomes, the following indicators will be co llected as a baseline and tracke d throughout the project to inform Learning Goal #1. Measur es and methods could include: Number of youths that participat e in each programming at the c af\u00e9 Percent of participants develop cultural pride and sense of be longing, as determined by pre/post survey Percent improved mental health (suicide ideation, anxiety, dep ression), as determined by pre/post screening Additionally, occasional interv iews or planned focus groups wit h youth that engage with the caf\u00e9 can help us determine the level of satisfaction and the level of impact the caf\u00e9 has had on the youth's cultural identification and emotional health . Some baseline data exists, while other indicators will be colle cted as a baseline and tracked throughout the project to inform L earning Goal #2. Measures an d methods could include: Number referred to behavioral he alth and social services Number that receive behavioral heal th services (baseline avail able through Daly City Youth Health Center and BHRS) Number that participate in ment al health programming as part o f the cafe and centralized gathering space. Percent decreased stigma and increased knowledge about availab le behavioral health resources, as determined by pre/post survey. Does an integrated approach to a s ocial enterprise that include s on-site programming improve me ntal health outcomes for the Filipino/a/x youth engaged? Learning Goal #1 - Mental Health Outcomes Does a culturally affirming space increase access to behavioral health and services for Filipino/a/x youth? Learning Goal #2 - Access Page 17 of 31 Additionally, the same occasional interviews or planned focus g roups with youth that engage with the cafe and centrali zed gathering space (mentioned above) can include questions about mental health needs and accessing resources . Available baseline data: Improved dropout rate and % of graduates that meet University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) requirements for Filipino s/a/x students o Jefferson Union High School District: Filipino/a/x students ma ke up 20% of dropouts and only 42% of graduates m et University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) requirements. o South San Francisco Unified: Fil ipino/a/x students make up 8% of dropouts, and just 19% of graduates met t he UC and CSU r equirements. Due to largely unavailable baseli ne data specific to Filipino/a /x youth quality of life and social determinants of health out comes, the following indicator s will be collected as a baseline and tracked throughout t he project to inform Learning Goal #3. Measures and methods could include: Number that participate in job/ internship, academic support an d leadership skills programming Improved educational outcomes (suspension, grades, etc.), as d etermined by pre/post survey Additionally, demographics of youth that engage will be collected and pre- and post- survey to assess protective factors , internal strengths and external supports across several contexts of their live s: personal, peers, family, schoo l, and community. Interviews/focus groups with y outh can provide more in-depth in formation about the impact of leadership, job and other life skills developed. Section 3: Additional Informati on for Regulatory Requirements CONTRACTING If you expect to contract out the INN projec t and/or project evaluation, what project resources will be applied to managing the Count y's relationship to the contractor(s)? How will the County ensure quality as well as regulatory compliance in these contracted relationships? All BHRS service agr eements (contracts, MO U's) are monitored by a BHRS Manager that has the subject matter expertise. Contract monitors check-in a t least monthly with service providers to review challenges, s uccesses, troubleshoot and sta y up-to-date on the progress of the project. Additi onally, reporting deliverables are set in place in the Can a holistic social enterprise model imp rove quality of life indicators for Filipino/a/x youth? Learning Goal #3 - Social Determinants of Health Page 18 of 31 agreements and linked to invoicing . Payments of services are contingent on the reporting. Evaluation contracts are monito red in a similar fashion by the MHSA Manager in collaboration with the assigned BHRS Manager. COMMUNITY PROGRAM PLANNING Please describe the County's Community Pr ogram Planning (CPP) process for the Innovative Project, encompassing inclusion of stakeholders, representat ives of unserved or under- served populations, and individuals who reflec t the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity of the County's community. In San Mateo, the CPP process for Innovation Projects begins wi th the development of the MHSA Three -Year Plan. A comprehensive community needs assessme nt process determines the gaps, needs and priorities for services, which a re used as the basis for the development of Innovation proj ects. Appendix 3 describes the Th ree-Year Plan CPP process for San Mateo County. Between February and March 2019, a broad solicitation of innova tion ideas was launched. Both a flyer and an MHSA Innovati on Idea Form were circulated t hrough various means: Flyers are sent to/placed at C ounty facilities, as well as ot her venues like family resource centers and community-based organizations; Announcements at numerous inter nal and external community mee tings; Announcements at program activ ities engaging diverse families and communities (Parent Project, Health Ambassador Program, Lived Experience Ac ademy, etc.); E-mails disseminating inform ation to over 1,500 stakeholders; Word of mouth on the part of committed staff and active stake holders, Postings on a dedicated MHSA w ebpage smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa, the BHRS the BHRS Blog www.smcbhrsblog.org MHSA Innovation brainstorming sessions held with groups that requested it (Lived Experienc e Workgroup, MH SARC Older Adult Committee). The MHSA Innovation Idea Form requested narrative on the propos ed idea/pr oject and information to ensure the idea meets the requirements for Innov ation funding. Additionally, in San Mateo County we had the requirement that the idea addres s the MHSA Three-Year Plan prioritized needs: Engagement and integration of older adults across services an d prevention activities Culturally relevant out reach and service delivery Integration of peer/family suppor ts across services and prevention activities Integration of co-occurring pr actices across services and pre vention activities Engagement services for trans ition-age youth (mentoring, educ ation, peer support) Broader housing options to suppor t individuals across the con tinuum of care We received 35 MHSA Innovation Idea Forms, which speaks to the need for innovation in serving some of our most vulnerable communities' needs. All submitted ideas were pre- screened against the Innovation requirements, twenty-one were m oved forward to an MHSA Innovation Selection Committee. The committee was made up of di verse clients, family Page 19 of 31 members, community service provi ders and staff. All projects we re reviewed and prioritized by the committee and included an Impact/Effort assessment and scoring. Five proposed Innovation ideas moved forward to develop into full Innovation project proposals for approval by the Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). On October 2, 2019, the MHSA Steering Committee met to review the 5 project ideas and provide comment and considerations for the projects. The MHSARC voted to open the 30- day public comment period and reviewed MHSOAC comments, during the public hearing and closing of the public comment period on November 6, 2019. No other substantive comments were received. All comments and letters of support are included in Appendix 4. MHSA GENERAL STANDARDS Using specific examples, briefly describe how your INN Project reflects, and is consistent with, all potentially applicable MHSA General Standards listed bel ow as set forth in Title 9 California Code of Regulations, Section 3 320 (Please refer to the MHSOAC Innovation Review Tool for definitions of and references for each of the General Standards.) If one or more general standards could not be applied to your INN Project, please explain why. Community Collaboration The planning of the cafe and cent ralized gathering space involv ed stakeholders representing various sectors of the community including youth. Initially, the idea was brought forward by the Filipino Ment al Health Initiative (FMHI) collaborative. To ensure the process was community inform ed, a needs assessment was conducte d to gather input that would develop the programming. A survey was distributed broadly, and four focus groups were facilitated that targeted specific age groups: youth, adults, and elders. Additionally, individual interviews and meetings were held with gatekeepers a nd key leaders of the Filipino/a/x community, which include, but are not limited to, executives of non-profit organizations and City and County elected officials. The collaboration with FMHI will continue through implementation of an advisory group. Cultural Competency The entire project is rooted in cultural values of Kapwa (\"toge therness\") & Ginhawa (\"total wellness\") and the understanding tha t cultural identification is a key protective factor for youth. Programming will leverage art and culture as described above. Client/Family-Driven As mentioned above, FMHI will continue to play a role in the im plementation of this project. Clients and family m embers will be engaged in an advisory capac ity through FMHI or as independent member of an advisory board. The evaluation contrac tor will gather input on the evaluation questions and stra tegies, develop quarterly progress reports to share preliminary findings and gather input from the advisory group. Wellness, Recovery, and Resilience-Focused Supporting wellness, recovery and resilience is accomplished th rough relationships and social networks, flexibility, respect and responsiveness, and taking a holistic approach that Page 20 of 31 considers overall health, st able housing, independence, etc. T hese principles are key to the strategies of the proposed proj ect including the programming th at will be offered to Filipino youth in the community. Integrated Service Experien ce for Clients and Families A request for proposal process wi ll select the service provider that will own the contract for these services. Pre-launch pl anning and ongoing collaboration will be critical to offering an integrated service experience for recipients. Cafe/center staf f/mentors will need to be well- informed on the full range of ser vices at BHRS and the communit y and build relationships with gatekeepers to ensure coor dinated referral and warm hand-o ffs. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND STAKEHO LDER INVOLVEMENT IN EVALUATION Explain how you plan to ensure that the Proj ect evaluation is culturally competent and includes meaningful st akeholder participation. As mentioned earlier, the evaluat ion contractor will engage an advisory group of diverse clients, family members and prov iders to gather input on the ev aluation questions, strategies and on quarterly progress repor ts. Cultural and language demogr aphics will be collected and analyzed as part of the quarterly reports to ensure equal a ccess to services among racial/ethnic, cultural, and li nguistic populations or communit ies. The quarterly reports will be used to inform and adjust as needed the direction, outreach str ategies and activities. INNOVATION PROJECT SUSTAI NABILITY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE Briefly describe how the County will decide whether it will continue with the INN project in its entirety or keep particular elemen ts of the INN project without utilizing INN Funds following project completion. Will individuals with serious mental illness receive services from the proposed project? If yes, describe how you plan to protect and provide continuity of care for these individuals upon project completion. With a social enterprise, we ar e establishing a stronger fundin g source that generates revenue that is allocated towards the centralized gathering spa ce and caf\u00e9 sustainability and the programming. In addition, e xisting programs that specia lize in these areas will be leveraged and serve as a platform and space for strengthening a nd building community partnerships across both the non profit and business sectors. The advisory group will be engaged in any needed adjustments of the project. In addition, the MHSA Steering Committee wi ll be a venue for vetting next st eps with diverse stakeholders. If the evaluation i ndicates that the proposed pro ject is an effective means of increasing access to behavioral health services for youth there may be availability of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) funding, a proposal of continuation would be brought to the MHSA Steering Committee and the Mental Health an d Substance Abuse Recovery Commission for approval and to a 30-day public comment process to secure ongoing PEI funding. Contractors wi ll be asked to develop a sus tainability plan as part of their project proposal. Page 21 of 31 COMMUNICATION AND DI SSEMINATION PLAN Describe how you plan to communicate results, newly demonstrated successful practices, and lessons learned from your INN Project. A) How do you plan to disseminat e information to stakeholders w ithin your county and (if applicable) to other counties? How will program participants or other stakeholders be involved in communication efforts? MHSA implementation is very much a part of BHRS' day-to-day bus iness. Information is shared, and input c ollected with a diverse group of stakeholders, on an ongoing basis. All MHSA informat ion is made available to stake holders on the the MHSA webpage, www.smchealth.org/bhrs/mhsa. The site includes a subscription feature to receive an email notif ication when the website is up dated with MHSA developments, meetings and oppor tunities for input. This is cur rently at over 1,500 subscribers. The BHRS's e-journal, Wellness Matters is published the first W ednesday of every other month and distributed electr onically to county wide partn ers and stakeholders, and serves as an information di ssemination and educational tool , with a standing column written by the County's MHSA Manager. The BHRS Blog also provides a forum for sharing and disseminati ng information broadly. In ad dition, presentations and ongoing progress reports are provided by BHRS, and input is sought on an ongoing basis at the monthly Ment al Health and Substance Abuse and Recovery Commission meeting at the MHSA St eering Committee meeting; at m eetings with community partners and advocates ; and internally with staff. Opportunities to prese nt at statewide conferences will also be sought.

Planning was l ed by the MHSA Manager and the Director of BHRS along with the MHSARC and the MHSA Ste ering Committee. A draft CPP process was presente d to and vetted by the MHSARC. The MHSARC was asked for their input and comments on the process and what other stakehol der groups should we be reaching out to in each of the CPP Phases. STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED Input was sought from twenty ni ne diverse groups and vulnerable populations to include perspectives of different backgrounds and interests including g eographical, ethnic, cultural and From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 social economic, providers and re cipients of behavioral health care services and other sectors, clients and their family membe rs. See the full list of input s essions below. Additionally, a PreLaunch sessi on was held with clients/consum ers hosted by the Peer Recovery Collaborative, a collabo rative of peerrun agencies in cluding California Clubhouse, Heart and Soul and Voice of Recov ery. At this session informat ion was presented and shared to help prepare clients/consumers for the CPP Launch session where they would be providing input and public comment. Discu ssion items included, 1) Backgr ound on MHSA; 2) What to expect at the CPP Launch session; and 2) How to prepare a publi c comment. Extensive outreach was conducted to promote two key public meet ings, the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017 and the CPP Prioritization Session on April 26, 2017. Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Samoan. Stipends to consumers/clients and their fami ly members, language interpreta tion, child care for families and refreshments were provided at each of these sessions. Over 270 participated in the se ssions, 156 demographic sheets w ere collected and of these 37% identified as clients/consumers and family members and 36 stipe nds were provided. The majority of participants at these two public meetings (64%) represented central and south geographical areas of the county. There are institutional barriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (trust, transportation, cultural and language, etc.). In an effort to account for this, two additional Community Prioritization Sessions were conducted in East Palo Alto and the Coastside. In the future, we will add a community session in the north part of the county as of aConsumer/Client Provider ofBehavioral HealthServices Provider of Healthand Social Services Decline to state Disability Represented Grou ps From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Date Stakeholder Group 12/7/16 MHSARC and Steering Committee (Input Proces 2/15/17 MHSARC Adult Committee 2/15/17 NAMI Board Meeting 2/16/17 Filipino Mental Health Initiative 2/21/17 Coastside Community Service Area 2/21/17 Northwest Community Service Area 3/1/17 MHSARC Older Adult Committee 3/2/17 Central Community Service Area 3/2/17 Peer Recovery Collaborative 3/3/17 Diversity and Equity Council 3/3/17 Northwest SchoolBased Collaborative 3/7/17 Pacific Peer Recovery Collaborative Session) 3/9/17 East Palo Alto Community Service Area 3/9/17 Central School Collaborative 3/13/17 MHSA Steering Committee (CPP Launch) 3/14/17 African American Community Initiative 3/16/17 Ravenswood SchoolBased Mental Health Collaborative 3/17/17 South Community Service Area and Child/Youth Committee 3/23/17 Chinese Health Initiative 3/23/17 Latino Youth Committee Alto (Communi 4/18/17 Coastside Prioritization Session) 4/19/17 4/20/17 Native American Initiative 4/20/17 Contractor's Association 4/21/17 Latino Immigrant Parent Group 4/24/17 Veterans 4/25/17 TAY recipients of services 4/26/17 MHSA Steering Committee (CPP Prioritization) From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 PHASE 1. NEEDS ANALYSIS To build off of the previous Commu nity Program Planning (CPP) p rocess in FY 2014/15, stakeholders including clients, f amily members, community partn ers and organizations were asked to think about current serv ices as they relate to the gaps in services identified in FY 2014/15 (listed below), specific service categories and populat ions served to identify any additional gaps in services: Cultural humility and stigma Timely access Services for peers and families Services for adults and older adults Early intervention Services for children and TAY Cooccurring services Criminal justice involvement For Phase I and the initial input sessions, stakeholders where asked the following questions, based on the priority gaps ident ified in previous years for con tinuity: From your perpective, do these M HSA services effectively [e.g. serve the cultural and linguistic needs of your target communities, address timely acc ess for your target communities, serve the behavioral healthcare needs of clients a nd families, etc. ]? What's working well? What improvements are needed? Probes: Do these services addr ess principles of wellness and re covery? stigma? Are current collaborations effective in reaching and serving ta rget communities? What is working well? What's missing? All comments received up to the d ate of the CPP Launch Session on March 13th were grouped into themes and presented a t the CPP Launch. Additional input was sought regarding both the needs/service gaps and whet her there were any voices (or communities) missing from t he Needs Analysis phase. The CPP Launch Session was a joint MHSARC and MHSA Steering Committee meeting and included a facilitated community input. Agenda items i ncluded 1) an MHSA Housing propos al for use of unencumbered housing funds 2) public c omment from clients, families and community members on priority needs a nd gaps in mental health services, and 3) breakout g roups to begin developing strategies t o address the key needs/ service gaps identified. About 120 clients, families, community members and stakeholders attended the CPP Launch Session. PHASE 2. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The Strategy Development Phase w as kicked off at the CPP Launch Session on March 13, 2017. Findings from the initial input sessions were shared at the CPP Launch Session including relevant strategy ideas. From the San Mateo County Mental Health Services Act ThreeYear Program and Expenditure Plan FY 1718 through FY 1920 & Annual Update FY 1718 While the above six need/gaps in services were identified, ther e was also an overarching theme that arose from the input sessions, which brought to surface co mmon questions in MHSA planning: do we build upon existi ng MHSAfunded programs or do we create new programs? Input session participants identified the need to consider both . It has been 10 years since the inception of MHSA and most progr ams have not received additiona l resources (aside from Cost of Living increases to the contracts) to expand services and/or clients served, especially for those programs that are resulting in positive behavioral health outcomes. Three key next steps for the CPP process were identified at the CPP Launch Session: Additional input sessions with vulnerable populations and key s takeholders identified. Additional strategy development sessions in isolated and higher need communities, in particular East Palo Alto and the Coastside/South Coast region. Follow up meetings with all MHSAfunded programs to identify pr iority program challenges, needs and possible st rategies to address these. PHASE 3. PLAN DEVELOPMENT The final Phase of the CPP Proc ess was kicked off at the CPP Pr ioritization Session on April 26, 2017. The meeting goals were threefold: 1. Present strategy recommendations, results from the Community In put Sessions and prepared public comments in s upport of each recommendation. 2. Provide meeting participants the opportunity to bring forward a ny additional strategy recommendations and to prioritize the additional recommendation s. 3. Prioritize across all strategies proposed (MHSA Steering Commit tee only) to help identify the recommendations to include i n the MHSA ThreeYear Plan. Appendix 4.

Michael Sagum - O ctober 22, 2019 I want to see a center that focu ses on Filipino culture and all ows youth to succeed in whatever they aim to do. 2. Victor Morales (Los Angeles) - October 28, 2019 I believe that this Filipino Cultural Center will be very benef icial to the target community because they are an underserved community. If this cultural center were to exist, it would encourage people to access help and overcome the stigma by being help ed by likeminded people as we ll as with people who share the same culture. At the same time, this center would also function to e ducate people outside of the target community of the Filipino culture. 3. Kim Davalos (San Fra ncisco, San Bruno), Skyline College - Novem ber 1, 2019 San Mateo is home to a signifi cant population of Filipinx/Filip inxAmerican families a nd have yet to have a place to proudly come into community together. As an educator a nd counselor at Skyline College which is within the San Mateo District, we foresee many partnerships and collaborations already! 4. Patrick Racela (Daly City, San Francisco) Kabataan Alliance - November 2, 2019 Community members in Daly City are in dire need of services alo ng the lines of employment support, workers' rights, and immigration services. 5. Jenard Lucky M. Abrena (Daly Cit y), Senior High School student and part of Filipino Barkada Club at Westmoor High School - November 2, 2019 I would support the development of a Filipino Cultural center a s I see this place benefiting the Filipino Community and it'll be a safe and fun place for our people/cult ure to go to. Most of us(filipinos) don't know much about our history and its ha rd to fit in as most of us eit her immigrated here or we were born here and just don't know what our culture is about. By having this place in the city that's heavily populated by Filipinos, it will help out the community a lot and it'll be a place were future generations will go and hang and even spread news of events that around the area. Like high schools t hat have Filipino clubs that are hosting events for their culture or even clubs t hat are doing fundraiser to he lp out the people here or back home in the Philippines. So we should we really have a Filipino Cultural Ce nter here in Daly City. 6. John NguyenYap (Oakla nd) - November 2, 2019 It is imperative to meet the com munity where they are at especi ally when trying to break through cultural stigma and lack of understanding of mental and emotional health . The Filipino Cultural Center idea is a wonderful and innovative way to engage the Filipino American co mmunity in Daly City and San Mateo County as a whole in their wellness and bring them into the behavioral health services that they will need. Approaching the outreach and engagement through a value of shar ed identity and shared space speaks to the Filipino American community. Th e approach of utilizing food, cr eativity, culture, and skill development as a bridge to wellness and stigma reduction is inspiring and what y outh and young adults have been yearning for since I have been working with youth (over 20 years). 7. Liza Marie S. Erpelo (San Franci sco, San Bruno), Coordinator, K ababayan Learning Community at Skyline College - November 3, 2019 The last time that Daly City and San Mateo County had a Filipin o community center with programs specifically geared for the youth was betwe en 2007 2012, at the Liwanag Ku ltural Center in the Hillside Clubhouse in Daly City. During that time, we were able to build through the Pili pino Youth Coalition, the Kalayaan School for Equity, the Downe Organizing Pro ject, and Filipino Graduation ( FilGrad). We were able to connect students and educators alike ac ross K12 and colleges /universities and c reate events and programs together to serve each other and our community. In 2012, the programming for LKC had to be scaled back due to other commitments of the board members, save for the organization LAY A Migrant Youth for Change and Action, so we are long overdue for a new c enter for our Filipino community . 8. Camille Santana (Concord), FMHI San Francisco, Center for Babay lan Studies, Kapwa Healing Circle, Los Medanos College - November 3, 2019 All my life, I have considered and been drawn to the question o f what is healing for the Pilipinx community? What does it look like and where and how does it happen? My sis ter has been struggling with a diagnosis of Bipolar for the last 9 years. ou r family has been dealing with stress and grief over this and a deep struggle of how do we support someone with mental illness in our family and also with what support and healing do we need as a family and a system? Community healing spaces like t he Filipino Community Culture Center is an extremely valuable and needed res ource and safety net for Pilip inx youth, their families and future families. I strongly support this healing spac e for several reasons. I beli eve people heal in community, in knowing their cultural and ancestral backgro und, through artistic development and expression, and through leadership and vocational development, which I view as deeply tied to one's pu rpose and sense of selfefficacy and worth. I also view peer counseling as and group counseling and sharing a n extremely valuable part of healing for the Pilipinx community. I am especially concerned about the high rates of suicidality i n the Pilipinx community particularly with young people. I personally have been impacted by the suicide of one o f my best friends who was Pinay. Again, I cannot stress the importance of FM HI San Mateo's work and all F MHI groups across the Bay Area with examining and supporting access and innovations in mental healt h treatment and support for the Pilipinx community. There is healing that needs to happen in our communi ty and our cultural resources and perspectives on this healing is extremely needed. This unique a pproach to healing in the Filipino Youth Culture Center speaks to everything I feel is missing in wellness and t reatment of mental health: community, culture, arts, safe space to be in relati on with peers, and career and l eadership development. 9. MarLa C. Medina (Daly City, San Francisco) - November 4, 2019 I think it would be great to have a space where Filipinos and p eople alike could share skills with each other and collectively create w ith each other. 10. Claire Atilano (South San Fran cisco) - November 4, 2019 So, the next generations of Filipino can learn about their own cult ure 11. Darren Kumasawa (Redwood C ity) - November 4, 2019 Although I am not Filipino, I know many people in the Filipino community who have talked to me about this project and are excited to see it developed. I have heard firs thand how the community would benefit from a Filipino Youth Culture Center. A lthough the focu s of the Cente r would be on the youth, I think all age groups will benefit from the Center and it will help bring the generat ions closer together. Having a space for atrisk youth to learn new skills and be mentored by supportive adults will help to improve their mental health. 12. Maple Molina (Oakland ) - November 4, 2019 It's important for our youth to have a safe place that is acces sible to them. It's also v ery empowering to have a community that is in their cohort that they can relate to and b uild strong connections and purpose with. 13. Jennifer Valido (South San Fran cisco) - November 5, 2019 We need it to preserve our culture in the generations to come a s well as a deeper representation in a predominantly white community. 14. Christian Carlo Cegue rra (Pacifica) | Kababay an Learning Commun ity - November 5, 2019 Health is not only for the privileged. 15. Rhoel Paragas (Daly City), Anakbayan - November 5, 2019 Counseling or Mental Health 16. Eduardo Unisa Jr. \"EJ\" (South Sa n Francisco), Student @ Skyline College, Kababayan Learning Community Student - November 5, 2019 I am in solidarity of a creation of a Filipinx Cultural Center. Daly City has the largest concentration of Filipinx folk outside of the Philippines, h owever there is nothing disti nctly Filipino about it. Th e creation of such will provide resources that our peopl e need and will be able to grea tly benefit from. As a S. San Francisco resident, I have spent an ample amount of time of my youth in Daly City b ecause of how close to home it makes my family feel. Having a space to d edicated for Filipinx youth wil l go a long way in preserving and cultivating our culture and helping usher a new generation of criticalthinking , cultural conscious youth. 17. Leila SottoOrquiza (Daly City) - November 5, 2019 As a young woman who grew up wit h a lack of resources regarding my Filipina culture, I believe having a center would benefit individuals and families regarding wellnes s and my community. 18. Merve Lapus (Richmond, San Franci sco), VP of Outreach and Partn erships, Common Sense Education - November 5, 2019 The Filipino culture has been dil uted over the many years due t o strategic colonization and natural resources. Despite that, we have always fo und ways to innovate and carryo n to spread and share the depth of our culture. that resilience is also seen in how the Filipino comm unity will rally to learn and meet the demand for many high needs positions in our community. From farmworkers to nursing in the medical industry, and currently helping to solve the education crisis across so many US cities. There is a reason why Filipinos are so nimble and innovative. Providing a center that allowed for our youth and Filipinos of all ages, and general population of the like to learn more about what makes our Filip ino neighbors and community so strong and connected is a much needed resource fo r the community. 19. Leila Perreras (South San Fr ancisco) - November 5, 2019 It is important to have a sense of belonging to have human inte raction and the ability to build community for my children. 20. Shiraz Karmaz (Pacific a) - November 5, 2019 I believe this cultural center c an play a vital role in the com munity by engaging youth and, importantly, their guardians and seniors to help the m gain perspective and educati on on the complex mental health issues they face. The community youth, the fu ture, need to be empowered to solve the problems they will face as they come up against powerful forces like climate change, economic i nstability, and student debt that will put a strain on their mental and physical wellbeing. The project can, if marketed and located with care, be a very accessible and comfortable service that the community can come to rely on. The uplifting cycle it has the potential to create cannot be unde rstated. With each generation passing through feeling more confident and comfortable with their ability to create change, the center wil l be proven to be well worth the investment. 21. Hazel Benigno, PsyD (Pacifica, S an Carlos) - November 5, 2019 Research on health and wellness ha s repeatedly shown that the b est results occur when s upport is provided in a culturally relevant way. For F ilipinx Americans, this is prov ided amongst community, through a multifaceted approach. The proposed youth com munity center reframes wellness in a way that looks at holistic wellbeing, allowing youth to define and follo w what wellness means for the m on an individual and collective basis. A culturally affirming space woul d allow young adults to find str ength, beauty, and healing within their community. We live in a time when more and more young people ar e becoming increasingly aware of their intersecting identities. Being able to access an inclusive spac e that honors and reflects their lived experiences is what provides room for individual and community healing and resilience. As someone who grew up as a Filipina American in the Bay Are a, a space that has long been c onsidered diverse, I still felt that my own cultural awareness was lacking fo r most of my adolescent years. I had to actively seek out and join multiple organizations and extracurricula r activities to even have any s ense of connection and cultural knowledge. Even then, I didn't get a chance to fully immerse myself in and unde rstand history and culture in a way that felt impactful until my undergraduate years. I had to wait until I w as in college and paying a hefty tuition to access any kind of ethnic studies cours es. Understanding one's own his tory and connecting to it should not come with these kinds of barriers. Today's youth deserve an accessible, a ffirming space that allows them to belong to a culture that is their birthright . I fully support the developme nt of this center on a professional and personal level, and I hope we can co unt on your support as well. 22. Angeline Tablante (San Bruno, Sout h San Francisco) - November 5 , 2019 I fully support the creation of the Filipino Cultural Center, a s it would not only provide the younger generations life skills, help foster their cr eativity and allow them to get familiar with the members of their community, but it would also give them the oppo rtunity to learn about their cu lture. I was fortunate to have grandparents that exposed me to Filipino cultural a rts as a child, and as a resul t I was able to learn and appreciate my roots as well as make lasting social conne ctions. I believe this helped me become the confident a nd fulfilled adult that I am. Thus, it would be wonderful to give the younger generations access to learn Filipino cultural arts and the chance for positive effects in their futures. I feel it is imp ortant to learn about one's culture as it gives a strong sense of one's identity, and wit h the understanding of one's id entity comes the ability to empathize and desire to help others. I also believe that having the center would pr omote a sense of belonging , which is important in one's wellbeing and happiness. I have faith that the center w ould make a positive impact on the community by providing knowledge to the youth on how to be selfsufficien t and emotionally balanced, which in the long run will create leaders and responsible citizens who will parti cipate in making the world a better place. 23. Jazz Lamadora (Daly City, Belmont), FMHI Community Member - Nov ember 5, 2019 I fully support the creation of a Filipino Cultural Center beca use cultural affirming spaces that promote wellness and positive youth development are needed in San Mateo County. Growing up in Daly City, I did not have access to the cultural resources to learn, explore, or cel ebrate my Filipinx identity. There were limited, if any, age appropriate services a nd safe spaces available. This w as despite living in a predominantly Filipinx community. Instead, I internaliz ed negativity and harmful messa ging from my environment. I felt culturally estranged. As a youth, participating in spoken word poetry in o ther counties allowe d me to explore my fragmented sense of self, peel a way the masks, and develop inte rnal strength to deal with mental health issues. Writing and performing po etry was my coping skill. It w asn't until moving away to college where I embraced my cultural identity through affirming and engaging sp aces that I had the oppo rtunity to participate in. Youth and young people should not have to leave their commu nity in order to receive culturally affirming services and opportunities. I wa nt my younger siblings and our future leaders to be proud of who they are, where they come from, to learn a nd challenge cultural norms, to engage in peer dialogue, to have access to spaces that promote we llness and to help them reach their poten tial. It's prevention an d early intervention work. I think an inclusive and intergenerational space is also a powerful way to build community bridges and contribute toward real positive change. What excites me the mos t about the proposal is the concept of a social enterprise model. The cafe would not only address social determ inants of health by providing employment opportunities to atrisk youth, but also raise cultural and men tal health awareness to the public using market based strategies. The Filipino Cultural Center would have incre dible potential to incre ase community access to behavioral health services while reducing stigma. I have talked to many Filipinx and nonFilipinx family members, friends, and acquaintanc es about the Filipino Communit y Center proposal. Most of them are surprised that a space like this doesn't already exist given th e demographics and community will. Now is the time and the support from the MH SA Innovation Fund will truly m ake it a reality. 24. Desirae Sotto (Daly City, Belmont) - November 5, 2019 To find community in this city that has been my home all my lif e. 25. Alexis Cuison (Los Angeles) - November 5, 2019 It's a great to have a Filipino Yo uth Culture Center in San Mat eo County because ther e are not a lot of outlets/places where Filipino culture is represented in the com munity. As someone who grew up in the Philippines and have FilAm friends who don't necessarily know the culture, it is important to have an understanding of your heritage a nd knowing your own motherland. 26. Jillianne Conti (South San Francisc o, San Francisco) - November 5, 2019 \"Yes\" ... I would suppor t the development of a Filipino Cultural Center 27. Laarni San Juan, RN, PHN, MPH (S an Francisco, Daly City, South San Francisco), Pub lic Health Nurse San Mateo County - November 5, 2019 From my professional experience as a public health nurse employ ed by San Mateo County for 21 years and from my own personal experience of dealing with mental health c hallenges, this innovation project would greatly serve the Filipino comm unity. This unique center would fill the large gap of not having adequate culturallyappropriate support t o truly address the complex nat ure of mental health. Fastpaced medical offices and clinics often focus on physical symptom control i.e . blood pressure and diabetes management, and often overlook the psychological aspect of wellbeing. Mental h ealth wellness and recovery goes beyond distributing washedout pamphlets at doctors' offices and pinni ng xeroxed copies on lo bby corkboards. The Filipino Cultural Center would be dressed with inviting decor, have appropriately trained staff, and would be the \"go to spot\" for solace as w ell as community gatherings and activities. The ability to be able to go to a familiar space to engage and comf ortably participate are very i mportant aspects of we llness in the Filipino community. This kind of innovativ e space will reach the target community because it is centrally located, easily accessible, and intentional in its plans to truly help and upli ft those who need services. The Filipino community deserves dedicated space unique to their perspective and approa ch to wellness. This innovate project is needed healing the community this way now will serve future g enerations to come. 28. Velba Villanueva (Daly City, San Francisco), Daly City Planning Commission - November 6, 2019 Filipinos are one of the largest ethnic groups in Daly City. Th e development of a Filipino Cultural Center would help teach and preserve the Filip ino cultural within the commun ity. I can imagine it becoming a safe space for Filipinos who recently immigrated to find resources in a foreig n country. And a place also Filipino Americans to learn more about their culture. In general cultural centers are a great way for the community to learn about each other. 29. Craig Wiesner (Daly Ci ty, San Mateo) San Mateo County LGBTQ C ommission, Small Business, Owner, Home Owner in Daly City - November 6, 2019 Daly City is blessed to have one o f the largest Filipino popula tions in the country yet we don't have a place where Filipino youth can learn ab out and celebrate their herita ge, overcome the challenges of historic marginalization, support each ot her and families, and make Daly City and the Bay Area a place where Filipino Americans can thrive today and tomorrow. 30. Janine Ning C. Recio (San Franci sco), Voice Acto r & Singer/Song writer - November 6, 2019 Growing up in Daly City in the 80s and 90s, I didn't really hav e a place where I felt I could explore my creativity outside of school. Creativity is so important in all aspects of life and if fostered at young ages, it really prepares a person to be resourceful and in novative as an adult. Creativi ty also does wonders for everyone's mental health, both children and adults alike. A child's school life a nd an adult's working life is often so stressful, that having a place like this where com munity can gather, but also l earn and grow together is so important. There are so many opportunities and expe riences that can be opened up to the community with this innovation project. I see it being an exciting prospect for the future of this city, with lasting, positive longterm effects. 31. Krystle Cansino (Sout h San Francisco) LGB TQ Commission, Crisis Services, Junior Apostles for Christ - November 6, 2019 The Bay Area peninsula has a hig h volume of Filipinos in the ar ea, however there is no ce nter or location where one can go to learn about our hi story and heritage. I think the cultural center would serve our multigenerational population but also highlight the wonders of Filipino culture for those are eager to learn. We don 't have filipino specific servi ces in the Bay Area. It's been a problem looking for filipino Tagalog speaking cli nicians who are inept to work with our population. 32. Lolita Ortua JAC (San F rancisco), retired SFGH Nurse, St. Paul of the Shipwreck - November 6, 2019 It would be nice to have a place where we can go to get service s. There are lots of Filipinos in the area that would feel proud to have a center for the community. 33. Tess Cansino (Dublin), TriValle y Filipino Community - November 6, 2019 We don't have one. We should have a place where people can go t o learn about our culture. 34. Errol Feria (San Francisco, Daly City), Daly City Youth Health Center - November 6, 2019 As the Behavioral Health Manager of the Daly City Youth Health Center, I offer my support for this project as a way to bridge the gap between the clinical aspect and the pract ical aspect of coping with mental health issues. I imagine a space, like the Filip ino Cultural Center, located i n the North County of San Mateo, an accessible place for our adolescent clients at the health center to apply the social skills they developed during therapy, practice the life skills learned, find a place to work, or just to have a safe space to visit. I also imagine a strong collaboration between agencies th at would enable mental health providers, clinicians, case workers, other professionals, and community mem bers to conduct crossreferrals , develop projects, and share information or ideas for the betterment of our youth and their families in the community. 35. Myan Molina (South San Fran cisco) - November 6, 2019 Growing up in the Philippines and coming to America at a young age, the transition and assimilation process can be very difficult. The culture shock is real and it can be traumatizing for a lot of folks. Having a cultural center that provides a space for Filipino Americans in the Bay Area is helpful because it's a safe space where our community can not only gather but to also preserve and prom ote our culture and heritage. A center in Daly City where there's a grea t population of Filipinos is nece ssary and I'd love to see it come to life. 36. Kalen Jennings (South San Fr ancisco) - November 6, 2019 A Filipino Cultural Center will provide support to our Filipino community and will be a s ource of learning and engagement for our whole county to understand and appreciate Fi lipino culture. 37. Christopher Cansino (Dub lin) - November 6, 2019 We don't have one. 38. Michelle Sampior (San Francisco, Bay Area) - November 6, 2019 Having a center where I could have talked about my anxiety as a developing youth would have been helpful. I often dealt with my feelings alone as I couldn't express them a t home. Especially those tender high school years where my identity started taking shape, I likely would ha ve been given better tool s to help with my self esteem rather than learn them at a distance through other peopl e. 39. Kristine Javier (South San Fr ancisco) - November 6, 2019 We need a safe zone to be able to connect/network with our peop le, to be able to share stories, help out one another, empower one another. 40. Steve Disselhorst (San Bruno), Ou r Family Coalition and San Mat eo County LGBTQ Commission - November 6, 2019 Daly City has the highest concen tration of Filipinos outside th e Philipines. Many are rec ent immigrants or first generation Filipinos. This community center will provide them a place to connect with others, connect with their heritage, and integrate into the mainstream culture. 41. Monica Ramil (San Francisco), M onica Ramil Therapy - November 6 , 2019 A Filipino Cultural Center would be extremely beneficial to the health and wellness of the Filipino community. It would provide a safe space to connect with others, to find r esources and to learn ab out each other. It's so easy to isolate in this day and age; community is needed now mo re than ever. It is important to share stories, talk about and normalize our struggles and help each other see the strengths we each po ssess that can be hard to see if we are on our own. 42. Nes Marco Morales (Daly City) - November 6, 2019 I have not experienced services offered for the community. I b elieve it is very importan t one to have because a lot of people need mental heal th support and many are unaware h ow to manage those conditions. I would benefit as well as I am currentl y managing my own through a com munity I had to create for myself and for others over the years. But imagine those wh o can't do that for themselves would suffer. I believe in the development of a Filipino Cultural Center!\" 43. Christian Guerre ro (Daly City) - November 6, 2019 A Filipino Cultural Center can a ddress the specific needs of th e Filipino American population in Daly City in relevant and culturallyengagi ng ways that are not yet availabl e in the area. Due to the suburban nature of Daly City, and the limited city funding for expansive health se rvices, alternative forms of support and programming are needed in order to engage the youth. A Filipino Cultural Center will be able to more efficiently address community i ssues while developing the socia l and economic capital of the population. The social enterprise orientatio n of the proposed project will allow for longerterm and more sustainable programming in the city. I perso nally have experience with comm unity organizing in the Daly City and have seen the struggles in regard to funding. There was a nonprofit with a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor called the Pilipino Youth Coalition in Dal y City around 2011 which was hou sed at the Liwanag Kultural Center near Jefferson High School. This organ ization lost its grant writer, so we transitioned into a volunteerbased grassroots organization called La ya Migrant Youth\u2014paying for re nt through incomegenerating projects and donations. This organization paused operations when volunteers transitioned out of Daly City and we lost the stability of funding. Having seen this, I believe that the soci al enterprise project proposed by FMHI will be able to support the community through i ts programming while ensuring longterm operational sustainability due to its funding structure.\" 44.

Yves Augustin (Alameda, San F rancisco) - November 6, 2019 It will be very beneficial for the Bay Area diversity due to th e strong Filipino presence in the area. 46. Cheryl Martin, LMFT (South San Francisco) - November 6, 2019 We need a Filipino community center because we have the largest area of Filipinos outside of the Philippines and it's a travesty to the Filipinos in the area that we don't have a place to congregat e in the area. Having our Filipino people hang out in Serramonte is not enough. 47. Rachelle Banares (South San Fr ancisco) - November 6, 2019 I'm a big believer and teach in the healing arts. It be great to have a space that supports the wellness and preventive health of the communi ty that my not be always be acc essible due to cost or feeling judge. For example I'm a yoga teacher and I would love to provide a suppor tive environment to teach to the community. There such a need for it though cl asses are expensive or it doe sn't cater to the needs of older Filipinos. 48. Carlo Dela Cuesta (San Francisco) - November 6, 2019 I would support the development of a Filipino Cultural Center... To help out fellow Filipinos 49. Ronald Ponferrada (San Franc isco) - November 7, 2019 It's a space to collaborate, netw ork, and most importantly shar e culture knowledge to anyone who would like to spend time with oth er people's company. 50. Nathan Garcia (Daly City), Kababy an Alumni Student - November 7 , 2019 I feel that the center will be ver y positive for the intended t arget community in providing a very safe, comfortable, and very educational environment. 51. Camille Pangilinan (Daly City, S an Bruno), Skyline Kababayan Le arning Community - November 7, 2019 As a Filipino immigrant who has recently moved to Daly City, I feel that it is ironic how Daly City has the highest concentration of Filipinos outside the Philippines yet the supp ort systems available for Filipinos in the community is almost nonexistent. I believe that the development of a Filipino Cultura l Center will not only benefit me, but also my fellow Filipinos around the Bay Area. 52. Inna Bleykhman (San Franci sco) - November 7, 2019 Education, collaboration, communi ty building, equal representat ion of this vibrant, talented, and hardworking community. 53. Ashley Byington (Port Char lotte, FL) - November 7, 2019 I am a school counselor and can see a huge benefit to this proj ect. Many students and families I come into contact with need a lot of additi onal support outside of the sc hool setting, and sadly, the stigma associated with seeking out that support often outweighs the risk of doing so. I think if students and families had a safe place that connected them direct ly with services that could hel p, it could make an incred ible impact in the lives of those people. A center devote d to the Filipino culture will give its members/visitors the opportunity to receive services that they o therwise may not seek out. 54. Maria Cielo Mellinger (San Di ego) - November 7, 2019 Because it's necessary for people to have a safe place where th ey can share their experiences with others. 55. Ashton Tyler Castillo (South San Francisco) - November 7, 2019 As a fellow Filipinos I think it would be a good idea to have a cultural center to appreciate the whole culture and to be able to educate other people about it. 56. Mark Anthony Estrada (Daly City, San Bruno), Skyline College, A ssociated Students of Sk yline College, CIPHER Learning Community - November 8, 2019 A contemporary space that is bu ilt to educate and assist the yo uth of today is the best thing we could have in my community. 57. Jaelyn Malilay (Daly City) - November 8, 2019 I want to support the developmen t of a Filipino Cultural becaus e it will help young and developing youth to have a place of safety. This w ill provide them a safe community where they can come and talk to a community who understand their own cultural. Every culture is different a nd everyone needs that person/community to understand the struggles and happ iness that relate to them! 58. Kristine Isidro, RN DPH (San Francisco) - November 8, 2019 Our Filipino community deserves a space to share our own cultur e in our society and for all nations to embrace our Filipino culture 59. Marianne Millena (South San Fran cisco), Filipino Student Union President, Pilipino Cult ure Night Director - November 8, 2019 I believe that I should support the Filipino Cultural Center be cause it is something that needs more exposure to students like us because we are the future. The more that we le arn about our culture, the more that we are able to show who we are and wher e we came from. I think the goa l that Skyline communi ty has accomplished, in my eyes, is that the advisors we're able to open our heart a nd open our minds to new beginnings. Meaning that they helped me discover tha t I have a voice and I am capab le of being who I want to be as a leader. In this Filipino Cultural Center, I would like to see the same. I have spoken to students who wanted to be in the Kababayan Learning Community (KL C) however changed their minds because they feel like they don't belong, they didn't speak the language, or they think that they're too \"FOB.\" In addition, the things that I have learned in the Skyline, for example, KAPWA, my own grandparents who are traditional filipinos did not know that there was more to this word, they didn 't know anything about the core values of Filipinos, which is something that makes me feel different. I suppo rt the Filipino Cultural Center . 60. Christian Carlo Cegue rra (Pacifica, San Br uno) - November 9, 20 19 Mental Health is as import ant as Physical Health 61.

Gene Ryan Pangan Kababayan Learn ing Community - November 12, 2 019 With a vast population of Filipin os in Daly City, there is no f ormal Location for Filipinos that other people might recognize and developing a Filipino Cultural Center will make r elative changes for that issue 64. Myan Molina (South San Fran cisco) - November 17, 2019 Growing up in the Philippines and coming to America at a young age, the transition and assimilation process can be very difficult. The culture shock is real and it can be traumatizing for a lot of folks. Having a cultural center that provides a space for Filipino Americans in the Bay Area is helpful because it's a safe space where our community can not only gather but to also preserve and prom ote our culture and heritage. A center in Daly City where there's a grea t population of Filipinos is nece ssary and I'd love to see it come to life. 65. Elizabeth Marco (San Francisco) , Homeless Children's Network - November 19, 2019 The development of a Filipino Yo uth Culture Center would be a p riceless asset to the Bay Area Community as a whole. There are many barriers for Filipino youth to access inf ormation about their own cultures including intergenerational trauma, language barriers, and the pressures of acculturation. I be lieve that by creating a community space where young Fili pinos can nurture pride for the ir beautiful and vibrant culture will be a valuable resource for them in the future. As someone who grew u p in a family of first generation migrants from the PI that created an envi ronment where we were not allow ed to speak / ask abou t our motherland due to the traumas my family endured I would have been incredibly t hankful for a space such as this where I could learn to undo these invisible psy chic wounds that I was holding in my body. Being able to embrace my culture fully has made me feel like a more whole person and has led me to a place of rich self discovery I think this cultural center would be able to give that same gift to the you th of San Mateo, enric hing their lives and creating beautiful connections. 66. Susan Cordero (San Jose, San Mat eo, Hayward), MSW CSUEB & FMHI Intern - November 19, 2019 Growing up in the Bay Area, ther e were not many Filipinx spaces that I was aware of and none that catering to youth that would also provided access to mental health services . Due to generational trauma and pressures of assimilation, there was so much of my culture that I didn't ful ly understand and didn't know how to ask my family about as a youth. I didn' t have the opportunity to furth er develop my cultural identity until college, where I was an outlier at a pred ominantly white college. Thanks to my family's sacrifices and dedication, I was allowed the opportunity and privilege to pursue higher educatio n. These are opportunities and privileges I wish my family had access to as they are amazing, strong, and l oving people. They deserve to be celebrated and to have a place tha t honors and respects our culture; a pla ce to connect with their roots and connect with Filipinx youth who are navigating their own development. The ce nter will beautifully address the needs of the community, including addressing mental health stigma and honori ng our ancestry through a holistic perspective. This is an inspiring project th at will benefit so many Filipinx youth and families in the future. I am a huge supporter of the meaningful proje ct and look forward to all of the opportunities it will create for the Filipinx community. 67.

OFFICE OF THE CITY COUNCIL CITY OF DALY CITY 333 - 90TH STREET DALY CITY, CA 94015-1895 Toby Ewing Executive Director Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission 1325 J Street, Suite 1700 Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Mr. Ewing With a population of over 34,000 Filipina/o/x Americans (FilAm) in Daly City (American Community Survey, 2017), this community represents the largest concentration of Filipinos outside of the Philippines. Although there has been a FilAm presence since the 1960s, there has been a significant lack of services and resources for this community. As a City Council Member, educator, and leader in the community, it is vital to have services that are culturally relevant and responsive for FilAm youth. The opportunity to have a Filipino Cultural Center in Daly City is long overdue and the advantages it presents for empowering and addressing the issues of mental health are essential. I am writing this letter in full support for the Filipino Cultural MHSA Innovation project being submitted by the San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. Having a Filipino Cultural Center that focuses on the needs of FilAm youth is crucial based on research that has shown high rates of mental health issues, the stigma of voicing out matters of wellness, and cultural mistrust in obtaining services. As an Ethnic Studies professor who has taught Filipina/o/x American studies over the past two decades at Skyline College in San Bruno, CA, common themes of a lack of a cultural identity; substance abuse; and issues of depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation have been prevalent in my classroom. This is an opportune time where leadership can step up and provide the necessary resources and services for this underserved community. The potential of having a Filipino Cultural Center in Daly City presents numerous opportunities for creating a leadership pipeline for youth to realize their potential and become active leaders in our community. The social enterprise model can provide youth lifelong skills in professionalism, networks, organizing, leadership, and a cultural identity that can provide purpose and pathways for success. It will allow them to obtain the social, cultural, political, economic, and cultural capital that will allow them to navigate through their personal, CITY COUNCIL RAYMOND A.

This is key in building foundational pillars in developing an identity of confidence, creativity, and service to others. The opportunities to learn about their history and culture will allow them to understand how their experiences are related to a long legacy of struggle and survival stories in America. It will help them to construct a sense of pride and purpose to continue this narrative of resilience and legacy. By having a space where FilAm youth can discuss, explore, learn, and build with one another has the potential to create a supportive and caring community to bridge between generations, service-learning, and civic agency. According to a 2017 study on FilAm voter turnout, by Filipino Advocates for Justice (FAJ) expressed that 50% of the eligible voting population in San Mateo County vote and the number of young people are vastly underrepresented. The potential of a Filipino Cultural Center can cultivate a space for youth leadership to become connected to the community and become politically engaged. I fully endorse the proposal for the Filipino Cultural MHSA Innovation project submitted by the San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. Their proposal presents the strong need for a Filipino Cultural Center in Daly City and how it will benefit our community. I urge you to support this project and provide the essential resources and services for this underresourced community. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email at councilememberRod@gmail.com. Sincerely, Dr. Roderick Daus-Magbual Council Member City of Daly City Nate Nevado Counselor, Skyline College Executive Director, Rock The School Bells Coordinator, CIPHER Hip Hop Learning Community 3300 College Drive San Bruno, CA 94066 November 10, 2019 Toby Ewing Executive Director Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission 1325 J Street, Suite 1700 Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Mr. Ewing: This letter is to support the Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project being submitted for approval by the San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. My name is Nate Nevado and I am a counselor at Skyline College in San Bruno, CA. I am also the Executive Director for Rock The School Bells which is an annual Hip Hop educational conference that is aimed to educate middle school and high school youth about the importance of higher education, career exploration, mental health wellness, and social justice issues. Rock The School Bells has been serving the community for the last 12 years and has been replicated at other colleges such as De Anza College, Sacramento City College, and the University of Hawaii in Manoa. We have recently been awarded by the Kent Award for San Mateo County for our intentional work with our students in addressing the educational gaps through curriculum development and pedagogical practices. Despite the success of Rock The School Bells, there is a significant gap in providing continued support and resources for our Filipino community. It is also important to note while Rock The School Bells is Hip-Hop based and is rooted in Black arts and culture, many Filipino youth and students have identified themselves through Hip Hop culture. In fact, for the last 5 years in my work with the CIPHER Hip Hop Learning Community, nearly 75% of the students I serve in this community are Filipinos. In the CIPHER Hip Hop Learning Community, our students engage in classes that are degree-applicable and transferable to universities such as English, History, Sociology, and Counseling. These classes are all contextualized in using Hip Hop as a framework to educate students about current events, mental health wellness, social justice issues, identity, financial literacy, and career development. All of our classes generate all of their learning through cultural production such as creating videos such as documentaries, music production, creating artwork, songwriting, and event coordination. As with any class in college, the experience can last one semester. Students are left with figuring out where they can go to generate new and existing cultural production particularly our students from Daly City. As an educator, I believe strongly that we should not place the responsibility on youth and students to seek for these services and resources; that it is the responsibility of the City and the County to create these opportunities. The Filipino Cultural Center can provide so much for our students who are seeking academic, emotional, and creative outlets. The Center can provide a space, an ocean of knowledge, a pipeline from programs such as CIPHER and Rock The School Bells at Skyline College, where our students can continue to extend their learning outside of school. I am excited for this intentional and necessary work for our community. As an educator who has been in higher education for the last 15 years and has been one to approach education in new and innovative ways, I have learned that when you create educational and humanizing spaces that fosters sense of belonging and cultural humility and integrity, individuals of all ages can develop a greater sense of self, acquire the practice of agency and advocacy, and develop meaningful relationships intergenerationally. We appreciate your consideration of the Filipino Cultural Center. Sincerely, Nate Nevado Skyline College Rock The School Bells Toby Ewing Executive Director Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission 1325 J Street, Suite 1700 Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Mr. Ewing , The LGBTQ Commission of San Mateo County is writing to support the Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project being submitted for approval by the San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. The Filipino community is suffering, and it h as gone unnoticed for long enough. The effects of colonial mentality have driven the Filipino community to undiagnosed/untreated depression, substance use, cultural identity confusion, oppression, and suicide ideation. There needs to be a solution to this and we believe the proposed Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project is a start. Not only can this Filipino Cultural Center support the community break through the cultural stigma and lack of understanding of mental and emotional health, but it c an bridge the gap of Western and Eastern practices and be a catalyst for future models of mental health services for minorities. The integrative approach of traditional therapeutic behavioral services to treat the pathologies of an individual with the unde rstanding of emotional suffering as a universal human condition and needing to take an active role in shaping one's psychology provides a balanced approach to mental health. This Filipino Cultural Center would be the first of its kind in San Mateo County a nd would be pioneers for providing to an underserved population using supportive, creative, and innovative methods. We hope you can join us in supporting to change course of the diverse effects of mental health, mental illness, and mental health services w ithin the Filipino community by approving the Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project.

Toby Ewing Executive Director Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission 1325 J Street, Suite 1700 Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Mr. Ewing : This letter is to support the Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project being submitted for approval by the San Mateo County Behavioral Hea lth and Recovery Services . My name is Juslyn Manalo, a resident in Daly City, San Mateo County for over 30 years and currently on the City Council for the City of Daly City. As a Filipino American being raised in the Bay Area, it was through support of organizations and programs that gave me the understanding of who I was and what it meant in regards to the word com munity, to sustain my well -being. The Filipino Cultural Center MHSA Innovation project will chang es lives, and potentially even save the lives of young people in our community. The innovation project excites me because it takes a holistic approach to a taboo topic within the Filipino commu nity, most especially with the youth. It is extremely important youth have a safe space, an outlet for creativity and a place they can hone into their leadership skills. As I look back, through different youth programm ing, I gained support. The idea of having a place especially geared towards providing mental health services and including programming that serves as a catalyst for a young person to understand who they are, once again feel safe, and gain ownership of their creativity and share it with the community is invigorating. I have no doubt that this innovation project will reach the target community, especially those who are not accessing services. Mental Health sustainab ility should be part of our routine but because of stigma and lack of resources, it is not. This program will open doors for those who do not seek services and will hopefully prevent tragedies and teach young people that receiving help is not a weakness but a strength. The overarching model, looks at every aspect of someone's wellbeing. Through culture, a very significant part of one' s self, a wellness social enterprise in itself, is designed to put the youth in the center of the conversation and es sentially give a safe space for expression, inner reflection and an outlet with trained professionals who can identify and support these young people. In the proposal sent, the program is well thought out to include the most important aspects and tools to teach youth in their Wholistic Well-being. Career Path/Purpose (school -to-career prep) Wellness Ambassadors (wellness and mental health linkages) Rite of Passage Work (cultural identity formation) Leadership Development (i.e. capstone arts- based projects to address mental health &amp; wellness related social issues facing the community) Youth Production Line &amp; Management (financial wellness) I am amazed at the concept of the CommuniTREE which provides a framework which uses a tree as a metaphor to depict the values that ground this work (SOIL), the supports needed (ROOTS) for success, the strategies that will get us there (BRANCHES), the resulting youth capacity (LEAVES) and health outcomes (FRUITS) we expect to impact. Daly City has a high percentage of Filipino Americans and young people that need the support in their most vulnerable times. I urge you to support the Filipino Cultural Center, MHSA Innovation project as this will impact the community and provide services to those underserved, and in essence provide a life-line for youth to understand themselves, thei r culture , the mental health resources, tools for them as they proceed into adulthood to pass on to others and the next generation.

In East Palo Alto, one of the biggest cha llenges for our outreach and r eferral partnerships is getting our clie nts to go to the clinic after w e refer them. If the clinic staff is able to go out our work will be more effect ive. We agree with your sentiment and are hopeful that the opportuni ty to retool our clinics will allow for appropriate level of supports for client unmet needs. Thank you fo r your comment. I would like you to consider the fact that 1time MHSA $ should NOT be used to cover for county budget deficit and \"restructuring\" cli nics. This money (I believe) is not meant t o be used for County budget pro blems. Those $ are for providing services. The funding as proposed is aligned with the priorities set by t he MHSA Steering Committee; including th e use of onetime funds for Sys tem Improvements of Core Services an d Stop Gaps for Budget Reductio ns that may impact MHSA direct services to seriously mentally ill clien ts. The budget deficit stopgap will allow us to ensure that the most severe c lients receive Full Service Partnership services , which include nonmental hea lth services and supports to advance clients' recovery. Clients' needing a lower level of care can be transitioned appropriately to BHRS case managers an d outpatient therapist who can s upport continuity of care for the client. Thank you for your comment. My suggestion is rather than have workers going out to the home s of patients who are in need of assi stance, create several local ar eas/offices for patients to visit and which are in reach because of locations. I would challenge the effectiveness of u sing the resources going 1:1 to homes. Thank you for your input. Curre ntly, County Health and BHRS ar e in a planning process to complete a full review and analysis of spac e needs. Your feedback will be incorporated into that planning process. Capital Facilities - Cordilleras - 1 comment received I would like you to consider using actual \"SMC\" General Budget $ for capital improvements instead of using MH SA onetime funding to pay one million towards rebuilding Cordilleras. I agree and totally agree that Cordilleras needs help, but I don't believe it should come out of our very small MHSA budget funding. Especially onetime funding. The County General Bud get is experiencing a deficit overall. Cu rrently, we are identifying all external f unding available to complete this $100M project by 2022. County Health has contrib uted $7.8M, Stat e Dept of Hea lth Care Services has approved $2.3M from Whole Person Care Initiative. The ask from MHSA is $1M, which is aligned the MHSA Steering Committee priorities for use of these onetime funds . Capital Facilities is an all owable expense. MHSA Innovation Projects Launched Innovation Solicitation in January 2019 35 ideas received, 20 reviewed by Selection Committee Moving forward with 5 ideas Handout: MHSA Innovation Ideas Prioritization Below are brief summaries of the proposed five Innovation Proje cts for San Mateo County. 1. Addiction Medicine Fellowship in a local community setting Estimated Project Amount & Length: $663,125 / 4 years The proposed project is an accred ited Addiction Medicine Fellow ship sponsored by San Mateo County that is tailored to addressing the needs and priorities of the public sector including treating the most vulnerable communitie s with cooccurring substance use disorders, advancing equity on multiple levels and contributing to educational projects in cli nical and community settings. This would also be the first Addiction Medicine Fellowship based in a loca l health safety net heal th system, serving as a model for California's 58 counties. 2. Colocation of Prevention and Ea rly Intervention Services in Lo wIncome Housing Estimated Project Amount & Length: $925,000 / 4 years The proposed project will provide prevention and early interven tion services including behavioral health resources, supports, screening, referrals and linkages t o young adults, ages 1825, onsite at affordable housing properties, minimizing stigma and reducing b arriers to accessing behavioral health care. 3. PIONEERS CollegeAge Pacific Islander Mental Health Estimated Project Amount & Length: $925,000 / 4 years The proposed project, Pacific Islanders Organizing, Nurturing, and Empowering Everyone to Rise and Serve (PIONEERS) provides a cultu rally relevant, college behavi oral health program for NHPI youth that prioritizes the mental wellbeing of students and their res pective communities through empowerment, leadership and advocacy. 4. Older Adult Homelessness Prevention due to Economic Stress Estimated Project Amount & Length: $750,000 / 4 years The proposed project will reach out and engage isolated older a dults who may be at risk of becoming homeless. Trust and sa fety will be established to redu ce shame/stigma. Older adults will be screened for economic stress, behavioral health issues, and connected to homeless, housing and behavioral health resources for planning, and support, to preve nt acute homelessness and to slow the growing older adult homeless population trend. The innovati on will create a new partnership between Human Services Agency Cent er for Homelessness providers , Older American Act programs, Behavioral Health and Recovery S ervices, and Aging and Adult Se rvices. 5. Social Enterprise Cultural and Wellness Caf\u00e9 Estimated Project Amount & L ength: $2,625,000 / 5 years The proposed project is a cultural arts and wellnessfocused so cial enterprise caf\u00e9 that offers youth development and mental health programming on site. The social e nterprise caf\u00e9 will hire and train atrisk youth from Northern San Mateo County and serve as a cul turally affirming space for Filipino/a/x youth and community. The social enterprise model h as proven to be a more sustainable approach when it comes to stab le and diversified funding stream s. Most of the existing community organizations that offer some ele ments of the proposed project rely heavily on grantwriting and fundraising. FY 201920 MHSA Innovation Projects30Day Public Comment - Public Comments Received for MHSARC Rev i e w 1 1 / 6 / 1 9 Public Comments Received - for MHSARC Review Innovation Project Proposals Comments Response Older Adult Homelessness Prevention - 3 letters of support were received for the Older Adult Homeless Prevention proposal The proposed project will reacho ut and engage isolated older a dults who may be at risk of becoming homeless. Trust and safety will be e stablished to reduce shame/stigma. Older a dults will be screened for econo mic stress, behavioral health issues, and connected to homeless, ho using and behavioral health resources for planning, and support, to preve nt acute homelessness and to slow the grow ing older adult homeless popul ation trend. The innovation will create a new par tnership between Hum an Services Agency Center for Homelessness providers, Older Americ an Act programs, Behavioral Health and Recovery Services, and Aging an d Adult Services. I would like you to consider older adult outreach to Board and Care residents who are at risk of hom elessness, expansion of the sen ior peer program would be an alternative to a new homeless service. Thank you for your input on incl uding Board and Care residents, we will add this to the proposal. As fo r expansion of the senior peer program, this would not qualify for Inno vation funding as it is a curren t program we have been successfully providing. But, we do agree with your c omment and this past fiscal year did expand senior peer program servic es to address the waitlist of about 48 clients. Addiction Fellowship 6 comments were received in support of the Addiction Fellowship proposal. The proposed project is an accredited Addiction Medicine Fellow ship that is tailored to addressing the need s and priorities of the publi c sector including treating the most vuln erable communities with cooccu rring substance use disorders, advanci ng equity on multiple levels an d contributing to educational proj ects in clinical and community settings. This would also be the first Add iction Medicine Fellowship base d in a local health safety net health system, serving as a model for Califor nia's 58 counties. I would like you to consider co llaborative care with peer certi fied addiction specialists, peers providing se rvices and supports in the commu nity Thank you for your input on including a peer component and spec ifically involving Peer Certified Addicti on Specialists, we will add thi s to the proposal. This is critical to r ecovery principles. Currently a s proposed, the IMAT team will provide case manag ement for patients seen by the fellow in the hospitals and clinics. 30Day Public Comment - Public Comments Received for MHSARC Rev i e w 1 1 / 6 / 1 9 Why MHSA funding and not primary health or drug MediCal dollar s for a medicalbased fellowship. Addiction is a specialty that to uches on all fields of medicine , including mental health. Substance use diso rders and mental health disord ers have a very high rate of cooccurrence (at least 50% in both directi ons). Given this, addiction specialist will receive training in the diagnos is and treatment of mental health disorders. We want people suffering from addiction to be served wherever they enter our health system. In San Mateo County Health, people with only the most serious of menta l illnesses are treated in clinics purely devoted to mental healt h; all others with mild to moderate, and often severe, disorders are treated by primary care providers with the help of integrated behavioral h ealth teams. Most primary care provid ers, hospitalists, and psychiat rists are not trained to treat substance u se disorders. This is one reas on that only ten percent of people with addict ions receive any MH treatment and why MHSA can provide a great opport unity to fill this much needed g ap. Oneyear fellowship then what? Where are the certified addictio n fellows housed, in hospital or BHRS clinics? This proposal is for 3 years, so we would hopefully be able to train 3 fellows, adding to the workforce o f physicians able to treat th is very underserved population. If it is successful, we hope our posit ive findings will help us secure additional f unding. The fellow will be rota ting through various locations such as the int egrated mental health team wit hin primary care, the hospital wards, emergency department, and spe cialty clinics such as the Pain Clinic and Edison Clinic. Social Enterprise Cultural and Wellness Caf\u00e9 - 43 Comments received in support of the Social Enterprise proposal The proposed project is a cultur al arts and wellnessfocused so cial enterprise caf\u00e9 that offers youth development and mental health programming on site. The social enterprise caf\u00e9 will hire and t rain atrisk youth from Northern San Mateo Co unty and serve as a culturally affirming space for Filipino/a/x youth and community. The socia l enterprise model has proven to be a more sustainable approach w hen it comes to stable and diversified funding streams. Most of the ex isting community organizations that offe r some elements of the propose d project rely heavily on grantwriting and fundraising.

Given this, we have $12.5 million excess reserve and available to spend as onetime 2. MHSA OneTime Funds Public Comments MHSARC Motion: Vote to open a 30day public comment period for the MHSA Plan t o Spend Available OneTime Funds o Yoko opened the motion o Letitia seconded the motion o Unanimous vote to open 30day public comment period Plan to Spend OneTime Funds o Priorities for onetime funds were set back in January System Improvements for core MHSA services Technology and Capital Facilities - ideas in this category came from BHRS budget stakeholder meetings Workforce Training & Community Education/Awareness - community education was added based on recent input sessions (for example: board and care WRAP, mental health, trauma informed care) County Budget Update - Louise Rogers o BHRS hosted idea sessions to help with budget reduction strategies (done across SMC Health) o Even though we have a great local economy for the moment (e.g. unemployment is low), the reality for the services we provide in County Health is that we have a 4:10pm financial problem because of the situation in Washington Encourage everyone to vote in terms of federal legislation Medicaid and MediCal are our big revenue Our cost continues to go up because it is expensive to live and work in the County Employing people here are very costly Cost is increasing faster than revenue o SMC Health implemented first set of ideas in July 2019, will bring update and new ideas to Board in January 2020 o BHRS gap is $5 million dollars - BHRS budget is over $200 million dollars (San Mateo Medical Center gap is $48 million) Gap across SMC Health $50+ million (out of $864 million budget; less than 10%) o Why talk about this? Increasing awareness about the budget Consider what new things we create while thinking about keeping existing services solid Reductions in budget will be thoughtful Onetime allocation to support BHRS budget impacts o $1 million for Cordilleras cons truction - Capital Facilities (Louise Rogers) We own Cordilleras (unincorporated area) Built in 1950s to be TB hospital has not been renovated and rehabilitated since 117 beds - 63 are in locked medical health rehabilitation center and 54 are residential care Looked for another piece of land to see if they could build something new - people don't want facilities like this in their neighborhood Rebuilding it (on site 20 acres) best solution 4 residential cottages (16 beds each) and large housing complex (57 housin g beds), total 121 beds Common space on the ground floor for nonprofit partners to engage, meeting space, kitchen, spiritual space, beautiful outdoors, healing place for people's recovery submerged in nature Project expected to be completed by 2022 and are currently identifying all funding needed Total cost is $100 million (budget $120 million for cushion) $7.8 million contributed by Health, $2.3 million from State, requesting $1 million onetime from MHSA o $4 Million for FSP/Clinic budget gap and restructuring - System Improvement (Scott Gilman) Will use $4 million ($2.4 million first year, $1.5 million second year) as a stop gap (vs. cutting positions) - and will focus on restructuring to increase billable services and bring in revenue. For example, traveling to a client's home for an appt can be reimbursable vs. waiting on a client who ends up being a noshow Will improve coordination with FSPs moving people to community Public Comment o Client/California Clubhouse We should conduct a fundraiser for Mental Health Awareness Month activities o OASIS Peer Support Worker/Steering Committee Member We've already spent monies on restructuring into Community Services Areas - why will we be spending another $4 million on this? o California Clubhouse Board Member Thrilled to see money in supportive employment California Clubhouse is effective model for supportive employment o OASIS Peer Support Worker How are we restructuring, what is the money actually being spent on? Response: in order to avoid cuts, the monies will be used to fund current positions. Restructure may have not been the best word but, rather than make $2.5 million dollar of cuts, let's give people time to get billable services up. o MHSA Steering Committee Member Is the funding for only those in FSP? Response: No, it will impact all clients Is funding used for transportation and lost productivity for travel time? Response: No, infrastructure funding is already in place. It's for positions that would be otherwise cut to conduct activities that would be billable and support client engagement o California Clubhouse Member Supported Employment is a well worthy cause, helpful in helping people find jobs, good to have funding for it We will be able to pull California Department of Rehabilitation federal dollars 3.

American Institutes for Research (AIR) is working wit h San Mateo County (\"the County\") to understand how enrollment in an FSP promotes resiliency and improved health outcomes of individuals living with mental illness served by an FSP (hereafter referred to as \"partners\"). This report shows outcomes for chi ld, transitional age youth (TAY), adult, and older adult clients (hereafter referred to as \"partners\") of the Full Service Partnership (FSP) program in San Mateo County using FSP program survey data and Avatar data, San Mateo County's electronic health records (EHR) system . Exhibit 1, below, presents the percent improvement between the year just prior to FSP and the first year with FSP , by age group . Percent improvement is the percent change in the perc ent of partners with any events . For example, the percent of adult partners experien cing homelessness changed from 91% before FSP to 58% in the first year with FSP, a 36.3% improvement . In sum, the findings from self -reported outcomes (survey data) suggest that the vast majority of the outcomes improve ( 27 of 32 outcomes) for all reported age groups. As can be seen in Exhibit 1, there are improvements comparing the year prior to FSP to the first year of FSP for partners in all age groups for the following self -reported outcomes: arrests , mental health emergencies, and physical health emergencies. In addition, for children and TAY partners, school suspensions decrease, and for adult partners, the percent with any employment increases. Further, fewer adult and older adult partners ha ve an active substance abuse problem and are receiv ing substance abuse treatment. Finally, t he percent of TAY and adult partners with an episode of detention or incarceration decreases . However, there are five outcomes for which there is no improvement. First, for TAY partners, grade ratings decrease, and homelessness increase s slightly (less than 10%) . Second , for child partners, grade rating and attendance decrease. T he proportion of children who are incarcerated increases in the first year of FSP. However, th e increase in incarceration is relatively small (26 in the first year with FSP compared to 22 in the year just prior) when compared to the decrease in arrests ( 9 in the first year with FSP compared to 24 in the year just prior) among child partners. Moreo ver, the main finding from the hospitalization outcomes (EHR data) is that , compared to the year before joining an FSP, there are reduction s in the percent of partners with any hospitalization, mean hospital days per partner, p ercent of partners using any PES, and mean PES event per partner. The only exception is that the mean hospital days for older adults increase by about one day which is likely be attributed to other medical conditions as both the hospitalization and PES incidence decrease significantly . Also, for all cohorts, t he reductions are consistently observed over the years since the inception of the FSP program . 2 Exhibit 1: Percent Improvement in Outcomes by Age Group, Year before FSP Compared with First Year with FSP FSP Outcomes Self-reported Outcomes Adult (25 to 59 years) N = 346 Older adult (60 years & older) N = 59 Yr before Yr after change Yr before Yr after change Homelessness 91 58 36.3% 3 8 N/A Detention or Incarceration 61 43 29.5% 3 5 N/A Employment 35 44 25.7% 4 2 N/A Arrests 52 6 88.5% 3 0 N/A Mental Health Emerg. 151 57 62.3% 13 7 46.2% Physical Health Emerg. 83 26 68.7% 18 12 33.3% Active S.A.

FSP programs provide individualized integrated services, flexible funding, intensive case management, and 24 - hour access to care (\"whatever it takes\" model) to help seriously mentally ill adults, children, transition -age youth and their families on their path to recovery and wellness. In San Mateo County (the County) there are currently four comprehensive FSP providers, Edgewood Ce nter and Fred Finch Youth Center serve children, youth and transition age youth and Caminar and Telecare serve adults and older adults. As part of San Mateo County's implementation and evaluation of the FSP programs, American Institutes for Research (AIR ) is working with the County to understand how enrollment in the FSP is promoting resiliency and improved health outcomes of County's clients living with a mental illness. The data used for this report are collected by providers via self -report from the partners as well as electronic health records (EHR) data obtained through the County's Avatar system . Note that self -reported data for this year is available only for adult and older adult partners (Caminar and Telecare). This is because the providers workin g with younger partners had technical difficulties entering data into the system. Initial survey data are collected via an intake assessment, called the Partnership Assessment Form (PAF), which includes information on wellbeing across a variety of measure s (e.g., residential setting), at the start of FSP and over the twelve months just prior. While a partner, survey data on partners is gathered in two ways. Life changing events are tracked by Key Event Tracking (KET) forms, which are triggered by any key e vent (e.g., a change in residential setting). Partners are also assessed regularly with Three Month (3M) forms. Changes in partner outcomes are gathered by comparing data on PAF forms to data compiled from KET and 3M forms. EHR data collected through the SMC Avatar system contain longitudinal partner -level information on partner demographics, FSP program participation, hospital stays , and PES uses before and after the enrollment date within the SMC health system . The Avatar system is limited to individual s who obtain care in the San Mateo county h ealth system. Hospitalizations outside of San Mateo County, or in private hospitals, are not captured. The following report will explore how the first year with FSP differs from the year just prior to joining the FSP program, for child, transitional age youth (TAY), adult, and older adult individuals who complete at least one full year with FSP. Then, we present trends in EHR data overall and over time, by year of FSP program enrollment . Appendix A presents addi tional detail on residential outcomes . Outcomes for individual FSP providers can be found in Appendix B. Details on our methodology for both the FSP outcomes and hospitalization outcomes can be found in Appendix C. 5 Self-reported outcomes The following section presents outcomes for the 148 child ( aged 16 and younger ) FSP partners, 202 TAY ( aged 17 - 25) FSP partners, 346 adult (aged 26 -59) FSP partners, and the 59 older adult (aged 60 and older) FSP partners. The results described compare t he first year on FSP to the year just prior to FSP for partners completing at least one year of FSP. Several outcomes are broken down by age category, as described below. N ote that employment, homelessness, incarceration, and arrest outcomes are not prese nted for older adults, as there are insufficient observations in this age group for meaningful interpretation (i.e., there are less than 5 older adult partners total with any of these events). 1. Partners with any reported homelessness incident: measured by residential setting events of homelessness or emergency shelter (PAF and KET) . 2. Partners with any reported detention or incarceration incident: measured by residential setting events of Jail or Prison (PAF and KET) . 3. Partners with any reported employment : measured by employment in past 12 months and date employment change ( PAF and KET) .1 4. Partners with any reported arrests: measured by arrests in past 12 months and date arrested (PAF and KET) . 5. Partners with any self -reported mental health emergencies: measur ed by emergencies in past 12 months and date of mental health emergency (PAF and KET) . 6. Partners with any self -reported physical health emergencies: measured by emergencies in past 12 months and date of acute medical emergency (PAF and KET) . 7. Partners with any self -reported active substance abuse problem : measured by self -report in past 12 months and captured again in regular updates ( PAF and 3M). 8. Partners in substance abuse treatment : measured by self -report in past 12 months and captured again in regular u pdates ( PAF and 3M). In addition, we also examine three outcomes specific to child and TAY partners: 9. Partners with any reported suspensions : measured by suspensions in past 12 months (PAF) and date suspended (KET) 10. Average school attendance ranking : an ord inal ranking (1 -5) indicating overall attendance; measured for past 12 months (PAF), at start of FSP (PAF), and over time on FSP (3M) 11. Average school grade ranking : an ordinal ranking (1 -5) indicating overall grades; measured for past 12 months (PAF), at st art of FSP (PAF), and over time on FSP (3M) Then, mental and physical health emergencies are considered in conjunction with residential status for all age groups combined. Specifically, the likelihood of an emergency is considered for partners in all advan tageous residential settings in their first year with FSP is compared to partners experiencing one or more high risk setting . For a dditional detail on residential outcomes, see Appendix A. For additional details on outcomes broken apart by FSP providers, see Appendix B. For details on the methodological approach, see Appendix C. 1 Employment outcome is not applicable to child and TAY partners. 6 First, please find the comparison of outcomes in the year prior to FSP to the first year on the program for adult partners in Exhibit 2. Homelessness , incarceration, arrests, self-reported mental and physical health emergencies , and substance abuse problems and treatment all decrease . In addition, employment increase s. Exhibit 2: Outcomes for Adult Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 346) Next, below in Exhibit 3, please find the comparison of outcomes in the year prior to FSP to the first year on the program for older adult partners. Similar to adult partners, self -reported mental and physical health emergencies , and substance abuse problems and treatment all decrease .

The findings are essentially the same as those in the last year's report. All but one self -reported incidences (homeless, arrest, suspension, mental or physical health emergencies) decrease . The increase in incarceration is small (26 in the first year with FSP compared to 2 2 in the year just prior) . The magnitude of decline in arrest incidence is much larger (9 in the first year with FSP compared to 24 in the year just prior). Exhibit 4: Outcome s for Child Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 148) Outcomes on school attendance and grades are presented below in Exhibit 5. As can be seen, attendance and grades for child partners decline modestly. Recall that these ratings are on a 1 -5 scale, coded such that a higher score is better.

The increase in homelessness is small (26 in the first year with FSP compared to 2 4 in the year just prior). Compared to the last year's report, the magnitudes of decrease are similar and slightly larger . Exhibit 6: Outcomes for TAY Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 202) Outcomes on school attendance and grades are presented in Exhibit 7. Attendance and grades for TAY partners change very little. These ratings are on a 1 -5 scal e; a higher score is better. Exhibit 7: School Outcomes for TAY Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 202) 2 The 40 older TAY partners in Telecare and Caminar are excluded from these outcomes because these providers do not reliably gather outcomes related to school attendance.

Advantageous settings are defined as living with family or foster family, living alone and paying rent, or living in group care or assisted living. Hi gh risk settings are defined as homelessness, incarceration, or in a hospitalized setting. As can be seen, both mental and physical health emergencies are more common among individuals who experience a high risk residential setting.

Percent of partners with any hospitalization decreased from 23% before FSP to 1 2% during FSP. Days in the hospital decreased from 6. 98 days before FSP to 2. 51 days during FSP. Percent of partners with any psychiatric emergency services (PES) decreased fro m 42% before FSP to 27% during FSP. The average number of PES events decreased from 1.1 9 events before FSP to 0. 69 events during FSP.

Health Care Utilization for FSP Partners by Age Group This report also presents the four hospitalization outcomes for the 198 child, 164 TAY, 29 8 adult, and 44 older adult partners using the Avatar system (EHR): 1. Partners with any hospitalizations: measured by any hospital admission in t he past 12 months 2. Partners with any PES: measured by any PES event in the past 12 months 3. Average length of hospital ization (in days): the number of days associated with a hospital stay in the past 12 months; 4. Average number of PES event: the number of PES e vents in the past 12 months. *Note that the difference in the number of partners across the data sources is due to the difference in age group definition (see Appendix C) and not every partner has a health care record in the County's EHR system. Hospitalization outcomes are presented in Exhibit s 10-13. For all four age groups, t he percent of FSP partners with any hospitalization or PES event decrease s after joining FSP . The mean number of hospital days experienced by FSP partners decreases after F SP enrollment , except for the older adult group. The average number of PES events decreases after FSP enrollment for all the age groups. 11 Exhibit 10: Hospitalization and PES Outcomes for Adult Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 298) Exhibit 11: Hospitalization and PES Outcomes for Older Adult Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 44) 39%54% 18%38% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Percent of Clients with Any HospitalizationsPercent of Clients with any PESPercent of Adult Partners with Any Healthcare EventYear Before First Year 12.1 1.83.5 1.0 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.0 Hospital Days (Length of Stay)PES per ClientQuantity of Healthcare use for Adult ParntersYear Before First Year 27%34% 14%16% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Percent of Clients with Any HospitalizationsPercent of Clients with any PESPercent of Older Adult Partners with Any Healthcare EventYear Before First Year 4.5 0.75.4 0.2 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 Hospital Days (Length of Stay)PES per ClientQuantity of Healthcare Use for Older Adult ParntersYear Before First Year12 Exhibit 12 : Hospitalization and PES Outcomes for Child Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 198) Exhibit 13 : Hospitalization and PES Outcomes for TAY Partners Completing One Year with FSP (n = 164) 5%24% 2%11% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Percent of Clients with Any HospitalizationsPercent of Clients with any PESPercent of Child Partners with Any Healthcare EventYear Before First Year 1.3 0.5 0.10.2 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4 Hospital Days (Length of Stay)PES per ClientQuantity of Healthcare Use for Child PartnerYear Before First Year 14%43% 11%30% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Percent of Clients with Any HospitalizationsPercent of Clients with any PESPercent of TAY Partners with Any Healthcare EventYear Before First Year 4.8 1.02.8 0.8 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 Hospital Days (Length of Stay)PES per ClientQuantity of Healthcare Use for TAY PartnersYear Before First Year13 Health Care Utilization for FSP Partners over Time Exhibits 14-18 show the four hospitalization outcomes, stratified by enrollment year. As can be seen in Exhibit 14, the percent of p artners with any hospitalization decreased after joining an FSP program for all cohorts. Exhibit 14: Percent of Par tners with Any Hospitalization over Time Exhibit 15 displays the mean hospital days per partner. With the exception of 2006 and 2007 cohorts, most partners experienced decreases in the mean number of hospital days. Exhibit 15: Mean Number of 4.17.0 3.59.0 (LOS) in Hospital Year Before First Year14 Exhibit 16 displays the percent of partners with any PES event by the year they began FSP. All cohorts experienced a decline in the likelihood of a PES event. Exhibit 16: Percent of Partners with any PES Event over Time Finally, Exhibit 17 displays the mean PES events per partner. Again, all cohorts experienced a reduction in PES events. Exhibit 17: Mean PES Events Year15 Appendix A: Additional Detail on Residential Outcomes For residential setting outcome s, we present all the categories of living situations and compare the percentages of any partners spending any time in various residential settings the year prior to FSP and in the first year . A list of all residential settings and how they are categorize d, is presented in Appendix C with the methodological approach. As can be seen in Exhibit A1, the percent of clients reporting any time in an inpatient clinic, homeless, incarcerated, or living with parents decreases. In contrast, the percent living in an assisted living, group home, or community care environment , or living alone or with other s, paying rent increases .

The outcomes in this section are broken apart for the following FSP providers: Caminar and Telecare. No outcomes are presented for any group of partners with 1 0 or fewer individuals. Exhibit B 1-B3, presents the percent of partners with any events the year just prior to FSP and the first year on FSP, as well as the percent improvement for each FSP provider . Percent improvement is t he percent change in the percent of partners with any events. As can be seen in Exhibit B 1, there are improvements comparing the year prior to FSP to the first year during FSP for Caminar on all the available self -reported outcomes. The percent difference with any employment is reported as N/A because the percent of partners with employment increases from 0% to 2%. Thus, the denominator is 0. Exhibit B 1.

Among the providers included in these analyses (Fred Finch, Edgewood, Caminar, and Telecare), 795 partners completed a full year with FSP since program inception. Three datasets were obtained: one from Caminar , one from and from Edgewood . Caminar and Edgewood provided their datasets in a Microsoft Excel format while Telecare provided a raw Microsoft Access database , which included data on individuals who were not affiliated with FSP. For Telecare only, we limit ed the dataset to FSP partners using the Client Admission data and the System Agency Program. Edgewood /Fred Finch serve child partners and TAY partners . Caminar and Telecare serve primarily adult and older adult partners, and a small number of older TAY clients. Exhibit C1 below describes the age group of partners completing a t least one full year of FSP by provider.

Note that for clients who stopped and then reestablished their FSPs, we only kept the record corresponding with their most recent Global ID, as indicated in the State's documentation. Partner type (child, TAY, adult, and older adult) is determined by the PAF data. For Caminar and Edgewood/Fred Finch, this was done using the variable Age Group . o Caminar: a value of (7) indicated a TAY partner, a value of (4) indicated an adult partner , and a value of (10) indicated an older adult partner. o Edgewood/Fred Finch : a value of (1) indicated a child partner, and a value of (4) indicated a TAY partner. o In both cases, this was confirmed using the Age variable. For Telecare data, partners were given a PAF appropriate for their age; the partner type was identified by the Form Type variable (TAY_PAF; Adult_PAF; or OA_PAF). 20 Partnership date and end date were determined as follows: End date was determined by the reported date of the partnership sta tus change in the KET, if the status is indicated to be \"discontinued.\" For clients still enrolled as of the data acquisition at the end of the year, we assigned an end date of June 30, 2018. All data management and analysis was conducted in Stata. All co de is available upon request. Additional details on the methodology for each outcome are presented below. Residential Setting 1. Residential settings were grouped into categories as described in the table below (Exhibit C2). 2. The baseline data were populated u sing the variable PastTwelveDays collected by the PAF. Individuals without any reported locations were assigned to the \"Don't Know\" category. 3. First residential status for partners once they join FSP is determined by the Current variable, collected by the P AF. Individuals without any reported current residence were assigned to the \"Don't Know\" category. Some individuals had more than one Current location. In this case, if there was one residence with a later value for DateResidentialChange , this value was co nsidered to be the first residential setting. If the residences were marked with the same date, both were considered as part of the partner's first year on FSP. 4. Additional residential settings for the first year were found using the KET data if the DateRes identialChange variable is within the first year with FSP as determined by the partnership date. If no residential data were captured by a KET, it was assumed that the individual stayed in their original residential setting. 21 Exhibit C2: Residential Categories Category Telecare Setting Value3 Caminar, Edgewood, and Fred Finch Setting Value4 With family or parents With parents 1 1 With other family 2 2 Alone Apartment alone or with spouse 3 3 Single occupancy (must hold lease) 4 19 Foster home Foster home w ith relative 5 4 Foster home w ith non -relative 6 5 Homeless or Emergency Shelter Emergency shelter 7 6 Homeless 8 7 Assisted living, group home, or community care Individual placement 9 20 Assisted living facility 10 28 Congregate placement 11 21 Community care 12 22 Group home (Level 0 -11) 16 11 Group home (Level 12 -14) 17 12 Community treatment 18 13 Residential treatment 19 14 Inpatient Facility Acute medical 13 8 Psychiatric hospital (other than state) 14 9 Psychiatric hospital (state) 15 10 Nursing facility, physical 20 23 Nursing facility, psychiatric 21 24 Long -term care 22 25 Incarcerated Juvenile Hall 23 15 Division of Juvenile Justice 24 16 Jail 30 27 Prison 31 26 Other / Don't Know Don't know 0 18 Other 49 17 3 Setting names determined by Setting variable in Telecare data. 4 Setting names determined by the following guide: https://mhdatapublic.blob.core.windows.net/fsp/DCR%20Data%20Dictionary_2011 -09-15.pdf 22 Employment Employment outcomes were generated for adults only. Therefore, Edgewood and Fred Finch data were excluded. 1. The baseline data were populated using the PAF data. An individual was considered as having had any employment if there was a non -zero, non -blank value for one of the following variables (note that variable names differ slightly by dataset): a. Any competitive employment in past t welve months (any competitive employment; any competitive employment for any average number of hours per week; any average wage for competitive employment) b. Any other employment in past twelve months (any other employment; any other employment for any avera ge number of hours per week; any average wage for any other employment) 2. Ongoing employment was populated using the variable indicating the date of employment change (variable names vary slightly by file) in the KET file, as long as the date is within the f irst year with FSP as determined by the partnership date. A change is considered as indicating some employment if the new employment status code indicated competitive employment or other employment (again, variable names differ by data set). We assumed tha t no information on employment in the KET indicated that the original employment status sustained. Arrests 1. The baseline data were populated using the variable ArrestsPast12 collected by the PAF. Individuals with blank data in this variable were assumed to have zero arrests in the year prior to FSP. 2. Ongoing arrests were populated using the variable indicating the date of arrest (variable names vary slightly by file) in the KE T file, as long as the date is within the first year with FSP as determined by the partnership date. We assumed that no information on arrests in the KET indicated that no arrests had occurred in the first year on FSP. Mental and Physical Health Emergenci es 1. The baseline data were populated using the variable MenRelated and PhysRelated for mental and physical emergencies, respectively, as collected by the PAF. Individuals with blank data in this variable were assumed to have zero emergencies of that type in the year prior to FSP. 2. Ongoing emergencies were populated using the variable indicating the date of emergency (variable names vary slightly by file) in the KET file, as long as the date is within the first year with FSP as determined by the partnership date. The type of emergency was indicated by EmergencyType (1=physical; 2=mental). We assumed that no information 23 on emergencies in the KET indicated that no emergencies had occur red in the first year on FSP. Substance Abuse 1. The baseline data were populated using the variable ActiveProblem and AbuseServices for active substance abuse problems and participation in abuse services , respectively, as collected by the PAF. Individuals w ith blank data in this variable were assumed to have no substance abuse problems or abuse services in the year prior to FSP. 2. Ongoing substance abuse data were populated using the 3M data variables of the same name. Any record of an active substance abuse p roblem or participation an abuse services during the first year of FSP was recorded. No observations were assumed to have no ongoing abuse problem or participation in abuse services. 24 Methodology for Avatar Data Analysis The hospitalization outcomes use electronic health records (EHR) data obtained through the Avatar system. Using EHR data avoids some of the reliability shortcomings of self -report, but this presents challenges as well. The Avatar system is limited to individuals who obtain care in the San Mateo county hospital system. Hospitalizations outside of San Mateo County, or in private hospitals, are not captured. The hospitalization outcomes include 704 partners who completed one full year or more in a FSP program and were in the Avatar system. Ind ividuals started FSP between July 2006 (the program's inception) and June 2016, completing at least one full year before June 2017. All data management and analysis were conducted in Stata. Code is available upon request. To count instances of psychiatric hospitalizations and PES admissions, we relied on the Avatar view_episode_summary_admit table. Exhibit C3 shows the program codes corresponding with the above measures. Additionally, FSP episodes were identified through th e Avatar episode_history table. Exhibit C3: Program codes among clients ever in the FSP Program code Program value Psychiatric Hospitalizations 410200 ZZ410200 MEDICAL CENTER - PES Notes: Data represent all utilization from FSP clients for these codes, as pulled from Avatar on April 5th, 2016. Partner type (child, TAY, adult, and older adult) was determined by the partner's age on the start date of the FSP program, as derived from the \"c_date_of_birth\" variable from the view_episode_summary_admit table and the \"FSP_admit_dt\" variable from the episode_history table. As we have discussed in the previous year's report, the distribution of partners by age group is different between the Avatar data and the FSP Survey data (reported in our previous report \"Full Service Partnership (FSP) Outcomes: Findings from 2015\"). This is likely due to the different ways age group was determined. For the s urvey data, AIR determined age group by whether the partner was evaluated using the child, TAY, adult, or older adult FSP survey forms. For the Avatar data, AIR assigned individuals to an age group based upon the date they joined FSP and their reported dat e of birth.

Laura's Law supplements existing mental health law by allowing a court, in counties that have chosen to implement the law, to order a person into Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) through a civil process. On June 16, 2015, the San Mateo County (SMC) Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to enact Laura's Law. San Mateo County B ehavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) started to implement Laura's Law in July 2016. The BHRS AOT team has been assembled to assess the referred individual for eligibility, provide outreach and engage ment , and coordinate with other agencies (County Counsel, directors of various treatment prog rams including Full Service Partnership (FSP) program s, hospitals, etc.) . Caminar FSP is the AOT FSP service provider . To continue supporting BHRS ' implementation and continu ed quality improvement , American Institutes for Research (AIR ) has been retained t o conduct an independent evaluation of the AOT program in the second year . This calendar year 2018 (CY2018 hereafter) report's purpose is to provide a detailed view on how the implementation is progressing and to determine if any adjustments are necessary to achieve the goals of the project. The report describes who is making referrals, who is being referred, and who is enrolling in AOT FSP services. The report also provides preliminary findings on client outcomes during CY2018 and changes in key events before and after enrollment in AOT FSP services. Most of the findings are based on administrative and electronic health record (EHR) data on clients who were referred, enrolled and actively engaged in CY 2018 ( January 1, 201 8 to Dece mber 31 , 201 8). In CY2018, t he BHRS AOT program received 160 referrals for a total of 148 individual clients and 38 informational calls . Most referrals originated within San Mateo County and have come from a licensed or supervising mental health treatment provider followed by family members . The majority of referred clients were White (55%), Non-Hispanic (78%) and male (6 6%). The referred clients often had histories of arrest, incarceration, hospitalization, homelessness, and violent behavior in the year before the referral. There were 69 referred clients who were deemed ineligible for AOT services . Of these, 23 clients were referred to specific community services, including behavioral health clinics. Of the 39 eligible clients who were offered Caminar AOT FSP services , 22 clients enrolled in AOT FSP services as of December 31 , 201 8. The AOT team is currently in the process of offering AOT FSP services to those who are eligible and finding other resources for those who do not me et the criteria. Among AOT FSP enrollees, we find fewer hospitalization, psychiatric emergency service, homeless, and jail events after enrolling, compared to the period before AOT FSP enrollment. The AOT has filed two court petitions for two clients in CY 2018 . San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 2 Introduction Background In 2002, the California Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 1421, commonly known as Laura's Law. Laura's Law supplements existing mental health law by allowing a court, in counties that have chosen to implement the law, to orde r a person into Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) through a civil process. However, the court has no power to enforce its order if the person refuses to participate in treatment. On June 16, 2015, the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to enact Laura's Law. The approved budget was $ 3,766,973 through June of 201 8. The AOT program implementation began in July 2016. Laura's Law is intended to address the mental he alth care needs of individuals who do not meet the requirements for \"grave disability\" in order to establish a conservatorship or \"danger to self or others\" requirement for involuntary confinement, but whose mental status appears to be deteriorating. Laura 's Law allows family members, friends, mental health professionals and peace officers to refer individuals with mental illness to be evaluated to receive court ordered treatment which often includes FSP treatment. The court may order individuals who meet t he criteria for Laura's Law into 180 d ays of Full Service Partnership (FSP) treatment. The court, however, cannot force any individual to take medications or to participate in the FSP program ; ultimately , an individual can choose not to engage in treatment without any legal consequences. The premise of Laura's Law is that the non-binding judicial order will induce at least some individuals to participate in treatment. For the court to order a person to participate in Assisted Outpatient Treatment they must meet the eligibility criteria as listed below: 1. 18 years or older 2. Suffering from a serious mental illness, defined as a mental disorder severe in degree and persistent in duration. May include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder , as well as major affective disorders 3. Unable to \"survive safely\" in the community without \"supervision;\" 4. History of \"lack of compliance with treatment\" as evidenced by at least one of the following: a. hospitalized/incarcerated two or more times in the last 36 months due to a mental illness; or b. violent behavior towards self or others in the last 48 months 5. Previously offered treatment on a voluntary basis and refused it; 6. Is \"deteriorating\" When a licensed mental health treatment provider determines that a c lient who is court -ordered into AOT has failed or refused to comply with the treatment ordered by the court and that efforts have been made to achieve compliance, the provider may ask that the client be brought to a hospital for evaluation as to whether th e client requires involuntary treatment. San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 3 AOT goals and objectives are to: Engage individuals in ongoing treatment and support Reduce homelessness, hospitalizations, victimization , arrests, and incarceration Help families and reduce caregiver stress Save costs related to arrests, incarcerations, and hospitalizations Laura's Law Implementation in San Mateo County San Mateo County BHRS began implementation of Laura's Law in July 2016. This included the start of Caminar's AOT FSP services and their hiring an d training staff. The BHRS AOT team ha s been assembled to assess the referred individual for eligibility, provide outreach and engage ment , and coordinate with other agencies (County Counsel, directors of various treatment programs including FSP program s, hospitals, etc.) . Caminar FSP is the service provider. This team is comprise d of one Clinical Services Ma nager, one half-time Psychologist, one Psychiatric Social Worker, one half-time Deputy Public Guardian , one full -time Mental Health Counselor and one half-time Peer Support Worker . The AOT team works to identify people who qualify for AOT services, encourage them to accept services and then link them to those services. The AOT team is based centrally in San Mateo County and travels to all parts of the county to engage prospective candidates. The Referral and Screening Proces s Anyone can contact the BHRS AOT team with a referral of someone about whom they are both concerned and believe meets the criteria for AOT services. The referrals are received either through a dedicated AOT phone number or email address. The referral system is checked a minimum of twice a day, Monday through Friday except for county holidays . The AOT team contact s the referring party to gather more information regarding the person who is being referred. Often additional information is needed from other sources to determine eligibility . If the person appears to meet the criteria or eligibility is unclear , the AOT staff will arrange to meet with the individual. This meeting will provide additional information to determine eligibility and an opportunity to establish rapport. The AOT staff continue to engage and encourage eligible individuals to accept services voluntarily. Upon consent to enroll in the program , the AOT staff contact the C aminar AOT FSP and prepare for a \"warm handoff .\" If the person who is deemed eligible refuses to enroll in the AOT , the staff psychologist may assess this person and request that County Counsel file a petition with the San Mateo County Superior Court (see below , Court Process ). If the referred individual is not elig ible, other resources are considered that may benefit the person. The referring party is contacted and provided an explanation of the decision and available options for the person they ref erred. The AOT staff member will help facilitate referrals to other service providers. This facilitation process is an extremely important part of the services provided since many of the referrals do not meet the full criteria for AOT FSP services. San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 4 BHRS AO T staff will continue to engage and work with individuals who are not eligible until they are effectively connected with appropriate services. This frequently involves regular in- person contact with the individual, their family, past treatment team and oth er people who are part of their network of support. The relevant parties are engaged wherever the person is located (e.g., home, shelters, hospital, jail). The engagement may last from a few days to a couple of months in order to get the person connected and provided with a warm hand off. Case studies in the Appendix show example s of the AOT team's involvement in the referral and engagement process. Court Process San Mateo County Counsel has ten days to file a petition with the San Mateo County Superior Court once the AOT psychologist has completed the ir assessment and submitted the petitio n request to County Counsel. After being reviewed by County Counsel , it goes to the Behavioral Health and Recovery Services Director for review and signature , should he be in agreement with the petition. If the petition is then filed, the Court has five co urt days to schedule and hold the hearing. AOT court hearings are a civil process. The San Mateo County Private Defender's Office is also notified at the time of the petition so that they can contact and prepare to represent the referred party in court. Th e assigned private defender will be provided with background and contact information on their new client and will attempt to become part of the client's support and advocacy system. The AOT court judge will review the petition during the court hearing and with the referred party present. In some cases, the referred party may refuse to be present in court. In such cases, the judge will have the option of reviewing the petition without the person present but with the private defender who is representing the p erson. The AOT judge will either grant the petition and \"Both the problems and the symptoms experienced by people who are referred to AOT are very complex, often with dangers to their health and well -being, as well as the well -being of the community. It is not unusual that clients have been struggling for many years, essentially lost in a cycle of decompensations, hospitalizations, incarcerations, such that they have a limited cap acity to understand and follow -up with their own care. A critical role of AOT investigations is to simplify the complexity of a case for the care teams and the client . The client can experience some treatment success which encourages the client to engage f urther . Noticeably, an important part of this seems to be the enduring nature of AOT in continuing to support clients through their various struggles and successes. The program has been remarkable at filling a gap in services for people who were previously unreachable .\" (BHRS AOT Psychologist) San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 5 order the person into AOT FSP treatment or will find that the person does not meet the criteria and not order him/her into treatment. The AOT Court judge will expect a status update on each individual court ordered into treatment every 60 days. This update will be prepared by the AOT FSP provider . The court ordered individual does not need to be present in court. If the court and the treatment team see benefit to having the court ordered individual appear in court more frequently than 60 days to support his or her recovery, this can be arranged on a case by case basis. AOT FSP Program Caminar is the AOT FSP provider for San Mateo County. They are contracted to provide FSP services for up to 50 AOT clients. The AOT FSP is a full continuum of services that includes the following: 24/7 wrap around services Small caseloads (10 -1 ratio) Medication management Recovery focused, strength based services Intensive case management Treatment plan developed in collaboration with client Co-occurring disorder treatment Field based services Educational and vocational assistance Housing services Assistance with benefits and finances Life skills training and communi ty integration Caminar's AOT FSP staffing is comprised of: one Program Director, five Case Managers, two Assistant Case Managers, one Community Support Worker, one Family Partner, one Peer Support Worker, one Housing Specialist, one Registered Nurse, and one Psychiatrist. To support SMC BHRS in delivering AOT services that improve client outcomes, American Institutes for Research (AIR) is conducting an independent evaluation of the AOT progra m. Evaluation objectives are to : Summarize changes in key event s (e.g. homelessness, arrests, incarceration) before and after enrolling in AOT FSP services Describe the demographics of persons making referrals and referred individuals Describe the AOT case management process \"The AOT court order process has proved successful in engaging people in treatment services who were previously unreachable or too unwell to be able to plan safely and successfully to manage their illnesses independently. To an extent, we know it is somewhat human (and culturally appropriate) to deny and decline support and care from the community. There seems to be a powerful transition of ability to receive care that takes place in the courtroom where someone hears 'you need care to survive' and 'we promise to give it to you' .\" (BHRS AOT Psychologist) San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 6 This annual report includes tw o perspectives of the San Mateo's AOT program: (1) outcomes and (2) operations . The outcome section provides findings about changes in key events during the periods before and after the client enrolled in the AOT FSP program. Findings are based on adminis trative, survey and electronic health record (EHR) data. A total of 22 clients were newly enrolled in the AOT -FSP in the CY2018. However, this small sample size is inadequate to detect any statistical significance, therefore we present hospitalization and Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES ) outcomes findings on all AOT FSP clients who were enrolled in AOT FSP services since inception (August 2016) to June 30, 2018 (n=6 4). Also, because both the hospitalization and PES are outcomes that we expect to change when the client is enrolled in the AOT FSP program (i.e. immediate outcomes), we c hoose to focus on a shorter period of time to examine the changes that could be more likely attributed to the AOT FSP program (i.e. the 6 -month before and after AOT FSP enrol lment ). For jail and homeless outcomes, we include clients who were actively enrolled in the AOT FSP program in CY2018 . We focus on a longer period of time (one -year before and after) as they are more intermediate as we expect the effect of AOT FSP program could take place after the client is close to completing or has completed the AOT FSP program. The operation section focuses on describing who is making referrals, who is being referred, and who is enrolling in AOT FSP services. Findings on the 160 refer rals are based on administrative data collected by the AOT team from Jan 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018. \"Simply put , our job is to listen with compassion, see beyond the illness, and touch the humanity that lives within each client. With AOT's support, it is the clients themselves who lead the way to hope and wellness. \" (BHRS AOT Staff) San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 7 Methods Data S ources This evaluation utilize s data from multiple data sources on clients who were referred, enrolled and actively engaged in the AOT FSP program for any duration during the period of January 1, 2018 through December 31 , 201 8. These data include (1) BHRS AOT program administrative database (as of March 12, 201 9), (2) Caminar 's AOT -FSP surveys (as of September 21 , 2018)1, and (3 ) Avat ar Electronic Health Records (EHR) system (extracted on March 21 , 201 9). In addition, we also use client outcome data collected by the AOT team including jail, employment, homeless, violent behavior, victimization and substance abuse and treatment complian ce. Outcomes . To study hospitalization and psychiatric emergency services among AOT FSP enrollees, we also gathered hospitalization data through the County's EHR system, Avatar.2 The comprehensive data system includes all episodes of hospitalizations and PES events associated with the AOT clients. One important note is that the Avatar data may not include services received by clients outside the San Mateo County health system. To evaluate homelessness and jail incidences before and after enrollment in AOT FSP services , we used client data collected by Caminar 's surveys and BHRS AOT team. The Caminar surveys are administrated at enrollment, every three months following enrollment , and when a defined key event (e.g. homelessness ) occurs . Clients' jail history and other client outcomes during CY2018 including violent behavior, victimization , substance abuse and treatment compliance were collected by the BHRS AOT team. Operations . To capture information about referrals and individual client characteristics we have gathered demographic information, clients' histories of arrests, incarceration s, hospitalizations (for mental health issues and for physical health issues), aggressive/violen t behavior, and homelessness from AOT team's administrative database, which includes information collected during the referral and case management phases. Analysis Descriptive stat istics (e.g., means) were calculated to describe the demographics of person s making referrals and referred clients. To describe the changes in key events of AOT FSP enrolled clients , we calculated homelessness and jail events before and after AOT FSP enrollment . For these key event outcomes, t he pre -AOT period is 12 months before the client's enrollment date, and the post -AOT period is from the enrollment date to December 31, 201 8. 1 We were not able to obtain the full CY2018 Caminar AOT FSP data at the time of conducting this analysis for the CY2018 report because Caminar changed to a new Electronic Health Record system (EHR) in Dec 1, 2018. Work to convert the new data and merge wit h the previous FSP data is still in progress as of June 1, 2019. Because this switch may affect data input and quality around the switch date, we decided to use previously extracted Caminar AOT -FSP survey data (up to September 21, 2018 ). 2 The Caminar FSP surveys do not include information on client hospitalization or psychiatric emergency service use. San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 8 Outcomes : AOT Key Events among Clients Enrolled in AOT FSP Services Psychiatric Hospitalization & Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) (N=64) Exhibit 1a shows psychiatric hospitalization and PES use in the 6-month s before and after the client enrolled in the AOT FSP service s. There were 18 clients who had at least one hospitalization (i.e. hospital stay) in the 6-month s before enrollment with a total of 27 episodes for the group . During the 6 -month s after the AOT FSP enrollment, there were 8 clients who were hospit alized with a total of 8 episode s. The reduction in hospitalizations is significant at p<0.01. These outcomes are based on 64 AOT FSP clients eligible for this analysis. We excluded the clients who enrolled after June 30, 201 8 to ensure a full six months of outcome monitoring following enrollment in the AOT -FSP program. Exhibit 1a. Hospitalization and PES use before and after A OT FSP enrollment, n= 64 Average hospitalization days was 5.4 days and the total number of hospitalization days was 345 before enrollment , compared to 2.8 days and 179 days in the 6 -month period after the client enrolled in AOT FSP . 0.0528 ). Further, PES use decreased from a total of 37 episodes in the previous 6-month s to 19 episodes during the 6 - month s after. The difference is significant at p<0.01 (p = 0.0075 ). Exhibit 1b.

We report the following outcomes: homeless, jail, violent behavior, victimization and substance abuse and treatment compliance. One important note here is that this section focuses on the client outcomes occurr ing in CY2018. Most of the 61 clients in our sample are the same client s in the sample for health care use analysis in the previous section (N=64) ; however , there are still some differences. First, some clients discharged from the AOT FSP program before 2018 are not included in the housing, jail and other client outcomes analy ses because data on their CY2018 outcomes are not available. Second, clients who started after July 1, 2018 are not present in the previous section because of the 6 -month pre -post design for the hospitalization and PES analysis . Housing and Jail Exhibit 2 reports jail and housing outcomes from AOT administrative records and Caminar survey data, respectively . Fewer jail encounters and periods of homelessness occurred after clients enrolled in AOT FSP services. While 30 clients (49%) had been put in jail before AOT FSP enrollment, only 15 clients (25%) were reported being jailed after enrollment. 26 clients (43%) reported homelessness after starting the AOT FSP program, compared to 33 (54%) in the year before. Again, as indicated in the Data Sources sectio n, we capture partial year homeless outcomes because we were only able to obtain Caminar survey data up to Sep 21, 2018. Exhibit 2. Housing, and jail outcomes before and after clients who were in jail12 months prior to AOT enrollment 12 months after AOT enrollmentSan Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 10 It is worth noting that some clients who were newly enrolled into the AOT FSP program may continue to experience homeless ness for some time following enrollment due to their inability to access certain services or their need for other services ( e.g., alcohol and drug rehabilitation ) prior to housing. The following are common reasons for prolonged periods of homelessness despite enrollment in the AOT FSP program: 1. Shelters, social rehabs, accessory dwelling unit s (ADU ), and all other placements have waitlists. 2. Those who are Registered Sex Offenders (RSOs, or \" 290s \") are not welcome at most mental health housing/treatment options and require extra services to place. 3. Some clients choose to go to alcohol and drug rehabilitation during the first part of their AOT treatment, which makes them technically homeless. 4. Some clients are tempora rily liv ing in motels with the AOT FSP Case Manager's support to ensure stability while waiting for stable placement. 5. A small number of clients choose to pursue a lifestyle without housing. 6. Notably it is very difficult to place someone in a shelter or tre atment center directly out of jail (jail referrals have increased over CY2018). 7. The path to perm anent mental health housing takes time , typically from six months to a year. Other Client Outcomes in 2018 Exhibit s 3 through 5 show client outcomes in employment, treatment compliance, victimization , violent behavior, and substance abuse for all the 61 clients who were enrolled during 2018 . We did not collect data in the year prior to the client enrollment during CY2018 ; therefore, we are not presenting the data in a comparative manner. We will collect and include the pre -enrollment outcomes in the future report. Exhibit 3 reports whether the client participated in any employment services in 2018. While most of the clie nts were unemployed, 16% of clients reported that they participated in some type of employment services. Exhibit 3.

Among all AOT FSP clients, the episodes of hospitalizations and PES event s were significantly lower during the 6 -month s after the client enrolled in the AOT FSP, compared to the 6 -month s before. The length of hospital stay was a lso shortened post enrollment vs. pre enrollment . Other key events such as jail and homeless ness have also reduced. It is exc iting and important to note that the data collection protocol a nd process have mature d and continuously integrated into the AOT team operations. AOT staff were more experienced in documenting and collecting needed information and data for evaluation. Additional data sources (such as jail information) were obtained from other agencies to complement the original research design. As a result, data quality improved significantly. For example, compared to the data in the CY2017 evaluation report, t he \"unkn own\" cases have been greatly reduced. Better data quality provides more useful information to the AOT implementation and operations. Several insights can be learned to address potential barriers and challenges to referral, engagement, and successful enrollment . The race/ethnicity composition of the referred group continues to reflect the diverse population of San Mateo county. The non - white group accounts for 42.5% of the referred clients (68 out of 160 referrals). We noted in the previous report that cultural bac kground plays an important role in treatment preference . This may suggest a continuing need for alternative, culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations, especially for San Mateo County , whose reside nts have a diverse mix of racial/ethnic background s. Community mental health practitioners and f amily members remain the main source of referrals. Continue d effort s to outreach to these main referral groups provide s an effective means to helping the AOT program identify and engage potential clients and promote treatment acceptance . About two thirds of the referred clients were not residing at home at the time of the referral. Most of them were homeless, in the hospital, or jail. Continuing o utrea ch and collaboration s with these entities is an effective means to reach and engage these clients who are typically difficult to reach. \"Our clients are some of the most resilient people I have ever encountered. Some feel mistreated, abandoned, and ha d good reason not to put their faith in a complete stranger to better their lives. I am honored to offer our clients an opportunity for individualized treatment, witness them reach their potential, and foster healthy relationships. It is truly a privilege to s erve our population and I am proud to see how strong our program has become.\" (BHRS AOT Mental Health Staff ) San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 24 The AOT team takes an important role in engaging and connecting eligible clients to the AOT FSP services and other nee ded community -based resources and is the key to the success of the San Mateo AOT program . Since inception, the program has received a significant number of referrals from the community and has connect ed and engaged with both eligible clients and clients wi th less severe mental health issues (i.e. ineligible clients). As the program continues into its third year, it is essent ial to continue to take an evidence -based and data -driven approach to outreach, contact, and engage the referred clients and to optimize the team staffing model to ensure both programmatic and client needs are met. Tailored to the AOT team's need, w e will continue to monitor and evaluate the program as it moves into the third year. The longer history of the AOT program and the imp rovement in data quality will enable us to conduct longitudinal analys es to identify trends in the key events and referral outcomes. These findings will provide more valuable insight and enhance our understanding of the impact of the AOT program in San Mat eo County. San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 25 Appendix . Case Studies Tammy is a client in her mid -fifties who was referred by jail personnel just prior to her release. She has a long history of hospitalizations and incarcerations dating back many decades and has in fact, spent most of the past 30 years institutionalized in hospitals or jails. Many of her difficulties were due to her struggles with schizoaffective disorder. When she met BHRS AOT (hereafter AOT), Tammy said she realized how important it was for her to continue the medi cations she had begun taking in jail but expressed anxiety that she would not be able to make it in the community. Given Tammy's history, AOT determined it would be in her best interest to enroll her into the AOT FSP with an extended warm hand -off period f urther partnering with Caminar AOT FSP to help the client maintain health. Among the challenges for Tammy were her many aliases and unclear birthplace information, making it difficult to obtain government issued identifications which is critical to receiv ing benefits and procuring housing. After leaving jail, Tammy lived at a local homeless shelter while AOT worked with her. AOT staff did extensive research and was able to get a copy of her birth certificate. With this information, her Caminar AOT FSP case manager was able to get her correct identification and then social security benefits along with a more stable housing option. AOT staff gradually became less involved in client's case, allowing her to fully bond with her Caminar AOT FSP case manager. Tammy prospered in the Caminar AOT FSP program, complying with her medication regimen and fully embracing life in the community , including finding a church and working to get along with roommates in her supported housing. After 12 months in the AOT FSP, Tammy had improved so much that she graduated AOT FSP and was able to step down to a lower level of care to another Caminar program. CASE STUDY I San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 26 AOT received a referral for Ben, a young man with schizophrenia, who was living a very isolated life. Ben had no relationship with his family and no friends. He tended to call and harass local police departments and authority figures due to command hallucinations. Ben was incarcerated and hospitalized due to the nature of these calls. These calls were putting both the client and the community at risk. Over two months, AOT built a relationship with client through weekly visits and being curious about his experience. Once trust had been established, Ben agreed to enroll in AOT/FSP. Since enrolling, his initial c harges have been reduced and he has not returned to jail or the hospital. In addition, he has reconnected with his family and demonstrated an ability to contain his impulses through skills learned working with AOT/FSP. Lastly, Ben is no longer living an i solated life, as he is participating in group therapy, building a social network and traveling with his family. CASE STUDY II San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 27 BHRS AOT (hereafter AOT) received a call from a panicked family member whose middle - aged son Ron had been living with her for the past three years. Prior to that, Ron had been living in SoCal for over a decade and returned after a divorce. He had not left the house, showered, or cut his nails or hair, and was living in his own filth since moving home three years ago. Ron had never received any mental health treatment (though he had been offered) nor was he aware of any of his mental health needs. The family had tried to intervene numerous times with police and other community agencies but gave up due to no results. AOT went t o the family home with members of the local police department to assess for safety and possible hospitalization. AOT initiated a 5150 emergency psychiatric hold for grave disability, which was invoked by the police. AOT gave the family education on the 5150 process and supported the family as this took place. When he was hospitalized, Ron didn't know who any of his family members were and was living in a delusional world. Ron received proper care and was connected to a regional clinic for services. Since t hat time, client recognizes his family, lives a fulfilling life at home with them and is engaged in caring for his mental health. CASE STUDY III San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 28 Andy is a middle -aged client who was referred to AOT by his San Mateo County probation officer in early 2018. He was released from Napa State Hospital in the previous month and had been sleeping in a parking garage every night. He was afraid to stay in a shelter and was not eligible for several homeless shelters due to his previous criminal background . Andy's social security benefits had been suspended due to missing required paperwork. He was meeting with his probation officer monthly in her office and stated to her that he needed help. Andy had suffered from a severe mental illness his entire adult life and had attempted suicide five times. He had been removed from his mother's care when he was very young due to neglect. Andy was interested in accepting intensive case management services from an FSP program. AOT prepared a referral for the FSP servic es and advocated for his admission to an FSP program . The FSP provider was able to admit him into its program immediately, and within days he was placed into a safe board and care home in San Mateo County. His new FSP case manager was able to assist him wi th filing paperwork with Social Security to reinstate his monthly income. CASE STUDY IV San Mateo County's Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) Program (Laura's Law) - 2018 Annual Report | 29 Gary was diagnosed with a severe mental illness as a young adult nearly one decade ago. He was referred to AOT from one of our regional mental health clinics. Gary was struggling with ongoing symptoms of Schizophrenia (especially paranoia and auditory hallucinations), homelessness and multiple incarcerations for violent and non -violent offenses. Over the past four years, he utilized psychiatric emergency service s multiple times, was hospitalized for his illness, and was unable to maintain housing or a medication regimen. After multiple attempts to engage Gary voluntarily in AOT while he was at the local jail, he continued to decline any services or medications d ue to low insight into his problems. As he was believed to be at high risk for needing future crisis interventions due to his intensive struggles, he was referred for an assessment with the AOT psychologist. After meeting with Gary, the psychologist agree d that a court petition for AOT services was the next step. When Gary and his private defender attended AOT court, Gary agreed to accept services voluntarily during the petition process. Gary has made a lot of progress in his first six months of AOT, including connecting to a psychiatrist, working with a case manager, and starting his medication. His participation in AOT has resulted in reduced symptoms, reconnection to his family, increased functionality, and moving into stable independent housing. CASE STUDY V 199 APPENDIX 7. BARBARA A.

MBSAT PILOT STU DY RESULTS MINDFULNESS BASED SUBSTANCE ABUS E TREATMENT FOCUS GROUP RESULTS The Mindfulness Based Substance Abuse Treatment (MBSAT) cu rriculum was piloted with three of our partners (Puente, Starvista and El Centro). This pilot was conducted in order to inform the Traum a Informed Interventions for youth RFP that will be replacing the Seeking Safety curriculum. As part of the pilot we also co nducted focus groups to hear feedback from the youth regarding the cu rriculum but to also expand our preven tion strategy to encompass what they identified as oppo rtunities and barriers. METHODS All providers that are piloting the MBSAT curriculum were invited to participate in the focus groups. A BHRS staff member conducted the groups at the participating sites to hear about their experience with the curriculum directly from the youth. QUESTIONS 1.What was your experience with the mindfulness practices? Were they helpful? Please explain 2. What stands out to you most in your experience with this program? 3. Is there anything that makes it difficult to practice mindful ness at school, work and at home? 4. What needs to change for you to be able to use the skills you have gained in this group? 5. How can we reinforce the success of this program within your community? PARTICIPANTS 2 Sites participated Pescadero High School a gro up facilitated by Puente Life Moves facilitated by Starvista 16 youth participated in the groups 100% of youth were youth of colo r from marginalized backgrounds, and diverse cultural and linguistic needs FINDINGS Overall, the youth enjoyed the MBSAT curr iculum and confirmed that they learne d new skills that they will try to continue to use in their daily life. Wh ile the curriculum is a prevention curric ulum for substance use, some youth have used these skills to avoid getting into fights, to calm themselves down when they are stressed about the future and to think before they act when they interact with their siblings, friends, and parents. BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY FOR MINDFULNESS Mindfulness training for teachers so that th ey understand and support mindfulness practices Taking structured time from the school day to meditate Training for parents so that they can use the skills but also so that they encourag e the practice at home Start embedding mindfulness pr actices from a young age such as elementary school FACILITATION The facilitator needs to be knowledge able about meditation and preferably practices the techniques in their own life The facilitation style affects engage ment and the youth prefer someone t hat is high energy and relatable Confidentiality is essentia l for creating a space where youth feel safe and are able to share openly Having food and incentives motivates the youth to continue participating Fidget toys during the class help the youth concentrate on the content ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES The youth identified that their e nvironment impacts their ability to practice mindfulne ss effectively The youth brought up stressors such as: graduating from high school and going to college or finding a job, not knowing what their next step will be after high school , the national political enviro nment, policies at their schools, violence in their neighborhoods, the availability of drugs and alcohol 201 APPENDIX 9.

The Community Services and Supports (CSS) component of MHSA was created to provide direct services to individuals with severe mental illness and included Outreach and Engagement activities. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (SMC BHRS) funds the North County Outreach Collabo rative (NCOC) and the East Palo Alto Partnership for Mental Health Outreach (EPAPMHO) to provide outreach and engagement activities throughout San Mateo County. This report summarizes overall collaborative and provider -specific outreach efforts across individual and group outreach events that occurred in fiscal year (FY) 2017 -2018 (July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018). We also present some historical data since FY 2014 -2015 to show how outreach has changed over time. Total Attendance For FY 2017 -2018, SMC B HRS providers reported a total of 4,767 attendees at all outreach events. Of these, 696 attendees were reached through individual outreach events and 4,071 attendees were reached across 57 group outreach events . Demographics of outreach attendees NCOC NCO C's most common age group among outreach attendees was adults (37%). Over half of individual and group outreach attendees were female ( 59%). The greatest proportion of attendees were White (26%), followed by Filipino (13%). Insurance status was largely unreported. Some a ttendees also reported being part of one or more special populations (i.e., homeless, at risk for homelessness, vision impaired, hearing impaired, veterans). Of those reporti ng special population status, 5 3% percent were homeless or were at -risk for homelessness. EPAPMHO EPAPMHO outreach attendees were largely adu lts (56%). Over half of i ndividual and group outreach attendees were female (54 %). Most attendees reported Medi -Cal insurance (56%) , but many reported not having insurance (26 %). The largest proportion of attendees were Black (36%) . Of those reporting special population status , 66% were homeless or were at -risk for homelessness. 2 Outreach event characteristics NCOC The average length of NCOC individual outreach events was 44.3 minutes in FY 2017 -2018. Of all the 230 individual outreach events, most occurred in other community locations (44%). Among the 101 individual outreach events which occurred in other community locations, most cited were \"San Mateo County Fairgrounds\" and \" Frontierland Park\". Other locations cited include Pacifica Drop in Differential Response and San Mateo Drop in Differential Response. Of the individual outreach events, 17% used Medicaid Administrative Activities (MAA) code 401 (Discounted Medi -Cal o utreac h). Most were in English ( 92%). Some included mental health referrals ( 31%) and substance abuse referrals ( 4%). Providers also made 343 referrals to other services, including emergency/protective service, financial/employment, food, form assistance, housin g/shelter, legal services, medical care and transportation. NCOC group outreach events lasted 11 5.77 minutes on average. Of all the 57 group outreach events, most were conducted in English ( 75%) and among the 7 group outreach events held in other community locations (18%), most were cited as being held in \"San Mateo County Fairgrounds\" and \"Mall\". Other locations cited include Edgewood Drop -In Center, Frontierland Park Pacifica and Pacifica Fog Fest. These events most frequently used MAA code 401 (Discounte d Medi -Cal outreach, 9%). EPAPMHO The 466 EPAPMHO individual outreach events were an average of 37.5 minutes each. These events were typically administered in English (69%), occurred in unspecified locations (37%) and used MAA code 400 (Medi -Cal outreach, 24%). EPAPMHO individual outreach events also included mental health referrals ( 31%) and substance abuse referrals ( 37%). A total of 669 referrals were made to other services, including emergency/protective service, financial/employment, food, form assistance, housing/shelter, legal services, medical care , transportation and health insurance. Of the two EPAPMHO group outreach events, the average event lasted 45 minutes. Both group outreach events were conducted in Eng lish (100%) and in Faith -based Church/Temple (100%). One event used MAA code 400 (Medi -Cal outreach, 50%). Recommendations We have several recommendations based on FY 201 7-2018 data. These recommendations fall under t hree umbrellas: those aimed at enhancing outreach , those to improve data collection , and discussion points for changing the reporting structure for next year . To enhance outreach, we suggest that SMC BHRS work with providers to: 3 Continue efforts to tailor or increase outreach efforts for specific demographic groups, such as older adults and Latino/Hispanic persons from Central America. Consider how to best address the needs of individuals who report being uninsured or do not report their insurance status. Focus on increasing housing -related resources and referrals . Focus on increasing housing -related resources and referrals . Housing insecurity continues to be a major challenge for individuals served by SMC BHRS. To improve data collection, we recommend SMC BHRS work with providers to: Ensure that all data have been obtained from outreach providers . Make other/unspecified data categories clearer. To improve the report structure for outreach, we recommend an open discu ssion with SMC BHRS. Specifically, we have the following ideas for improving the report. The report could rely less on erratic quarterly data. Certain data categories might be combined for reporting purposes, which would improve table readability and inter pretability. However, it is important to ensure that SMC BHRS reporting needs are met. We would like to discuss revising how the special populations data are reported. Although it would mean that these data would not be comparable to previous years, we believe we can make these numbers more meaningful by describing them as a function of all individuals who attend an outreach event. 4 Introduction In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), to provide funding t o Counties for mental health services by imposing a 1% tax on personal income in excess of $1 million. Activities funded by MHSA are grouped into components, and the Community Services and Supports (CSS) component was created to provide direct services to individuals with severe mental illness. CSS is allotted 80% of MHSA funding for services focused on recovery and resilience while providing clients and families an integrated service experience. CSS has three service categories: 1) Full Service Partnership s; 2) General System Development Funds; and 3) Outreach and Engagement. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (SMC BHRS) MHSA Outreach and Engagement strategy increases access and improves linkages to behavioral health services for unde rserved communities. Strategies include community outreach collaboratives, pre -crisis response, and primary care -based efforts. SMC BHRS has seen a consistent increase in representation of underserved communities in its system since the strategies were dep loyed. In particular, community outreach collaboratives funded by MHSA include the East Palo Alto Partnership for Mental Health Outreach ( EPAPMHO ), which t argets at -risk youth, transition -age youth and underserved adults [Latino, African American, Pacific Islander , and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ)] in East Palo Alto, and the North County Outreach Collaborative (NCOC) , which ta rgets rural and/or ethnic communities (Chinese, Filipino, Latino, Pacific Islander , and LGBTQ) in the North County region including Pacifica . These collaboratives provide advocacy, systems change, resident engagement, expansion of local resources, educatio n and outreach to decrease stigma related to mental illness and substance abuse . They work to increase awareness of and access and linkages to culturally and linguistically competent behavioral health, Medi -Cal and other public health services, and social services . They participate in a referral process to ensure those in need receive appropriate services . Finally, they promote and facilitate resident input into the development of MHSA funded services and other BHRS program initiatives. Providers report ed fiscal year ( FY) 2017 -2018 (July 1, 2017 through J une 30, 2018 ) outreach data using an electronic form first implemented in quarter four ( Q4) of FY 2014 -2015. AIR created this form based on interviews with San Mateo County staff and focus groups with provid ers. This collective effort sought to improv e the data collection process so that SMC BHRS and its providers could better understand the reach of their outreach efforts. After data are entered, AIR cleans the data and calculates aggregated counts and perce ntages to describe outreach activities. P lease see Appendix I for information about calculations. This report focuses on EPAPMHO and NCOC 's outreach event s that occurred during FY 2017 - 2018 and outreach event attendees. We also present some historical data from FY 2014 -2015, FY 2015 -2016 and FY 2016 -2017 to show how outreach has changed over time. Counts of attendees do not necessarily represent unique individuals because a person may have been part of more than one outre ach event, taken part in both individual and group outreach events, 5 and/or interacted with different providers. Provider summaries are also available to help SMC BHRS and its providers better understand each individual provider's outreach efforts. Please refer to Appendix A to H . As a note, the provider information for Daly City Peninsula Partnership Collaborative, Daly City Youth Health Center, Pacifica Collaborative, and StarVista in the appendix is not a reflection of the most current data that was recei ved in May to June of 2019. Due to the timing of the data received, only the data in the main section of the report has been updated with the new data from these four organizations. Overall Outreach During FY 2017 -2018 , SMC BHRS outreach providers report ed a total of 4,767 attendees at outreach events \u2014696 attendees reached through indi vidual outreach events and 4,071 attendees reached across 5 7 group outreach events. Each individual outreach event occurs with a single attendee. Group outreach events inclu de multiple attendees. An attendee is not necessarily a unique individual because a person may have been a part of multiple individual or group outreach events. Table 1 shows outreach attendees, by collaborative, provider, and event type (i.e., individual or group) for FY 2017 -2018 . Table 1.

The north region also spans a much wider geographical area, making group events (vs. individual outreach) such as community wide fairs much more feasible and relevant. In contr ast, East Palo Alto spans 2.5 square miles making an individual approach to outreach more effective. The total number of NCOC outreach attendees increased in FY2014 -2017 and in FY 2017 -2018. The EPAPMHO outreach in FY 2014 -2018 (Figure 1 ). EPAPMHO outreach numbers have been decreasing over the past three years and currently reaching about 0.36 % of the population. According to EPAPMHO provider organizations there have been both staffing and community -level chal lenges that have led to decreased numbers; these are discussed further under the Recommendations section of this document. Figure 1. Total Outreach Attendees by Collaborative, FY 2014 -2018 Note: The attendee numbers from previous FYs are slightly higher than those reported in the previous reports because some outreach data was reported after that FY. Table 2 presents outreach event attendees' race/ethnicity each collabora tive. Increases of five percent or more between the two years are shaded in green; decreases of five percent or more are on race/ethnicity by quarter for FY 2017 -2018 are presented later in the report (pages 12 and 1 9). Table 2. Race /Ethnicity by not sum to 100% because of rounding . **Total count for race/ethnicity reported may exceed the total number of attendees, because some providers may have reported individuals who are multi -racial as both multi -racial and their respective race/ethnicities, leading to extra counts in some cases. T he denominator for race/ethnicity percent is the sum of all race/ethnicity data reported. N/A indicates the category was not available or discontinued during the specific fiscal year. While the NCOC has seen decreases in outreach numbers overall, there ar e a few key differences in the racial/ethnic demographics of the outreach attendees. In particular, there was a decrease in White participants by 7% and Mexican participants by 8% from FY 2016 -2017 to FY 2017 -2018. 8 The EPAPMHO has also seen decreases in ou treach numbers overall, there are a few key differences in the racial/ethnic demographics of the outreach attendees. In particular, there was a decrease in unknown race participants by 14% fro m FY 2016 -2017 to FY 2017 were increases in Black pa rticipants by 14% and multi -racial participants -2018 . These shifts in the racial/ethnic makeup of outreach participants are discussed further under the Recommendations section of this document. Table 3 presents the numbers and percentages of the mental health and substance abuse referrals made to the overall outreach events by collaborative for FY 2014 2014 -2015 to FY 2017 -2018 Figure 2 and Figure 3 present referrals to social services in FY 2014 -2015, . The percentages repres ent percent of total attendee referrals to social service s. In FY 2017 -2018, NCOC had 343 referrals to social services, as compared to 496 referrals in FY 2016 -2017 and 485 referrals in FY 2015 -2016 and 379 in FY 2017 -2018, EPAPMHO had 669 to services, as compared to 652 in FY 2016 -2017 referrals and 1, 433 referrals in FY 2015 -2016 and 4 38 referrals in FY 2014 - 2015. In FY 2017 -2018, N COC had decreases in the percent of financial, legal, medical care, transportation, and other referrals compared to the prior two FY s.

The denomina tor for preferred language percent is the sum of all preferred language data reported. Recommendations We have several recommendations based on FY 201 7-2018 data. These recommendations fall under t hree umbrellas: those aimed at enhancing outreach , those to improve data collection , and discussion points for changing the reporting structure for next year . Enhance outreach Continue to tailor or increase outreach effor ts for specific demographic groups, such as older adults and Latino/Hispanic persons from Central America. EPAPMHO and NCOC have made improvements to meeting the needs of the senior s (age d 65 and older), but additional targeting may still be necessary. According to a survey of San Mateo residents i n 2015, 19% of the county's senior population reported needing help for emotional/mental health probl ems or use of alcohol/drugs.1 This year, 13% of the attendees were older adults, which is similar to last year, but a major improvement over FY 2015 -2016 (during which 7% of the attendees were seniors) . In addition, similar to last year, among persons who identif ied as Latino/Hispanic, individuals from Central American de scent were underrepresented at outreach even ts. Among persons who identif ied as Latino/Hispanic and report ed needing help for emotional/mental health problems or use of alcohol/drugs in San Mateo County in 2015, 57% were Central American and 14% were Mexican.2 However, 93% of Latino/Hispanic outreac h attendees were identified as Mexican and only 3% were identified as Central American among the two collaboratives. Note that the ethnicity of Central American was first added in FY 2016 -2017, thus no data on Central American was available for FY 2014 -2015 and FY 2015 -2016. Consider how to meet the changing needs of uninsured individuals. A large proportion of attendees d id not report being insured by a specific health plan. In FY 2016 -2017, 56% reported being uninsured or had unknown insurance status acro ss two collaboratives, which is similar to last year FY an 2015 -2016 (54%) and a decrease from FY 2014 -2015 (64%). Disentangling uninsured status from unknown insurance status is a data quality issue to be discussed below, but regardless, this group deserv es special attention. The county should consider how to best 1 UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. AskCHIS 2015. Available at http://ask.chis.ucla.edu. 2 UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. Ask CHIS 2015.

Language English Other 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%)27 meet the needs of uninsured individuals, who may become more reticent to respond to outreach events particularly if they are concerned about treatment costs. The size of this group may also grow if the insurance marketplaces destabilize. Focus on increasing housing -related resources and referrals . Last year, AIR recommended considering whether adequate housing -related resources were being given; since then the number of statements of homelessness or risk of homelessness has decreased . Note that attendees may not be unique individuals, a report structure issue which is discussed below . In FY 2017 -2018, we observed an in crease in the total number of housing -related referrals made. Improve data collection Ensure that all data have been obtained from outreach providers. It appears that data are missing at the time of this report. As of the January 2019 , here is a record of 2,643 individuals receiving outreach contact in FY2017 -2018, as compared with 6,989 from FY2016 -2017. The additional data was not collected from NCOC providers until June 2019. Make other/unspecified categories clearer . Last year, AIR recommended minimiz ing missing data, and there are fewer missing data this year. However, there are still relatively high proportions of individuals in other/unspecified categories for some topics. For example, 8 8% of the NCOC outreach attendees were identified as having unk nown insurance status. EPAPMHO has substantially reduced the missingness in their demographic data, from 15% of their outreach attendees identify ing as other/unknown races last year to 0.4% this year . Potential updates to reporting structure The report co uld rely less on erratic quarterly data. It is important not to over interpret within - year trends. There is substantial variation in quarterly outreach characteristics, particularly due to small sample size . SMC BHRS should consider whether quarterly data are useful or informative. Consider combining data categories for reporting. Currently, there are many very small groups gathered and reported separately. Some of the less common categories may be combined for reporting purposes only (e.g., creating a South East Asian category, or a disability category). However, before these changes are made, it will be important for us to discuss reporting requirements with BHRS to ensure needs are met. Discuss revising the denominator for special populatio ns reporting. Like previous years, the representation of special populations is described compared to all reports of a special population designation (which are not mutually exclusive). These numbers may be more meaningful if described as a function of all individuals who attend an outreach event. However, since this will make the reporting differ from previous years, it is worth discussing prior to making any changes. 28 BHRS Discussion on Outreach characteristics and trends After three years of summarizing comprehensive outreach data, it is imperative that we look at the trends and challenges in outreach from a perspective that considers sociocultural context and its impact on community demographics and the need for updating outreach goals and integrat ion across other BHRS outreach efforts. Outreach characteristics where we specifically looked at trends across the three fiscal years 2014 -2017 included; 1. Outreach Attendees - while there were differences amongst the collaboratives as shown in the report, o verall numbers and reach increased. 2. Race/Ethnicity - overall, individuals identifying as Mexican and White increased while other ethnicities decreased, in particular, Other Latino/Central American, Tongan and Samoan and Filipino and Black. 3. Referrals to Mental Health/Substance Abuse -while the total number of referrals made to both mental health and substance use providers decreased by almost half, the perce ntage of those referred to these services increased. This could point to the idea that outreach is getting more targeted to those with mental health and substance use needs. 4. Referrals to Social Services - the collaboratives differed in the types of referr als, while EPAPMHO primarily refers to medical care, the NCOC primarily refers to legal, and financial . Housing is the main referral type for both collaboratives . 5. Special Populations - Overall, at -risk for homelessness continues to be the highest special populations group reported. While we are well aware that staff and agency transitions and data reporting/tracking have had direct impact on the outreach numbers; there are also socio -political factors that may influence some of the shifts in racial make -up, referrals made and participant characteristics. Gentrification Recent changes in economic, educational and racial make -up of historically disinvested neighborhoods is happening across the Bay Area including the communities served by the Outreach Colla boratives. The Urban Displacement Project (http://www.urbandisplacement.org; Zuk, M., & Chapple, K. (2015 ), which analyzes regional data and has identified cities such as Colma, Daly City and East Palo Alto susceptible to ongoing and advanced gentrificati on including loss of low income housing, displacement of low income communities and changing demographics. Drug Medi -Cal Waiver In April 2016, San Mateo County was the second in the State of California to receive approval to create a local Drug Medi -Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC -ODS) providing individuals with substance use disorders greater access to a wider range of behavioral healthcare services. 29 Community -based agency representatives are reporting an increase in more complex co - occurring cases. I t will be important to attempt to track the impact of DMC -ODS on outreach. Immigration policies The current policy changes impacting immigrants has led undocumented immigrants to avoid safety -net programs. Community based agency representatives across Sa n Mateo County have been reporting a drop in enrollment and e ligible families pulling out of health and social service initiatives out of fear of deportation . It is expected that this will impact outreach characteristics. Tracking of Referrals Moving forward we will need to strengthen the tracking of unduplicated referrals to behavioral health services to demonstrate specifically how outreach efforts increase access and linkages to treatment and improve timely access for underserved populations. In par ticular, guidelines released by the State of California Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission are requesting the following data points to demonstrate effectiveness of programs funded to create access and linkages to services: 1) number of r eferrals for Serious Mental Illness (SMI), 2) the t ype of treatment received, 3) the number that followed through and engaged, 3) average duration of untreated mental illness and 4) average interval between referral and engagement . Updates to Out reach Co llaborative Deliverables Outreach characteristics as outlined in this report will continue to be collected. It is important to keep the intention of the collaboratives focused on reaching underserved populations in low income communities including at-risk youth, transition -age youth and adults of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds . Given the many challenges to tracking and reporting unduplicated reach, the focus will shift to unduplicated referrals made to behavioral health services in particular and f ollow through where appropriate. Following are overall considerations outlined last year that will be incorporated into 2018 updates to the Outreach Collaborative deliverables. Coordinate and articulate the goals of the outreach collaborative strategy across both the north county region, including Pacifica and the East Palo Alto community. o Benchmarks and activities are expected to look different given the unique needs and demogr aphics of each community, but the overall goals should align. o Integrate broader outreach and support goals and activities, recognizing the intersection of outreach to increase access for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) and outreach efforts for prevention, stigma reduction and meaningful engagement. Identify meaningful indicators of success for the outreach collaboratives including tracking SMI referrals and follow through where appropriate. Integrate efforts and activities to include special populations as identified in the AIR report, at -risk for homelessness, older adults and emerging communities and expanded 30 needs in the broader San Mateo County (e.g. Arab -American, LGBTQ, geographically isolated communities, etc.) Coordinate and articulate MHSA -wide efforts and indicators to measure stigma reduction and improvements in cultural and ethnic disparities as they relate to access to behavioral health services in San Mateo County.

Outreach events took place at age -specific community centers, faith -based church es/temples, health care clinics, home s, shelter, jail , job site s, non - traditional locations, office s, residential care facilit ies, school s, unspecified field location s, other community locations, and over the phone. Of the 616 outreach events, 40% occurred in office s. Most of these events were held in English (60%). Only one EPAPMHO group outreach event was conducted. The event lasted 15 minutes and was conducted in S panish . It occurred at a library and resulted in 24% of the attendees being referred to mental health and systems of care services and 32% of the attendees being referred to substance abuse and systems of care services. A total of 1,045 referrals were made to social services , including emergency/protective service s, financial/employment, food, form assistance, housing/shelter, legal services, medical care, transportation and health insurance. Even though 71% of the special population attendees were homeless or were at risk for homelessness, only 29% of the attendees received housing referrals. 3 Recommendations Recommendations based on FY 201 8-2019 data fall under t wo umbrellas: those aimed at enhancing outreach and those to improve data collection. To enhance outreach, we suggest that SMC BHRS work with providers to: Conduct more outreach in languages other than English. This will help ensure individuals who do not speak English are able to access services. Focus on increasing housing -related resources and referrals. Housing insecurity continues to be a major challenge for individuals served by SMC BHRS in this FY 2018 - 2019. To improve data collection, we recommend SMC BHRS work with providers to: Make other/unspecified data categories c learer. There are still relatively high proportions of individuals in other/unspecified categories for some topics, such as \"other social services.\" Ensure insurance data is capture. Due to the high percentage of missing data from this category, it was not reported this year. 4 Introduction In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), to provide funding to Counties for mental health services by imposing a 1% tax on personal income in excess of $1 million. Activiti es funded by MHSA are grouped into components, and the Community Services and Supports (CSS) component was created to provide direct services to individuals with severe mental illness. CSS is allotted 80% of MHSA funding for services focused on recovery an d resilience while providing clients and families an integrated service experience. CSS has three service categories: 1) Full Service Partnerships; 2) General System Development Funds; and 3) Outreach and Engagement. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (SMC BHRS) MHSA Outreach and Engagement strategy increases access and improves linkages to behavioral health services for underserved communities. Strategies include community outreach collaboratives, pre -crisis response, and primary car e-based efforts. SMC BHRS has seen a consistent increase in representation of underserved communities in its system since the strategies were deployed. In particular, community outreach collaboratives funded by MHSA include the East Palo Alto Partnership for Mental Health Outreach (EPAPMHO), which targets at -risk youth, transition -age youth and underserved adults (Latino, African American, Pacific Islander, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning [LGBTQ ]) in East Palo Alto, and the North C ounty Outreach Collaborative (NCOC), which targets rural and/or ethnic communities (Chinese, Filipino, Latino, Pacific Islander, and LGBTQ) in the North County region including Pacifica. These collaboratives provide advocacy, systems change, resident engag ement, expansion of local resources, education and outreach to decrease stigma related to mental illness and substance abuse. They work to increase awareness of , and access and linkages to , culturally and linguistically competent behavioral health, Medi -Cal and other public health services, and social services. They participate in a referral process to ensure those in need receive appropriate services. Finally, they promote and facilitate resident input into the development of MHSA funded services and other BHRS program initiatives. Providers reported fiscal year (FY) 2018 -2019 (July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019) outreach data using an electronic form first implemented in quarter four (Q4) of FY 2014 -2015. The information collected is self -reported by the a ttendee. AIR created this form based on interviews with San Mateo County staff and focus groups with providers. This collective effort sought to improve the data collection process so that SMC BHRS and its providers could better understand the reach of the ir outreach efforts. After data are entered, AIR cleans the data and calculates aggregated counts and percentages to describe outreach activities. P lease see Appendix I for information about calculations. This report focuses on EPAPMHO and NCOC's outreach events that occurred during FY 2018 - 2019 and outreach event attendees. We also present historical data from FY 2014 -2015, 2017 -2018 to show how outreach has changed over time. Counts of attendees do not necessarily repre sent unique individuals because a person may 5 have been part of more than one outreach event, taken part in both individual and group outreach events, and/or interacted with different providers. Provider summaries are also available to help SMC BHRS and its providers better understand each individual provider's outreach efforts. Please refer to Appendix A to I. Overall Outreach During FY 2018 -2019, SMC BHRS outreach providers reported a total of 5,417 attendees at outreach events \u2014865 attendees reached through individual outreach events and 4, 552 attendees reached across 77 group outreach events. Each individual outreach event occurs with a single attendee. Group outreach events include multiple attendees. The count of attendees is not necessarily unique because a person may have been a part of multiple individual or group outreach events. Table 1 shows outreach attendees, by collaborative, provider, and event type (i.e., individual or group) for FY 2018 -2019. Table 1.

The north region also spans a much wider geographical area, making group events (vs. individual outreach) such as 6 community wide fairs much more feasible and relevant. In contr ast, East Palo Alto spans 2.5 square miles making an individual approach to outreach more achievable The total number of NCOC outreach attendees increased in FY2014 -2018 and decreased in FY 2018 -2019. The total number of EPAPMHO outreach attendees decreas ed in FY 2014 -2018 but then increased again from FY 201 8-2019 ( Figure 1). Figure 1.

In particular, from FY 2017 -2018 to FY 2018 -2019 there was a n increase in White 8 participants increased by 2%, and participants wh o declined to state their race increased by 13%. There was a decrease in Mexican participants by 1% and Filipino participants by 6%. The EPAPMHO has also seen a decrease in outreach numbers overall and there are a few key differences in the racial/ethnic d emographics of the outreach attendees. In particular, from FY 2017 -2018 to FY 2018 -2019, there was a decrease in Black participants by 1 3%, White participants decreased by 0.2%, Tongan participants decreased by 1%, and multi -racia l participants by 4% . There were increases in Mexican participants by 14% from FY 201 7-2018 to FY 201 8-2019.

The one group outreach event was conducted in Spanish (100%) in FY 2018 -2019. Preferred language: EPAPMHO individual ongan (10%), Samoan (1%). Attendees at t he one EPAPMHO group outreach preferred Spanish (100%). Figure 22 present s breakdown of preferred languages at individual outreach events in FY 2018 -2019. Figure 22. Preferred Languages for EPAPMHO Individual recommendations based on FY 2018 -2019 data. T hese recommendations fall under two umbrellas: those aimed at enhancing outreach and those to improve data collection. Enhance outreach Conduct more outreach in languages other than English. Of the 942 outreach activities conducted only 21% were in a langu age other than English (<1% in Tagalog, <1% in Cantonese, <1% in Mandarin, 3% Samoan, 5%, in Tongan, and 12% in Spanish) . This will help ensure individuals who do not speak English are able to access services. Focus on increasing housing -related resour ces and referrals . People who reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness make up a high percentage of the special population group. For this year, 66% of the NCOC attendees and 71% of the EPAPMHO attendees reported being homeless or at risk of home lessness. Despite this high number, only 12% and 29% of referrals reported were made to housing in NCOC and EPAPMHO, respectively. In FY 2018 - 2019, we observed an decrease in the total number of housing -related referrals made compared to previous year. Improve data collection Make other/unspecified categories clearer. Last year, AIR recommended minimizing missing data, and outreach staff have made an effort to do a better job in data collection. However, there are still relatively high proportions of ind ividuals in other/unspecified categories for some topics. For example, the percentage of individuals who reported being referred to \"other social services\" made up 22% of referrals for the NCOC collaborative for FY 2018 -2019. This speaks to the need to ex pand upon the categories for this question. Ensure insurance data is capture. This year, a large proportion of attendees (55%) reported being uninsured or had unknown insurance status across the two collaboratives. Hence, this data was not presented in this year's report. The high percentage of attendees who reported being uninsured or had unknown insurance status has been a consistent trend in each of the prior years: 57% FY 2014 -2015 across both collaboratives. The county should consider how to best meet the needs of uninsured individuals, who may become more reticent to respond to outreach events particularly if they are concerned about treatment costs. The size of this group may al so grow if the insurance marketplaces destabilize. American Institutes for Research FY 2018 -2019 Outreach \u2014Asian American Recovery Services A -1 Appendix A.

The San Mateo County Pride Center (Pride Center or the Center) is a formal collaboratio n of four partner organizations: StarVista, Peninsula Family Services, Adolescent Counseling Services, and Daly City Partnership. The Pride Center also works collaborat ively with the Pride Initiative of the BHRS Office of Diversity and Equity and the Count y of San Mateo LGBTQ Commission, co -sponsoring and consulting across many events, efforts and policy priorities. MHSA INN Project Category: Introduces a new mental health practice or approach. MHSA Primary Purpose: 1) Promote interagency collaboration related to mental health services, supports, or outcomes and 2) Increase access to mental health services to underserved groups. Project Innovation : While it is not new to have an LGBTQ center providing social services, there is no model of a coordinated appro ach across mental health, social and psycho -educational services for this marginalized community. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) approved the project on July 28, 2016 , and BHRS began implementation in September 2016. The Pride Center opened to the public on June 1, 2017. The following report provides findings from the second year of implementing th e San Mateo County Pride Center, from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. In accordance with the requirements for MHSA INN programs, BHRS selected two Learning Goals \u2014 Collaboration and Access \u2014as priorities to guide the development of the Pride Center. As Figure 1 demonstra tes, BHRS sought to explore how this innovative model of coordinated service delivery and community engagement could enhance access to mental health services within underserved LGBTQ+ populations, particularly for individuals at high risk for, or with, acu te mental health challenges. In turn, the program domains of Collaboration and Access are areas in which the Pride Center might serve as a model to expand of mental health services for LGBTQ+ individuals in other regions. Figure 1: San Mateo County Pride Center Learning Goals Learning Goal 1 (Collaboration) Does a coordinated approach improve service delivery for LGBTQ+ individuals at high risk for or with moderate to severe mental health challenges?Learning Goal 2 (Access) Does the Pride Center improve access to behavioral health services for LGBTQ+ individuals at high risk for or with moderate or severe mental health challenges?San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 2 Project Need Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and other (LGBTQ+) i ndividuals commonly experience depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, homelessness, social isolation, bullying, harassment, and discrimination. LGBTQ + individuals are at higher risk of mental health issues compared to non -LGBTQ+ individuals given that they face multiple levels of stress , including subtle or covert homophobia, biphobia , and transphobia.1 Across the United States, a majority (70 %) of LGBTQ+ students report having experienced harassment at school because of their sexual orientation and/or gender id entity, and suicide is the second leading cause of death for LGBTQ+ youths aged 10 -24.2 These nationwide trends are no less evident in San Mateo County. According to the San Mateo County LGBTQ Commission's 2018 countywide survey of 546 LGBTQ+ residents and employees, nearly half of adult respondents (44%) identified a time in the past 12 months when they felt like they needed to see a professional for concerns about their mental health, emotions, or substance use. At the same time , 62% of adult respondents felt that there are not enough local health professionals adequately trained to care for people who are LGBT, and fewer than half (43%) felt their mental health care provider had the expertise to care for their needs . Among LGBTQ+ youth who responded to th e survey , three -quarters (74%) reported that they had considered harming themselves in the past 12 months, and two -thirds (65%) did not know where to access LGBTQ+ friendly health care.3 In this context , BHRS developed the San Mateo County Pride Center as a coordinated behavioral h ealth services c enter to address the need for culturally specific programs and mental health services for the LGBTQ+ community. The establishment of the Pride Center also fulfills the MHSA principle to promote interagency collaboration and increase access to mental health services for underserved groups. Project Description and Timeline As a coordinated service hub that meets the multiple needs of high -risk LGBTQ+ individuals , the Pride Center offers services in three compo nents : 1. Social and Community Activities : The Pride Center aims to outreach, engage, reduce isolation, educa te, and provide support to high -risk LGBTQ+ individuals through peer -based models of wellness and recover y that include educational and stigma reducti on activities . 2. Clinical Services : The Pride Center provides mental health services focusing on individuals at high risk of or already with moderate to seve re mental health challenges. 3. Resource Services : The Pride C enter serves as a hub for local, county, and national LGBTQ + resources , including the creation of an online and social media presence . 1 King, M., Semlyen, J., Tai, S.

Figure 2: Pride Center Implementation Timeline Evaluation Overview In 2017 , BHRS contracted Resource Development Associates (RDA) to conduct the evaluation of the Pride Center implementation and outcomes. RDA collaborate d with BHRS staff, Center l eadership staff, and Center partners to develop data collection tools measure program and service outcomes. In order to maximize RDA's role as research partners and fulfill MHSA Innovation evaluation principles, this evaluation uses a collaborative approac h throughout, including Pride Center staff and partners in operationalizing the evaluation goals into measurable outcomes and interpreting and responding to evaluation findings. BHRS seeks to learn how the Pride Center enhances access to culturally responsive services, increases collaboration among providers , and, as a result, improves service delivery for LGBTQ + individuals at high risk for or with moderate to severe mental health challenges. To guide the evaluation, R DA and BHRS have developed evaluation questions in three categories (see Figure 3). By reaching the Pride Center's goals in terms of service and operat ions, and by improving collaboration, the Pride Center hopes to improve access and overall service outcomes for clients.

Evaluation Domains and Questions Evaluation Methods RDA developed a mixed methods evaluation that incorporates both process and outcome evaluation components. A mixed methods approach allows the evaluation to track quantitative measures of service delivery and outcomes, while also gathering qualitative input on how and why activities and outcomes occu rred . Using multiple sources to explore the evaluation questions also enables comparison and corroboration of findings across data sources. The process evaluation component explores the extent to which the Pride Center h as been implemented as planned , as well as the strengths and challenges the county has experienced in implementation . The process evaluation considers the perspective of various stakeholders, including Pride Center staff and participants alike. Evaluating the implementation of Pride Center activities and services enable s BHRS, Pride Center leadership staff, and Center partners to make real-time adjustments that may improve the operations and outcomes of the Center. The outcome evaluation component assesses the extent to which the Pride Cent er\u2014through its collaborative approach to service delivery \u2014improves access to services and client -level behavioral health outcomes. San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 5 Data Collection In line with RDA's mixed methods approach , this evaluation includes both quantitative and qualitative tools to measure indicators in th ree domains : Center services and operations, the Center's Learning Goals (Collaboration and Access to Services ), and service delivery outcomes. Below we describe the measures that the evaluation will use along with the data coll ection methods that we will use to measure each of the indicators. Please see Appendix A for a detailed data collection plan. As collaboration is the core innovative element of this MHSA INN project, it was crucial for the evaluation team to operationalize the concept of collaboration so that it could be measured over time. RDA researched validated survey tools intended to measure collaboration among a team of service providers , including both management -level staff (who may not work directly with clients) and direct service staff. RDA and BHRS selected the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Co llaboration Scale II (AITCS -II), developed by Dr. Carole Orchard.4 AITCS -II is a diagnostic instrument that is designed to measure the interpersonal dynamics and teamwork among health services coworkers . It consists of 23 statements , represent ing three elements that are considered to be key to interprofessional collaborative practice: 1) Partnership , 2) Cooperation , and 3) Coordination . Respondents indicate their general level of agreement with each statement on a 5 -point Likert scale that ranges from 1 ( \"Never\" ) to 5 (\"Always\") . The survey takes approximately 1 0 minutes to complete. To facilitate survey administration, RDA transferred the survey onto the online platform Survey Gizmo. RDA obtained permission from Dr. Orchard to make some slight modifications to the survey language in order to be more appropriate for the Pride Center team. For example, we replaced \"his/her\" with \"their\" a s a gender -neutral pronoun. See Appendix B for RDA's online version of the AITCS -II. To document the Pride Center's service population, Center staff and RDA collaborated to create a protocol for m onitoring the number and characteristics of individuals who participate in onsite programs and services. Because the Pride Center provides an array of services with varying degrees of participation \u2014 including drop -in services, one -time community events, ong oing peer support groups, and clinical services \u2014it was import ant to define what constitutes meaningful participation at the Pride Center for the purposes of collecting and reporting demographic data to the MHSOAC. The Pride Center serves marginalized individuals who may be hesitant to provide personal information on paper, even anonymously . Asking new attendees to fill out an extensive demographic form could feel unwelcoming to individuals who have experienced fear, stigma, and trauma related to their LGBT Q+ identity or other life circumstances . In order to maintain a welcoming environment, Center staff determined that individuals who attend the Center more than once , as well as any client s receiving clinical 4 Orchard, C. A., King, G.

To capture the total number of individuals served, the Pride Center decided to also track attendance through a sign -in sheet that captures basic personal information, but does not include the full ra nge of demographic variables listed in the updated INN regulations. The demographic form was designed to capture all elements required by the MHSOAC. The Pride Center and its partners decided to add additional categories to the questions regarding sexual o rientation and gender identity in order to include a wider spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities. These revision s were aligned with BHRS's initiative to revise Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) questions on health intake forms. The Pride Center and its partners also decided to add three additional items to the demographic form: housing status, income, and employment status. RDA developed an online format of the demographic survey using a HI PAA-compliant version of Survey Gizmo; the Pride Center administrative specialist enters the demographic forms into the online form monthly . The demographic form designed for the Pride Center is included in Appendix C. RDA developed a survey to gauge Pride Center participants' e xperiences and approval of the Center's onsite programs, staff members, mental health services, and community space. The survey is designed to be administered annually at a point in time to as many participants as possible, through both paper and online fo rmats. Pride Center staff began to administer the Experience Su rvey to Center participants and attendees in June 2018. The survey includes 13 statements that invite respondents to indicate their level of agreement with each statement on a four -level Likert scale (\" Disagree ,\" \"Somewhat Disagree,\" \"Somewhat ). In addition, the survey asks the number of times participants have visited the Pride Center and contains an optional section to record respondents' demographic information. RDA developed an online format of the demographic survey using a HIPAA -compliant version of SurveyGizmo . Paper surveys were entered into the online form. The Participant Experience Survey is included in Appendix D. RDA conducted three focus groups with Pride Center participants \u2014one each with youth, adult, and older adult participants \u2014to gather in -depth information from individuals who accessed clinical services and participated in Center prog rams and events. With feedback from BHRS and the Pride Center Director , the evaluation team develop ed a semi -structured focus group guide to learn from participants about their experiences with programs onsite, to what extent the Pride Center facilitates access to services for LGBTQ+ individuals , and any suggestions for improvement. In addition, RDA held a focus group with members of the Pride Center's Community Advisory Board (CAB), which formed in early 2018. Speaking to CAB members offered insight into t he group's activities during the first few months of operation, their perspectives on the Pride Center's successes and challenges, and priorities for the CAB moving forward.

San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 8 Implementation Update Changes to Innovation Project during Reporting Period There were no changes to the Pride Center MHSA Innovation pro ject during FY2017 -18. Key Accomplishments This section highlights accomplishments of the Pride Center in FY2017 -18. The key accomplishments are divided in to three categories: implementing onsite programs and services, developing and enhancing the Center's internal operations, and expanding the Center's countywide engagement. The Pride Center's clinical practice became fully operational. Soon after its Grand Opening in June 2017, the Pride Center hired both its Clinical Coordinator and Case Manager, who helped augment the Ce nter's clinical services into a full -fledged practice. In collaboration with other staff, the Clinical Coordinator oversaw the development of the Center's clinical policies and procedures in the fall of 2017. The Pride Center obtained Medi -Cal certificatio n in late 2017, which enabled participants with Medi -Cal insurance to access mental health services; previously the Center only offered therapy on a sliding scale. In order to meet the mental health needs of as many participants a s possible, the Center als o piloted a program for intern and trainee clinicians to gain work experience while offering services onsite. I n August 2017 the Pride Center hired an unpaid, part - time clinical trainee , who became a clinical associate and postgraduate intern in January 2018. In 2018, the Center hired two additional part -time, unpaid clinical trainees , whose multilingual skills expanded the Center's ability to serve Spanish - and Cantonese - speaking participants. The Pride Center implemented a wide array of programs , resour ces, and events for LGBTQ+ individuals with mental illness or at risk of mental illness . In addition to therapy and case management services, the Pride Center organizes eleven peer support groups for particular subsets of the LGBTQ+ community . The Center a lso hosts a number of recurring community events, like movie nights, arts and crafts gatherings, and community forums. The Pride Center also offers a Resource Library with informational materials and directories to other services.

Figure 6 displays examples of the promotional materials that staff produce for Center programs and events. Figure 5: Onsite Programs and Services at the Pride Center in FY18 Pride Center p articipants have taken active roles in expanding the Center's programming. Pride Center staff launched a volunteer program in FY2017 -18, with regular orientations to train new volunteers. According to Pride Center staff, participant volunteers were most active in helping out with administrative tasks, the Resource Library, and a ssisting fellow participants with accessing resources. In addition, Pride Center attende es have worked with staff to create new supportive services . For instance, some participants organized a job network and employment search program to assist fellow part icipants who are looking for work. Another participant started a support group for people on the autism spectrum. These collaborative efforts exemplify the enthusiasm of Pride Center participants for the community that the Center supports, as well as the o penness and flexibility of the staff to support programs initiated by participants.

At the start of FY2017 -18, the Pride Center had been open to the public for a month, but had yet to develop or implement many of its organizat ional policies, procedures, and protocols San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 11 for the day-to-day operation of its new collaborative model . Consequently, Pride Center staff and partner organization representatives have revised their program manual and internal policies over the past year . Areas in which staff have developed procedures and workflows include: Policies and procedures for the Center's clinical program ; Protocols for data collection in both clinical and nonclinical programs ; Standards and best practices in development and fundra ising ; Safety policies, i.e. in the event of an onsite health crisis ; Role clarity between staff members and between Pride Center and partner organizations' staff ; Operational procedures for emergency preparedness; and Integrating matters of cultural humility into organizational policy . The Pride Center expanded its capacity by hiring additional staff. As mentioned above, the Center hired two full -time clinical staff members in the summer of 2017 to enhance the Center's therapy and case management serv ices. A part -time Grant Writer and Development Associate joined the Center in early 2018 to spearhead the search for additional funding and sustainability opportunities. In addition, Center staff operates a volunteer program, whose members support a wide r ange of activities , including events planning and programming, outreach efforts, research, data entry, and more . Table 2 includes a full list of new staff members , trainees, and interns during FY2017 -18. Table 2: New Staff Members and Volunteers Onboarded in FY 2017 -18 Quarter Staff Member / Volunteer Q3 2017 Clinical Coordinator and Lead Clinical Supervisor Q3 2017 Case Manager Q3 Youth Intern (part -time) Q1 2018 Grant Writer and Development Associate (part -time) Q2 2018 Clinical Associate (part-time unpaid intern) Q2 2018 Clinical Trainee ( part-time unpaid intern) The Pride Center launched its Community Advisory Board (CAB) in February 2018. The CAB draws together a diverse group of community representatives who are committed to expanding the Pride Center's engagement within and beyond San Mateo County. During the first few m onths of meeting, the CAB worked to establish clear roles among its members, while exploring alternatives to a hierarchical decision -making structure for the group as a whole. In addition, CAB members engaged in multiple forms of outreach, building partner ships with community -based organizations and seeking potential sponsorships from the private sector. The Pride Center served as a hub for a variety of meetings and trainings designed to strengthen community capa city to serve LGBTQ+ individuals . Staff hold monthly onsite trainings on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) for local service providers, school staff, and other community members. The Pride Center also serves as the meeting site for other commun ity partners: the Pride San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 12 Initiative of the BHRS Office of Diversity and Equity, the County of San Mateo's LGBTQ Commission, the San Jose/Peninsula chapter of the national nonprofit PFLAG , and the San Mateo County Office of Education, which hosts meetings fo r GSA (Genders and Sexualities Alliance) Coordinators at the Center. In addition, some local GSA student chapters meet at the Pride Center. Pride Center staff trained an array of private and public organizations on matters of sexual orientation and gender identity, establishing the Pride Center as a resource for the broader San Mateo County population . In the fall of 2017, Pride Center staff developed a comprehensive training program to educate BHRS staff , local service providers , and local businesses on wo rking with LGBTQ+ individuals. The Center's staff conducted over 60 trainings across San Mateo County in FY2017 -18, averaging five per month . Training participants included employees from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, as well as attendees of a Trauma Informed Schools Conference. Furthermore, Pride Center staff also spoke at professional conferences, including the Multicultural Symposium of the Northern California branch of the National Alliance for Mental Illness and the Stanford Adolescent We llness Conference . Through helping other organizations and agencies better serve their LGBTQ+ consumers and constituents, the Pride Center's staff helped to promote the Center as a source of expert knowledge within the wider community. Figure 10 includes a partial list of workplace trainings that Pride Center staff conducted in FY2017 -18. The Pride Center led trainings and outreach for over twenty local middle schools, high schools, and colleges . Pride Center staff facilitated trainings for teache rs and staff members at six high schools, as well as the San Mateo Union School District. Center staff and volunteers also held workshops, hosted tables at resource fairs, and supported student organizations at fifteen schools, ranging from junior high sch ools to four -year colleges. In FY 2017 -18, Pride Center staff also sponsored a gathering of students representing GSAs from schools across San Mateo County. In addition, the Pride Center formed two longer -term partnerships with staff and students at local s chools. The Center contracted with Kennedy Middle School, located in nearby Redwood City, to offer a ten -week therapy group for LGBTQ+ students. In addition, the Center partnered with students from the Queer Identities course at nearby Notre Dame de Namur University to launch the Oral History Legacy Project, in which students recorded and presented the experiences of older adult participants at the Pride Center. Figure 7: Pride Center Staff and Volunteers Conducting a Training at Thomas R. Pollicita Middle School San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 13 The Pride Center co -sponsored many informational and recreational events to spread awareness about the Pride Center. The Pride Center sponsored a range of educational events, such as resource -sharing workshops for county residents, in collaboration with other service agencies and departments in San Mateo County. The Center also hosted several social programs and events with local businesses; for instance, the Center held events at Planet Granite, an indoor rock climbing gy m, and CuriOdyssey, an interactive science and wildlife center. The Center also held joint events with LGBTQ+ centers in nearby Oakland and San Jose, building intra -regional connections between LGBTQ+ communities in different parts of the Bay Area. Through these community -based events, attendees could learn more about the Center's onsite programs, and could potentially be connected to needed mental health services.

Table 3 includes a head count of unique individuals who signed a Pride Center attendance sheet , or whom Pride Center staff tallied, during the past year. Table 3: Number of Unique Individuals Accessing Pride Center Programs and Services in FY 2017 -18 Source # Unique Individuals Onsite sign -in sheets during drop -in hours 1,011 Peer group attendance 81 Community -based trainings ( tally of participants ) 1,309 BHRS SOGI trainings (sign -in sheets) 655 TOTAL 3,056 Moreover, when considering all points of meaningful contact \u2014which also include engaging with Center representatives at an outreach event or tabling event and following the Center on social media \u2014the Pride Center had over 10,000 meaningful encounters in its first full year of implementation. Of those who v isited the Pride Center, 151 accessed clinical psychotherapy services, and 45 utilized case management services onsite. These numbers include 13 individuals who accessed both therapy and case management services. Because the Pride Center only has one case manager, its capacity to offer case management services is limited. As such, Center staff prioritize these services for participants with more critical and/ or complex needs. To date, over a third (37%) of the participants receiving case management were experiencing homelessness at the time. Housing instability is a common challenge for participants receiving case management; to date, the case manager has help ed over half (52%) of their clients either maintain or obtain housing or shelter. 5 To produce a count of unique individuals, Pride Center staff aggr egated the sign -in sheets and manually unduplicated any names that appeared multiple times. San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 16 Participant Demographics During FY2017 -18, a total of 4 00 individuals completed the Pride Center's Participant Demographic Survey. The results are summarized below.6,7 Age: The majority of participants in FY2017 -18 (85%) reported being between the ages of 16 and 59. Eight percent were 60 or older, and 5% were 15 or younger. See Figure 11 for the full range of participants' ages. Language: Nearly all participants (92%) reported speaking English in their households . Spanish was the second most common language ; othe r responses included Cantonese, Tagalog, Tongan, and Armenian. Race: Slightly more than half of participants (54%) identified as white, followed by Hispanic or Latino/a/x (23%) and Asian or Asian American (20%) participants. Because partici pants could select multiple racial identities, 8% of participants identified as both white and another racial identity. In total , 52% of participants identified as either multiracial or people of color. (See Figure 12 for the full results.) When comparing the rac e of Pride Center par ticipants to the population of San Mateo County in 2017 , the Pride Center saw a slightly higher percentage of white participants (39% of the county, vs. 46% of participants who identified as only white) and a slightly smaller percentage of Asian participants (30% of the county, vs. 20% of Pride Center participants). One -quarter (25%) of county residents are Hispanic or Latino/a/x, which is 6 While participants are asked to fill out the demographic form upon their second visit to the Center, it is possible that a small number of participants may have a ccidentally completed the form more than once. Thus, 400 is likely close to an unduplicated count, but may include some duplicates. 7 Note on reporting : To comply with HIPAA requirements and protect the confidentiality of participating individuals , this report only present s data for response categories with at least five responses. Where fewer than five responses were received, some categories have been combined. 5% 29% 30% 26% 8% 3%0 to 15 16 to 25 26 to 39 40 to 59 60 and older Decline to state 54% Asian Black Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander Other Native American / Alaskan Decline to stateFigure 11: Center Participants by Age in FY2017 -18 (n=400) Figure 12: Pride Center Participants by Race in FY18 (n=400) note: participants could select multiple answers San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 17 consistent with Latinx representation at the Pride Center (23%). Black, Native American, and Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants were also represented at rates comparable to the population of San Mateo County (3%, 1%, and 2% of county residents , respectively).8 While the Pride Center has improved in achieving a racially diverse and representative participan t base, recruiting participants of color and sustaining culturally sensitive programming remains a priority for Center staff. Ethnicity: For participants in Year Two, the most commonly identified ethnicity was European. Latinx participants most commonly id entified as Mexican or Chicano/a/x , followed by South American. Among Asian American participants, the most common ethnicities were Filipino/a/x and Chinese, with other participants identifying as South Asian, Japanese, Korean, or other Southeast Asian eth nicities. Smaller proportions of identified as African or Middle Eastern. Sex: Sixty -one percent of participants responded that they were female at birth, and 31% responded that they were male at birth. Other participants identified as intersex at birth or declined to respond. Gender Identity: In all, 62% of participants identified as cisgender: 39% percent identified as cisgender women, and slightly less than one -quarter (23%) identified as cisgender men. Nine percent of participants identified as genderqu eer or gender non -conforming, and 7% identified as either transgender men or women. Nearly one -fifth of participants (18%) declined to state their gender identity; the remainder of respondents identified as another gender identity, or as questioning or uns ure of their gender identity. Figure 13Error! Reference source not found. shows the full range of responses for Pride Center participant s' gender identities. Sexual Orientation: Gay and lesbian individuals accounted for 30% of survey responses , as did participants who identified as heterosexual or straight.9 Twelve percent identified as queer, 9% identified as bisexual, and 5% identified as pansexual. Aside from those who declined to answer (9%), the remaining participants reported that they were asexual, questionin g, or identified with another sexual orientation. Figure 13 shows the full range of responses for participants' sexual orientations. 8 \"U.S. Census Bureau Quick Facts: San Mateo County, California,\" U.S. Census Bureau website . <<https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanmateocountycalifornia >> 9 The high proportion of respondents who identified as straight or heterosexual is likely due to multiple factors: Pride Center staff originally administered the demographic survey to service providers who attended onsite trainings (but stopped doing so in the middle of the year); Parents of LBGTQ+ youth visit the Center to access resources or attend parenting classes and peer groups, and some of these parents have completed the survey; A numb er of the Pride Center's transgender participants identify as heterosexual; Because the Pride Center does not turn away people who are not LGBTQ+, it is possible some straight people accessed drop -in services.

The most common ly reported disabilities were chronic health problems (6% of participants), difficulty seeing (5%), and learning disabilities (4%). Education: 10 As a whole, adult Pride Center participants are highly educated. Among respondents aged 26 or older (n=254), three -quarters of participants had either earned their bachelor's degree (37%) or a graduate degree (38%). Nine percent reported having some college education, and 7% declined to answer. The remaining respondents had an associate's degree, a vocational or trade certific ation, a high school diploma or GED, or less than a high school diploma. Employment: Slightly less than half of participants (44%) reported having full -time employment, with 14% reporting part -time employment and 17% identifying as students. Ten percent of participants were unemployed and looking at the time of the survey, and 5% were retired. The remaining participants declined to answer. Income: As Figure 14 shows, t he Pride Center draws adult participants across the socioeconomic spectrum. Among survey respondents aged 26 or older, there was a fairly even distribution of reported incomes across the five different response options. However, over a quarter (26%) of respondents declined to answer. Housing: Over three -quarters of participants ages 26 and older (79%) reported having stab le housing, and an additional 5% reported that they were 10 Adult participants aged 25 and younger are not included because the Pride Center's demographic survey includes an age category between 16 and 25, which would include current high school students as well.

Veteran Status: Over 95% of adult participants reported that they were not armed forces veterans . San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 20 Progress Toward Learning Goals This section discuss es the progress that the San Mateo County Pride Center has made toward achieving its two learning goals : Collaboration . Does a coordinated approach improve service delivery for LGBTQ+ individuals at high risk for or with moderate to severe mental health challenges? Access . Does the Pride Center improve access to behavioral health services for LGBTQ+ individuals at high risk for or with moderate or severe mental health challenges? A summary of key findings is presented below, followed by a detailed discussion of each learning goal . Summary of Key Findings Wide Range of Services -The Pride Center's collaborative organizational model has been instrumental in developing clinical and other services for LGBTQ+ participants across age groups, identities, race/ethnicities, incomes, and languages. Partner agencies each bring their own areas of expertise and coordinate with each other to provide mental health and supportive services for participants with multiple needs. High -Quality Services -Among Pride Center staff, strong team cohesion has enabled the Center to provide high quality services while they learn how to best operate in a collaborative service delivery model. Increased Capacity -With outside partner agencies, the Pride Center has developed strong relationships that facilitate referral pathways to the Pride Center as well as improved capacity to serve LGBTQ+ individuals outside of the Pride Center.Learning Goal 1: Impact of Coordinated Service Delivery Model Culturally Responsive Services -The Pride Center's model increases participant access to quality mental health care by offering therapists who identify as LGBTQ+ and who provide culturally sensitive services for San Mateo County's diverse community. Reduced Stigma -Having a physical building in a prominent location, highly competent staff, and responsive programs and services, creates an inclusive and welcoming community that promotes entry into and continued participation in mental health and other supportive services for the LGBTQ+ community.Learning Goal 2: Improved Access to Mental Health ServicesSan Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 21 Learning Goal 1: Impact of Coordinated Service Delivery Model Bringing together multiple organizations to operate the Pride Center has helped ensure that programming and services accommodate a wide range of participants . Because the Center's four partner organizations have dif ferent service specializations \u2014for instance, Peninsula Family Services works primarily with older adults, and Adolescent Counseling Services works with youth \u2014the Center can serve a much wider array of people than one organization on their own. In addi tion, the partner organizations, which had existed long prior in San Mateo County, offered the fledgling Pride Center a stamp of approval as a trustworthy institution. Having a n array of services available onsite, along with assistance connecting with outside services , has helped Pride Center clients get the services they need more quickly and with less stress than before the Pride Center . Parti cipants noted that the Center's coordinated model was a major help to individuals w ho would otherwise have to travel to several different offices to access mental health care and other needed service s. The concentration of supportive programs at the Center particularly eases the burden on individuals with mental health challenges, indivi duals who have experienced homelessness, and/or low - income participants without adequate access to transportation. Besides offering mental health services, the Center case manager address es some of the practical challenges that low -income LGBTQ+ people mig ht face, like offering assistance in finding employment opportunities, writing a resume, securing necessary documentation , apply ing for public assistance, and searching for stable housing. Strong internal cohesion among staff members facilitates the delivery of high -quality services to Pride Center participants. Staff and participants both agreed that the Pride Center takes a coordinated approach to serving clients. On the Staff Collaboratio n Survey, nearly all respondents (90% or more) felt that their team had strongly coordinated health and social services based on participants' needs, regularly communicated as a team regarding participants' care, encouraged and cultivated each team members ' particular skills, and worked with participants and their families to adjust care plans. Participants corroborated staff members' internal assessment that this team -based approach to service delivery has enhanced their own wellbeing.

Figure 15: Participant Approval of Service Linkages at the Pride Center in FY20 17-18 Source: Participant Experience Survey Notably, survey respondents found it easier to connect to other services within the Center than outside the Center: slightly over two -thirds (69%) agreed that it was easy to connect to other services outside of the Center . This finding can be interpreted in two ways: on one hand, it point s to the inherent ease of access in a one -stop -shop model; on the other hand, it may suggest an area for improvement in linking participants from the Pride Center with outside agencies. The connections the Pride Center has cultiva ted with outside agencies have improved coordination and access to mental health services by establishing referral pathways and increasing capacity for LGBTQ+ appropriate care . As discussed in the Implementation Update section above , the Pride Center has carried out trainings and outreach with a multitude of County and community partners. These external collaborations have improve d access to mental health services for LGBTQ+ individuals \u2014both b y raising awareness about the Pride Center and by building capac ity for LGBTQ - appropriate services outside the Center . Learning Goal 2: Improved Access to Mental Health Services With a clinical model that offers therapy by and for LGBTQ+ individuals , the Pride Center improves access to mental health services for LGBTQ+ individuals who would be less likely to seek or remain in care with non -LGBTQ+ providers. Having a LGBTQ+ therapist has easy to get connected to other services within the Pride Center. (n=152) It's easy to get connected to other services outside of the Pride Center. (n=142) Agree Somewhat Agree We're a gigantic resource for the San Mateo County community. We're educating the educators and the social service providers, we're building all kinds of networks: GSAs in the schools, alliances in adult groups. - Community Advisory Board member San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 23 health treatment , as participants feel more understood and supported compared to previous experience with non - LGBTQ+ therapists . Several focus group participants noted that they struggled to find adequate mental health care locally before hand, and had faced issues when their providers were not trained to work with LGBTQ+ clients . According to participants, LGBTQ+ therapists are more likely to understand their lived experiences ; this means that participants are not spending valuable treatment hours explaining terminology, identi ties, or types of relationships that non-LGBTQ+ therapists may not understand. Not having to worry about whether their therapist will understand them relieves anxiety that many LGBTQ+ individuals experienced when receiving services from non -LGBTQ+ provider s. As a result, participants are able to begin treatment with a fundamental sense of trust that they may not have been able to establish with their previous mental health care providers. This trust sets a foundation for a strong patient/provider relationship , which ultimately supports a productive treatment process . In addition to the clinical services at the Pride Center, all participants have the opportunity to access drop - in services, join a relevant peer support group, atten d Center events, and otherwise benefit from the informal therapeutic gains of the Center as a safe, inclusive space. On the Participant Experience Survey, 100% of respondents (n=134) either agreed (85%) or somewhat agreed (15%) that the services they were receiving at the Center were improving their mental health . The Pride Center fills a particular gap in access to mental health services and supports for participants who identify as transgender or nonbinary . The Center's clinical services, peer support groups, and other programs are responsive to participants across the LGBTQ+ spectru m, particularly those who are marginalized within health care and public systems, such as transgender and nonbinary individuals . Center staff regularly help transgender or nonbinary participants change their name and/or gender on their personal identification and public records, a process than can be difficult and frustrating when undertaken alone. Clinicians on staff have written letters of support for participants to receive hormonal therapy and gender reaffirming surgeries. One youth participant noted that the Center was the only local facility to offer voice therapy services for transgender people looking to match their voice with their gender identity and expression. The Center's Resource Library also includes chest binders that are made available free of charge to participants. In addition to these regular programs and resources, the Center has also sponsored events such as the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance, and a photo project and social media campaign called In Bloom: Transgender Day of Visibilit y. Put broadly, Center staff and leadership are aware of the complex mental health and supportive service needs that transgender and nonbinary participants can face and can coordinate service delivery to meet these needs across multiple domains. I don't feel like I need to hide things from [the therapists]. It was a major step in my life...I've had transphobic therapists in the past. - Youth participant When I went to cisgender, hetero normative therapists, I got a blank look. They didn't get it. The [therapists] here understand it on the inside. - Adult participant It's incredibly important to have someone you can talk shorthand with. - Older adult participant San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 24 Figure 16: Pride Center Participants in the In Bloom: Transgender Day of Visibility Photo Project Staff members' warmth , client -centered approach , and follow -through has encourage d participants to engage in and remain connected with Pride Center services. Participants of all ages credit the Pride Center staff \u2014clinicians , program staff, and administrative staff alike \u2014for fostering the Center as a welcoming and accessible environment. For instance, one participant noted that the staff member at the front door remembered their name upon a return visit, even though they had not attended any programs in several months. In turn, staff members' helpful disposition has helped some participants to overcome the stigma they had felt around seeking mental health care, and/or their sexual orientation or gender identit y. Another adult participant described how they had found the Center when they were questioning their sexual orientation, and how staff members had met with them offsite until they felt comfortable enough to visit the Center. Staff and participants both a greed that the Pride Center uses a client -centered approach that is collaborative and inclusive of participants. On the Staff Collaboration Survey, 100% of respondents agreed that their team : 1) includ es patients in setting goals for the patients' care; and 2) listen s to the wishes of their patients in determining the process of care chosen by the team . Participants concur red that staff members invite their perspectives in setting their care plans: 99% of respondents (n=135) either agreed (81%) or somewhat agreed (18%) that staff included them in deciding what services were best for them. Every single time I come here, it's a lovely experience. There's not a single time I cross that door and someone doesn't ask me how I am , or how my day is going. - Youth participant San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 25 Pride Center staff have developed team cohesion by participat ing in team -building activities and practicing open communication . All Staff Collaboration Survey respondents indicated that team members respect and trust each other. It is evident from both staff and participants that a collaborative, respectfu l, and trusting work environment has contributed to staff members' capacity to collaborate in serving participants. Figure 18 shows how respondents to the Participant Experience Survey were nearly unanimous in agreement that Pride Center staff were personable, helped address participants' questions, and were respectful of participants' sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, and/or culture. Figure 18: Participant Approval of Pride Center Staff in FY2017 -18 (n=172) Source: Participant Experience Survey The Pride Center has cultivated a more racially diverse participant base over time, increasing access to services for historicall y marginalized LGBTQ+ communities. Last year's annual report noted that one of the Pride Center's early challenges was achieving greater representation from LGBTQ+ people of color. All in all, the Center has made strides in ensuring that the Pride Center s erves a racially sexual orientation. (n=162) Staff understand & affirm my gender identity. (n=162) Staff are courteous and friendly. (n=172) Staff are responsive when I have requests. (n=165) Staff understand & affirm my culture/ethnicity. (n=160) Agree Somewhat Agree Figure 17: Center Staff at the \"One Year of Queer\" Pride Center Anniversary Celebration San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 26 more reflective of San Mateo County and California as a whole. The Center's clinical protocols stipulate that staff prioritize mental health services for members of underserved and marginalized groups, including people of color. The Center recruited clinical staff and interns who were fluent in languages common to local immigrant communities, such as Spanish and Cantonese. In addition, Center staff developed some programming to specifically support San M ateo County's large Latinx community, such as a Queer Latinx Circle support group. Partly due to these concerted efforts, the Pride Center was able to grow a more racially diverse community of participants. As noted in the previous section, during the past year a majority of respondents (52%) to the Center's demographic survey identified as nonwhite or multiracial. Despite these advances, staff are still committed to improving the representation of participants of color in Pride Center services. For instanc e, the racial diversity of the Pride Center community was one of the most commonly cited areas for improvement in the write -in responses on the Staff Satisfaction Survey. For FY2018 -19, Center staff plan to launch a peer support group for queer and transge nder people of color (QTPOC), and to host weekly peer support drop -in services in East Palo Alto and Half Moon Bay, communities with higher concentrations of residents of color. Providing a physical location and inclusive space for LGBTQ+ individuals improves mental health and wellbeing by reducing social isolation, ameliorating stigma, and creating a sense of community . Participants of all ages noted that the Pride Center provides an important day -to-day community space, where they could go to simply hang out or feel like part of a larger community. Prior to the opening of the Center, many participants had to travel to San Francisco, the East Bay, or San Jose to find an LBGTQ+ friendly community space. Other participants cited that the Pride Center was valuable simply as a space where they could go to find a peaceful, quiet environment. Participants of all ages cited the Pride Center's intergenerational events as some of their favorite Center programs. Older adults relished talking to younger participan ts about the struggles they faced in growing up LGBTQ+, and youth participants expressed admiration towards the adults who helped build a foundation for the modern -day LGBTQ+ community. In this way , the Center's collaborative service model has helped to cr eate an environment where participants who might never otherwise interact could find commonality. As Figure 19 indicates, 100% of the respondents to the Experience Su rvey agreed or somewhat agreed that the Pride Center is a welcoming and safe environment, and 99% agreed or somewhat agreed that the Center offers participants a sense of community. What I really like about the Pride Center is that it's a safe space, and it's not triggering. - Youth participant People should not have to go to Berkeley or San Francisco or San Jose to feel like a part of something. - Adult participant I think the [Pride Center is] doing a fantastic job of representing the LGBTQ community. It's nice to see more than just queer white kids. - Youth participant San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 27 Figure 19: Participant Approval of the Pride Cent er's Environment and Atmosphere in FY20 17-18 Source: Participant Experience Survey Some participants hailed the Center as a joyous space, noting how the bright and colorful artwork throughout the interior helped to create a welcoming atmosphere. In addition, the artwork and posters promote social inclusion, connecting LGBTQ+ rights to support for civil rights, immigrant rights, disability rights, and racial, gender, and religious equality. That is, the Center supports an intersectional understanding of inclusion within its community of participants. Other participants and CAB members suggested that the ve ry presence of the Pride Center as a physical building on a prominent local thoroughfare (El Camino Real) was itself therapeutic \u2014legitimizing LGBTQ+ residents as equal members of the broader San Mateo County community. Some older adult participants and CAB members contrasted the presence of the Pride Center to their own experiences growing up, when they and their LGBTQ+ peers had no place to pub licly gather or express their sexual orientation and gender identity. These individuals thus offered that the very existence of the Center could help to reduce the stress and stigma that LBGTQ+ residents experience from social isolation or discrimination. 99% 92%1% 7%80% 85% 90% 95% 100% The Pride Center is a welcoming & safe environment.

This section highlights the key recommended areas of focus for the Pride Center in establishing a collaborative model that improves access to mental health services for LGBTQ+ residents based on implementation learnings to date . Despite high levels of collaboration in coordinating service delivery, Pride Center staff observed areas for improvement in establishing and formal izing processes for the internal operations of the Center . As described earlier in this report, Pride Center have developed excellent communication and working relationships . Pride Center staff and partners have also made strides in developing new policies and procedures to guide their work . At the same time, staff recognize that there is still work to do\u2014they are building the Center and its operating procedures from scratch. Staff Colla boration Survey respondents indicated areas for improvement in the following areas : Understanding the boundaries of what each other can do; Using agreed -upon processes to resolve conflicts; and Equally dividing agreed -upon goals a mong the team. The above responses indicate potential areas for organizational growth: clarifying staff members' different responsibilities, ensuring an equitable division of labor, and establishing accountability to a standard for conflict resolution. It stands to reason that improving internal workflows around role clarity will further enhance staff members' capacity to serve participants. While the four partner organizations have periodically assisted Pride Center staff in developing and implementing org anizational protocols, such as sharing planning documents or other resources from their other program areas, multiple staff members commented on the Collaboration Survey that they could benefit from more support from the partner agencies on matters of orga nizational development. The widespread demand for mental health services among LGBTQ+ county residents has challenged staff members' capacity to accommodate all participants' needs. It is to the credit of the Pride Center's coordinated service model and countywide engagement strategies that the Center attracted so many county residents who sought culturally sensitive mental health services for LGBTQ+ individuals. However, the Pride Center's clinical practice lacks the capacity to meet the needs of all par ticipants who access to mental health services through the Center, both in terms of staffing and physical space. As mentioned earlier, in early 2018 Pride Center staff had to relegate some participants seeking mental health care to the clinical practice wa itlist. To accommodate the high volume of participant requests for mental health services, Center leadership began to utilize therapist trainees as clinical staff in 2018. This strategy has its limitations, however: because San Mateo County prevents traine es from serving as counselors for mild to moderately mentally ill Medi -Cal clients, the trainees have only been able to work with participants on a sliding scale fee for service . This barrier has proved challenging, as multiple therapist trainees are multi lingual and may be best suited to work with Medi -Cal recipients who primarily speak a language other than English. San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 29 The high volume of Pride Center activity, combined with the Center's capacity limitations, heightens the risk of staf f burnout. In speaking with the RDA evaluation team, Community Advisory Board members raised concerns that the Center's staff members were exerting themselves beyond what was sustainable. To be certain, the CAB's apprehension is a credit to the devotion an d commitment that Pride Center staff have demonstrated in making the Pride Center fully operational, coordinating regular onsite and community -based programming, helping clients with needs as they arise, and cultivating the Pride Center as a welcoming spac e. Nonetheless, the risk of burnout remains among the small body of staff who are responsible for the wide array of Pride Center activities, and who spearheaded the development of the Center into a fully operational service and community space in the past year. San Mateo County is a difficult region in which to mobilize LGBTQ+ community members. Some participants contrasted the welcome and inclusive environment of the Pride Center to their neighborhoods of residents and other community spaces, which often t ended to be culturally or socially conservative. For instance, Center participants who attend the nearby College of San Mateo have remarked that the campus' climate can make LGBTQ+ students uncomfortable or afraid of expressing their gender identity and/or sexual orientation. In addition, Center staff, participants, and CAB members all noted that the geographic expanse and residential distribution of San Mateo County can make it difficult to reach community members farther away from the Center's location in downtown San Mateo , particularly residents along the coast or in North County . The county lacks ample west -to-east public transportation routes, and CAB members noted that local bus lines periodically cut back their services. While staff, participants, and CAB members have all pursued engagement opportunities throughout the entire county, they have done so in spite of these ongoing infrastructural and geographic challenges to regular outreach. Everyone here has such high levels of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, commitment, heart... [but] you can only sustain that for so long. - CAB member [I]t feels like everyone is constantly wearing about eight hats and there's never enough time. - Pride Center staff member San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 30 Conclusion The 2017 -2018 fiscal year marked the first full year of operation of the San Mateo County Pride Center. At the start of FY2017 -18, the Center had been open to the public for one month and had just wrapped up its inaugural month of programming. In the year following its Grand Openin g, the Pride Center staff and partner organizations established a wide array of clinical services and community -oriented programs. The range of programming helped to foster a multigenerational, multiracial community of participants who identify across the spectrum of sexual o rientation and gender identity. The Pride Center has not only filled a critical gap in local mental health care services; it has also demonstrated the benefit of its unprecedented model of coordinated service delivery. The Center allows participants to access mental health services with LGBTQ+ therapists, which for many participants is a welcome departure from their previous difficu lties in finding mental health care providers both knowledgeable and respectful of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, the Pride Center offers a safe space for community members who often experience discrimination or social isolation to gather. In turn, the Pride Center's social events and community -oriented programs provide avenues for participants to connect with mental health care or other supportive services. In addition, the Center's staff, participants, and Community Advisory Bo ard have conduct ed community outreach and engagement activities across the county . Pride Center staff delivered workplace trainings for behavioral health clinicians, service providers, educators, and private sector organizations. These trainings empowered providers in other sectors to better serve their LGBTQ+ clients and students and helped build awareness of the Center across San Mateo County. Staff also conducted outreach to students and older adults across the county, working to address the social isola tion that many LGBTQ+ individuals experience. That is, the Pride Center's extensive community presence was twofold: to draw more people to the onsite services and programming, and to serve as an I've been involved in a lot of LGBTQ organizations, mostly advocacy groups, focused on a particular issue. This [Center] brings it all together. There's the social component \u2014part of the sense of community, lots of social activities. And also the activities that are for a purpose - support group[s], intergenerational dinner[s]. Also, things the Center is doing to [increase their visibility in the County]... Most LGBTQ organizations don't have that range. - Older adult participant Figure 21: Attendees at the Pride Center's Inaugural Queer Youth Prom San Mateo County Behavioral Heal th and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - San Mateo County Pride Center December 21, 2018 | 31 expert resource in making the county's entire network of supp ortive care and services friendly to LGBTQ+ residents. The Pride Center is not without its struggles. It is still a relatively young organization, and its staff devoted a large amount of time and effort last year to building the Center's infrastructure, ad dressing operational challenges, and developing brand -new programs. Staff capacity is limited in its ability to handle the participant demand for mental health care services, and locating sustainable, longer -term sources of funding for the Center remains a concern. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Pride Center has become a crucial community resource within a short amount of time, and has already influenced service providers, employers, and consumers across the county. The Pride Center is hoping to extend the innovation study period for an additional two years. With additional time, the Pride Center would focus on further developing its internal policies and procedures and serving a larger mental health client base . Having the opportunity to extend the eval uation of how the Pride Center's collaborative model influences access to services and client outcomes would support in documenting a replicable best practice model that can benefit Behavioral Health Services statewide and nationally.

The MHSA INN project ca tegory and primary purpose of the NMT pilot project are as follows: MHSA INN Project Category: Makes a change to an existing mental health practice that has not yet been demonstrated to be effective. MHSA Primary Purpose: Increase quality of mental health services, including measurable outcomes. Project Innovation: While NMT has been integrated into a variety of settings serving infants through young adults, there is no literature or research of NMT in a strictly adult setting or population. BHRS intends to adapt, pilot, and evaluate the application of the NMT approach to an adult population with a history of trauma. This e xpansion to and evaluation of NMT in an adult system of care is the first of its kind. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accounta bility Commission (MHSOAC) approved the project on July 28, 2016 and BHRS began implementation in September 2016. In 2017 , BHRS contracted Resource Development Associates (RDA) to evaluate the adult NMT pilot project . This report provides findings from the second year of NMT implementation \u2014July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 \u2014in the BHRS Adult System of Care. BHRS developed two learning goals to guide the NMT pilot and assess the extent to which the program is meeting its intended MHSA objectives \u2014to increase the q uality of services and consumer outcomes. The learning goals are outlined in Figure 1 below. The first learning goal pertains to the adaptation and implementation of the NMT approach in the adult consumer population, while the second learning goal pertains to the effectiveness and impact of the NMT approach in improving recovery outcomes. Figure 1. NMT Pilot Project Learning Goals Learning Goal 1 Can NMT, a neurobiology and trauma - informed approach, be adapted in a way that leads to better outcomes in recovery for BHRS adult consumers? Learning Goal 2 Are alternative therapeutic and treatment options, focused on changing the brain organization and function, effective in adult consumers' recovery?San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 2 Project Need Through the MHSA Community Planning Process in San Mateo, BHRS and community stakeholders identified the need to provide alternative treatment options to broaden and deepen the focus on trauma informed care and provide better outcomes in recovery for adult BHRS consumers. To address this need, BHRS proposed implementi ng the NMT approach within the BHRS Adult System of Care. NMT is an innovative approach to treating trauma that is grounded in neurodevelopment and neurobiology. Subsequent sections provide a more in -depth description of NMT and its application to adults. Project Description and Timeline The Child Trauma Academy (CTA) developed NMT as an alternative approach to addressing trauma, typically used with children, that is grounded in neurodevelopment and neurobiology. NMT is not a single therapeut ic technique or intervention. Rather, NMT uses assessments to guide the selection and sequence of a set of highly individualized therapeutic interventions (e.g., therapeutic massage, drumming, yoga, expressive arts, etc.) that best match each NMT consumer 's unique strengths and neurodevelopmental needs .1 NMT is guided by the principle that trauma during brain development can lead to dysfunctional organization of neural networks and impaired neurodevelopment. The selected set of therapeutic interventions in tends to help change and reorganize the neural systems to replicate the normal sequence of brain and functional development. Selected interventions first target the lowest, most abnormally functioning parts of the brain. Then, as consumers experience funct ional improvements, interventions are selected that target the next, higher brain region. The sequence of interventions aims to help consumers better cope, self -regulate, and progress in their recovery. As depicted in Figure 2, the NMT process co nsists of three main phases: 1) assessment, 2) brain mapping, and 3) the development of individualized treatment recommendations. These phases are briefly described below. Figure 2. Key phases of the NMT Process 1Perry, B.D . & Hambrick, E. (2008) The Model Therapeutics. Reclaiming Children and Youth , 17(3), 38 -43. Assessment Brain MappingTreatment RecommendationsSan Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 3 Assessment. NMT -trained providers collect information pertaining to the consumer's history of adverse experiences \u2014including their timing, nature, and severity \u2014as well as any protective factors. This information is used to estimate the risk and timing of potential developmental impairment. The assessment also includes an examination of current functioning and relationship quality (e.g., with parents , family, peers, community, etc.). Brain Mapping. NMT -trained providers enter assessment data into a web -based tool designed by the CTA, which uses assessment data to generate a brain map illustrating the brain regions most affected by developmental impai rment. Through this \"mapping\" process, scores are calculated in four functional domains: 1) Sensory integration, 2) Self -regulation, 3) Relational, and 4) Cognitive. The functional domain values are compared with age typical domain values to assess the degree of developmental impairment and identify the consumer's functional strengths and challenges. Treatment Recommendations . Therapeutic interventions are identified that address the consumer's needs in the four functional domains, first targeting the lowest brain regions with most severe impairment. Throughout treatment, assessments and brain mapping are performed at regular intervals to evaluate any changes in funct ional domains, and treatment recommendations are adapted as appropriate. Since its development , NMT has been most widely used with children who experienced maltreatment and/or trauma, and BHRS has been using the NMT approach w ith children since 2012 . However, the use of NMT with adults is limited. Given the high prevalence of trauma among adult behavioral health consumers and the relationship between childhood trauma and behavioral health issues in adulthood, there is a strong theoretical basis to predict that adult mental health consumers could benefit from the NMT approach.2,3 Nevertheless, NMT's effectiveness in the adult population is unknown. As mentioned, NMT has not been formally imple mented into an adult system of c are, and no outcome studies have been conducted to evaluat e NMT in an adult population . BHRS is adapting, piloting, and evaluating the application of the NMT approach to an adult population with hopes of increasing the quality of mental health services and improving recovery outcomes for adult mental health consumers with a history of trauma. 2It is estimated that 40 -80% of adults with mental illness and/or substance use issues also have experiences of trauma.

San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 4 NMT Providers As mentioned, BHRS has been using the NMT approach with youth since 2012. In that time, 30 clinical staff in the BHRS Child and Yout h System of Care and 10 clinical staff from community -based partner agencies received training through CTA.4 In addition, 10 BHRS providers have become certified NMT trainers, and certify other providers in NMT through the CTA training. These trainers serve as mentors to NMT trainees and teach NMT principles and provide consultation to other providers. To expand NMT to the adult population, 12 providers within the BHRS Adult System of Care began NMT training with CTA in January 2017. The providers work in a variety of settings, including BHRS specialty mental health or regional clinics and programs serving consumers re -entering the community following incarceration. Target Population BHRS estimates that the adult NMT pilot project will serve approximately 7 5 to 100 adult consumers annually once the BHRS providers in the Adult System of Care are fully trained. Providers refer existing BHRS consumers from their caseloads to NMT, targeting three adult mental health populations : General adult consumers (ages 26+) receiving specialty mental health services; Transition age youth (TAY) consumers (ages 18 -25); and Criminal justice -involved consumers re -entering the community following incarceration. The three target populations like ly have different experiences, needs, and coping skills and, as a result, could respond to NMT differently. For example, TAY are still undergoing brain development and therefore may be more responsive to neurodevelopmental treatment approaches such as NMT. In addition, the re - entry population might have different coping mechanisms than the general adult and TAY consumer populations, such as engaging in high -risk behaviors that might lead to incarceration. For the re -entry population, the experience of incar ceration could also further contribute to trauma. Figure 3 illustrates the key activities that have taken place since NMT implementation began in July 2016. 4CTA operates the formal training certification program. The training takes place over approximately one year, with trainees learning through a combination of readings, videos, webinars, and case -based tra inings. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 5 Figure 3. NMT Implementation Timeline Evaluation Overview As mentioned, BHRS contracted RDA to evaluate the pilot and support project learning. In order to maximize RDA's role as research partners, RDA collaborated with BHRS and CTA when planning the evaluation \u2014including identifying evaluation goals, validating the theory of change for NMT specific to the adult populatio n, identifying the types of variables that may support or complicate outcomes in adults , and developing data collection tools to measure program implementation and consumer outcomes. To guide the NMT evaluation, RDA developed evaluation sub -questions asso ciated with each learning goal. The evaluation questions (EQ) are listed below. To the extent possible, the evaluation will examine implementation and outcome differences across the three target populations to identify how BHRS can adapt the NMT approach t o best meet each population's unique needs. More in -depth information about the evaluation is available in the evaluation plan included in the Appendix.

'17: NMT PLANNING BHRS develops outreach materials, identifies providers for NMT training, and develops resources for NMT interventions YEAR TWO (July '17 - June '18) START -UP & YEAR ONE (July '16 - June ' '17) San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 6 The first year of the evaluation focused largely on Learning Goal 1 to identify how BHRS is implementing and adapting the NMT approach with the adult population. During this second year, the eva luation examines both Learning Goals to : 1) identify how NMT implementation has progressed as the program has matured and providers are further along in or have completed NMT training, and 2) examine preliminary changes in consumers' functional and recover y outcomes as consumers participate in NMT. Evaluation Methods Data Collection RDA employed a mixed -methods evaluation approach (i.e., using both qualitative and quantitative data) to identify who is participating in NMT, how BHRS is adapting the N MT approach for the adult population, and preliminary consumer outcomes. This report includes information about NMT implementation as well as preliminary consumer outcomes for adults who participated in NMT services during the evaluation period \u2014July 1, 201 7 to June 30, 2018 , fiscal year 2017 -2018 (FY17 -18). RDA worked closely with BHRS to identify and obtain appropriate outcome measures and data sources to address the evaluation questions. RDA collected quantitative information about NMT consumers from two main data sources: 1) BHRS's Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, Avatar, and 2) the NMT Database operated by CTA, which includes brain map and functional domain scores as well as recommended NMT interventions . RDA also collected qualitative data throu gh a focus group conducted with BHRS NMT providers (6 participants) on August 7, 2018 and a focus group with NMT consumers (7 participants) on September 27, 2018. The focus group with NMT providers centered on providers' experience of NMT training, how the y are adapting the NMT approach with the adult population, and implementation successes and challenges. The focus group with the NMT consumers centered largely on their experience with NMT services, how NMT services differ from other mental health services received, and the perceived impacts of NMT on their wellness and recovery. Table 1 outlines the outcome data available for this report as well as the respective data sources.5 Table 1.

To analyze qualitative data, RDA transcribed focus group participants' responses to appropriately capture the responses and reactions of participants. RDA then thematically analyzed responses from participants to identify commonalities and differences in participant experiences. Implementation Update Changes to Innovation Project during Reporting Perio d There were no changes to the NMT pilot project during the 2017 -2018 fiscal year. Key Accomplishments Six providers within the BHRS Adult System of Care completed NMT training and are continuing training to become certified NMT trainers. In January 2017 , 12 providers in the BHRS Adult System of Care began the scheduled CTA NMT training. As of the end of the reporting period, six providers completed the NMT training and are certified in NMT. Of these providers, five are continuing on to NMT \"Train -the-Trainer\" training, which began in July 2018, to become certified NMT trainers. Four providers are still continuing the NMT training, while two providers stopped the training due to workload and/or other demands but are intending to restart the training at a l ater date . In year 2 of the NMT pilot, the number of consumers receiving NMT services doubled from year 1. During the second year of the NMT pilot project, 40 adult consumers received NMT -based services compared to 20 consumers during year 1. During year 2, providers completed baseline assessments with 37 consumers and completed follow -up assessments with 11 consumers. As providers are progress ing through the training and have become more confident with the NMT assessment, providers are beginning to implement NMT assessments and interventions with more clinical cases. As more providers become fully trained, BHRS anticipates approximately 75 to 100 adult consumers will receive NMT services annually. BHRS expanded the NMT resources and interventions available to consumers in the Adult System of Care. During the first year of the pilot project, the NMT interventions for adults were somewhat limited as BHRS worked to expand available resources. However , during the second year of the evaluation, BHRS established relationships with other services and programs, including yoga, drumming, therapeutic massage, and animal -assisted therapy. Additionally, providers within the adult system of care have been San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 8 able to use NMT pilot funding to better equip their offices and clinics with resources and tools for NMT interventions \u2014including therapeutic lighting, art supplies, adult coloring books, weighted blankets, fidget spinners, bubbles and silly putty, sensory brush es, and other sensory integration tools. This broader array of NMT interventions will allow greater opportunity for both providers and consumers to try different therapies and identify the interventions that best meet consumer s' needs. NMT Consumer P rofile The following section describes the consumer population that participated in NMT services during FY17 - 18, including demographic information, behavioral health diagnoses, behavioral health service utilization, and baseline NMT assessment information. Demo graphic Information As mentioned previously, BHRS aims to serve three adult populations through the NMT pilot project: adult consumers (ages 26+) receiving specialty mental health services, TAY (ages 18 -25) receiving mental health services, and criminal justice -involved consumers re -entering the community following incarceration. During FY17 -18, 40 adult consumers received NMT services, all of whom reflect the intended target population. Most c onsumers (n=31, 78%) were adults ages 26 -59, while nine consumers (23%) were TAY. No consumers were under the age 18. In addition, at least 15 consumers (38%), including both adults and TAY, were also part of the re -entry population.6 Figure 4. NMT Consumer Population, FY17 -18, N=40 Table 2 describes the demographic characteristics of the NMT consumers.7 For some characteristics, information was unknown or not reported for all consumers. As a result, the total number of consumers may be less than 40. The number of consumers for whom information is available is reported in the table. 6Consumers were identified as part of the criminal justice/re -entry population if they received be havioral health services in custody, services through the BHRS mental health court, or services through a provider aimed at serving the re -entry population (e.g., Service Connect). 7In accordance with HIPAA, demographic categories comprised of fewer than five consumers were aggregated to protect consumer privacy. 9 TAY Consumers31 Adult Consumers TAYAdult San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 9 Two -thirds of consumers reporte d they were female (n= 26, 65%) and one -third reported they were male (n=14, 35%); no consumers reported a different sex.8 The largest racial group was White (n=15, 42%), while 33% reported another race including Asian, Black or African American, and Other. Nine consumers (25%) reported they were two or more races. One -third of consumers reported they were Hispanic or Latino (n=12, 33%). Nearly all consumers (n= 37, 93 %) spoke English as their primary language, while some consumers primarily spoke another la nguage or more than one language. Most consumers reported they were heterosexual (n=14, 78%), while 17% (n=6) reported they were another sexual orientation, and 6% (n=2) declined to state their sexual orientation. Over half of consumers (n=24, 60%) had a k nown disability, including a chronic health condition, an intellectual disability, or another type of disability. No consumers reported that they were a veteran. Table 2.

Typically, the majority of adult consumers receiving specialty mental health services within adult systems of care have been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophreni a or schizoaffective disorder) or a mood disorder 8Information regarding gender identity was not available for this report. However, BHRS is actively working to incorporate gen der orientation questions into their EHR. 9LGBTQ+ refers to lesbia n, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning or gender queer, intersex, asexual, or other sexual orientations. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 10 (e.g., bipolar or major depressive disorders). However, as shown in Figure 5, the NMT population served during FY17 -18 had a wider variety of behavioral health diagnoses . Consumers may have more than one behavioral health diagnosis; as a result, percentages add to greater than 100%. While the most common diagnosis was a mood disorder wherein 73% (n=29) of consumers were diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder, only 8% of consum ers (n=3) were diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Nearly two -thirds of consumers (63%, n=25) were diagnosed with a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , and half (53%, n=21) were diagnosed with a generalized anxiety, panic, or adjustment disorder. In add ition to these mental health diagnoses, 28% (n=11) also had a diagnosed personality disorder. Substance use is also prevalent among the population served, wherein half of consumers (n=19, 48%) have a documented co -occurring substance use disorder. Of these consumers, most reported using several substances, while some were diagnosed with specific cannabis, alcohol, amphetamine, or opioid use disorders. Most consumers with documented substance use disorders were also part of the criminal justice re -entry popu lation. Figure 5. Behavioral Health Diagnoses of NMT Consumers, N=40, FY17 -18 The breadth of diagnoses aligns with some of the diagnostic challenges that arise when working with individuals who have experienced significant trauma. Adults who have experienced trauma often have a more complex clinical presentation, frequently characterized by symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mood fluctuation s as well as substance misuse . Symptoms reflective of trauma may not clearly align to any one diagnosis within the existing diagnostic classification systems (e.g ., DSM -IV TR or DSM -V). The relatively high prevalence of documented personality disorders may also be indicative of pervasive childhood trauma. As more consumers particip ate in NMT, it will be possible to explore consumers' clinical profile in greater depth. Behavioral Health Service Utilization All consumers who received NMT services were enrolled in and receiving outpatient mental health services. This aligns with the model of integrating NMT within existing mental health services rather than creating a stand -alone program. In addition to outpatient mental health services, one -third of consumers (n=13, 33%) also participated in outpatient and/or residential substance us e services in the year prior to NMT enrollment . Additionally, in the year prior to NMT enrollment, 18% of consumers (n=7) experienced a mental health crisis that required psychiatric emergency services . 8%28%48%53%63%73% Pyschotic Disorder (n=3)Personality Disorder (n=11)Substance Use Disorder (n=19)Generalized Anxiety, Panic, or Adjustment Disorders (n=21)Post-traumautic Stress Disorder (n=25)Mood disorder (n=29)San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 11 Figure 6. Behavioral Health Service Utilization, N=40, FY17 -18 Baseline NMT Assessment s As mentioned previously, NMT -trained providers enter assessment data into a web -based tool designed by the CTA that uses the assessment data to generate a brain map illustrating the brain regions most likely to be affected by developmental impairment. Through this \"mapping\" process, scores are calculated in four functional domains: 1) Sensory integration, 2) Self -regulation, 3) Relational, and 4) Cognitive. The brain map and functional domain values can then be compared with age typical values to assess the degree of developmental impairment and identify the consumer's functional strengths and challenges. These functional domains are defined as follows: Sens ory Integration refers to a set of functions that integrate, process, store, and act on sensory input from outside (e.g., visual, auditory) and inside (e.g., metabolic) the body. Self-Regulation refers to a broad set of functions that modulate and regulat e the activity of other key systems in other parts of the body and brain, such somatosensory and emotional regulation. Relational refers to the complex set of relationship -related functions such as bonding, attachment, attunement, reward, empathy, and rel ated emotional functions. Cognitive refers to the myriad functions involved in complex sensory processing, speech, language, abstract cognition, reading, future planning, perspective -taking, moral reasoning, and similar cognitive capabilities. As of the end of the reporting period, baseline assessments were completed for 37 consumers.10 Of these 37 consumers, 29 were adults (78%) and 8 were TAY (22%). For each consumer, functional domain values were compared with age typical values to calculate the percent of age typical (i.e., the functional domain score). A score of 100% indicates normal functioning with respect to a person's age. A score lowe r than 100% indicates some degree of impairment, wherein lower scores correspond to greater impairment. For example, a functional domain score of 70% indicates greater impairment than a value of 80%. The average baseline scores for the total brain map and each of the functional domains are illustrated in Figur e 7. Consumers' average baseline brain map score was 81%. However, the values ranged widely from 53% (indicating a high degree of impairment) to 100% (indicating normal functioni ng). Consumers 10 Baseline assessments were still ongoing and not yet completed for the remaining three consumers. 18%33%100% Psychiatric Emergency Services (n=7)Substance Use Services (n=13)Outpatient Mental Health Services (n=40)San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 12 appeared to have relatively high functioning in the sensory integration and cognitive domains at baseline. The average sensory integration score was 85% (range: 51% to 100%), while the average cognitive domain score was 87% (range: 62% to 10 0%). In comparison, consumers appeared to have somewhat lower functioning in the self -regulation and relational domains. The average self -regulation score was 77% (range: 42% to 100%), while relational score was 76% (range: 49% to 100%). Figur e 7. Average Baseline Brain Map and Functional Domain Scores, N=37 , FY17 -18 As discussed, brain map and functional domain scores are used to highlight the consumers' functional strengths and needs. This information can then be used to develop broad recommendations for the types and intensity of NMT interventions that consumers should receive to promote growth and recovery. To guide treatment planning, CTA developed cut -off scores to indicate whether interventions targeting each of the functional domain areas are recommended as essential, therapeutic, or enrichment. These recommendation categories, or levels, are described in greater detail below: Essential: Functional domain score is <65% of age typical. At the essential level, activities are considered crucial for future growth in the given domain. If functioning in the essential area is not increased, the individual will lack the foundation for future growth and development in this and other areas. Therapeutic: Functional domain score is 65-85% of age typical. At the therapeutic level, activities are aimed at building strength and growth in the particular area. Therapeutic activities are viewed as important for continued growth and developmen t. Enrichment: Functional domain score is >85% of age typical. At the enrichment level, activities provide positive, valuable experiences that continue to build capacity in the given area. Figure 8 illustrates consumers' recommended level of intervention across each functional domain based upon their baseline assessment. In both the sensory integration and cognitive domains, interventions for most consumers (65 -70%) were recommended as enrichment. Interventions in the cognitive and sensory integration dom ains were recommended as therapeutic for approximately one -quarter of consumers and recommended as essential for less than 10%. This reflects the relatively high functioning of consumers in these areas. 87%76%77%85%81% CognitiveRelationalSelf-RegulationSensory IntegrationTotal Brain MapSan Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 13 In comparison, for the self -regulation and relational domains, most consumers had interventions recommended as essential or therapeutic.

Learning Goal 2: Are alternative therapeutic and treatment options, focused on changing the brain organization and function, effective in adul t consumers' recovery? A summary of key findings is presented below, followed by a detailed discussion of each learning goal. Summary of Key Findings Provider Experience -Providers enjoy the NMT training and believe it is helping them better serve their clients. However, greater mentorship throughout the training process could help providers better understand NMT priniciples and apply NMT to the adult population. Provider Skill Development -Providers are becoming more confident with the NMT assessment process and are expanding NMT selection to include consumers who are lower functioning and/or have greater mental health needs. Adaptations to Adults -Assessments can still be more time consuming and more difficult to complete with adults than children and adults are sometimes less receptive to trying different types of activities. To address these challenges, providers are implementing strategies to make the assessment process smoother with adults and are tailoring activities to meet each consumers' specific needs and interests. Learning Goal 1: NMT Implementation and Adaptation Improved Consumer Outcomes -Consumers appear to be benefitting from NMT services, as indicated by increases in functional domain scores and progress in their recovery. The NMT approach may also make it easier for some consumers to engage in therapy. Trauma -Informed Approach toCare -NMT implementation may behelping clinics and programs within theBHRS adult system ofcare bemore trauma -informed .Learning Goal 2: NMT OutcomesSan Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 15 Learning Goal 1: NMT Implementation and Adaptation The following section describes key successes and challenges implementing and adapting NMT to the adult population. The section includes discussion of the selection of providers in the adult system, NMT training, the NMT assessment process, and NMT interventions. Providers opted in to NMT training voluntarily in order to strengthen their ability to serve consumers with a history of trauma. As mentioned, 12 providers began the NMT training in January 2017 , all of whom are master's level clinicians . NMT training was vo luntary, and all clinical staff opted in. Providers received information about NMT and the NMT training opportunity from supervisors, team members, and a training announcement circulated by BHRS. Providers shared that they chose to participate in the train ing because they were already working with consumers with a history of trauma and adverse experiences . Providers felt the NMT approach sounded promising to better serve these consumers and expressed interest in strengthening their abilities to respond to a nd treat the impact of trauma . Some providers had a background in occupationa l therapy and noted that they were already using more \"hands on\" interventions aiming to improve consumers' functioning . These providers hoped the NMT training would help them gain a more in -depth understanding of the principles of neurodevelopment and how NMT -based interventions can be used to improve consumers' recovery . The NMT training model relies on a case conference or group supervision approach with intensive self- study. In this approach, the providers attend an initial in-person training and then begin implementing NMT while conducting their self -study and participating in NMT study groups and learning communities . To conduct their self -study, providers receive a detailed training syllabus with a variety of web -based training materials and resources \u2014including videos, lectures, recordings, readings, and case studies \u2014 allowing providers to work through the content at their own pace . Providers must also participate in a monthly meeting , or case conference, wherein providers discuss real -life cases. These group discussions are the foundation for supervision of NMT implementation, provide opportunities for clinicians to r efine their knowledge and skills, and allow for fidelity monitoring. Throughout the training, providers must also complete at least 10 NMT assessments . Certified NMT providers must then complete fidelity assessments annually, wherein providers evaluate the same client data and inter -rater reliability scores are calculated. NMT training is designed to be completed over the course of approximately one year, although the self - directed nature of the training allows the training to be extended as needed . San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 16 The NMT training is increasing providers' knowledge and ability to respond to consumers with a history of trauma. Overall, p roviders found the NMT training useful and interesting, and enjoyed learning about the ne urobiology and impact of trauma. For many of the providers, the NMT training is providing an opportunity for more advanced training in brain development and neuropsychology related to trauma. The providers described how their increased knowledge and understanding about the impact of trauma is helping them better under stand the behaviors and presentation of consumers. NMT trainers and supervisors also observed these changes among providers, and noted that the training appears to be improving providers' clinical skills. Given these benefits, s everal providers shared that all clinicians should receive some training in the NMT principles and the impact of trauma on neurodevelopment in order to improve service delivery. The NMT training is intensive and takes significant time and dedication. Providers also acknowledged that training take s dedication and require s a lot of time in addition to their existing caseloads and other responsibilities. Additionally, challenges in completing assessments with adult consumers as well as translating NMT tools from the child to adult population can make the training particularly intensive. For providers in the adult system, the training is requiring more than a year to complete. Among providers who completed the training, the process took approximately 18 months . However, some providers are working through the training at a slower pace, while two providers chose to suspend the training until they had more time to devote to it. Some providers shared that it was helpful when their supervisors were flexible in allowing them to take extra time to participate in the trainings and conduct NMT assessments. Providers also noted that it would be helpful if they could re ceive continuing education credits for the NMT training. Greater mentorship throughout the training could help providers better understand and apply NMT principles and adapt NMT for an adult population. While the training is extensive, some providers shared that it would have been useful to devote more time and practice to treatment planning during the training. In some cases, providers felt they needed more explanation of how the underlying NMT principles related to the selection of specific intervent ions. Some providers also found it challenging to translate the underlying theory to practice as many of the learning materials focused on children rather than adults. In particular, some providers felt they needed more guidance in selecting practical inte rventions for adults . Some of the recommended interventions are geared more toward children, or adults may be more hesitant than children to try new activities if they are unfamiliar (e.g., yoga, knitting, clay therapy). The information is so valuable...The trauma lens from a neuro perspective, it has changed my outlook on the world and how I view things. - NMT Provider You have to be willing to go the extra mile to get this specific training. I was really close to dropping out because it's like taking another master's course and I already had so much on my plate. My supervisor was really accommodating in providing more time, but it's hard to follow -up when you're not getting clients consistently. It's a lot of work. - NMT Provider San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 17 Providers noted that having greater access to NMT mentors (i.e., certified NMT trainers with more senior experience implementing NMT) could have helped trainees navigate some of the challenges related to learning the assessment tools and treatment planning as well as modifying interventions for adults . Some providers mentioned that it would also be helpful if they were paired with a NMT -certified provider who worked in the same clinic or program to promote more regular mentorship and familiarity with the target population. It is important to note that th e cohort of NMT trainees is larger than in previous years, primarily because of this INN project. Although trainees were paired with mentors in the latter half of the training, there were more trainees per trainer and new trainees may not have gotten as mu ch support as in previous cohorts . However, a s previously mentioned, five providers in the Adult System of Care are participating in the NMT Trainer certification training and can provide mentorship to future trainees in the Adult System of Care . Providers are becoming more confident and adept with the NMT tools and the assessment process. The NMT assessment process is fairly intensive and includes a number of detailed questions to understand a consumer's developmental history and pa st experiences of trauma. For all new NMT trainees \u2014in both adult and youth systems of care \u2014it takes time for providers to learn and gain comfort with the assessment tool. Providers in adult systems may also have a steeper learning curve as they do not regu larly conduct developmental histories with adult consumers with the level of detail required for the NMT assessment. As all NMT trainees first learn the assessment questions and process, they often administer the assessment in a direct way, going question by question. This approach takes longer and there was concern that this approach may trigger or risk re -traumatizing consumers who are not accustomed to these types of questions. In particular, adults may be less accustomed to discussing early experiences \u2014including trauma \u2014and providers were concerned that the developmental history questions may bring up emotions that the consumer is not prepared to manage. As providers have progressed through the training, they have become more confident with the assessmen t tool and appear to be more consistently implementing strategies to make the assessment process smoother and minimize the risk of re -traumatization. These strategies include: 1) Explaining the process to consumers to help them understand why the providers are asking about their childhood and adolescence; 2) Asking broader questions or combining questions to make the assessment more conversational, less burdensome, and less -time cons uming for the consumer and to reduce the risk of re - traumatization ; There's a lot of reason and th eory involved in the training, but then we had to do the treatment planning portion. I felt like I was thrown into the treatment planning a little bit. I needed more of a bridge. - NMT Provider San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 18 3) Breaking up the assessment over multiple visits if the consumer had reactions to the questions or struggled to focus long enough to complete the assessment; and 4) Reach ing out to additional respondent s who may have information about the consumer, such as another provider who is familiar with the consumer's history . Some consumers who participated in the focus group also acknowledged that the as sessment process can feel long and that it can be difficult to discuss past experiences of trauma , particularly if it is their first time meeting with a provider . However, consumers who participated in the focus group shared that providers were patient and made them feel safe. Some providers mentioned it could also be useful to have a standardized set of materials or an orientation to NMT that could be used by all providers to help introduce consumers to NMT prior to beginning services . The orientation or materials could be used to help explain the NMT pr inciples and process to consumers so consumers know what to expect and feel more comfortable with assessment . As providers gain comfort with the NMT assessment process, providers are expanding NMT selection criteria to include consumers with greater mental health needs. In the earlier stages of NMT training, providers were often conservative in determining which consumers to refer to NMT . Providers were mindful of the risk of the assessment process and effectiveness of interventions based upon consumers' level of functioning, coping skills , and ability to self -regulate as well as providers' experience with the assessment tool. Several providers mentioned that they typically only referred higher f unctioning consumers \u2014including consumers they knew well and with whom they developed trust and rapport; consumers who were willing and comfortable discussing their trauma; consumers who had the coping skills to manage reactions that may arise as a result of the assessment; and consumers who are stable and compliant with medication, are not actively abusing substances, and are not actively psychotic. As providers gain more e xperience and confidence with NMT and the assessment process , providers' perception of the adult population that may benefit from NMT is evolving , and providers' selection criteria is expanding. Providers still consider the risks of engaging in the assessm ent with the potential benefits of NMT and strive to build rapport with consumers before beginning the assessment process . However, providers feel that the most important selection criteria for NMT are: Consumer has a history of trauma; Consumer is willin g to participate in NMT and regularly shows up for appointments; and Consumer is stable enough to recall information and provide realistic responses. Providers mentioned that it can still be challenging to conduct assessments with individuals who are actively abusing substances or are experiencing psychosis , as this may influence consumers' ability or willingness to respond to assessment questions and/or regularly participate in NMT services. In the beginning, I would have thought I needed the good therapy client who has good insight...Now, I'm thinking, why couldn't we implement [NMT] with someone more impaired? - NMT Provider San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 19 Nevertheless, it is apparent that providers are implementing NMT with adult consumers across a greater spectrum of mental health severity. Assessments are more time consuming and can be challenging to complete with adults. Providers noted that one challenge in implementing NMT with the adult population is that the assessments can be more time consuming and more difficult to complete than with children. One provider noted that while they can sometimes complete an NMT assessment for a child in 1 -2 meetings, for adults it can often take 3 -4 meetings over the course of a month or longer. Some reasons the assessment process is often longer for adults are: With adults, t he NMT assessment collects information for a consumers' entire developmental history \u2014fetal stages through adulthood. In contrast, the assessment is shorter for children as it only collects information through the child's current developmental stage. The assessments can be more time consuming for adults if consumers cannot recall information , and/or if consumers need to take breaks o r stop the assessment if it brings up difficult experiences. Compared to children, a dult consumers may have fewer collateral contacts that the providers or consumers can work with in order to fill in information gaps of the assessment. Adult consumers may be less likely to regularly participate in NMT services due to the severity of mental illness, substance use, homelessness, incarceration, etc. Given these challenges , providers are experiencing difficulty completing assessments if consumers stop regular ly attending mental health service appointments or become incarcerated, hospitalized, or otherwise unavailable to continue . Providers are implementing a breadth of NMT interventions, tailoring activities to each consumers' specific inter ests and needs. The recommendations serve to guide the types of interventions that consumers may need and that providers should focus on. However, the specific interventions selected are tailored to what each individual is interested in and willing to do. As mentioned, adults may be less willing to try new and different types of activities compared to children, so providers often try to int roduce interventions that may be more familiar. For example, some consumers shared that they first tried exercises such as deep breathing, counting, going for walks , and mindfulness exercises . While these activities may help some consumers become more comf ortable with the different approach to therapy, consumers also appreciated that they could practice these techniques on their own. Providers also try to learn about consumers ' hobbies and interests and will suggest or encourage activities that align with the recommended interventions. As providers build rapport with consumers and learn Every time I meet with [my provider], we work on a different project. At that time, I'm at peace. I'm in a secure place. I could have a bad day, but talking with [my provider], playing with clay or listening to music, it takes me away. - NMT Consumer San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 20 more about their specific goals and needs , they may suggest new or additional activities that consumers may enjoy or benefit from such as yoga, drumming, or spinning clay. In some cases, consumers also suggest new activities they would like to try. Consumers appreciated having a variety of activities to choose from and tools to use to best meet their needs in different situations. This flexible and individualized approach helps consumers feel supported and engaged as well as increases the likelihood that they will implement the interventions independently . Learning Goal 2: NMT Outcomes The following section describes individual -level outcomes of adult consumers who partici pated in NMT services \u2014including changes in assessment scores and recovery outcomes \u2014as well as larger systems -level changes in the providers' approach to care as a result of NMT implementation in the adult system. Providers conduct fo llow -up NM T assessments with consumers to evaluate consumers' progress as well as update consumers' treatment plans if necessary. At the time of this report, follow -up assessment data were available for 11 consumers. Among these consumers, five were adults and six were TAY. On average, there were 12 months between the baseline and follow -up assessments, although the time interval ranged from 4 to 20 months. The relatively small number of individuals with follow -up assessments and the varying length of time between assessments may partially reflect the challenges in completing assessments and inconsistent participation in services among the adult population. Additionally, providers who did not progress as far in the training may not have had the opportunity to complete follow -up assessments as they were likely serving fewer consumers or serving consumers for a shorter period of time . As the program continues to mature and greater numbers of consumers are served for longer periods, we expect more consumers wil l receive follow -up assessments . For the report, changes in assessment data were examined; h owever, given the small number of individuals with follow -up data available, assessment findings should be considered preliminary and exploratory. Focus groups wi th providers and consumers were also used to collect additional qualitative information about how NMT has impacted consumers' wellness and recovery. Although the magnitude of change varies, m ost consumers are showing increases in the ir assessment scores, suggesting functional improvements. For the 11 consumers with follow -up data available for this report , baseline and follow -up assessment data were examined to identify changes in consumers' brain map and functional domain scores as consumer s participated in NMT services. An increase was defined as any positive change in a score from baseline to follow -up (follow -up score - baseline score > 0), while a decrease was defined as any negative change in scores from baseline to follow -up (follow -up score - baseli ne score <0). San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 21 Of the 11 consumers, most consumers showed increases in their total brain map scores and across all functional domains from baseline to the follow -up assessment. As shown in Figure 9, 73% of consumers (n=8) showed incr eases in their total brain map scores, while 27% (n=3) showed a decrease. Across the sensory integration, self -regulation, and relational domains, 64% of consumers (n=7) showed increases in domain scores, while 36% (n=4) showed decreases. The greatest numb er of consumers (n=9, 82%) showed increases in the cognitive domain, with only 18% (n=2) show ing decreases in domain scores. Figure 9. Percentage of Consume rs with Increased and Decreased Assessment Scores from Baseline to Follow -up, N=11, FY17 -18 In general, increases in brain map values suggest improvement (progress toward age typical functioning), while decreases in brain map values suggest further impairment (movement away from age typical functioning). However, given that NMT has not yet been widely implemented with adults, it is unclear what magnitude of change in assessment scores may be expected and how changes translate to functional and recovery outcomes in adults. Overall, the average change in consumers' brain map and functional domain values was +3% to + 5%, depending on the specific domain (Table 3). However, the magnitude of change varied widely across consumers. Scores in the self -regulation and relational domains appeared to be particul arly variable, where the change in scores ranged from a decrease of approximately -30% to an increase of nearly 30% from baseline to follow -up. Providers noted that consumers who had particularly large increases in assessment scores responded particularly well to the selected NMT interventions. These consumers regularly engaged in the recommended activities and/or practiced various self -soothing or calming techniques on a day -to-day basis . However, in other cases, providers noted that some consumers showed great progress in their recovery, but the change in assessment scores was minor. 18%36%36%36%27% 82%64%64%64%73% CognitiveRelationalSelf-RegulationSensory IntegrationTotal Brain Map% of Consumers with Increased Scores% of Consumers with Decreased ScoresSan Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 22 Table 3. Average Change in Assessment Scores from Baseline to Follow -Up, N=11, FY17 -18 Average Change in Scores Range of Change in Scores Total Brain Map +4% -18% to to +20% It is important to note that providers' increasing experience and confidence with the NMT assessment may also partially contribute to differences in domain scores from baseline to follow -up. Providers generally completed baseline assessments earlier in their NMT training, whereas follow -up assessments were completed later when provi ders had more practice and training . As providers gain more experience with the assessments, they may score criteria slightly differently , which may contribute to a change in assessment scores . As more consumers participate in NMT services and more assessm ents are completed , it may be possible to better understand how changes in assessment scores relate to changes in consumers' functioning and recovery. NMT services appear to be helping consumers progress in their recovery. Aside from changes in assessment scores, all focus group participants could point to benefits consumers experienced as a result of participating in NMT interventions . Consumers most frequently discussed how the NMT interventions helped them feel less anxious and more relaxed. Concentrating on an activity \u2014such as an art project or spinning clay \u2014helped consumers \"get out of their head,\" while techniques such as deep breathing or the u se of sensory tools \u2014such as fidget spinners, stress balls, brushes , and massagers \u2014helped consumers stay centered and calm. In some cases, consumers and providers reported that the NMT -based techniques and activities are helping to decrease substance use as well as reduce or avoid medication to cope with depression and anxiety . Other changes noted by consumers and providers includ ed more consistent sleep schedules, increased attention to hygiene and self -care, and improved ability to communicate. For some consumers, the assessment process and NMT interventions appear to be helping consumers process their experiences to develop bett er insight and understand the impact that trauma has had on their current behaviors. The moment you start, you ge t the anger out by massaging the clay. All the stress and tension I had in my hands and my mind, I didn't have it anymore. I didn't even remember the reason why I was so upset or hurt. - NMT Consumer San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 23 The NMT approach may make it easier for some consumers to engage in therapy. Consumers shared that NMT felt different from other mental health services consumers had received. In many cases, consumers were accustomed to more traditional talk therapy, which often left consumers feeling emotional and fatigued after sessions. As one consumer noted, \"just talking to the therapist makes me relive things I don't want to.\" In contrast, NMT -based activities made consumers feel \"refreshed\" and \"light.\" While consumers enjoy the variety of interventions and activities, several consumers also observed that it was easier for them to discuss their feelings and traum a when engaging in the activities and that it helped them feel safe. Consumers also talked about how providers will engage in activities \u2014such as drawing, coloring, and building models \u2014with the consumers, which helps build rapport and trust. Several consumers mentioned that no other providers have worked with consumers in this way before, and that with NMT, they look forward to their next sessions . NMT implementation may be helping clinics and programs be more trauma -informed. As mentioned, providers reported that being trained in NMT and the neurodev elopmental impacts of trauma is changing the way they approach care , regardless of whether they are implementing NMT with a consumer. Moreover, providers observed that the presence of NMT is beginning to influence other providers who are not trained in NMT but work with NMT -trained providers . Both NMT -trained providers and non -NMT providers are making changes to their office set -up and have added objects in therapy rooms to increase consumer comfort. NMT trained providers are also increasingly receiving requests from non -NMT providers to conduct assessments with consumers on the non -NMT providers' caseloads, including both adults and the parents of children on their caseloads. With the increasing demand for NMT services, one provider suggested that it wou ld be useful to have a more explicit NMT program wherein people who screen for severe trauma are then sent to a dedicated team of NMT providers. These findings suggest that training providers in the adult system of care in NMT principles may support adult clinics and programs in being more trauma -informed and trauma -capable organizations overall. [NMT] doesn't feel like the normal going to the counselor and you just tell them your feelings and it's depressing and it's serious. [NMT] doesn't feel like that. It feels light. - NMT Consumer San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 24 Conclusion The 2017 -2018 fiscal year marked the first full year of NMT implementation in the BHRS Adult System of Care. During this time, providers in the adult system progressed in their training and served 40 consumers from diverse populations. Additionally, BHRS made great strides to better equip clinics and programs with NMT resources to expand the NMT interventions available to adult consumers. Throughout the year, providers gained more experience with the NMT assessment process, and are beginning to expand NMT selection to include consumers who are lower functioning and/or have greater mental health needs. However, implementing NMT assessments a nd interventions can still be more challenging and time consuming with adults compared to children. Adults sometimes have difficulty recalling information, may not be able or willing to participate in outpatient services consistently, and can be more hesit ant to try different types of activities . To address these issues, providers are implementing strategies to limit the burden of the assessment process on consumers and are tailoring NMT services and interventions to each consumers' specific interests and n eeds. Consumers appear to be benefitting from NMT implementation , and for some, the NMT approach may make it easier for consumers to engage in therapy . Although follow -up assessment data were limited, preliminary data suggest that consumers are improving across all functional domains. C onsumers and providers also cited improvements in consumers' mood, coping mechanisms, and self -care as well as decreases in substance use. Additionally, NMT implementation is strengthening trained providers ability to serve consumers with a history of trauma, and shows promise in supporting the adoption of trauma -informed practices and treatment options in the BHRS Adult System of Care overall. Over the next year, BHRS and RDA will continue to evaluate implementation progres s to identify facilitators, challenges, and possible recommendations for adapting NMT in an adult system of care and will continue to collect consumer -level data to examine changes in consumer outcomes. If [NMT ] can be done throughout all of San Mateo County and the whole mental health system, it c ould have so much of an impact. - NMT Consumer San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 25 Appendix . Adult Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics Evaluation Plan Introduction The Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics\u00a9 (NMT) within the Adult System of Care was developed as part of the San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) three -year Mental Health Services Act (MHSA ) Innovation plan. At their core, MHSA programs are intended to provide counties with funding to create fundamental changes to the access and delivery of mental health services. The goal of MHSA Innovation (INN) programs are to test novel approaches and in terventions created by local communities through an inclusive Community Program Planning (CPP) process. INN programs seek to do the following: Increase access to mental health programs for underserved groups, Increase quality of services and outcomes, and Promote interagency collaboration. Through the CPP process, BHRS identified the need to provide alternative treatment options to broaden and deepen the focus on trauma informed care and provide better outcomes in recovery for BHRS consumers. To address this need, BHRS proposed implementing the NMT approach within the BHRS Adult System of Care. NMT is an innovative approach to treating trauma, typically used with children, that is grounded in neurodevelopment and neurobiology. BHRS intends to adapt, pilot, and evaluate the application of the NMT approach to an adult population in order to increase the quality of mental health services and recovery outcomes for adult mental health consumers with a history of trauma. The NMT pilot meets INN requirements as it represents a change to an existing practice which has not yet been demonstrated to be effective. This expansion and evaluation of NMT within an adult system of care will be the first of its kind. The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors approved the Adult NMT project on May 24, 2016, and BHRS began implementation of the three -year pilot in September 2016. BHRS selected Resource Development Associates (RDA) to conduct a two -year evaluation of the adult NMT pilot project beginning in January 2017. The NMT evaluation is intended to help BHRS achieve the following objectives: 1. Meaningfully engage stakeholders throughout the evaluation process; 2. Measure the impact of the program; 3. Support data -driven decisions about program implementation and continuation; 4. Increase knowledge about what works in m ental health and with the adult consumers; and 5. Comply with INN regulatory and reporting requirements. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 26 NMT Literature Review: Support for NMT NMT Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (e.g., chronic stress, neglect, abuse, trauma, etc.) can profoundly impair neurodevelopment and brain functioning. Disordered brain functioning can in turn contribute to a myriad of physical, cognitive, e motional, and behavioral problems that may persist throughout the lifespan (Perry, Pollard, Blakly, Baker, & Vigilante, 1995; Felitti et al., 1998; Anda et al., 2006). The impact of adverse experiences on brain development and the resulting functional and behavioral issues also vary with the timing, severity, pattern, and nature of the trauma, as well as by the unique experiences and genetic characteristics of each individual. However, many treatment approaches designed to help individuals cope and progress in their recovery do not consider or adequately address the complexity and variability of neurodevelopmental impairment caused by childhood trauma. The Child Trauma Academy (CTA) developed NMT as an alternative approach to trauma -informed treatment that is grounded in neurodevelopment and neurobiology (Perry, 2008). NMT is not a single therapeutic technique or intervention. Rather, NMT aims to guide the selection and sequence of a set of highly individualized educational, enrichment, and therapeutic inter ventions (e.g., therapeutic massage, drumming, yoga, expressive arts, etc.) that best match each NMT consumers' unique strengths and neurodevelopmental needs to help consumers better cope, self -regulate, and progress in their recovery. (Perry & Hambrick, 2 008). As trauma during brain development can lead to dysfunctional organization of neural networks and impaired neurodevelopment, the selected set of interventions are intended to help change and reorganize the neural systems to replicate the normal seque nce of both brain and functional development (Perry & Hambrick, 2008). Interventions are selected to first target the lowest, most abnormally functioning parts of the brain. Then, as functional improvements are made, therapies are selected that target the next, higher brain region (Perry & Hambrick, 2008). The sequence of interventions aim to help consumers better cope, self -regulate, and progress in their recovery. Since its development, NMT has been implemented in various behavioral health settings (Perr y & Dobson, 2013), including BHRS which has been using the NMT approach with youth since 2012. To date, the number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of NMT are limited. However, some studies have found evidence of increased social -emotional developm ent and improvements in problematic behavior in children receiving NMT (Barfield, Gaskill, Dobson, & Perry, 2012). In BHRS, among a sample of 10 youth receiving NMT assessments and interventions, all showed improved self -regulation, and two -thirds showed i mprovements in sensory integration, relational, and cognitive domain measures. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 27 Application of NMT for Adults Currently, NMT is most widely used with maltreated and traumatized children, and the use of NMT with adults is limited. However, ther e is a strong theoretical basis to predict that adult mental health consumers may also benefit from the NMT approach. As mentioned, NMT is built upon the premise that trauma can cause neurological damage and that sequential, neurodevelopmentally appropriat e interventions can help improve coping skills and recovery outcomes. A study of over 17,000 adults revealed a strong positive relationship between ACEs and the increased likelihood of behavioral health issues, suggesting disordered brain functioning in r esponse to child trauma (Anda et al. , 2006). In particular, adults who experienced four or more ACEs were 3.6 times more likely to be depressed, 2.4 times more likely to experience anxiety, 7.2 times more likely to suffer alcoholism, and 4.5 times more lik ely to use illicit drugs than adults with no ACEs (Anda et al. , 2006). The relationship between trauma and mental health is further strengthened by the high prevalence of adult consumers with mental illness and/or substance use issues who also have experiences of trauma, approximately 40 to 80% ( Missouri Institute of Mental Health, 2004 ). These findings suggest that interventions, such as NMT, that address the neurological impacts of trauma may be effective in helping consumers improve coping skills and achieve better recovery outcomes. Despite the potential of using NMT with adults, there are also important differences between the adult and youth consumer populations that should be considered. In comparison to children, the extent of neurological da mage is likely greater among adult mental health consumers who may suffer continued brain impairment beyond the effects of childhood trauma. For instance, many adult mental health consumers also have a history of long -term psychiatric medication usage as w ell as long -term substance abuse, both of which can further impair brain functioning. In addition, initial studies of NMT have found the approach is most effective for children in safe, stable, and nurturing environments (Perry & Hambrick, 2008). However, many adult consumers may still be experiencing patterns of instability and trauma. One study found that nearly a third of mental health consumers had been victimized within the previous six months (Desmarais et al., 2014), while other studies found that c onsumers with serious mental illness are more than 10 times more likely to be homeless than the general population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2016). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of NMT in improving recovery outcomes in the adult population is unknown. As of yet, no outcome studies have been conducted to evaluate NMT in an adult population and NMT has not yet been formally implemented into an Adult S ystem of Care. Given this opportunity and the preliminary success of NMT with youth, San Mateo BHRS has undertaken a project to adapt, pilot, and evaluate the application of the NMT approach to an adult population within the BHRS Adult System of Care. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 28 San Mateo BHRS Adult NMT Pilot Project NMT Providers As mentioned previously, BHRS has been using the NMT approach with youth for the past five years. In that time, 10 BHRS providers have become certified NMT trainers. These NMT trainers can not certify other providers in NMT; however, the trainers can provide consultation and teaching of NMT principles. In January 2017, 14 mental health clinicians began NMT training.11 The clinicians work in a variety of settings within the BHRS Adult System of Care, including BHRS specialty mental health or regional clinics as well as programs targeted toward consumers re -entering the community following incarceration. Target Population The NMT providers will incorporate the NMT process into their clinical w ork, targeting three main populations of adult mental health consumers, including: General adult consumers receiving specialty mental health services, Transition age youth (TAY) consumers (ages 18 -25), and Criminal justice -involved consumers re -entering the community following incarceration. It is important to note that the three target populations likely have different experiences, needs, and coping skills and as a result, could respond to NMT differently. For example, TAY are still undergoing brain development and therefore may be more responsive to neurodevelopmental treatment approaches, such as NMT. The re -entry population may have different coping mechanisms than the general adult and TAY consumer populations, such as engaging in high risk behavior s that are more likely to lead to incarceration. In addition, for the re -entry population, the experience of incarceration could contribute to trauma. BHRS estimates that through the adult NMT pilot project, approximately 75 to 100 adult consumers will receive NMT -based services annually. Providers will refer existing BHRS consumers from their caseloads to NMT. Due to the novel nature of t his pilot, clear selection criteria for adults referred to NMT have not yet been established. Although, adult consumers who will most benefit will likely have a history of crisis or trauma. Additionally, NMT is not intended for consumers diagnosed with ser ious psychotic disorders or who are currently cycling in and out of psychiatric hospitalization. As implementation progresses, BHRS will establish guidance in case selection with the support of NMT trainers and mentors. 11The formal training certification program takes place over one year, with trainees learning through a combination of readings , videos, webinars, and case -based trainings. Trainees begin implementing the NMT model with consumers shortly after the training c ommences and must conduct a minimum of 10 NMT assessments annually. In order to ensure fidelity to the NMT model, CTA requires that all certified NMT providers complete fidelity assessments twice annually, wherein the providers evaluate th e same client dat a and inter -rater reliability scores are calculated. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 29 NMT Process and Activities The NMT approach helps clinicians identify the developmental strengths and challenges of each individual to help create an individualized treatment plan matching their unique developmental needs. As depicted in Figure 2, the NMT process co nsists of three main phases: 1) developmental risk assessment, 2) functional assessment and brain mapping, and 3) the development of individualized treatment recommendations. T hese phases are described in greater detail below. However, the elements of the NMT process and specific NMT -based services will likely be modified as the approach is adapted to the adult population. Figure 10. Key phases of the N MT Process Developmental Risk Assessment. NMT -trained clinicians collect information pertaining to consumers' history of adverse experiences - including their timing, nature, and severity - as well as any protective factors to estimate the risk and timing of potential developmental impairment. Functional Assessment and Brain Mapping. NMT -trained clinicians conduct an assessment various brain - mediated functions (e.g., heart rate, motor skills, short -term memory, speech and language, etc.) to develop a brain map identifying the brain regions most affected by developmental impairment. Through this \"mapping\" process, scores are calculated in four functional domains : 1) Sensory integration, 2) Self - regulation, 3) Relational, and 4) Cognitive. The functional domain values are then compared with age typical domain values to assess the degree of developmental impairment, identify the consumers' functional strengths and challenges, and track progress over time. Treatment Planning . In the third phase of the NMT process, therapeutic activities are identifie d that address the consumers' needs in the four functional domains, first targeting the lowest brain regions with most severe impairment. For example, consumers with severely impaired self -regulation scores often have hyper -reactive response systems and ma y benefit from deep -breathing techniques and the use of weighted vests or blankets. Consumers impaired in the sensory integration domain may benefit from patterned, repetitive somatosensory activities such as drumming and yoga. Treatment may include a mix of activities that are tailored to each consumers' unique developmental needs and activity preferences. Throughout treatment, functional assessment and brain mapping are performed at regular intervals to evaluate any changes in functional do mains. As functional improvements are made, treatment recommendations are adapted, with therapeutic activities becoming more advanced and/or targeting higher brain regions. Ultimately, as NMT treatment progresses, it is expected that consumers will experie nce improved functional and recovery outcomes. The NMT process and outcomes pathway is summarized in Figure 11.Developmental Risk AssessmentFunctional Assessment and Brain MappingTreatment PlanningSan Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 30 Figure 11. NMT Process and Ou tcomes Pathway Serious Adverse Experiences Experiences of chronic stress, neglect, abuse, and trauma impair neurodevelopment and contribute to mental health issues.Developmental Risk Assessment Consumers' history of adverse events and resilience factors can be used to estimate the risk of developmental impairment.Functional Assessment and Brain Mapping The degree of developmental impairment, the brain regions most affected, and consumers' functional strengths and challenges are identified. Treatment Planning Therapeutic activities are recommended that target the lowest and most impaired brain regions and functional domains, and sequentially target higher brain regions and domains as improvements are made. Improved Functional and Recovery Outcomes Continued NMT -based treatment helps reorganize the neural systems to replicate the normal sequence of brain development, resulting in improved brain functioning, coping skills, and self -regulation.Improved Longer -term Functional and Recovery Outcomes Improved brain functioning, self - regulation, and coping mechanisms could lead to improvements in secondary outcomes, including decreases in substance use, medication dosage, periods of homelessness, criminal justice involvement, and psychiatric hospitalization.San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 31 Evaluation Overview Learning Goals and Evaluation Questions BHRS devel oped two main learning goals for the NMT evaluation. The first learning goal pertains to the adaptation and implementation of the NMT approach in the adult consumer population, while the second learning goal pertains to the effectiveness and impact of the NMT approach in improving recovery outcomes. To further guide the NMT evaluation, RDA developed evaluation sub -questions associated with each learning goal. The learning goals and evaluation questions (EQ) are listed below. Learning Goal 1: Can NMT, a neu robiology and trauma -informed approach, be adapted in a way that leads to better outcomes in recovery for BHRS adult consumers? EQ 1.1. How is the NMT approach being adapted to serve an adult population? EQ 1.2. Who is being served by the adult NMT project, what types of NMT -based services are consumers receiving, and with what duration and frequency? Learning Goal 2: Are alternative therapeutic and treatment options, focused on changing the brain organization an d function, effective in adult consumers' recovery? EQ 2.1. To what extent is the NMT approach supporting improvement in adult consumers' functional outcomes and overall recovery and wellbeing? EQ 2.2. To what extent is the experience of care with the NMT approach different from consumers' previous care experiences? Evaluation Strategy RDA will implement a mixed methods evaluation that is collaborative and emphasizes continuous quality improvement. Mixed Methods. A mixed methods approach utilizes both qualitative and quantitative data to address the research questions. Utilizing mixed methods allows the evaluator to identify the correlation between program participation and outcomes and also identify the program strengths and challenges from the participants' perspective. This allows program staff to make adjustments to the program in real -time. Collaborative. RDA conceptualizes its role as research partners rather than outside evaluators. In this approach, BHRS sta ff, service recipients, and other invested parties work collaboratively with evaluators to articulate program goals, develop outcome measures, and interpret and respond to evaluation findings. Continuous Program Improvement. RDA will work with BHRS and its stakeholders to build capacity for evaluation and engage in ongoing continuous program improvement. Continuous program improvement San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 32 is a framework by which evaluation is not a one -time event, but an ongoing way of providing data for the program to use to strengthen program design and implementation. Data Collection and Analysis In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of program implementation and impact, BHRS and RDA identified a number of expected measurable outcomes including process outcomes, clinical outcomes, functional and recovery outcomes, and consumers' experience of care. Process outcomes will largely be descriptive, and will include documentation of any training and NMT implementation activities, the number of consumers served, and the types of services provided. Consumer -level outcomes, including clinical, functional, and recovery outcomes, will be evaluated before and during NMT treatment to assess the impact of NMT services. During the first year, the evaluation will focus on collect ing and analyzing process outcomes to assess NMT implementation, as well as collecting individual -level clinical, functional, and recovery baseline data. The second year will focus on measuring progress in NMT implementation and changes in clinical, functi onal, and recovery outcomes from baseline . Throughout both years, RDA will provide technical assistance to BHRS staff implementing the NMT intervention to support their ability to collect client data. BHRS and RDA identified a number of data sources to co llect outcome measures, including NMT metrics, the NMT treatment plan, Avatar electronic health records, the NMT consumer form, and focus groups with NMT providers and with NMT consumers. Table 4 lists the expected measurable outcomes as well as the data sources that will be used to collect each outcome measure. The data sources are described in greater detail below. In addition, Table 6 in Appendix I summarizes the data sources and information that will be used to address each learni ng goal and evaluation question, and Table 7 in Appendix II outlines the specific data requested. Table 4.

RDA will work with CTA and BHRS to obtain NMT Metrics with which to measure clients' functional domain values. NMT metrics will be obtained from consumers' initial NMT brain mapping and at agreed upon intervals thereafter (e.g., every six mont hs). The NMT functional domain values will be used to establish consumers' baseline functioning at service start and documenting any change that occurs over the course of service delivery. To the extent that adult age typical functional domain values are a vailable, RDA will also compare BHRS consumers' functional domain scores to age typical values to assess the degree of impairment and progress toward age typical functioning. NMT Treatment Plan. RDA will work with BHRS to obtain information from consumers' treatment plans at agreed upon intervals. The NMT Treatment Plans include information about the types of treatment or activities that are recommended, treatment received, and any progress notes. This information will be used to assess NMT treatment participation and adherence to the service plan. Avatar Electronic Health Record Data. RDA will work with BHRS to obtain relevant consumer -level information from BHRS' electronic health record (EHR) s ystem, Avatar. Information obtained from the EHR may include client demographic information, clinical diagnoses, BHRS mental health service utilization, and psychiatric hospitalization. EHR Data will be requested for the year prior to NMT enrollment as wel l as during NMT participation to assess any changes in mental health service utilization during NMT treatment. NMT Consumer Form. RDA developed a NMT consumer form to capture additional consumer -level information that is not currently captured or not rea dily extractable from existing data sources. The NMT consumer form includes information regarding consumers' current psychiatric medication, substance use, housing and homelessness, and criminal justice system involvement (e.g., arrests and incarcerations) . NMT providers will administer the consumer form during NMT assessments at agreed upon intervals (e.g., once a month). This information will be used to assess changes in longer -term functional and recovery - oriented outcomes throughout NMT participation (e .g., changes in the frequency or duration of incarcerations or arrests, frequency of substance use, and medication dosage). The NMT consumer form is available in Appendix III. Focus Groups with Providers Trained in NMT . RDA will facilitate focus groups wi th BHRS Adult System of Care staff who were trained in the NMT model. During the first year of the evaluation, these focus groups will explore providers' experiences with the NMT training and initial application of the NMT model, including the quality and applicability of their training in NMT, successes and challenges in adapting the model for adult consumers, and the integration of the brain mapping and other elements of the NMT approach into their existing service delivery processes. During the second ye ar of the evaluation, the focus groups with providers will assess how their experiences using the NMT approach have changed over time, any new successes or challenges that have emerged, and their perceptions of the impact of the NMT San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 34 approach on client well being, including improvements in functional and recovery outcomes. The focus group protocol is available in Appendix IV. Focus Groups with Clients Participating in NMT . During the second year of the evaluation, RDA will facilitate focus groups with adult B HRS clients who have received the NMT -based services. During the first year of the evaluation, the focus groups will ascertain clients' experiences with the NMT approach, how NMT services differ from other mental health services received, and consumers' pe rception of the impact of NMT on their own wellness and recovery. Before beginning the focus groups, the intention of the focus groups will be explained and informed consent will be obtained from all consumers. The focus group protocol is available in Appe ndix IV and the consent form is available in Appendix V. RDA will begin our analysis by organizing and cleaning the NMT and client -level data as well as information from the focus groups. To analyze the quantitative data we will conduct both descriptive and inferential statistics, as approp riate, to describe the outcomes as well as to identify changes over time. To assess process outcomes, descriptive statistics will primarily be used, while pre -post analyses will be used assess changes in cl inical, functional, and recovery outcomes before and during NMT services. Qualitative data will inform both the process and consumer outcomes. To evaluate qualitative data, focus group participants' responses will be transcribed so that participants' resp onses and reactions are appropriately captured. RDA will then thematically analyze responses from participants to identify any recurring themes and key takeaways from the focus groups. RDA will triangulate qualitative findings with quantitative findings to develop a complete picture of the extent to which the NMT goals have been achieved. Reporting On an annual basis, RDA will draft a report that provides a comprehensive understanding of the implementation and impact of the NMT project to date as well as c omply with new MHSA INN regulations. The report will address the learning goals and evaluation questions, including an information about the progress of NMT implementation and related process outcomes, preliminary outcome measures, and recommendations for actionable program improvements. Findings will be shared with relevant BHRS staff through a findings work session prior to drafting the report. This work session will give BHRS staff an opportunity to interpret and respond to findings as well as provide f eedback. Following the work session, RDA will draft the annual report and send it to BHRS for review. RDA will then address and incorporate BHRS feedback, finalize the report, and send it to BHRS for submission to the Mental Health Services Oversight and A ccountability Commission (MHSOAC). The final report will then be available for presentation to the MHSA Steering Committee and the Stakeholder Advisory Committee. San Mateo Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Adult NMT Pilot December 2018 | 35 Timeline The NMT evaluation is a two -year evaluation, beginning in January 2017 and running through December 2018. Table 5 below provides an outline of evaluation activities over t he two year evaluation period, including the organization responsible for conducting each activity (i.e., RDA and/or BHRS). RDA understands that program needs develop and evolve, so RDA will be flexible in adapting the evaluation timeline to align with BHR S needs. RDA will confer with BHRS when creating any modifications to the evaluation timeline.

A special thanks to StarVista and the following individuals from the Health Ambassador Program -Youth Cohort s 1-3 whose participation was invaluable to this effort: Alejandro Andora Andrea Angelica Anne Caitlin Carlos Carolina Chelsea Claire Clara Diego Dylan Ernesto India Jericho Jessica Justin Leslie Luis Madeline Megan Michelle Moises Praise Rheem Sara Sophia Summer Tiffany Your cooperation and energy resulted in the development of this project, the collection of extensive data, and allowed us to prepare this report. The County and the HAP -Y facilitation and evaluation teams deeply admire and appreciate your commitment to the health and wellbeing of youth and young adults in San Mateo County. Figure 1: Graduates from HAP -Y Cohorts 1 - 3 (cont. on following page) San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 5 San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 6 Introduction Project Overview and Learning Goals The Health Ambassador Program -Youth (HAP -Y) is an Innovation (INN) program under the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) that is funded by the San Mateo County Behavioral Health Recovery Services (BHRS) department and implemented by StarVista . The MHSA INN p roject category and primary purpose of the HAP -Y are as follows: MHSA INN Project Category: Makes a change to an existing mental health practice that has not yet been demonstrated to be effective. MHSA Primary Purpose: Increase access to mental health serv ices. Project Innovation: HAP -Y serves as a youth -led initiative where young adults act as mental health ambassadors to promote awareness of mental health, reduce mental health stigma, and increase service access for young people. The HAP -Y Innovation pr oject is the first to offer formal evaluation of a training designed for youth peer educators and its effectiveness and impact on community awareness and stigma, increasing access to mental health services for youth, and addressing systemic changes, as wel l as supporting youth ambassadors' wellness and recovery. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) approved the project on July 28, 2016 , and BHRS contracted with StarVista in December 2016 to begin implementing the program . In 2017 , BHRS contracted Resource Development Associates (RDA) to evaluate HAP -Y. This report provides findings from the second year of HAP -Y implementation (July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018) . This reporting timeframe includ es Cohorts 1 -3 of the HAP -Y program . In accordance with the requirements for MHSA INN programs, BHRS selected three Learning Goals as priorities for the HAP -Y program. Figure 2: HAP -Y Learning Goals Learning Goal 1 To what extent does participating in HAP -Y build the Youth Ambassadors' capacity to serve as mental health advocates? Learning Goal 2 How does HAP -Y increase mental health knowledge and decrease mental health stigma?Learning Goal 3 How does HAP -Y increase youth access to mental health services?San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 7 Project Need Through the MHSA Community Planning Process (CPP) in San Mateo, the need to increase access to services for youth and young adults emerged. Youth and young adults, especially between the ages of 16- 25, commonly experience challenges transitioning into adul thood and are notably underserved in the mental health system. Transition aged youth (TAY) navigat e more adult -like challenges without having yet mastered the tools and cognitive maturity of adulthood .1 Given this, c ommunity members advocated adapting the existing Health Ambassador Program (HAP) , a program created in the County's Office of Diversity and Equity, for youth participants. In the original HAP, a program that is currently operating out of BHRS, adult participants with lived experience completed a curriculum to enhance their skills and knowledge about behavioral health. HAP graduates served as a critical liaison to the County by doing outreach, speaking at panels and community events, and teaching psychoeducational classes. The idea for a youth -focused HAP evolved from the recognition that informed youth could take a more proactive role as leaders in their communities ; promote health, recovery, and wellness with their peers, families, and communities ; and work toward reducing the stigma of mental health and facilitate access to mental health services for youth and young adults . Project Description and Timeline HAP -Y engages, trains, and empowers TAY between the ages of 16 and 24 as Youth Ambassadors to promote awareness of mental health and increas e the likelihood that young people will access needed mental health services. For this project, Youth Ambassadors receive psycho -educational training to build their own mental health knowledge and advocacy skills . Youth Ambassadors then engage in outreach and educational activities with other young people and deliver mental health presentations in the community. StarVista \u2014a non -profit organization that provides counseling, prevention, early intervention, and education resources throughout San Mateo County \u2014is the lead agency of this initiative. For over 30 years, StarVista has offered mental health services and resources to more than 40,000 people from diverse communities throughout San Mateo County . StarVista was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to implement and manage the HAPY project, including the administration, participant recruitment, and data collection aspects of the evaluation plan. HAP -Y Theory of Change As is illustrated in the Theory of Change below, HAP -Y is intended to su pport and influence Youth Ambassadors, youth and community members, and the mental health systems a whole. HAP -Y intends to accomplish this by first training Youth Ambassadors in research and evaluation principles and mental health promotion. The Youth Amb assadors then engage in a series of outreach and educational training activities to promote mental health awareness and reduce stigma with youth, the community, and youth - 1 Wilens, T., Rosenbaum, J. (2013) Transition Aged Youth: A New Frontier in Child and Adol escent Psychiatry. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 52:9. M. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 8 serving adults. As a result of HAP -Y activities, youth increase their access to and p articipation in mental health services and change their attitudes about mental health. The program design expects that an audience of youth would be more likely to access mental health services and resources if receiving the information by a team of their peers. Further, HAP -Y intends to have a lasting change for individuals directly engaging with the program as well as the community -at-large. Figure 3: HAP -Y Theory of Change HAP -Y Program Model StarVista conducts outreach for HAP -Y through schools, counselors, and social media platforms. Youth who show interest in HAP -Y participation are asked to submit an application and go thro ugh a formal interview process conducted by StarVista. StarVista sta ff are responsible for providing traini ng, collaborating with outside agencies to prov ide additional training , and arrang ing and support ing public presentations for Youth Ambassadors. StarVista also provides transportation and stipends for youth to attend the trainings. Throughout the duration of the program, StarVista staff also engage youth to remain involved and attentive in the program. Cohorts are selected based on their interest in availability for the program. Cohorts rec eive 14 weeks of training and have three months following their training to conduct a community presentation. StarVista partners with youth to identify a location and support the training by either co -presenting or providing individual preparation support. See Appendix and B for the HAP -Y youth application and StarVista youth interview protocol. HAP -Y Training Curriculum The following are the trainings StarVista provide s to each HAP -Y Cohort. These trainings includ ed psychoeducation and public speaking. The goal of the trainings is to build youth capacity to: Outreach and speak at panels and community events on mental health, Work with schools and other youth teaching psycho -educational classes, Facilitate discussi ons, and Provide resources to increase access to mental health services. HAP -Y research, evaluation, and health promotion training Youth skill development and knowledge of evaluation and stigma Youth Ambassadors conduct presentations to promote awareness and reduce stigma Resiliency factors communicated to stakeholders to reduce mental health stigma and promote awareness Resiliency factors integrated into the Mental Health System Youth increase access to mental health services San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 9 The HAP -Y Training focuses on topics of wellness and recovery and included learning the signs and risks of suicide, suicide prevention, and information on how to access mental health services. The formal curricul um include s Linking Education and Awareness for Depression and Suicide (LEADS), Question , Persuade , Refer (QPR), Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), and NAMI Family to Family. Outside trainers led the WRAP and Family to Fami ly trainings, and Star Vista leads the LEADS and QPR trainings.2 These programs are described briefly below. Figure 4: Programs in the HAP -Y Training Curriculum StarVista also conducted trainings with all three cohorts on target ed storytelling . These trainings were designed to build youth capacity to conduct outreach , speak at panels and community events on mental health, work with schools and other youth teaching psycho -educational classes, facilitate discussions or focus groups , provide resources to increase access to mental health services, and decrease stigma through lived -experience presentations. During the orientation and program close of every Cohort, RDA trained Youth Ambassadors on evaluation, data collection tools, and interpreting audience survey results. See Appendix C: Cohort 2& 3 Training Schedule for the Cohort 2 & 3 Training Schedule. 2 StarVista provided Cohort 1 with a training in Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA), but replaced this training with LEADS for Cohort 2 and all subsequent cohorts. YMHFA is a training for adul t relatives, educators, and service providers; whereas LEADS is more appropriate for peer youth mental health education. NAMI Family to Family is a 12 session educational program for family and friends of people living with mental illness. It is a designated evidence -based program. Research shows that the program significantly improves the coping and problem -solving abilities of the people closest to an individual living with a mental health condition. NAMI Family to Family is taught by NAMI -trained family member.Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) is a self-designed prevention and wellness process that anyone can use to get well, stay well and make their life the way they want it to be. It is used extensively by people in all kinds of circumstances, and by health care and mental health systems all over the world to address all kind of physical mental health and life issues. WRAP is listed in the National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices. Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) is an approach to confronting someone about their possible thoughts of suicide. It is not intended to be a form of counseling or treatment, instead a means to offer hope through positive action. The three steps include: (1) Question the person about suicide (2) Persuade the person to get help (3) Refer the person to helpLinking Education and Awareness for Depression and Suicide (LEADS) is an informative and interactive curriculum designed to link schools and educators to conversations about suicide and depression. LEADS is set up so that the youth are able to brainstorm and interact with each other. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 10 Implementation Timeline Figure 5 illustrates the key activities that the HAP -Y program has undertaken for Cohorts 1 -3 of the program. Figure 5. HAP -Y Implementation Timeline Evaluation Overview BHRS contracted Resource Development Associates (RDA) to carry out the evaluation of HAP -Y implementation and outcomes. In order to maximize RDA's role as research partners and fulfill MHSA Innovation evaluation principles, this evaluation uses a participa tory action research (PAR) framework. During the first year of the program, Youth Ambassadors worked to create the HAP -Y evaluation plan, which included developing and refining the evaluation questions based on the INN learning goals as well as developing and finalizing the data collection tools. Subsequent Youth Ambassadors participated in activities to build their capacity to understand evaluation and data collection approaches learn about the historical context of the role of evaluation at the state, and the impact that research plays in policy at the local level. Youth Ambassadors also learned about their and RDA's roles in the evaluation, quantitative and qualitative data collection tools and strategies, and the importance of being active members of the evaluation design and process. The purpose of the HAP -Y evaluation is to help BHRS measure the impact of the program , support data - driven decisions throughout implementation , and increase knowledge about what works in mental health and youth -specific ment al health programs. In terms of program impact , the evaluation focuses on the following domains : 1) Changes in leadership capacity and resiliency of the young people ; 2) Changes in youth's knowledge and level of stigma related to mental health ; and 3) Changes in access to services for youth . DEC 2016 -MAY 2017 StarVista creates training program and secures facilitators; develops recruitment materials; interviews and recruits Cohort 1 MAY -JUL 2017 HAP -Y launches; Cohort 1 trained SEPT -DEC 2017 Cohort 2 trained MAR -JUN 2018 Cohort 3 presentations, Cohort 4 recruited/trained JUL-AUG 2017 Cohort 1 presentations; Cohort 2 recruited DEC '17-MAR ' 18 Cohort 2 presentations; Cohort 3 recruited/trained YEAR TWO (July '1 7 - June '1 8) START -UP & YEAR ONE ( Dec '16 - June '17) San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 11 Evaluation Methods RDA developed a mixed -methods evaluation to respond to the INN learning goals listed above. The PAR evaluation design seeks to engage Youth Ambassadors with the hope that their lived experiences, both as y outh and as persons with mental health challenges, may provide a unique perspective on how to better serve and increase youth access to mental health services . A mixed methods approach allows the evaluation to track quantitative measures of impact from the educational presentations, while also gathering qualitative input on how and why activities and outcomes occurred. Using multiple sources to explore the evaluation questions also enables comparison and corroboration of findings across the data sources. The process evaluation component explores the extent to which HAP -Y has been implemented as planned and the strengths and challenges the county has experienced in implementation from the perspective of key staff and youth ambassadors. This exploration enables BHRS and StarVista to make real -time adjustments that may improve program delivery. The outcome evaluation component assesses how HAP -Y\u2014through its community educational presentations \u2014produces changes in access to services and in youth -ambassador health outcomes. Data Collection In line with RDA's participatory , mixed methods approach to evaluation, the evaluation includes quantitative and qualitative tools to measure process and outcome indicators in the three evaluation domains : building youth capacity, mental health stigma, and access to services. Below are the data collection methods used to explore the evaluation domains . Demographic Reporting Understanding the demographic background of the Youth Ambassadors provides an understanding of who is being served by the HAP -Y program. The demographic form was designed to capture all elements required by the MHSOAC and is completed by the Youth Ambassadors. The forms als o include additional categories to the items about sexual orientation and gender identity in order to be inclusive of the diversity of LGBTQ+ identities. The revision of the response options for the items on sexual orientation and gender identity were alig ned with BHRS's initiative to revise Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) questions on health intake forms. RDA developed an online format using a HIPAA -compliant version of Survey Gizmo for StarVista staff to enter for new cohorts. HAP -Y Self -Determination Survey RDA developed the self -determination for youth to take prior to program start and after program completion. This survey measures leadership skills and building youth capacity prior to program start, and then after the presentations are completed . Due to small and inconsistent sample size, we cannot use the survey data in this report. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 12 Audience Survey To document the impact of these public mental health presentations on a you th audience, Youth Ambassadors and RDA developed and implemented an audience survey that uses a pre/post mechanism to measure audience attitude changes throughout the presentation specifically around access to resources and mental health stigma. The audien ce survey includes an additional indicator for access to mental health services; there is an option in the survey for youth to request a follow up from StarVista regarding mental health services. Focus Group s with Youth Ambassadors RDA conducted pre and post focus groups with Youth Ambassadors to enable the evaluation team to gather in -depth information from youth implementing HAP -Y. The evaluation team developed a focus group guide to learn from Youth Ambassadors about what is working well and what is c hallenging about implementation and any suggestions for improvement. The pre -focus group protocol discusses internal stigma, program goals, and participant hopes. The post -focus group discusses program implementation, presentation experiences, and stigma. In Year 2, RDA held five focus groups: pre- and post - focus groups with Cohorts 1 and 2, and a pre-focus group with Cohort 2. Despite many attempts and outreach, we were unable to collect post -focus group data from Cohort 2 . Interviews with StarVista Staff RDA conducted interview s with StarVista program staff to gather perceptions from program staff about the HAP -Y implementation and outcomes . To facilitate the interview, RDA shared results of the focus groups and audience su rveys as a starting point for validating and/or adding to the data gathered up to that point. Please see Appendi ces D, E, F, and G for the tools listed above. Limitations to Methodology and Data Collection With any evaluation, there can be limitations to methodology and data collection; below are some of the categories where the RDA evaluation team faced limitations evaluating HAP -Y. Measuring Access to Services During the evaluation design process , the RDA evaluation team hoped to measure the StarVist a crisis call data base to determine if after a HAP -Y presentation there was an increase in phone calls ; however, there this is no valid mechanism that can confirm if StarVista crisis calls are due a HAP -Y presentation. RDA used qualitative information rep orted by Youth Ambassadors to understand their perspective on how their presentations might have increased access to mental health services. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 13 Measuring Audience Stigma Upon review of the survey data, the RDA evaluation team noted that following the HAP -Y presentation, audience members were slightly more likely to feel uncomfortable discussing mental health challenges and to indicate a perception that people with mental h ealth challenges were unstable . It is possible that the design of the survey itself accounts for some of these unexpected results. For most of the survey questions, a higher score on the Likert scale would indicate a positive response to the presentation . However, for these two questions, a lower score on the scale would indicate a positive response. In other words, there is a chance that the different wording for these two questions misdirected some audience members to indicate that they felt more stigma a round discussing mental health issues, when they meant to mark otherwise. In response to this limitation, RDA explored the open -ended responses to the audience survey in order to gauge audience members' perceptions of persons with mental health challenges and their comfort in discussing mental health issues. Completing Post -Program Data Collection Despite several efforts by StarVist a and RDA (e.g. targeted outreach and financial incentives to engage) , the RDA evaluation team was unable to reach Cohort 2 for post data collection. The program period for Cohort 2 ended in the summer, and many of the youth graduated and left the area, which made it difficult for them to engage in follow -up activities. Data Analysis To analyze the quantitative data from audience surveys , RDA examined frequencies and ranges. To analyze qualitative data, RDA transcribed focus group and interview participants' responses to appropriately capture the responses and reactions of participants. RDA thematically analyzed responses from participants to identify commonalities and differences in participant experiences. RDA then triangulated qualitative findings with quantitative findings to develop a complete picture of the extent to which the HAP -Y program goals have been achieved. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 14 Implementation Update Changes to Innovation Project during Reporting Period There were no changes to the HAP -Y MHSA Innovation pro ject during FY2017 -18. Key Accomplishments During FY2017 -18, HAP -Y Youth Ambassadors successfully completed t heir presentations and reached large audiences. Of the 31 participants who graduated from the HAP -Y training program, 28 completed presentations at sites across San Mateo County. In an effort to reach more of their peers, these Youth Ambassadors mostly foc used their outreach efforts to their respective schools . From July 2017 through June 2018, Y outh Ambassadors conducted 64 presentations across San Mateo County , which reached a total of 1,474 unique individuals. Table 1: Number of HAP -Y Participants and Audience Members per HAP -Y Cohort Cohort Number of HAP -Y Participants Participants who Completed Presentations Number of Presentations Number of Audience Members 1 11 9 9 287 2 10 9 23 365 3 13* 10 32 822 Total 34 28 64 1,474 *10 graduates Notably, the total number of community members whom the Youth Ambassadors reached is even higher , as some of the Youth Ambassadors from all three cohorts participated in other forms of community engagement, such as speaking on mental health p anels or conducting other forms of peer outreach. However, these community engagements did not involve an audience survey, so StarVista was not able to capture a total count of people whom the Youth Ambassadors engaged. StarVista staff ensured that HAP -Y would cover the entirety of San Mateo County, to ensure youth participation from geographically and demographically diverse communities. For one, StarVista gathered students from across the county to serve as Youth Ambassadors, with a priority of recruiting youth of color who had lived experiences with mental health challenges . Furthermore, the Ambassadors conducted presentations across San Mateo County to reach a broad population of youth audiences. As mentioned above, most of the presentations conducted we re at high schools, but some HAP -Y participants also conducted presentations at non -profit organizations and colleges. See Table 2, on the following page, for the full list of presentation sites and cities.

The Youth Mental Health First Aid training was replaced with LEADS, Linking Education and Awareness for Depression and Suicide (LEADS) , because it is designed for youth , unlike Youth Mental Health First Aid which is for adults serving youth. LEADS is an informative and interactive curriculum designed to link schools and educators to conversations about suicide and d epression. The LEADS training introduces terms used throughout the 14 weeks of HAP -Y, and is set up so that the youth are able to brainstorm and interact with each other before diving into definitions and examples. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 16 Consumer Population Served HAP -Y Cohorts 1 -3 Demographics The RDA evaluation team collected demographic information from each of the three HAP -Y cohorts that were active during Year 2 .3 A total of 3 4 individuals participated in trainings for Cohorts 1 through 3: 1 1 in Cohort 1, 10 in Cohort 2, and 13 in Cohort 3.4 Across all three cohorts, the majority of participants ( 68%) in the Ambassador program were high school students. A majority ( 59%) identified as cisgender women, and about three -quarters of participants (7 1%) identified as heterosexual or straight. Most Ambassadors were people of color (85%), with half of all participants identifying as Latinx, and about one -quarter identifying as Asian. The most common ethnicity reported was Chicanx or Mexican (3 5% of all participants). 3 Note on reporting: To comply with HIPAA requirements and protect the confidentiality of participating individuals, the tables below o nly present data for response categories with at least five responses. Where fewer than five responses were received, some categories have been combined. 4 As mentioned earlier, 31 of the 34 participants graduated from the HAP -Y training, and 28 of the 31 graduates participated in the peer mental health presentations. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 17 Table 3, on the following page, includes a summary of the demographic data from all three cohorts. The makeup of the HAP -Y cohorts reflected StarVista's emphasis on recruiting and trai ning Ambassadors of color \u2014particularly Latinx students \u2014to reach more students of color across the county. Relative to the population of San Mateo County as a whole, HAP -Y participants included a higher proportion of Latino/a/x participants (5 0% of particip ants, vs. 25% of all county residents or 33% of county youth) and a slightly lower proportion of white participants (fewer than 30% of participants, vs. 41% of all county residents or 34% of county youth). The percentage of Asian and Asian American partici pants (2 6%) was consistent with San Mateo County's demographics: 27% of all county residents or 22% of county youth.5 5 Sources: County of San Mateo, County of San Mateo 2015 - 2017 Profile, <<https://www.sm cgov.org/sites/smcgov.org/files/documents/files/County_Profile_2015_17.pdf >>; <<https://www.kidsdata.org/region/4/san -mateo - county/results >> San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 18 Table 3: HAP -Y Participants' Demographic Background, Cohorts 1 through 3 (n=3 4) Age: All HAP -Y participants were between the ages of 16 and 24 at the time of reporting. Most participants were on the lower end of this age range, as the majority of participants were still enrolled in high school. Language: Nearly all HAP -Y participants reported that English is the primary language spoken in their households. Race: The majority of HAP -Y participants in Cohorts 1 -3 (85%) identif ied as nonwhite , with half of participants (5 0%) identifying as Latina/o/x . About one -fourth (2 6%) of participants were Asian or Asian America n. Other responses included white, black, and another racial identity. Ethnicity: Slightly over one -third of participants (35%) identif ied as Mexican, Mexican American, or Chicana/o/x. Eighteen percent of respondents identif ied as Central American, which included Nicaraguan and Salvadoran. The Asian American participants, who comprised the next largest ethnic groups, identif ied as either Chinese American or Filipina/o. Other responses included Middle Eastern, African, and European. Sex: The majority of part icipants ( 68%) reported their assigned sex at birth as female, and the remaining participants reported their assigned sex at birth as male or declined to answer. Gender Identity: The majority of participants (59%) identif ied as cisgender women , and 21% identified as cisgender men. The remaining participants either reported another gender identity or declined to answer. Sexual Orientation: Just under three -fourths of HAP -Y participants (7 1%) identif ied as straight or heterosexual. The remaining participants identified with another sexual orientation (gay/lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, questioning or unsure) or declined to answer.

Veteran Status: No respondents reported being a veteran; all participants e ither stated that they were not a veteran or declined to answer the question. San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 19 Progress Toward Learning Goals This section discusses key evaluation findings across the first three HAP -Y cohorts according to the three identified learning goals of building youth capacity, increasing mental health knowledge and decreasing mental health stigma, and increasing access to mental health services. This section includes information gathered from the pre - and post -focus groups with Youth Ambassadors, Key Informant Interviews with StarVista, and the Audience Survey administered at the educational presentations. Summary of Key Findings Leadership Development : HAP -Y Ambassadors developed civic leadership and public speaking skills through preparing and leading their peer presentations, gaining and disseminating knowledge about mental health issues and resources. Personal Empowerment: Participation in HAP -Y helped several ambassadors learn skills to better take care of their own mental health, to connect friends and family to resources, and to confront the stigma around mental health in their own families.Learning Goal 1: Building Youth Capacity Information on Accessible Resources: The HAP -Y presentations increased audience members' knowledge about where to access mental health care resources, including resources available on evenings and weekends. Relatable and Engaging Presentations: The presenters' personable styles and well - organized information helped many audience members reduce their stigma around discussing the topic of mental health issues. Ongoing Challenges of Stigma: Audience members were more likely to report that they knew how and where to get mental health services than being comfortable seeking services . This might point to the persistence of stigma as a barrier to accessing mental health resources.Learning Goal 2: Increasing Mental Health Knowledge and Decreasing Stigma Audiences Informed How to Take Action: Many audience members noted that the presentation prepared them to seek mental health care for themselves, or to help connect family and friends to mental health care. Audience Members Requested Care: Over 40 audience members utilized the presentations to request follow -up mental health resources thorugh StarVista.Learning Goal 3: Increasing Youth Access to Mental Health ServicesSan Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 20 Learning Goal 1: Building Youth Capacity Leadership Development and Personal Empowerment HAP -Y Ambassadors gained a breadth of skills through their participation, both growing as civic leaders and learning how to better help the mselves and their loved ones with mental health challenges . When HAP -Y Ambassadors were asked to reflect on why they joined the program, youth shared that the motivating factors to join HAP -Y included: Developing skills to lead their own support groups ; Building their overall confidence and improving social skills ; and Strengthening their education around mental health for their future career paths . Many youth ambassadors shared that because of their own lived experience and family experience with mental health challenges , they wanted to be better equipped at helping young people in their community navigate resources. Other youth shared that their friends would often approach them with serious issues, and they did not always have the skills or know the resources to help them. According to HAP -Y demographic data, (52%) of the Youth Ambassadors identify as Latina/o/x. During focus groups across cohorts, many of these youth shared the desire to decrease stigma and shame from their communities. One youth described their intention of joining the program to help educate their family members who expressed fear and stigma about menta l health, because of their family dynamics. At the end of the program, Youth Ambassadors reported having a very positive experience. Many felt that through the course of their time in the program they had developed leadership and communication skills that would help them in the future. Public speaki ng and meeting new people came up across several focus groups as a value added to their everyday lives. In particular, youth felt their involvement in presenting to their peer audiences around mental health was very powerful for their own mental health. Yo uth also reported having personal growth and more connectedness with others because of program involvement. Youth especially appreciated having the opportunity to meet frequently and get to know one another through the group exercises facilitated by StarVi sta. Further, many youth believed I'm Mexican, and in my community mental illness is seen as weak. In my family, both sides have a history of mental illness, anxiety, and depression. One side of my family wants to talk about it, and the other side feels it is shameful and does not talk about it. -HAP -Y Youth Ambassador I joined HAP -Y because I myself suffer from mental health issues. When I was first starting to suffer, I had friends who didn't really know what to do. So I want to be the friend who knows what to do, and who helps out and opens up the conversation about mental health . -HAP -Y Youth Ambassador San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 21 that the learning about their own wellness and mental health coping strategies was a large benefit of the program. StarVista staff reported continuous growth and development of Youth Ambassadors . Staff observed many youths ' desire to stay connected to the field of mental health and recounted examples of HAP -Y youth becoming active advocates in their community. For example, one of the graduates from Cohort 1 is now working as a Case Manager at StarVista. A graduate from C ohort 3 successfully completed the 40 -hour WRAP facilitator training and is now co-facilitating WRAP workshops with the HAP -Y Program Coordinator for Cohort 4. Another youth from C ohort 3 is currently working on a podcast where they speak about their own experience of living with a mental health condit ion and hope s to also crea te a short documentary where members of the Latino community are able to speak about mental health and what mental health means in that community. Another youth participated in promoting the county's Tech Suite Innovation project by making a video advocati ng for the services this funding would provide in their community. Learning Goal 2: Increasing Mental Health Knowledge and Decreasing Mental Health Stigma As described in the Implementation Update section above, during FY2 017-18, 28 participants from the first three HAP -Y cohorts conducted peer mental health education presentations to a total of 1,474 audience members across San Mateo Count y. These peer education presentations were tailored to both components of Learning Goal 2: increasing knowledge about mental health issues and resources and reduc ing stigma that audience members might feel surrounding mental health (including discussing mental health issues, seeking help themselves, or helping to connect others to mental health reso urces ). HAP -Y participants presented their audiences with fundamental knowledge about depression and suicidal ideation, demonstrated techniques in how to engage friends and family about mental health, and provided some concrete resources for audience membe rs to use or pass along, such as a youth -led suicide prevention online chatroom. Moreover, the youth -led peer education model helps to reduce audience members' stigma by empowering youth to: normalize open dialogue about mental health, encourage their peer s that seeking help is not shameful, and model best practices of sharing information and resources with their communities. Findings from the HAP -Y audience survey results are presented in Figure 6, which shows the percentage of audience members that reported that the survey I found the topic of mental health and wellness, and what we need to do individually in order to keep us well, was really helpful to me personally. -HAP -Y Youth Ambassador [The presentation] informed me on the fact that I can get help. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 1 I learned that depression was treatable, [and]...ways to cope with and treat stress and mental illnesses. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 3 San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 22 items were true for them \"most of the time\" or \"all of the time .\" Overall , audience members reported that the HAP -Y presentations were largely succ essful in enhancing their knowledge about mental health issues and resources. However, results indicate that many audience members may still exhibit some degree of stigma around talking about mental health or seeking help for mental health issues. Informa tion on Accessible Resources HAP -Y presenters successfully increased audience members' knowledge of where and how to access mental health services. Following the presentations, the vast majority of audience members (89%) indicated that they always or mostly knew that they had the ability to access mental health services if needed; compared to 66% of the audience beforehand. There was a similar rise i n the percentage of audience members who always or mostly knew where to access services if they were emotionally struggling, from 73% to 94%. Individual write -in survey responses indicated that the presenters had assured that mental health challenges were treatable, and that audience members could seek help in times of need. Figure 6: Percentage of Audience Members That Reported \" All of the Time \" or \" Most of the Time \" Before and After HAP -Y Presentations, for HAP -Y Cohorts 1 through 3 (n=1,474) Relatable and Engaging Presentations The HAP -Y participants' well -structured, informative presentations and personable presentation styles led to audience members' high levels of satisfaction and helped to reduce some audience members' stigm a around discussing mental health. Over three -quarters of audience members (77%) indicated that they found the presentation useful, compared to only 12% of audience members who did not where to go to get support if I am emotionally struggling.I know who to call or access online if I need mental health services.I can get services that I need.I know of services that are available evenings and weekends.I feel comfortable seeking mental health services.I'm uncomfortable discussing topics related to mental health challenges.I think people with mental health challenges are unstable.Percentage of Audience Members Answering \"Always\" or \"Mostly\" Before Presentation After PresentationSan Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 23 presentation useful. Moreover, audience members rated both the presentation and presenters with an average of approximately 4 out of 5, indicating high levels of approval. When prompted to explain why they found the presentation useful, several audience members commented that the presentations emphasized the importance of the presentation topics, addressed misinformation around mental health, and presented difficult issues in a forthright manner. In doing so, the presentation materials helped to reduce audience members' stigma in considering and discussing the topic of mental health. Similarly, individual survey responses praised the HAP -Y presenters for helping to reduce the stigma around discussing mental health issues and making the audience feel more comfortable with difficult subject matters. Some comments highlighted how some presenters had made the presentation more accessible by sharing their personal experiences with mental health care. Ongoing Challenges of Stigma While HAP -Y presenters reduced audience members' stigma around mental health issues, stigma may still serve as a barrier to seeking mental health services. Following the presentation an additional 21% of respondents indicated that th ey always or mostly felt comfortable seeking mental health services, an increase from 48% to 69% of the audience. Some individual write -in survey responses, which asked audience members what they had found most useful, also highlighted the presenters' effo rts to destigmatize mental health issues. Several audience members praised the presenters for assuring those with mental health issues that they were not alone in their struggles. Other respondents, who had not themselves experienced mental health challeng es, indicated that the presentation had informed them on how stigma can deter people from talking about their mental health issues. In other words, the HAP -Y presentations helped challenge the stigma that audience members might feel in accessing mental hea lth services, and to better understand the stigma that people who face mental health challenges might feel in sharing their experiences. While the above results are positive, it is also notable that the proportion of participants who said they knew how and where to access mental health care services was higher than the proportion who said they would feel comfortable seeking mental health services . This discrepancy might be interpreted in two ways: one, it might suggest that while knowledge of mental health resources was quite high after the presentation, stigma around mental health remains a barrier to seeking mental health services. Alternatively, it is possible that audience members who did not feel they needed mental health services responded that they wo uld not feel comfortable seeking services. I feel reassured knowing that getting anxiety is normal. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 1 [The presentation s]howed me that stigma is just a thing we can all change to prevent suicide. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 2 [The presentation] helped me understand why people don't want to say anything about depression. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 3 San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 24 When comparing their knowledge and attitudes before and after the presentation, a slightly higher proportion of audience members said that after the presentation they feel uncomfortable d iscussing mental health challenges; and think that people with mental health challenges were unstable. These results are counterintuitive, as the HAP -Y presentation encourages open dialogue about mental health and seeks to destigmatize people with mental h ealth challenges. As mentioned in the methodology limitations section above, one possible explanation for these results is the design of the survey itself. However, it is important to consider alternative explanations why audience members might feel more uncomfortable in discussing mental health challenges or believe people with mental health challenges are unstable following the presentation. Many audience members who otherwise expressed approval of the presentation indicated their desire to know more abou t topics that the presentation had briefly covered, such as depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues, as well as more specific advice on how to engage peers who are suicidal. Some audience members suggested that the presenters slow down their de livery, and/or contain fewer words on each PowerPoint slide, so that the audience had more time to absorb the key points from the presentation. In this sense, it is possible that the introductory information provided in the HAP -Y presentations made respond ents feel less comfortable in speaking on more complex topics than what was provided in the presentation itself. Learning Goal 3: Increas ing Youth Access to Mental Health Services As mentioned earlier, while HAP -Y does not directly connect San Mateo County youth to mental health services, the program's theory of change offers that the peer education model will increase the likelihood that audience members access mental health services when needed or help others in their social circles connect to menta l health services. That is, presenting youth audiences with concrete mental health resources, providing resources for youth to engage with their family and friends, and reducing audience members' stigma around mental health care all help to create a wider network of young people who are cognizant of and comfortable with the resources available to them. In addition to survey questions about knowledge of available resources , the Youth Ambassadors who helped to design the audience survey included a question t hat allows respondents to indicate whether they are in need of mental health support, and whether they would like a follow -up contact to be connected to services . That way, the peer education presentations could also directly connect youth with acute issue s to needed services. Findings from the HAP -Y audience survey results are presented below. [The presenter was] very well spoken, was very educational and [did a] very good job of making a sensitive topic easy to talk about. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 2 [The presentation was] easier to understand for it was a student [who had experience with mental health care] sharing with everyone. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 2 [The presentation] was...straightforward which is really helpful as opposed to conversations that try not to directly address the taboo subjects. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 3 San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 25 Audiences Informed How to Take Action HAP -Y presenters were successful in raising audience members' awareness of specific mental health resources, including phone and web -based services, as well as services available on evenings and weekends. The audience survey responses discussed in Learning Goal 2 demonstrated increases in all of the survey questions regarding audience members' knowledge of available resources. Individual write -in survey responses cited c oncrete resources that the presenters had introduced, such as a peer online chatroom for teenagers and suicide prevention hotlines. These parts of the HAP -Y presentations likely account for the substantial increase in audience members' knowledge of particu lar available resources. Many audience members indicated that, following the presentation, they were more equipped to seek mental health care for themselves or to help family and friends with mental health challenges. When prompted to write why they had found the presentation useful, several individual audience members remarked that they could use their newly acquired knowledge to connect themselves or others to mental health services if necessary. Many audience member s noted that they had experienced anxiety or depression before, and the presentation had helped them to feel more comfortable in seeking help in the future. Other audience members noted that they could better help friends or family members who had experien ced mental health challenges. Youth Ambassadors shared that they were approached after presentations about resources and continued to connect their peers with mental health resources long after the presentations were completed. Audience Members Requested C are Three percent of audience members indicated that they were experiencing a mental health problem and requested individual follow -up support. The audience survey included an option for respondents to write down their contact information if they wanted St arVista to follow up with additional mental health resources. Forty -five audience members opted to include their personal information to receive support in accessing mental health care. It was great to hear of a chat room run by teens. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 1 [The presentation] gave me better ways to call suicide hotlines. - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 3 I have a friend that has depression. It is nice to know what to do/say if she starts acting suicidal . - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 2 I found resources to help get used to talking about my problems . - Audience member for HAP -Y Cohort 3 San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 26 Implementation Lessons During the second year of HAP -Y implementatio n, StarVista, Youth Ambassadors , and the RDA Evaluation team gleaned learnings, and this section provides a discussion of implementation lessons learned. Trainings What worked? Youth Ambassadors high lighted the importance of learning about different mental health symptoms and diagnoses, strategies to both identify and intervene when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis and building their own coping mechanisms as key training topics that shou ld remain. In terms of training modality, Youth Ambassadors liked the opportunity to connect with their peers and engage in activities around their own mental health and coping strategies. Participants appreciated a ctivities focused on group cohesion and youth devel opment where youth partnered with each other and did work. Youth also appreciated the mentoring and support given by StarVista staff, and the continued engagement after they completed the program. What could improve? Youth Ambassadors strongl y preferred activity -based learning to the lecture style of some of the trainings like NAMI. In particular, youth felt the materials from NAMI training were outdated and difficult to engage. Participants recommended making these trainings more interactive and discussion based. Presentations What worked? According to the youth ambassadors, many of their audience members described the presentation as \"eye opening.\" Youth shared that many of their peers had some knowledge about mental health, but did know specific resources or how to approach someone in a me ntal health crisis. Many participants shared that they received the most positive feedback around suicide prevention language and approaches from their peers. Additionally, several youth said they felt very prepared to talk about the prevalence of mental illness and suicide because of their QPR training. I felt that teaching us and training us in a group gives us knowledge and answers a lot of questions. [Mental health] is a big topic in today's society among high school students and now we are able to inform a lot of these topics and answer questions they are afraid to ask. -HAP -Y Youth Ambassador San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 27 What could improve? Across focus groups, Youth Ambassadors shared that they both wanted more opportunity to prepare for their presentations and would also like for the presentations to integrate their per spectives. Specifically, Cohorts wanted to practice presentations, refine their delivery and presentation style, and develop interactive elements with their audiences. Several youth suggested replacing one of the current NAMI trainings with additional time to prepare for the educational presentations. Participants also wanted talking points on mental health language and shared that they want to be approachable when talking to community members yet also clearly demonstrate their knowledge. Currently, youth are presenting a PowerPoint designed by StarVista Staff ; some Youth Ambassadors appreciated having the materials developed in advance, but others wanted more of role in the development of materials to have more ownership of the presentation and select information that would speak most to their peers. Several youth called out the importance of their WRAP training and wan ted to integrate th at training into their presentations, specifically to share coping strategies and how to approach triggers. Additionally, some youth suggested tailoring the presentations for younger audiences to smaller group settings, because their you nger audience s seemed intimidated to ask questions in a large group. Evaluation What worked? StarVista and youth reported that the evaluation activities were engaging and informative, and generally helped their understanding and connection to their proj ect design. RDA provided opportunities for youth to review data from previous cohorts and discuss the findings to help make the project more concrete. What could be improved? StarVista staff and RDA faced challenges trying to meet with Cohort 2 to collec t post -group data. Many of this particular Cohort had completed the program and were no t responsive to data collection engagement efforts. StarVista and RDA partnered to determine how to alleviate this in the future, and now will include data collection as part of the program to ensure better participation as well as other options like surveys and phone calls. Because of some of these challenges engaging youth in data collection, the findings from the youth - self-determination survey could not be analyzed d ue to low numbers that could skew results. Future Cohorts will have less intensive data collection activities that don't rely on completion from all participants for analysis. In addition to challenges to post data collection, the audience survey may not You have to be approachable to talk about something really serious and be empathetic about someone's crisis and you need to make a quick impression that you know what you are talking about... it's a lot of information. It would have been he lpful to have a little more structure in the information to give out to a group of people. -HAP -Y Youth Ambassador San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services MHSA Innovation Evaluation - Health Ambassador Program -Youth December 21, 2018 | 28 have not accurately reflect youth's attitude towards stigma and may need to be revised for future audiences. Conclusion Overall, Year 2 of HAP -Y successfully engaged stakeholders across the county and provided them with education on mental health as well as resources . While the program may benefit from new strategies to better measure access and accurately determine if stigma was reduced, the program did achieve its goal of building youth capacity and reaching mostly youth audienc es. In Year 3 of the HAP -Y program, StarVista will recruit new youth to participate as Cohort s 5 and 6. Youth Ambassadors will continue to receive psychoeducation training and conduct public education presentations. StarVista is also hoping to re -engage past Cohorts annually and have them all get to know each other and continue to incorporate the lessons learned from the first year s of the program into the final year.

The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission says Innovation, \"provides the opportunity to develop & test new, unproven mental health models that have the potential to become tomorrow 's best practices. \" This is important because it helps us remember that innovation is not intended to be a proven solution. There will be learn- ing, there will be challenges, and there will be problem solving. Read more about Innovation projects in the MHSOAC 's Regulations . Innovative digital applications for smartphones and other mobile devices have great potential. Apps empower consumers by engaging them as full partners in their behav- ioral health care, supporting self -care, and offering access to people who face barriers in working with a face -to-face provider. The Help@Hand project is trying to discover if technology fits within the Behavioral Health System of Care. And if so, how? Technology has many benefits, but there are also many challenges and questions. The project may discover technology does not work well within the Behavioral Health System of Care. If technology fits, it will be an incredible change in a positive direction. Help@Hand is a collaborative project with 14 city and county behavioral health depart- ments working together. This means Help@Hand is not one project, but many pro- jects across multiple cities and counties. This collaboration is innovative but working to- gether to implement something that has not been done before is innovative and requires creative solutions. California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA) Goals By December 2019, we hope Help@Hand will pilot up to five (5) technology apps. By June 30th we hope to have 8 - 12 apps available for use by cities and counties. We anticipate having at least one app in each of the 14 city/county members. Innovation is not limited to technology. Help@Hand is also innovative in it 's commit- ment to have Peers and Stakeholder involve- ment throughout the project. This means the communities served by the project also have a voice in how this project develops and is implemented. The audience for this project varies. Each of the 14 cities and counties is trying to reach unserved and underserved populations within their community, including Transitional Age Youth (TAY), monolingual communities, LGBTQ+, older adults and isolated adults.

At that time, it was known as the Innovation Tech Suite. Since that time, other cities and counties have joined the project. One of the key learnings from this project has been that launching the technology is only a small part of the work. There is a great deal of change and preparation that needs to occur to allow the launches to be successful. Listed below are some of the many accomplishments the collaborative has achieved so far by working together. Modoc & Orange counties approved to join project Apr 2018 7 Cups soft launch in Modoc, Kern and Orange counties Aug 2018 Cohort 2 (10 new cities and counties) added Mindstrong launched in Modoc Sep 2018 Conducted SoCal Peer Summit May 2019 Launched 2nd RFSQ Sep 2019 Nov 2018 Statewide Peer Manager hired 4 Help@Hand Stakeholder Report Frequently Asked Questions Twelve (12) counties and two (2) cities across California have joined together to learn and im- plement innovative technologies as a team. Cities/counties can join the project by submitting a proposal to the OAC*. Once approved, they enter the collaborative by contracting with CalMHSA*. Participation may change over time based on the counties that engage with the collaborative. For example, Inyo is transitioning out of the collaborative due to internal resource capacity. We have heard from other counties who may be interested in joining the collaborative. Some decisions are made individually by the cities and counties. Some decisions are made overall by the collaborative. Last Updated 9/30/2019 The Collaborative Help@Hand is delighted to have so many supporters eager to engage with and learn from the pro- ject. Stakeholders have asked the project many excellent questions on a wide range of topics. The topics have been captured here along with key points to help keep Stakeholders informed about the progress. Terms with an asterisk (*) can be found in the glossary at the end of the report. These technology tools are not intended to meet the needs of every consumer every time. We are always focused on protecting the people who are using these tools. Help@Hand is about person -centered care. Each individual should decide if they want to use the apps or not. We support their right to make that decision. This project looks at three areas of technology: 24/7 Peer Chat, Digital Therapy Avatar* (Interact with a chatbot or avatar for support), and Digital Phenotyping* (monitor wellbeing from passive data collected from digital devices, like a smartphone, to provide a user and clinician with feed- back). The initial technology selected followed a procurement process: 1) Request for Statement of Qualifications. RFSQ is a process for technology companies to submit a proposal to Help@Hand. The original RFSQ was released in December 2018. 2) In January 2019 candidates were interviewed. 3) All those who passed were added to \"the bench\" for county selection. 4) Counties selected desired apps. To introduce more technology options to the project, an updated RFSQ was launched on Sep- tember 11, 2019. The RFSQ will remain open through October 7, 2019. New technology is ex- pected to be available for cities and counties to pilot by mid -November. Products 5 Help@Hand Stakeholder Report Frequently Asked Questions Last Updated 9/30/2019 Safety Help@Hand is funded by MHSA dollars through California 's Proposition 63. As noted in their publicly available MHSA plans, cities and counties allocate funds toward the Help@Hand project. The funds are administered by CalMHSA on behalf of the collaborative. This project is funded by county contributions based on their approved OAC Innovation plan. This includes funds for overall project activities such as project management, marketing, imple- mentation readiness, organizational change preparation and testing. There are also local funds for marketing, implementation, technology configuration, licensing and training. As of September 2019, approximately 11% of the total project funding has been utilized, leaving 89% of the project budget available for the work ahead. Funding All apps involved in the Help@Hand Project will include accessible language that informs users on risks and limitations of the products, as well as what will happen in a crisis. CalMHSA has created Terms of Service (TOS) in response to early concerns raised by Peers and other community stakeholders. The TOS document provides initial disclosures and basic cautions for users of any technologies included within the Project. This TOS was written at a sixth grade reading level and will be shared with all users prior to engaging with any of our tech- nology offerings. The need for an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is considered on a case -by-case basis. Each county and vendor must make this determination considering their use of any data generated by the technology. CalMHSA cannot make any decisions about the need for an IRB. Currently, UCI is pursuing an IRB for an organizational assessment of the project. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission speaks about Innovation saying, \"it provides the opportunity to develop & test new, unproven mental health models that have the potential to become tomorrow 's best practices. \" This is important because it helps us remember innovation is not intended to be a proven solution or approach. There will be learning, there will be challenges, and there will be problem solving Anonymous vs Confidential \u2014these words are often used interchangeably but mean very differ- ent things. Anonymity refers to data that is collected in a way that the person's identity can nev- er be discovered. Confidentiality refers to data that is collected in a way that the person is not immediately identifiable, but they may be identified if the person is believed to be involved a cri- sis. The crisis response depends on the technology and the location where it is being implemented. Some cities and counties must be able to support a crisis response. Other cities and counties have different protocols. 6 Help@Hand Stakeholder Report Frequently Asked Questions For the Help@Hand Project, our working definition of a Peer is: Someone who publicly self - identifies with having personal lived experience of a mental health/co -occurring issue accompa- nied by the experience of recovery and is trained to use that experience to support the people we serve. Help@Hand is proud to partner with a CalMHSA Peer and Community Engagement Manager who works diligently to ensure the Peer perspective is integrated throughout the project. Many cities and counties involved with Help@Hand also have dedicated Peer representation. Peers are involved in activities like product exploration, evaluation, marketing, outreach and en- gagement. Recognizing that many stakeholders have needs and concerns before engaging with technolo- gy, the Peer and Community Engagement manager facilitated a series of meetings with stake- holders and is partnering with digital mental health literacy experts to create training to respond to emerging needs. Pilots are intended to engage a diverse population. During previous pilots, the apps were not only translated but also trans -adapted. This means a person who fluently speaks the language has reviewed the translation to validate the translation. They also checked to be sure it makes sense in the language and is culturally responsive. Stakeholders have multiple ways to provide input on the project. To get more information about stakeholder input for a specific city or county, please contact that location 's department of be- havioral health. Last Updated 9/30/2019 Peers & Stakeholders The user 's data is protected. Tech companies will have the data and may use it to improve the app, but they cannot sell it or trade it. Technology that collects and/or stores PII or PHI will be HIPAA compliant. Technology that does not collect your data are not HIPAA compliant because they do not collect your data. Data is housed by the technology vendors. It will not be sold. Many people already share personal data with their city/county. For example, data that is re- quested by some of the Help@Hand technology apps is very similar to the data that is collected for other county programs, such as CalFresh. Program evaluators University of California Irvine may use data for learning purposes, but the data will not identify individuals by name. Prior to using any technology or app, you will get information about the type of app it is and whether it is anonymous, confidential or neither. Privacy & Security 7 Help@Hand Stakeholder Report Frequently Asked Questions After the project is over, can counties and their stakeholders still have ongoing access to the digital solutions that were provided? Are the solutions confidential or anonymous? Will all apps have a disclaimer about what will happen in a crisis? Last Updated 9/30/2019 Questions We Are Working On How to Ask a Question To submit a question to Help@Hand, please contact CalMHSA at TechSuite@CalMHSA.org. The Help@Hand teams are working diligently with experts and stakeholders to find the best ways to implement the technology, but we know not all questions can be answered today. Some questions will remain unanswered as we work through the project. These questions have not been lost. Help@Hand will track those questions here. As answers are learned they will be add- ed to the FAQ sections of this document and the questions will be removed from this section. 8 Help@Hand Stakeholder Report Looking Forward Implementing technology is complicated and takes time. The American Medical Association Dig- ital Literacy Playbook notes that on average it takes a hospital 23 months to go from identifying a digital innovation need to scaling a digital solution to meet that need. In this case, we don't have one hospital, we have 14 cities and counties across the state, with different systems, pro- cesses and resources. We've also heard from diverse communities that we need more options. The project is opening an application process for technology companies to apply to be part of the suite of apps Help@Hand considers. Innovation is happening throughout the project on a daily basis. We are looking at different ideas and concepts, including creative ways to use the technology solutions, ways to identify and pro- cure new technology solutions, and creative approaches to marketing and branding that are dif- ferent than what we might expect to see with a county program. Help@Hand has learned no one or two apps can possibly meet all the diverse needs of the pro- ject. Two apps were initially selected and deployed in some of our counties. We realized through the learning and feedback that we would better serve our audiences by pulling back, do- ing some additional work and deploying slower using a pilot process. We acknowledge the importance of updates to our stakeholders. We will be implementing quarterly updates of this document for stakeholders. We are excited to be currently procuring additional technology to increase options and help realize our goal of having a \"suite\" of technology available to counties. This will also result in testing* and piloting of new technology. We will continue learning and exploring what works and does not work in bringing technology to county behavioral health systems. The technology procurement (RFSQ) is expected to close in mid -October. A list of approved tech- nology will be available to cities and counties by mid -November. Cities and counties will select a technology to pilot and will work with the vendor to develop a pilot proposal plan. Help@Hand will bring the next project status update to the OAC in November 2019.

The following pages outline these questions and how the question has been integrated in the application process for new technology vendors. Catalyst is developing a guide for Counties to use during demos/site visits to make sure they get the answers to some of the questions they identified. Stakeholder Questions Tech Vendor Application What is the purpose of the app? What will it do for me This question is addressed by the category Company/Product Match Capability to Address Behavioral Health How much time will it take to set it up? This question will be addressed during the demo/site visit process so counties can discuss their specific needs with the vendor. Is this app/digital solution sponsored or certified? Does it come from a credible source? The Technical and Professional Standards category addresses if a digi- tal solution comes from a credible source and if the vendor is seeking/ has sought FDA approval. If a county would like to know if a product has a specific sponsor/certification, they will have the opportunity to ask the vendor during the demo and site visit process. Who is the developer and what are their credentials? The \"Strength of Match \" category addresses credentials and experience for the vendor and its core team. The size, storage, and time investment for downloading? How much space does the app take up? How much data will this use? The RFSQ asks the vendor to describe their product 's technical archi- tecture. Additional questions regarding size, storage, and time will be addressed during the demo/site visit process so counties can discuss their specific needs with the vendor. How often is it monitored by a real person, what is the real person engagement? The RFSQ asks for information on staffing for the pilot and if the vendor has a security officer on staff to oversee their data security program. Additional questions regarding monitoring can be addressed during the demo/site visit process. What is the benefit of the app? The RFSQ asks for information on previous studies/pilots showing the benefits of the solution. In addition, it asks for the metrics vendors use to measure its success. What age group is this appropriate for? The RFSQ asks for the vendor 's target populations and their greatest health concerns. Counties can discuss with vendors if they are interest- ed in targeting a specific age group during the demo/site visit process. Can you lock the app or lock the account if multi -user capability? The RFSQ asked for detailed information on how the solution protects users ' privacy. Counties can discuss specific features with the vendor during the site visit/demo process. 1 11 Help@Hand Stakeholder Questions About Procurement Last Updated 9/30/2019 Stakeholder Questions, continued Stakeholder Questions Tech Vendor Application How is my information being collected? How is my information being used? Who will have access to my information? What happens to my data I 've entered after I remove the app? Why does the app need access to certain features (e.g. camera, location)? Any piece of mind statements like, \"we do not share with third parties \"? Is the technology secure? Vendors are asked to provide information on their protocols for management of information on user identities, consent and en- forcement, entity/facility authentication, confidentiality, and docu- ment workflow auditing and detailed security policies to protect user privacy. In addition, vendors are required to attach their pri- vacy policy and/or terms of use. Counties will be able to address any specific data/security questions with vendors during the demo/site visit process. Who should be contacted in case of an emergency? Vendors and counties will be able to discuss emergency contacts during the demo/site visit process and confirm contacts before submitting a pilot proposal. Disclaimer that it does not replace the care of a professional care or used for self-diagnoses Add a disclaimer that it is not meant to replace therapy, but that it is meant to supplement. Vendors are asked to describe their protocols during and after a user is in crisis such as reporting, resources provided to the user, organizational procedures, and how they liaise with a client in the RFSQ. What risks might I expect if I download it? Is it clear of any malware? Will this cause screen addiction? The RFSQ asks multiple questions regarding the vendor 's expe- rience and credentials as well as background on their solution (including security features to protect user privacy) as part of the vetting process. Counties will be able to discuss any specific risks they are concerned about such as screen addition during the demo/site visit process. Is it really free? Are there recurring payments and fees or payment after the free trial? Pricing structure for and after the pilot will be addressed during the demo/site visit process so counties can discuss their specific needs with the vendor. 2 "}
