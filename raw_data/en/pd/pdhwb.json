Right from very beginning, Naturopathy sprang from a philosophical platform which proclaimed Nature and Nature alone as the genuine and lasting healer. Benedict Lust was a giant among numerous visionaries, possessing unrelenting determination to bring Nature Cure and Naturopathy into the 20th century. Many shared that vision and like him, were dedicated to a movement that would challenge the assault on medical freedom which plagued not only naturopathic professionals, but also sanopractice, chiropractic, eclecticism, herbalism and more. Guided by twelve core statements established by Dr Ludwig Staden, these pioneers embedded our medicine with principles as necessary to understand and support today as a century ago.
