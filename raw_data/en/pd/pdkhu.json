It gives the body the fuel that it really needs to thrive. It is usually what humans are doing to themselves that is making them moving towards disease. Your diet needs to support your gut health thus cutting out foods that cause inflammation and increasing those that have an anti-inflammatory effect. This will keep your body in an alkaline state which reduces the inflammation and the negative impact it can have on your health. It is the processed and refined foods that tend to cause most of the problems. Foods in their natural unprocessed state (like fish, fresh fruit and vegetables) keep inflammation under control. Foods that promote inflammation and thus should be avoided are: - Sugars - Dairy - Gluten - Refined grains and carbohydrates - Fried foods - Grain fed meats - Unhealthy fats (trans fats, soy, canola, and corn oil) - Nightshade vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, cayenne) Foods to include to reduce inflammation: - Green leafy vegetables - Herbs - Fruits - Fiber - Organic grass fed meats - Healthy fats - coconut oil and olive oil - Wild caught fish - Omega 3 essential fatty acids - Nuts (almonds and walnuts) Here is a recipe for a drink to do 1-2 times per day to improve your gut health and help fight inflammation:- - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (with the mother) - \u00bd teaspoon of bicarb soda - \u00bd lemon squeezed - Warm water Add the bicarb soda slowly to the apple cider vinegar. Once it has stopped fizzing then add the juice from half a lemon and some warm water (1/2-1cup). NOTE: Warm water definitely makes it easier to take than having it in cold water. It may not be delicious but it is only a moment and it is down. This is a small sacrifice you can make to promote an alkaline pH in your body and promote your health.
