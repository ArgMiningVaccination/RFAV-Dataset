At Desert King we have developed scalable technologies to produce adjuvant precursors from Quillaja, due to its high content of triterpenoid saponins with immunostimulant capacity. Boost your Vaccine's Immune Response with the world's experts of scientific and sustainable solutions. [View more](https://desertking.com/qs21/) Vaccine adjuvants based on Quillaja saponins, obtained from our precursor, can be found in dozens of commercial human and veterinary vaccines manufactured by the world's largest laboratories. New applications that include oncology, infectious diseases and other pathologies are also being studied. To satisfy our customers' growing needs, we have made significant progress in R&D to enhance performance, guarantee supplies and comply with the high standards that this market demands. Thus, we have established a strong integrated supply chain that ensures a sustainable production of high purity extracts. It is a natural ingredient for vaccine formulation. Lower antigen requirements. Helps to boost weaker antigens. It improves the duration and onset of the immune response. It provides a more powerful and effective immune response for the prevention of various diseases. They are compatible with other adjuvants. Their surfactant properties make them ideal for the formulation of vaccines based on macromolecular complexes. Quillaja saponins effectively stimulate the production of antibodies and also induce a strong activation of the cellular immune response, stimulating the production of cytotoxic T cells against exogenous antigens. Our commitment is to conserve native forest through our model of rational and sustainable forest management, which reduces the impact on it and revitalizes it, contributing to its adaptation to climate change. We seek to improve control of the supply chain and work in partnership with all types of landowners. We are aligned with laws on the promotion and recovery of native forests, and we want to contribute with techniques and development that help their recovery and protection. Our biomass supply operation is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae) certified. We are pioneers in the development of Quillaja plantations with selected plants that have higher QS-21 content. (US Patent 11,254,699 B2) The company develops and maintains lines of research focused on Quillaja's requirements as a crop, making steady progress in the process of domesticating the species and its intimate relationship with the ecosystem. This reduces pressure on native forests. We ensure immediate availability of innovative, validated, and effective Quillaja products, which allow high formulation flexibility and adapt to our customers' diverse needs. Adjuvant Precursors Our company produces two ranges of Quillaja extracts that are adapted to the different needs of our customers: Our extracts are used by customers as precursors for obtaining adjuvant formulations. They are currently present in commercial vaccines against Herpes Zoster (Shingles), Malaria and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the coronavirus disease in 2019 (Covid-19). * The QS-21 manufactured by Desert King Chile is currently offered as a non-GMP, preclinical material and has not been evaluated in clinical research. Desert King Internacional (DKI) offers QS-21 GMP manufactured by a cotracted laboratory in the European Union. Features If you wish to learn more about QS-21 we invite you to watch the following Video. CHROMATOGRAPHICALLY PURIFIED SAPONIN FRACTIONS We have developed technology over the last decade that allows us to produce specific saponin fractions with chromatographic methods, for direct use by customers in the formulation of adjuvants. The potential use of purified fractions of Quillaja extracts in vaccines against certain types of cancer, HIV, Tuberculosis, Alzheimer's and Varicella Zoster is currently being studied. "}
