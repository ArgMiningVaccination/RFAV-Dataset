The study aims to 1) Assess in great detail the spectrum of health in the oldest old, 2) Examine the associations of health trajectories and outcomes with biological, clinical and social factors as the cohort ages, 3) Identify factors which contribute to the maintenance of health and independence, and 4) Advance understanding of the biological nature of human ageing. The study began in 2006 targeting participants who turned 85 and were living in Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside primary care trusts, United Kingdom. The study sample includes 1,042 people born in 1921 and registered with the participating general practices, with a response rate of 71.7% (Collerton et al., 2009). Collerton Joanna, Cavies Karen, Jagger Carol, Kingston Andrew, Bond John, Eccles Martin P et al. Health and disease in 85 year olds: baseline findings from the Newcastle 85+ cohort study. BMJ 2009;339:b4904. Data Collection At baseline, participants underwent a detailed multidimensional health assessment by trained research nurses in their usual residence (own home or institution), comprising questionnaires, measurements, function tests, a fasting blood sample, and a review of medical records held by the general practice. Assessments are conducted at baseline, 18 months, 36 months, and 60 months. General practice medical records are reviewed at baseline and 36 months for data on disease, medication, and use of general practice services. Participants could decline elements of the protocol. Participants will be tracked until death, and the date and cause of death will be included. Of those eligible, 1,042 participated in the study, 854 participated in both the health assessment and record review, 188 participated in the record review only, and 3 participated in the health assessment only.
