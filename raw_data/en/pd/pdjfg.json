E.g., you get a gun license for a shotgun, low capacity hunting rifle or simple handgun, and after 2 years you apply to get the gun license upgraded to allow for bigger guns. The licensing would require the same evaluation that the military does when doing the draft, which included a mental, physical and \"moral\" evaluation.

It's pretty hard to kill 20 people in a mass-knifing incident. - Also, there's 4 things virtually all mass murders have in common; troubled youth, crisis point, study of prior attacks, and the means. Guns are the means, as are rented trucks, and home-made gas, etc. Dealing with them is importantly, but ignores the other problems. I'm not sure how you prevent people from having a troubled youth; crackdown on bullying should help, but for all the mass murders that the anti-bullying campaigns stopped, it's almost as if social media added far, far more. I also don't know how to prevent a crisis point; a social safety net would probably lessen the impact of job loss, but there's no way to prevent divorce or the struggle to find a relationship to begin with. Studying the means of prior attacks is tricky; banning the media from covering a mass shooting isn't an acceptable solution, though not making murderers famous would help.

That's a 100 weapons which go into the grey/black market.

I'm also a bit of a cynic regarding some the headline restrictions like 'assault weapon bans' because often the definitions are utterly arbitary (something the pro-gun folks mock, because the anti-gun campaigners often know jack about guns, and thus are overly focused on 'it looks scary!' aspects than actual capabilities). - Yes, I like the Swiss model. - One issue about 'moral evaluations' is the folks doing said evaluations. I'm reminded of a story Condi Rice told; growing up in the late Jim Crow South, her father etc standing guard at night with guns to protect them from KKK attacks etc. If 'licencing' had been required, Condi's father and friends would have been disarmed by the Dixiecrat officials.

They are violations of people's bodily autonomy, and the analogy being made is that people have the right to make permanent changes to their body provided it is done so with their informed and affirmative consent. Being suicidal or mentally ill doesn't inherently make someone of unsound mind. There is nothing inherently of value in being alive, nor is inherently bad to die. Letting people die on their own terms instead of prolonging their suffering for the sake of mere existence gives them a chance to die with dignity. This whole idea of having the state decide what is best for people on their behalf is how we end up with people dying of insufferable diseases for long periods of time, in horrible pain, shitting themselves because it has been decided that death is \"worse\" somehow and therefore euthanasia immoral. It also the same paternalism behind drug prohibition and the immeasurable harm that has caused. In this case we are not even talking about having compassionate means to suicide prevention (which I would support) instead we decided mental health discrimination in the purchasing of fire arms is the way to go. This is all because an overbundance of guns produced under industrial capitalism, and the normalization of terrorist ideologies get redirected to be a problem about mentally ill people; because lets be real y'all rather do something about \"crazies\" then face the realities of overproducing free market capitalism, white supremacy, and religious fundamentalism. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 10:25, 26 May 2022 (UTC) - Fewer percentage than ever own guns in the US, the people who own just own far more than they used to.

But as an aside, suicide and euthanasia are clearly different. When an animal is suffering it is often subject to euthanasia, but I am sure that nobody would suggest that it committed suicide. - As far as the right to die is concerned I can't see any moral reason for withholding it. I have just had two friends suffer quite painful deaths from cancer but their families were insistent that they suffered every last minute of their deaths.

Consistently, discussions about background checks from the left include mental health evaluations, the GOP/NRA baulk at that every single time. As GC correctly notes, the purpose is to increase the number of gums in the US, period. Cory also correctly notes that there are fewer registered gun owners, but that means the people that have guns don't just have one, they have multiple. So reduce the number of guns available; make it illegal to import, freeze manufacturing of guns, (a lot of these companies have agreements with military branches, if they informed these companies that they will not work with any arms producer if they make certain weapons available to civilians, many companies would comply) start a voluntary buy back program, and lastly require all purchases of guns be traced.(This would be an actual good use of the blockchain)- [RipCityLiberal](/wiki/User:RipCityLiberal)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:RipCityLiberal)) 16:38, 26 May 2022 (UTC) - @ - Cory, you realize that you're talking to someone who views forcing people to live against their will as morally bankrupt right?

It's in the entomology Cory! - I am not blaming the \"left\", liberals and conservatives both do this and neither of them would I consider \"left\". We have to be really careful about what we advocate here, as many suggested forms of gun control often mean reinforcing the monopoly of legitimate violence of the state, re-entrenching the power of the enforcing part of the state more broadly (keeping firepower in the hands of the police and military, giving the state a huge advantage if workers choose to engage in direct action against capitalism and the state; you know a thing leftists would actually advocate). Historically the implementation of gun control often gets targeted towards marginalized groups, we saw this with the way California responded to the black panthers to which the NRA supported (the GOP and NRA broadly just want to keep nationalistic white people armed, and ensure the profits of gun-producing capitalists). When liberals advocate barring the mentally ill and people with a criminal past from obtaining guns this by and large is going to bias the laws against black people (with higher incarceration rates) and disabled people (as already established). We need to find ways to limit the accessibility and overproduction of guns as to reduce the presence and availability of guns from would be right-wings terrorists without leaving the state with the means to keep it's hand of legitimized violence to shoot dead members of marginalized communities (which it does and historically has a long history of doing so against PoC and striking workers) - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 19:21, 26 May 2022 (UTC). - Yet that's not going to happen and everyone knows this. There shall be no 'limits of accessibility' on weaponry (apart from a bit of tinkering on the edges) because the gun control faction of the Dems don't have enough power to get it through Congress, and even if they did I'd bet a steak dinner the Supreme Court would knock it down. Though new sale limits etc would be seriously limited in their utility - I suspect most of the mass shooters, if they'd been unable to buy them from stores, would have resorted to informal channels and/or illegal ones. Nor does it really stop folks who'd brought their weapons *way* before they decided to go on a rampage. - Don't be absurd. Euthanasia is of course a form of suicide. - Conclusion; constantly calling for Federal gun limitations to be put in is as predictable as the 'thoughts and prayers' line and about as useful - this cycle has been going on for at least 25 years now and the NRA etc have got their 'response' to the calls down to perfection. If 'public opinion' was going to turn against all this, it would have by now. So why bother continuing to play a game that you can a) see is rigged in advance and b) you know you won't win? - Also important is that in the USA there are *legitimate* reasons for gun ownership. Hunting / predator control is the obvious one, but self-protection is another - there are millions of Americans who live too far away for realistic police protection and due to the ~390m weapons in civilian hands I'd say it's a reasonable fear assailants shall be armed. I'm familiar just enough with UK rural life to know there's quite a resistance towards 'city mores' and outright opposition when it's attempted to be foisted on them by politicians - and I see no reason why their American counterparts would feel any different. - As many of these things, we have a situation where it appears two 'extremes' have dug in; the 'urban liberal' who'd ban even cap guns and the 'rights maximalist' who argues it's every American's utterly unlimited right to own enough ordnance for a small army no questions asked. With the inability to do anything on the legal front, I think the best bet is to work on encouraging responsible gun ownership, which includes speaking up (and having someone to speak to) when you think someone is going 'into a dark place' - for one of the things which I normally notice is that the majority of rampagers *should* have set off alarm-bells before they did the deed. Even moreso for the teenage ones; I normally don't like moralistic cliches but I agree that in this case 'where were their parents?' is a very reasonable question to ask. - And for the record, there *are* left-wing pro-gun groups. Such as the ' [Socialist Rifle Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Rifle_Association)' and ' [Redneck Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Revolt)'.

Police and other forms of law enforcemnt exist, sort of self evidently, to enforce laws. This in turn is based on the general idea the Social Contract, wherein the state exists to protect us from each other via a set of rules. In exchange, we consent to be governed by the institutions of that state. (This is what Consent of the Governed actually refers to btw.) The problem is America is run by self centered dipshits who are not concerned with the common good and/or have no idea what to do to solve this shit. This has the effect of basically trashing almost all of those state institutions, which borderline voids the requirements for a social contract in the first place.

Not liberal, left-wing. So, now that we've established that, I can straight up tell you that your narrative is childish as all fuck. At least from a leftwing perspective. Why did law enforcement enforce Jim Crow? Because it was the will of the state, as empowered by the population, that it do so. Gods and Goddesses fucking orally, anally, and vaginally above and below, can we not engage is pseudohistory when talking about these issues? Like actually understand what a system is, what it's made of, and how it works. Unless the state is legitimized by might, it is appealing to the will of the populace to determine what it can get away with. This in turn shapes the actions and ideas of the rulers, who will seek to push boundaries in their games of power, and, will seek to enrich themselves if not stopped. To put it more bluntly, the reason why America is shit is because the populace is lazy and complacent, when they aren't literally unable to be politically active.

Our modern institution of policing started from a demand to respond to rioting workers in England, and then the system was adopted in the US. It was also adapted in slave patrols, then later border patrols in the US. - policing is one of the primary means of enforcing inequality, especially on racial lines in a number of countries, and there multiple lines of evidence that suggest police practices are largely ineffective in responding to serious felonies, and many police practices especially in regards to forensics is largely based in outright pseudoscience. - It's an open secret that many crimes are happening on college campuses, with drug use, underage drinking, and more seriously sexual assault \u2014 and yet this is not where we find police presence (not that we necessarily want that either).

[Corrode](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(yak)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)15:49, 28 May 2022 (UTC) - the modern institution of policing did not start as a response to rioting workers in england. the cavalry were already dealing with such civil disorder. modern policing stems from the fact private policing existing before was ineffective at combating crime due in no small part from corruption of the thief takers, that'hue and cry' system does not work as populations grew and required crime to be witnessed and random people in the vicinity to pursue offenders. peelian principles and policing by consent is the foundation of modern policing. an alternative to draconian punishment or bloody military responses, it was meant to be a non militarised, civilian police operating through mutual trust and cooperation with communities policed, recognising that to do their job, the good will of the public is needed. the us has strayed far from these principles, with black communities never having been policed by consent. its important to understand the founding principles to understand what the policing could and should look like to offer an alternative to the current us police to realistically strive for instead of the choice between the status quo or the abolition of police entirely - as so unthinkable to many as to not worth consideration. - None of those social policies require the police to be removed. So again, how would your proposed system of rule enforcement be different than a police force, and why does it require abolishing instead of reforming the police? - People need community defence without unilateral power, one that is answerable to the direct democracy of the people who need protection. That would be wildly different the current unelected physical force of the state. - - in my view defunding is required to help fund all organisations and infrastructure required to prevent people reaching a point where they would be criminalised and become the responsibility of the police, whose role is much reduced as a result, have a much less antagonistic relationship with some communities leading to more trust and goodwill all around. this would be dependent on a judicary and prison system far far less brutal, and not having to enforce laws that are by accident or design racist in there effect, criminalising more black people and at a younger age than any other grouping, making interactions with police involve being taken away to be brutalised by the state. - abolition on the other hand is a fantasy requiring a utopian society that can never exist and is a boon to any one favouring the status quo to dismiss defunding, already a tough sell and far simple a process even without resistance and inertia, out of hand as one and the same as abolition, and people stop listening.

The police enforce inequality, are largely ineffective when it comes to serious crime, and are the means to which racist, classist, and queerphobic laws both historically and currently have been violently enforced. To see the police as something other than an institution of oppression is reflective of sociological privilege. If one was opposed to such inequality and oppression, then one would have to be for the abolition of the police. Reforms have a track record of largely being ineffective, and police, and police unions themselves provide extreme amounts of political pressure to prevent such reforms. The only data that suggests police are effective at preventing/responding violent crime, comes from police organizations themselves which presents a massive conflict of interest. At this point I think supporting police as a effective means of responding to \"crime\" and catching say \"rapists and murderers\" is borderline pseudoscientific. Especially consider all the openly used forms of forensic woo. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 22:21, 28 May 2022 (UTC). - @ [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)My citation for my claims come from the book \"The End of Policing\" by Alex S.

None of the major academic criticisms I am aware of involve claims of historical inaccuracy, but I can fold on that and say I am likely misremembering the historical details Vitale described in the book.

They simply desire the overly-militarised, trigger-happy and undertrained variant to go away. I get GC's annoyance here; I mean, you're members of a profession world-renown to going into a situation and shooting everyone dead regardless and you couldn't even bloody do that here - the one time it would have been most welcome. - American policing has existed since the 1880s. Suburbia and urban centers are growing in America. Virtually all American suburbanites want policing in their neighborhoods. Most American city dwellers want policing also. The number of police and detectives in the USA is projected to grow - - I have a question- Is there any police departments that don't have incompetent trigger happy cops? Is there any who do good honest police work? I suspect that it is very rare. -- - An important side note, though I'm sure it's obvious to most in this debate, but policing is only one form of \"law enforcement\", which is in turn only one form of controlling anti-social behaviors and maintaining some level of social cohesion. I'm making this side note to preempt the inevitable arguments that treat the police as the only form of enforcement that ever has been or ever will be, as such a view is both ignorant and absurd. - On a practical level, America (and her cops) are victims of the complete obsolescence of the organsational system for law enforcement. First off, there's simply too many police 'departments'. According to Google, [there's 18,000 of them, and many of them are tiny](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/08/most-police-departments-america-are-small-thats-partly-why-changing-policing-is-difficult-experts-say/). How *do* you reform such a lattice-work of jurisdictions, proceedures, management styles and so on? How can one spread 'best practice' within a force which is smaller than a bus, which shall invaribly end up with cops covering up for each other (like any work team does)? Some rinky-dink sheriffs etc might be decent cops, but know nothing about how to lead or manage anything. This is part of the issue Dumb cites - those cops are 'harrassing black neighbourhoods' because many colleges have their *own* police (of various forms) who are supposed to be going after the on-campus crimes. Ie they're not the same agency. - On a practical level, America (and her cops) are victims of the complete obsolescence of the organsational system for law enforcement. First off, there's simply too many police 'departments'. According to Google, - One of the answers to this is 'national standards' for policing, training etc. Yet the USA doesn't have them. Nor does she (apparently) have any national 'cop registration' system either. This means not only are training standards wildly different for each police academy, but the 'crap but not quite sackable' cops can keep on shifting PDs to keep one step ahead of their deserved 'day of reckoning'. - Speaking of academies... the model is screwed-up - expecting many of the prospective cops pay for their own training and kit. I mean, we stopped doing this for the military in the 19th Century. Some of the bigger PDs shall pay for your training etc, but the little ones can't afford this. There's a chronic shortage of police officers and this offloading of costs onto the prospective cop don't help. This can become a perfect storm for some outfits; short-staffed, can't afford to train new folks, ends up accepting poor/dodgy candidates simply because they meet the technical critera for employment. [Though the training leaves much to desired](https://www.police1.com/police-training/articles/a-letter-to-the-american-public-we-need-to-increase-the-quantity-and-quality-of-police-training-PEIoRJqWTIG55dqy/). American cops don't train enough for their advanced counterparts, too much of what training they do have revolves around shooting people/things and in smaller PDs the refresher training may be between little and nil. Even worse, there's a tendency to scrimp on the training but splash out for the bling of policing - new cars, big guns and so on. - So in short, yes some - in fact, most - police forces need 'abolishing'. And a lot of reform needs to be done.

As long as you have laws, you shall require people to enforce said laws. Even minority groups who really don't like their current policing arrangements still accept the need for policing of some form because anarchy sucks. In quite a lot of cases, they'd simply like the police to operate in the way they're supposed to. That's why 'defund/abolish the police' is a crappy slogan; it makes it sound like you're advocating anarchy to much of the Big Public. - The abolition of sexism, racism, albeism, transphobia, wage labour etc, are all \"utopian\" ideals that will never get accomplished any time soon, yet that doesn't therefore justify being pro-sexism or being favour of racism, does it? - - On a more practical front, the police are needed. They have the vast majority of policing experience and skills. Even if you 'abolished the police' today, you'd need to hire on many of them to help run the new 'Citizen's Watch' or whatever you call your police-by-another-name.

If people have dysfunctional governments and police forces, it's often because they have dyfunctional populations. - @ I'm a little late to the party here, but one of the more difficult things about policing, specifically in America, is a lack of uniform training and centralized authority. Police don't get their power from the federal, or state governments. Instead they are given power primarily from local voters. There are a couple reasons for this, however the source is almost certainly discriminatory. Currently for 50 US states there are 17.985 police agencies, the majority of which are local. If you reduced police forces primarily to counties, that would be roughly 3,000 police agencies, and if training was expressly the responsibility of states, it would be much easier to create best practices and enforce national rules and regulations. Obviously you need local training, but a universal policy for use of force, interacting with the public, and a constant refrain that police must serve the public, would address many of the systemic issues around policing.@ [GrammarCommie](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) is also spot on that this can't be a discussion solely about the police, the entire system of public safety must be reimagined, just like the justice system also needs major reinventing. Both of those fall under the biggest debate, over moral judgements of this country regarding crime and punishment, another thing that is flagrantly imbalanced.- [RipCityLiberal](/wiki/User:RipCityLiberal) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:RipCityLiberal)) 16:57, 31 May 2022 (UTC) Thanks, echo (you basically agree with my 'organisational obsolescence' point above). On @ [OnlySortaDumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)'s point... well, there's no other way to say this; you are a policing luddite. Your 'solution' to a poorly-functioning policing system is to simply revert to an earlier system. You know what law enforcement was like before organised, state-controlled police? - informal 'citizen watches', private guards, criminal gangs and on the occasion the state *had* to intervene, the army. A combination of incompetent, corrupt, biased and/or violent. - Like hand-looms, these things bit the dust because they were crap. In fact, many of the people who don't like the American police now - the poor, the minorities and so on - would fare even *worse* under previous systems than the current one. No police, powerful criminals like Epstein, Madoff etc would have never been brought down. Or any corrupt companies. For there's be nobody there to investigate crimes formally, and if somebody did start doing it informally... well, I could simply pay for goons to have you beaten up and office trashed.

Richard Lewontin made exact the same argument you did about flight but instead to illustrate how it is actually impossible to predict political and technological limitations from pre-conceived ideas of human limitations both from biological and pre-conceived notions of \"human nature\". Such arguments are not ones based in genuine nuanced understandings of biological science or even psychological science-- they are purely ideologically motivated stemming from a \"more than you can possibly know\" bias and preconceptions of human essentialism that is existentially fraught. Crime is a social construct, not a fact of nature. I no doubt believe that we can never rid society of anti-social tendencies but the only organizations that claim police efficacy in \"reducing violent crime\" are police themselves which presents a huge conflict of interest. To talk about the systems we had before (which recall I am not advocated for) as flawed because they were corrupt, biased, incompetent, and/or violent -- all of those criticisms can be currently held against the police. To state otherwise is flying in the face of the mountains of evidence of systematic racism enforced by the hands of police that have been accumulated over decades.

Fine. Answer the following clearly and concisely; - Without any organised 'police' how do you propose... - 1. ...society deals with the crimes committed which are *not* related to mental health issues, economic privation or substance abuse? - 2. ...society deals with the crimes which are too complex for the layperson to solve, such as complicated frauds? - 3. ...society avoids the blossoming of gangs, 'self-defence groups' (like my 'citizen's watch' you objected to), mercenaries and other actors which can make the lives of many of the public even worse? - 4. ...how shall a state be able to enforce the laws it has made? - As for being a reactionary proponent of anti-social justice... I take it you didn't read my points above which taken as a whole would be revolutionary for American policing? I didn't say a word about either laws or the judicial system, which are the two other parts of the 'justice' triad - you cannot have laws without detection/enforcement, and you can't have a judicial system without both of the previous. - Police - in theory at least - are not simply 'another criminal gang'. Two fundamental differences exist; they enforce the laws made by elected representatives of the people and they answer to them for their actions (or lack of). They may fail to meet these goals - sometimes hugely - but the simple fact is that they have these goals and 'gangs' generally don't. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 04:22, 2 June 2022 (UTC) - See a strawman fallacy is when someone mischaracterizes or oversimplifies their opponent's argument as to make it easier to rebuke, it's fallacy because the response becomes an argument in response to a series of irrelevant premises that the opponent didn't actually make. - In this instance you have constructed the argument that I would want modern policing replaced by the ineffective systems that preluded police, and that's my proposal. My argument in not simply the implementation of neighborhood watches in replace of policing, while keeping everything else as is. I advocated specifically for a massive expansion of various institutions and social programs as to prevent crime from happening to begin with to lower the need for police as an institution. Now that doesn't exclude the implementation of neighborhood militias that are directly elected by the communities they serve and are quickly stripped of their power when they wrong their communities, but that's not my \"solution\" nor my proposal as to what should replace the police, though I am not excluding it either. Also to make the historical argument here about the neighbor and citizen militias of old is sort of fallacious on the grounds that it just assumes that technological advances since then are irrelevant, that no new systems of accountability could be adopted that were unavailable to people 100 + years ago, and that systems of old would just be adopted verbatim with zero relevant changes. That's absurd. - I think most crimes are related to mental health, economic desperation, and the war on drugs. The crimes excluded from those categories that extend beyond mild misdemeanors (i.e. vandalism) are exceptionally uncommon(with the exception of maybe rape and serious spousal abuse), but as of now the more serious violent crimes are not effectively responded to by policing. Rape is notoriously poorly handled by police with less then 2% of those taken to court getting convicted for the crime. Not to mention that less than 5% of rape victims even feel comfortable going to the police. 60% of the murders committed in the united states never get cleared, so in all probability if you kill someone in the US provided there was no witnesses there is a good chance you may just get away with it. This doesn't even get into the amount of pseudoscience that informs police forensic practices for solving crime, i.e. the use of bite mark and hair analysis, blood splatter analysis, fingerprint analysis, etc. if you are starting from the assumption that the police are effective and competent you are already starting from a false premise. - So why is this expectation that the system that doesn't deal with these problems effectively should be expected to persist as is, but any alternative that may be just as effective but solves a lot of other problems related to crime is simply a non-starter? I think a good chunk of this is going have to be dealt with by abolishing patriarchal power structures and ensuring that men don't hold unilateral power over women --- because lets be real the majority of those crimes are being committed by men against their partners and spouses. - Fraud for that matter is not effectively dealt with by police, the most common response to fraud by the police is simply prevention via education. A culture that implements critical thinking and fraud prevention as a normal part of society's education system is going to be better equipped at preventing fraud, police aren't really a requirement. Tax agencies are better at handling fraud then the police are. - Honestly a lot of \"gangs\" and mercenaries that make people's lives worse is because they implement the incentive and power structures of capitalism as to establish economic coercion on small communities, or they are motivated by ideological extremism and far right nationalism (which the police openly engages with and often ignores). - I am not going to give the last point a response because as an actual socialist and not a pretend one I know the DoTP isn't characterized by the existence of a centralized state. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 06:51, 2 June 2022 (UTC). - I am not going to give the last point a response because as an actual socialist and not a pretend one I know the DoTP isn't characterized by the existence of a centralized state. - - Also nothing short of actual revolution is actually revolutionary, your modest demsoc proposals is not at all revolutionary.

You've identified serious deficits in police abilities to deal with serious crimes, as well as interactions with those experiencing homelessness, mental instability or drug addiction. But it appears you want to instead move many of these interactions to community members instead of a state sponsored force. You're addressing a serious problem with policing, that often members of the police force are not members of the community they are policing. So expanding community involvement in public safety I agree is critical. However, there is still a need for some sort of central governing body. That body would be responsible for training, distribution of resources, and accountability. Likely then you also need to break out groups based on what their response would be to a call. Somewhere around a third of 911 calls in the US, are some version of a welfare check, which doesn't require an armed response. Domestic disputes, and crimes of a sexual nature, probably need social workers to spearhead victim contact, but may require some form of armed response. There are examples of this working, especially in Western states, alleviating some pressure on police. But honestly why stop there? Why do you need an armed officer for traffic infractions? Why do you need an armed officer in any school? That sort of evaluation should encapsulate our immediate reforms. Investigative techniques, imprisonment and the judicial process all need to be addressed, however in the immediate we need to address officers on the street primarily. - Disturbingly, Uvalde PD have chosen to stop cooperating with Texas investigators. These smaller police forces may have the equipment, but they are woefully unprepared for any form of accountability, because they've never had to.- [RipCityLiberal](/wiki/User:RipCityLiberal)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:RipCityLiberal)) 23:43, 2 June 2022 (UTC) - @ - @ [Ariel31459](/wiki/User:Ariel31459)You misunderstand the fallacy you are making.

Even in that case some cultures actually take on ritualistic forms of suicide and starvation that put even those basic universals to doubt. Human emotions are even disputed as universal by scientists. It would be very odd if somehow emotions weren't universal for humans but \"crime\" was. Assuming a human nature does exist judging upon it on the basis of behaviour in the industrialized modern would be like trying to infer an animal's \"natural\" behaviour while kept in captivity in a zoo. - - but you know whose very inclined to believe in human universals and inherent tendencies towards evil? Fundamentalist christians. - If the absence of police is your standard for \"utopianism\" then your standards are low. There is no faith in acknowledging the realities of an ever evolving and socializing animal. The existentialists understood that atheism implied the absence of human essentialism, and yet you cling to the belief of such essentialism with the explicit argument that it's rejection exist on the basis of faith? I will admit an inevitability of violence and shitty behaviour, but crime is arbitrarily delineated. Most countries declare me being butt fucked by my boyfriend a crime, it's not a consistent set of outlawed behaviours across cultures and time. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 00:35, 3 June 2022 (UTC). - @ [RipCityLiberal](/wiki/User:RipCityLiberal)My favorite political philosopher to date is Machiavelli.

It would be lovely if \"construct\" could be used to make human nature somehow unimportant to the understanding of human cultures. Almost all people can see color, and the few individuals who are completely colorblind do not suggest that color sight is a construct of some kind. Human ethology is not a fake science.

The idea of anything being a wholly \"human\" nature is that is has to be defining to a species. \"Seeing colour\" is as defining as \"having a heart beat\" and illustrates how little you actually know about what you are talking about. If you have to dismiss entire fields of science to make your point then you are not by any means being scientific. I have a degree in psychology, not once in my courses did the concept of \"human nature\" ever come up as a serious scientific construct especially not in any way that gave it a useful operational definition. You can find some stuff that are seemingly universal across human cultures but at the end of the day you have to explain why those traits are particularly informative, and specially unique to humans. The best you can probably find is the use of language and the emergence of culture; but what is there to even gleam from that? The existence of violence is not at all defining to humans. Humans can and sometimes do exist peacefully in small communities. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 22:28, 7 June 2022 (UTC). - Ethology is the study of the relations of biology with behavior.

Ethology doesn't start with the premise \"there exists a human nature\". Ethology is also the study of behavior broadly as interpreted as adapted evolutionary traits. - Dismissing relevant experts skeptical of the usefulness of this construct (which doesn't actually follow from a evolutionary account of human behavior) is a type of anti-intellectual denial. - Also a lot of evolutionary studies on human behavior from social sciences are rife with methodological flaws, ignoring the relevant limitations and methodological controls biologists apply to evolutionarily analysis, which leads you to problematic fields with varying degrees of scientific quality in thieir literature, such as with evolutionary psychology and sociobiology. This is why Lewontin (a influential population geneticist studying evolutionary changes via allele distribution in populations) refers to such references of human nature as an example of \"biology as ideology\". The biological world is hardly so simple and essentialist. You can probably call such tendencies \"pseudo-biology\" or \"folk biology\" and they are as about as useful to evolutionary theory and biology more broadly as human \"races\" are. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 00:49, 8 2022 (UTC). - @ [Ariel31459](/wiki/User:Ariel31459)\"Why can't we improve society?\" Your reply is basically just \"because human nature/original sin\".

This may explain why hypocricy is such an important topic for moralists of all sorts. The religious mind may say \"everything is according to god's will.\" I don't. We each modify our behavior using the self-reflection theologians used to peg as \"free will.\" That's a bugaboo that sticks it's head in almost every argument concerning human behavior.

Nature has no intentions, it's not a conscious entity, it does not make \"mistakes\" or errors. - The point GC is making is that this \"just nature\" argument has historically been used in politically reactionary ways. I.e. the natural right to rule, Thomas Hobbes's argument that without a state life would be \"nasty brutish and short\", not to mention evolutionary psychologists and sociobiologists attempts to argue for the \"natural\" tendency for humans towards bigotry. - It all comes to serve the same function in the end, namely the status quo is inevitable as it is justified.

Human social systems are not constructed by individual arguments. The products of human reason are not always well-reasoned or permanant. this all seems rather premature to me. social programs, mental health services, reform of prisons and the judicary, and a whole lot more needs to be in place before abolition becomes a viable option. those things should be striven for because they are worthy goals in and of themselves, whether you want to aboltish the police or not. its only when such things are in place will abolition begin to look like a possibility, and its only then should it be a goal one can work towards - it should b a simple task by that point, as it likely being natural progression. whats missing right now is are those social programs, mental health services, etc. whats missing is what form they take, how they would be implemented, what they are meant to do, how they might compliment each other. not knowing any of that, abolition is based on wishful thinking, taking it for granted these will all be effective in doing what they are intended and will naturally do whats required to make abolition possible. nor is possible to say abolition can never work, without these supposed services in place to refer to and show us what they might be inherent shortcomings preventing abolition ever being viable. we cannot say one way or another if abolition will ever be viable right now, and we are far from a time when we can say, and without all the assumptions that have right now. until then we have essentially a pantomime debate - 'is it possible?' 'on no it isnt' 'oh yes it is'. all these social programs and assorted services that might someday come together to make the police redundant will come into being to meet specific and current community needs and for the benefit of the community not for a distant and uncertain goal of abolishing the police. i have no clue what these services will look like, what they would do, and how they are to be integrated with one and other and within the community - anything and everything from youth clubs to needle exchanges, i should imagine. nor do i know what challenges there are getting such things up and running. community activists and volunteers probably better placed to tell you what issues there are and what would help. this debate does not tell me, and the debate is pointless until these things are known.

(Besides the ones that he's [directly contributing to](/wiki/Transphobia), of course.) Maybe your surgery gets botched. Maybe you get hit by a car crossing the street on the way to the doctor.

Oddly the case of the Transman was actually an argument for Uni-Healthcare; the problems weren't fixed because he lost his insurance, allegedly. Matt's other points... - John Money and Alfred Kinsey were pedophiles or something (mostly untrue, but best lies always contain a nugget of truth in them) - Binary views on sexuality are not unique to the Western World (also not untrue) - Trans people emotionally bully people to get their way, including getting his Dr Phil segment removed (eh, can't really say) - Johnny the Walrus was the greatest children's book in the post-Seuss world (false) - The suicide rate for trans people pre/post-surgery is a misunderstanding of stats or something (very false) - His wife struggles to open a jar (lady, you have hot water for a reason) - And, of course... - Trans and other \"gender theorists\" don't know what a woman is (it's actually a good philosophical question, so calling this one false too) [Corrode](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [(yak)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)21:36, 4 June 2022 (UTC) - To be clear, you're saying that the case of the trans man that Matt Walsh brought up demonstrates the value of universal health care; Matt Walsh didn't say that. (I'd find it hard to imagine that he would.) - Aside from the truth values of the individual points that he made, the true ones don't seem to add up to his thesis, which I assume is that people with gender dysphoria should not be allowed to transition. If his thesis was significantly weaker than that, I'd suspect him of being dishonest about what he wants to convince his viewers of; for example, if his thesis were merely that gender self-identification was invalid in some philosophical sense, I doubt he'd be satisfied with someone who accepted that point but believed it had no bearing on medical treatment of gender dysphoria, nor appropriate social treatment of trans people.

I mean, there's nothing special about being a douchebag on the internet. Anyone can do it. - This is by no means an original point but it's worth mentioning that Matt Walsh can't define \"woman\" either. Your first attempt might be based on the ability to give birth, but then everyone stops being a woman when they hit menopause. Then you might say it's the presence of a uterus; the only reason you're using this definition is because it's a proxy for the ability to give birth, but it doesn't disappear with age. But there are still some people who are clearly women but don't have a uterus, so you define a woman as a human with two X chromosomes, and now people with Kleinfelter syndrome are women. Universal definitions of concepts are usually impossible and/or useless. [Christopher](/wiki/User:Christopher)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Christopher)) 19:32, 5 June 2022 (UTC) - I mean, as I keep pointing out, \"woman\" and \"man\" are memetic tautologies almost entirely rooted in human social interactions and determined largely by \"feels\" aka memetic signifiers. Don't believe me? Try to define woman in a way that includes all cis women, excludes all trans women, and can be used in a social context. The trick here is you can't. You can't make a coherent trans-exclusionary definition of \"woman\", because you definitionally have to redefine \"woman\" out of a social context, at which point the term becomes meaningless. [Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)19:40, 5 June 2022 (UTC) - Universal concepts in nature seem to only exist without exception at the most basic fundamental components such as with subatomic particles, and chemical elements; so called paradigm examples of natural kinds . Philosophers of science are sort of at consensus that biological kinds are rarely natural kinds - it's incredibly difficult to come up with a unproblematic definition of a species for example. So is it really a surprise if biological sex is no different? That's also if we look solely at sex too, gender on the other hand is almost exclusively a social kind \u2014 I don't think we would ever have that much success in traditional analysis in that area. - Cressida Heyes is a feminist philosopher who argues that \"woman\" is a Wittgensteinian [family resemblance](/wiki/Family_resemblance)concept. That any attempts to \"draw lines\" to what is and isn't a woman is never solely in the interest of neutral unbiased classification but exclusively for political aims. So when someone tries to answer the question \"What is a woman?\" It's for the best to ask yourself what is their political aim in attempting to find the line to draw in answering that question. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 22:30, 5 June 5 June 2022 (UTC) - Nevermind, followed the link and answered my own question.

For about 98.3% of humans, they have no abnormalities (in the pants at least), and it's pretty obvious they are one sex or the other (not to be confused with gender!). The remaining 1.7% is almost entirely comprised of conditions of varying severity, e.g., about 1.5% would be late onset congenital adreno-whatsits, which isn't a genital abnormality to begin with and very few if any medical doctors consider it to be any form of intersex at all. About 90% of the rest have various conditions or deformities, but will only have reproductive organs from one sex or the other; a human with XXX trisomy will still produces egg and can give birth, a human with XXY Klinefelter still produces sperm albeit often has fertility problems, so it's rather silly to insist they are a form of intersex. Beyond this, point, the lines do get blurred; Swyer syndrome is where the person has all the female parts but XY genes, this person will not go through puberty on their own as their gonads are non-fuctioning and thus no ova produced, so it's no longer cut and dry that they should be \"female\" but it would not be wrong to say they are either \"female\" or \"inter\"; yup, social construct. For about .02%, they do in fact have genitalia that's made up of both so they don't really belong in one or the other sex.

Dave or Rationality? \"Why science and religion are the same\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive416&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] Yup, probably the worst header but it's the title of the article I'm sharing. I've been back into r/christianity for the last few months and while I won't say it was a complete waste of time, it has flared up my scrupulosity to a point it hasn't quite been for about 8 years. Mental Illness denial is rampant there and one user claims calling someone crazy or a troll is the \"unforgivable sin\". But it led me to this [article](http://changingminds.org/blog/1307blog/130714blog.htm). This article, written by an engineer (yes, [I know](/wiki/Engineers_and_woo)) is what I owe the header to but I'm still curious of the opinions, even if the personal opinions here are \"this is stupid\" or *reverts and acts like it never existed* it at the very least tells me I'm taking rediculous ideas seriously at 5 AM. Essentially the message is Religion is an \"Inner experience\" and Science is 11:47, 7 June 2022 (UTC) - Both science and religion wage a \"tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition\" with the goal \"toward God!\" Guess who said this(He was a deist. Just so you know that I'm not quote mining.).Anyway, I personally take a Kierkegaardian approach to this dilemma. [Herr Doktor](/wiki/User:Highboi) [Enter into the rabbit hole](/wiki/User_talk:Highboi)12:40, 7 June 2022 (UTC) Some thoughts: - Insofar as science is fundamentally characterized by methodology, it is transparently not the same as religion. - In my education I read and accepted science just as I blindly accepted the Bible as the unchallengeable word of God; with regard to the science side, this is a commentary on science education, not scientific practice. - both are based in the explanation of human experience; supposing that this is true, it overlooks substantial methodological differences. Scientific observation and experimentation is systematic; the same cannot be said for the pagans' explanations of \"the forces of nature as the acts of various gods\". - Scientists also have their own social structure, with professorial high priests and rebellious researchers. Like religions, they claim to be working for the good of mankind. And, like religions, they are intolerant of contradictory views, with cruel ways of ostracizing those who stray too far; nothing in my experience indicates that the generalizations of professors as priest-like or of researchers as rebellious hold up. I'd be curious to see more details about the \"cruel ways of ostracizing\" practiced by scientists. Intolerance here is being used with a degree of equivocation. - There is no interesting connection made between Kuhn's idea of scientific revolutions and religious revolution. Even if an interesting line were explicitly drawn, it is unclear how far this would go in justifying the claim that science and religion are the same. - you cannot prove anything; This is kind of true. - How can you disprove the existence of God? Well, what follows from the existence of God? If there is nothing that follows, then you can't do so with deductive certainty, because any observation would be compatible with the existence of God. But that is a poor justification for belief in God. Furthermore, if gods with different dispositions would be expected to behave differently, then empirical evidence could provide justification to have greater credence in some statements of the form \"if there are gods, then they have traits ______\". Additionally, given that on some versions of the god hypothesis, it is possible for god to interact in obvious ways with the world, and that there is no (reliable) empirical evidence for such interactions, there is justification for disbelief in god. - The way the article is phrased betrays that the author is reflecting primarily on a monotheistic (probably Christian) theology. They speak of capital-g God, not gods in general, despite offering no reason to prefer belief in God to belief in gods. Granted, they do mention the \"pagans\", so they aren't considering this exclusively. - \"And what of religious experience, on which religions place such emphasis? To the neuroscientist it is simply the activation of a bit of the brain. Yet this also explains the whole of our experiences and thoughts. And, reflexively, we are using our brains to think about our brains, which poses another conundrum. Yet religious experience has converted hardened scientists as it creates bottomless feelings of joy and connection. With the mysteries of quantum science and things yet to be discovered, we cannot say what connection there is between people and beyond, though we surely experience this in our daily interactions.\"; This is a non sequitur, another non sequitur, a third non sequitur, and blind speculation that is transparently not rooted in a thorough understanding of contemporary quantum physics. - \"Both seek to explain outer and inner experiences. Each professes to serve both individuals and a wider society.\" Let's grant this. Then we can evaluate each on how well these ends are achieved. Given the depth of the explanations scientific investigation has afforded, and the resulting enhancement of human ability to manipulate things in the world, it seems to me that science has done relatively well both in providing explanations and in serving society. Perhaps one could dispute over how well it has done with regard to \"inner experiences\", but that is quite plausibly down to the difficulty and complexity of neuroscience, and while I confess to a relative ignorance of religious claims broadly speaking, I am not aware of (i) any unified account of inner experience or (ii) any in-depth explanation of inner experience. - Overall, the central claim is false, and the justification is shallow and meandering, overlooking crucial points of difference between science and religion which serve to undermine the overall argument. Most notable is the methodological distinction, which is ignored. Some of the parallels drawn are dubious, and don't withstand reflection beyond the \"seems plausible\" level of evaluation; others are superficial. My key takeaway is that the author is mistaken about his alleged \"tendency to analyze everything\", which is far weaker than he supposes. There are other problems, but addressing them would not make my critique much more interesting, and would take more effort than I am interested in giving.

Solipsism is basically like constantly living in a dream without your control. Now when philosophers bring up solipsism they don't do so as an argument for it (usually).

That usually comes with the simple question how do you know that you aren't living in a incredibly vivid dream right now? How can you prove that aren't?

However, the spirit of the movement lives on in certain things, disassociated from its hippies-incense-and-Enya reputation of old. Some parts of New Age became relatively mainstream (the Westernized yoga stretching exercise, for instance) without much issue, but what's probably more interesting is how the occult / esoteric and alternative medicine part of New Age have crept into certain spaces, including Christian ones, in a similar fashion. [Many Christians in America now also hold at least one New Age / esoteric style belief according to a 2018 Pew survey.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/01/new-age-beliefs-common-among-both-religious-and-nonreligious-americans/)To me, it's not that Christians have become New Age all of a sudden, but the esoteric elements have seeped into the paranoid style crowd.

He is very abrasive and takes a \"my way or the highway approach\" to governing rather than pragmatically compromising in some cases. Trudeau being caught wearing blackface in the past doesn't help either. The Westminster system (those which haven't adopted proportional representation) is viciously undemocratic. All that is left really is the UK (at a country level), Canada and a handful of Caribbean and Pacific Islands. Almost always a single party wins a majority, rarely with more than 50% of the vote. Canada and the UK regularly have governments by a single party with sizeable majorities with 40% of the vote (or even sometimes around 35%). Ford won with 40%, meaning 60% of the populous did NOT want his government nor their policies. This is absolute madness. Resistance to proportional representation in these countries are driven by the two large parties who refuse to give up their duopoly in government, and the lie that coalitions don't work. They can be problematic in Italy, Israel and occasionally in a few countries, but are extremely successful in 50+ other functioning democracies. The only time Canada or the UK tends to pass truly progressive policies are those few times there are minority governments (hence in Canada at the moment they are looking at universal day care and stronger gun bans). Having said all this, there actually isn't a massive difference between political parties in the UK or Canada. They all fall very close to one another on a three dimensional political ideology chart. None the less, over the long term it keeps Canada and the UK from more closely following successful Scandinavian policies.

Biden is as unpopular (and has a less solid base) - but find me a Democrat who isn't. This iteration of American politics is becoming massively unstable and entrenched because whoever wins shall instantly have the ground-in emity of at least 30% of the adult population. - Personally, I think Biden would decline to run in '24 if he genuinely believed there was a better (aka more popular) candidate than he. But I don't think such a candidate exists; they should have appeared by now, but I've seen nothing (and I don't think Harris has grown into this either). In fact, I don't think it's possible for such a candidate to exist - the simple fact that Old Man Biden, the American Brezhnev is reviled and attacked for being a 'hard left socialist' (or being a senile puppet of previous) by Republicans shows that the general 'political worldviews' of the two sides (there's way more than that in reality, but this is a simplified model) no longer have any real overlap, even to the point where they cannot even agree on the general 'rules of battle'. - Biden keeps insisting that he will run in 2024.

Many of whom lived in large apartment complexes. All of which were in very poor quality. Residents all lived in terrible poverty. Starvation, disease, depression and suicide were commonplace. The Human Free State claimed that living inside walled off cities was the best humanity could hope for. Just being able to wake up in the morning was considered good enough. Outside the walled off cities had its own set of horrors that made Human Free State cities look like a utopian paradise. Outside hosted monstrous creatures wanting to consume people on the inside. Their eternal hunger made the enemy relentless in their assaults. Self Defense Forces held off the attacks with all their might. Casualty rates had always been significant. Morale among the armed forces was extremely low; so low that many would go outside the cities just to become infected and join the ranks of the enemy. Miles Lykaios sat on the couch of his loft. Nothing actually happened in his simple existence. Calling it life would be a completely inaccurate description. How anybody could call being a resident inside a Human Free State city was beyond him. Sitting on the couch was likely one of the only real comforts available. The food given out by the Department of Food Production barely qualified as edible. Drinking tap water was akin to drinking toxic material. Advancing to a better quality of life had been reserved to the rich and powerful.The television played its usual propaganda of how humanity is rebuilding, essential services are available to all and healthcare quality is at its highest in a decade. Miles knew that the propaganda was almost all bullshit. Everyone knew that the Human Free State was poorly governed by an ultra-nationist political party. My idea is that the fictional human government is in league with the zombies.

The HSF will be a criticism of Hamas in telling people that they are fighting military occupation when it reality, they take Iranian money and are happy to oppress their population.

Zombies who plan and negotiate are not the stereotypical zombie at all, (which isn't on its own a dealbreaker) so why make it zombies? What about it being zombies informs the motivation or characterization of their faction that makes it either integral to the plot, or a clever subversion of the classic zombie tropes? Are the average zombies mindless, but their leadership is not? Are the average zombies intelligent and just desperate, alla \"The Return of the Living Dead\"? Are they \"science\" zombies brought about through a horrid experiment or fluke of biology, or \"magic\" zombies brought about by divine powers or necromancy? - If you are going to make zombies intelligent, they need to be a faction with complex motivations and desires. Just wanting to eat is insufficient, as it makes them boring. The compelling aspect of the stereotypical zombies is human appearance with inhuman behaviour. If you give them human behaviour (intelligence), then what makes them zombies and not just ugly cannibals? - I'm not saying the idea is bad, I'm saying the viewer will have these questions and your story will be even better if there are answers for them.

The cause of the zombie plague will be biological. Another concept is half human half zombies created by earlier attempts to cure the plague. The half breeds (I will call them that) are discriminated by both humans and zombies. The half breeds are non-infectious and only eat living animals, not humans. The zombies hate them because that they consider them impure while the humans see them as run of the mill zombies. Two uprisings will take place, one where the humans in the HSF are fed up with the totalitarian government while the half breeds rebel against the zombies for being discriminated against. -- [YouTube Demi-Queen](/wiki/User:Rationalzombie94) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Rationalzombie94)) 15:52, 11 June 2022 (UTC) - But why zombies?

Principle of identity and quantum mechanics[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive416&action=edit\u00a7ion=26)] how does something being in two places at once not contradict aristotle and become a violation of a logical axiom \u2014 Unsigned, by: [2603:9001:301:3600:8d0a:2037:13d1:9979](/w/index.php?title=User:2603:9001:301:3600:8D0A:2037:13D1:9979&action=edit&redlink=1) / [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2603:9001:301:3600:8D0A:2037:13D1:9979&action=edit&redlink=1) / [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/2603:9001:301:3600:8d0a:2037:13d1:9979) As I see it, there are several answers to your question. First, the principle of identity is an epistemological principle, whereas the nature of things is an ontological question. There is no necessary relation between what makes a statement true and what is going on in the world. Second, leaving the above aside, A being in two places at once does not contradict A=A. A is still A, it just does not have a fixed position. Third, your question seems to imply that a particle being in a state of superposition means it is in two places at once. This is only true, if true at all, on a certain interpretation of quantum phenomena. [101.100.131.204](/wiki/Special:Contributions/101.100.131.204) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:101.100.131.204&action=edit&redlink=1)) 03:39, 15 June 2022 (UTC) - I don't see the relevancy of the principle of identity so I will assume you mean the law of non contradiction. In that case it's not literally that the electron is at location 1 and not at location 1 at the same time t as a discrete entity, it's more that the electron is at location 1 and it is at location 2 at time t. The fact it is at location 1 is not negated by it's presence at location 2. The electron is a wave-like particle which does not have a definite border. It's not a solid object. There are spaces to which the excitation of an electron field can exist, and there places it can not. When a wave passes through said space the excitations just happens void of the space where the probability of finding the electron is zero. At least that's how my ignoramus brain understands it reading the handful of books written by physicists for the layman crowd. There is no principle in classical logic that quantum mechanics actually contradicts (so I have been told). There were philosophers at a time that thought that there was a tension and developed quantum logic as a result, but it turned out the motivation for this was based entirely on a misunderstanding. - [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 03:41, 15 June 2022 (UTC). - QM does not imply that nature can have contradictory properties. While this is one possible interpretation of QM, it is not a necessary consequence of the theory. First, even in QM, nature is never literally observed to be in contradictory states at the same moment. No particle or system of particles is ever measured at the same time to have conflicting properties, since each measurement returns a single value for the parameter under investigation. In general, this is an inevitable consequence of measurement, since detecting the state of a system destroys its superposition, thereby \"collapsing the wave function\" and forcing it to take on a definite value for the measured quantity. It is true, however, that things can display apparently incompatible properties when observed in different ways (and at different moments in time), behaving like waves in one instance and like particles in another. But it is not contradictory to suppose that things behave differently at different times. Second, we can specify the states of systems without contradiction if we are more precise in our description of them. First, we should simply deny that being in a superposition of A and B is equivalent to being both A and B simultaneously. For instance, in the case of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, we should deny that it is both dead and alive prior to observation. Second, we can consistently describe the state of a system in a superposition of A and B as being in a state such that <if it is observed/measured then it will return the result A with so and so probability and will return the result B with such and such probability>. There is no contradiction in that description of the cat, once again, since it avoids attributing inconsistent properties to the cat. Analogously, for wave-particles, we should say that the object is in a state such that <if it is measured in way X then it will appear to be a wave, and if it is measure in way Y, then it will appear to be a particle>. No contradiction here. But hold on! Recent experiments lend support to the claim that a single system is literally in two incompatible states at once. - I don't see the relevancy of the principle of identity so I will assume you mean the law of non contradiction. In that case it's not literally that the electron is at location 1 and not at location 1 at the same time t as a discrete entity, it's more that the electron is at location 1 and it is at location 2 at time t. The fact it is at location 1 is not negated by it's presence at location 2. The electron is a wave-like particle which does not have a definite border. It's not a solid object. There are spaces to which the excitation of an electron field can exist, and there places it can not.

There is no principle in classical logic that quantum mechanics actually contradicts (so I have been told). There were philosophers at a time that thought that there was a tension and developed quantum logic as a result, but it turned out the motivation for this was based entirely on a misunderstanding. - If a system is in a superposition of two states and the measurement doesn't interfere with that state, then it can remain in the superposition without collapsing into one or the other as a result of the observation. In that case, the two measurements returning inconsistent properties (e.g. wave or particle, dead or alive) pose a greater mystery. It is a delicate matter to carry out such a measurement, but researchers claim that it can be done. In one of the most striking examples, a metal paddle composed of roughly a trillion atoms and just barely visible to the naked eye has been put into a state of vibrating and remaining at rest at the same time! However, we can resolve these cases, too, without admitting contradictions, by a more careful specification of the state as suggested above. For the vibrating/non-vibrating paddle, we should specify its state as <if measured in a way that does not destroy the superposition, 50 percent of the measurements will yield vibrating, while 50 percent will yield non-vibrating>. Note that these measurements are made at different times. However puzzling this state might be\u2014and no one could legitimately claim to understand the underlying reality of such a system\u2014this description is not equivalent to both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time. A more simple objection would be that if it violates the Lnc, it would at the same time not violate the Lnc.

Ammo is a bit of a different story considering that it's a lot harder to make but there's an incredible amount of it in the United States alone with a whole lot more in Latin America and Canada. The easiest parts of reloading cartridges consist of the bullet (presses are very common for this purpose) and casing (pick up your brass!).

Limit the availability of firearm .stl files, put limitations of said .stl's being used on printers, put in a couple more hoops to buy printer carts for weapons-grade materials (like if you're buying chemicals), use the 3D printer MIC markers to allow tracing/prosecution of those who fabricate 'illegal' weapons/parts and so on. A kind of Newton's Third Law of tech shall apply here as ever; as 3D printing allows 'bad things' to be done with it, tech shall react to nullify/lesson the threat of said bad things. The internet gave us hackers and viruses, but it also gave us sysops and antivirus programmes. - We also don't know what the final market for 3D printing shall look like yet. While it clearly has a future, we do not know whether it shall end up like 2D inkjet printers (in most advanced homes) like photocopy machines (mainly in communial areas, such as libraries, businesses etc) or like the internet (utteerly ubiquitous).

I don't believe that .onion is in United States jurisdiction so the FBI/DOJ can't seize any of the domains unless they seize the server itself. It's also pretty easy to modify any files to evade detection unless every file has to be manually approved. Jailbreaking printers would probably also become more common.

Even if the FBI can't legally move against this 'free knowledge of making RPGs and machine guns' (which they might be able to, under anti-terrorism clauses) I'll point out that *other* nations have law enforcement too. Many of them know what computers are! Lastly, even if they are unable to legally prosecute, they shall often content themselves by simply destroying the offending site. - So in short; when confronted by the spectre of 3D printed weapons, the forces of law and order shall come up with many countermeasures, rather than sinking into a corner muttering 'it's impossible' while crying. [KarmaPolice](/wiki/User:KarmaPolice)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:KarmaPolice)) 03:41, 16 June 2022 (UTC) - Not entirely sure that someone who knows how to operate a 3D printer wouldn't understand how Tor works, it's a slower version of Firefox to the average layman. Also, I'm pretty sure that unless it violates arms export or atomic security laws, it's not legal to completely ban and criminalize 3d printed firearm files (correct me if I'm wrong). - So in short; when confronted by the spectre of 3D printed weapons, the forces of law and order shall come up with many countermeasures, rather than sinking into a corner muttering 'it's impossible' while crying. - Also, it's a bit harder to deal with bad .onions there are a lot of them (plus Silk Road was taken down because Ulbricht was a class-act fuckhead prior to making it and ignored opsec) and they're run by people who probably have guns too. Other countries likely have weaker freedom of speech protections but I'm mainly talking about the United States. - Like I said above, any large scale action is also dangerous considering all it took to push McVeigh and Nichols from being anti government to turning a Ryder truck into a bomb was Waco (and to a smaller extent, Ruby Ridge). Any talk of prohibiting sales is going to inject possibly millions into the market through panic buying. - I've seen thousands of people posting boogaloo memes and there are tens of thousands more.

A series of hoops and walls that a person would need to clear to get their printed weapon. Which most won't bother with, because simply buying a 'traditional' gun will be easier, quicker and for a long time, viewed as superior. The situation you're describing is in fact more a threat in nations like Germany, where gun control is much stricter but ammo is still obtainable, rather than the USA where the land is awash with them (and thus much cheaper). - I've seen thousands of people posting boogaloo memes and there are tens of thousands more.

Printers leave their own unique marks on their works, meaning that the majority of guns printed shall bear them (and thus be tracable, at least back to the printer). - Lastly, the vast, vast majority of mass shooters (~75%) bought their weapons legally. The bulk of the rest were obtained illegally; normally stolen from family members (predominating for minor shooters). This would suggest printed guns are a relatively minor issue; at least for now. - As for the other bits... well, let's sum it up nice and simple. 'You can't do anything for some crazy somewhere shall go and shoot up the place if you do'. As folks are already doing this on a daily basis anyway, I do not see that as much of a threat.

The only reason some of the US tiptoes around the white nationalist militia pretend \"warriors\" is that, politically, the Republicans have moved hard-right and therefore bow down to this mall ninja crowd to get votes (plus, the paranoid style is profitable anyways).

Most SWAT teams are part time made up by guns who are a bit more in shape and spend more range time than the average patrol officer but at their core, they're still deputy dingus and officer wingus with cooler toys. SWAT teams rely on superiority of numbers, firepower or the element of surprise. Remove any of these and they are fighting an armed defender who now has some sort of advantage over them. - Out of tens of millions of people, there are quite a few who can stand up to law enforcement and win.

You would think that things like the [North Hollywood shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout)would've taught them that maybe American gun culture needs to be nipped a bit if only for police safety reasons. But no, we get a more militarized police force instead, with all the crap that entails. - At any rate, Uvalde is an example of an outcome that can happen when a local unit is embarrassingly incompetent: in this case, a [BORTAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BORTAC)team came in to finish the job (way too late, of course).

If your band of rifle-toting extremists thinks their weaponry makes them exempt to laws and decisions made by a legitimately elected state, I will expect law enforcement to deal with them. If 'Dingus and Wingus' refused to do so, I will demand more officers be brought in do finish the job - because nobody is above the damn law. If this proves insufficient, I think I'd be justified in seeing this as 'an insurrection', expect the invoking the emergency laws there for this purpose and see the troops turn out. If this isn't enough, I'm sure the draft shall be restored because it's clear a civil war has broken out.

There were, of course, several obvious problems with this notion: - It was based on a great willingness to risk a great power war in Europe (and thus globally, by virtue of the European empires). - Rather than merely identifying Russian intentions, it risked creating the war by pushing the Russians, not least by suggesting that Germany was spoiling for a fight. - There was indeed the kind of \"it it has to be, then rather sooner than later\" attitude that would border in fatalism and further lowering the threshold for an actual war. - The complete lack of strategic flexibility symbolised by the abandonment of any strategic planning, but for a western strike into France, meaning that war with Russia was doctrinally wedded to a war with France (not that it would have been easy to avoid such a scenario, but a failure to even plan for alternatives was extremely neglectful of both the High Command and the political system and can be seen as a crucial failure of both). - It seems odd to me to make such a grand statement as this as an example of lessons to be learnt from (counter factual) history and then become all cagey about actually discussing the reasoning behind it.

Dude will be remembered just as much as every failed Democratic primary challenger, ie not at all Leftist argument against PR in Current Affairs smacks of vanguardism(?)[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive416&action=edit\u00a7ion=32)] I hardly know where to start with this train wreck of a mishmash of bad arguments, bizarre examples and dubious reasoning in recent (June 16th, 2022) article in the leftist US magazine Current Affairs by Benjamin Studebaker entitled [Proportional Representation Is a Terrible Idea That The Left Should Not Embrace.](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/06/proportional-representation-is-a-terrible-idea-that-the-left-should-not-embrace) So, I'll just start with a general worry I took away from this: It seems that it is essentially based on the notion that because it is difficult for \"the left\" to gain a majority in PR systems inn the guise of a single coherent, FPTP is just great! The reason I find this such a problematic argument is, that it seems to be based on an idea of politics in which the great hope for \"the left\" is that it can basically do what the GOP does and \"game the system\" to bulldoze its ideas through without having much of a majority support by having pluralities (or at best slight majorities) magnified through the FPTP electoral system. It seems to me that the article is shot through with an updated, if less openly authoritarian, [vanguardist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vanguardist) conception of politics in which \"the left\" is so self-evidently good and right that the inherent problems in FPTP (that results far less resembles broader, public sentiments) is actually good, because it keeps the far right out and if \"the left\" can become just a little more popular, it can do what Reagan and Thatcher did (but just in reverse). This seems to me to smack more than a little of the kind of \"the end justifies the means\" and \"we are the smartest guys in the room\" thinking that amounts to a form of vanguardism. Then there's the actual arguments and oh boy they're terrible. The examples of \"bad coalitions\" include: \"hung parliament\" and the older Lib/Lab coalitions of the early 20th century, which is bizarre, given the UK's FPTP system and distaste for coalitions in general (note the term \"hung parliament\" as an aberration). - The Spanish socialists having to barter with Basque separatists. Yup, PR systems can be especially volatile if you have strong secessionist sentiments, but is that really applicable to the US? And is there any less horse trading between different factions in the kind of \"big tent\" political parties fostered by FPTP? Studebaker spends a lot of time discussing the isolation of Die Linke in Germany, but again, the specials circumstances goes totally over his head: Yes, it's isolated because of (half of) the party's origins in the GDR ruling party (the SED), but the reason it's hard to simply build another leftist political party (and why the leftist breakout faction WASG joined with the ex-SED) is Germany's unusually high electoral threshold (specifically instituted to counter party fragmentation, cf. Weimar). Then there's Studebaker's claim that the right wing also tends to do well under PR, which first of all is only a problem if you think only some sentiments should be allowed to compete in the parliamentary arena, and secondly, it was not a PR system that elected Trump or fostered January 6th. If anything the US and UK governments over the last decades have been consistently more prone to tagging to the right wing, even compared to public sentiment as seen by polls. Studebaker's argument that \"leftist\" parties have no reason to stick together under PR is equally bizarre, unless the assumption is that all \"leftist\" parties under PR are driven by ideological purity and narrow minded vote optimisation for their own party, with total disregard of actually gaining power. Sure, you can find examples of that, with the splintered left of the 1970s lampooned in Monty Python's Life of Brian being an excellent example. However, those trends tend to eventually give way to cooperation among those parties who actually want to influence parliamentary politics, and not just a fan club for the \"ideologically orthodox\". Similarly, Studebaker lambasts the coalition agreements as being of dubious value and that they may water down political platforms, but are these really more solidly followed under FPTP than PR? And is his idea of \"keeping the centre out\" via FPTP (as opposed to his description of PR) actually realistic? Because to my mind, the examples of FPTP has generally evinced the exact trends he excoriates PR for, just in the guise of the \"big tents\" necessitated by FPTP. In short, I wonder if anyone might spot something I've missed? Am I misreading or over interpreting the points? Or is this really just a terrible set of arguments used to back up a dubious conception of politics and power?

[Cardinal Chang](/wiki/User:Cardinal_Chang)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Cardinal_Chang)) 11:19, 18 June 2022 (UTC) - @ [Cardinal Chang](/wiki/User:Cardinal_Chang)Leftist or leftism is often used more specifically then \"left wing\" as it denotes left-wing ideologies that share a position of anti-capitalism. Welfare Liberalism, and social democracy are \"left wing\" but they are not typically denoted as \"leftist\". Rightist is sometimes used, but there really isn't a defining feature to right wing ideologies even when only looking at the far right. At least not any that is defining against \"left wing\" ideologies like liberalism and social democracy.- [Only Sort of Dumb](/wiki/User:OnlySortaDumb)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:OnlySortaDumb)) 16:31, 18 June 2022 (UTC). - Current Affairs as far as I can tell self-identifies as a progressive (American style) political magazine, there's no need to resort to the fuzzy \"left / right\" supposed dichotomy. - In France right now, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has steered a new left-wing coalition [NUPES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Ecologic_and_Social_People%27s_Union)to become a major opposition force in their Parliament at minimum, and a small chance of becoming the majority in parliament, depending on how the second round goes. Since this author is a no-compromise type I [don't think he likes this scenario much for some reason](https://twitter.com/BMStudebaker/status/1536378250926120960), but it seems like M\u00e9lenchon's doing pretty good as a political leftie, power wise, with the \"let's work together to nip Macron\" approach. In short, I agree that this article is a hot mess of a take, the guy is young and probably in too much of an ideological purist phase at the moment. [35.140.177.2](/wiki/Special:Contributions/35.140.177.2)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:35.140.177.2)) 20:23, 18 June 2022 (UTC) - If you want to make radical changes, the possibility of gaining a lot of power with only a small amount of support that FPTP allows might be attractive, but it can benefit your political opponents just as easily as it can benefit you. Of course, if you think democracy is still something worth keeping around, doing a whole lot of unpopular things after getting a majority with few votes is likely to end in your party losing the next election and everything you've done getting reversed. If your opposition doesn't mind sacrificing democracy for power, losing a majority to them could shut you out of power for a very long time. If you want your political movement to be able to make a lasting impact via the ballot box, you have to win and win again (unless the changes you make would be really difficult to reverse, which maybe is what the author expects?). The feature of FPTP that the article seems to find desirable is that it is chaotic (in the sense that small changes in the composition of the electorate can produce wildly different assemblies) and that this could allow the left to lucksack its way into a majority sometimes. But a FPTP majority won via lucksack is likely to result in your splintered opposition uniting against you and booting you out. - Also, the history of the SNP in Scottish elections runs counter to the narrative presented by this article. - Also: \"If the right can use PR to grow in European social democracies, there is at least as much reason to think it could use PR to grow in the United States.\" [Too late, buddy.](/wiki/QAnon#U.S._House_2) [Vomitorium](/wiki/User:Vomitorium)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Vomitorium)) 02:01, 19 June 2022 (UTC) - Fist, a note on terminology: The reason I wrote \"the left\" in this way was that it seems unclear to me what it actually means, especially in Studebaker's version. There are a host of different type of \"left\"/\"leftist\" ideas from various types of social liberalism at the centre over socialist and social democratic to various types of anarchist and communist ideas on what may be loosely termed the left wing, to mention just a few. - @ - Off topic, i do apologise, but what's with the use of the word \"leftist\". Maybe because I'm on the other side of the Atlantic, but it just rings hollow and daft, what's wrong with left-wing? Do you also say rightist? Sorry,it's just something that slightly annoys me when reading through American webpages these last few years, and it usually results in me dismissing the author as a half-wit (Probably applies to Studebaker above). I don't mean to sidetrack your post. - As for the actual contents, it's exactly this gambling or chaotic attitude to politics of rolling the dice to get a clear majority on a fairly weak electoral majority/plurality that I find so puzzling. Usually, I see the emphasis on the left being to create and sustain a solid and stable electoral majority in order to have a sound foundation for introducing and maintaining the societal choices the left wants. The main exception that I can think of is exactly vanguardism, which I find smacks more than a little of the kind of paternalism that is usually more associated with the right (e.g. aristocracy literally meaning \"the rule of the best\"). - What seems even odder to me, is that the supposed reasons that Studebaker presents for lambasting and warning against PR are already present, and occasionally even more pronounced, in the current US (and arguably UK) FPTP systems. He also seems to have a very limited understanding of the actual political and societal context of the examples he cites, which leads him to either misinterpret them or to conclusions that are basically the opposite of what a greater understanding would entail. - Usually, Current Affairs tends to have some interesting pieces that are fairly well argued, which was why I took this one to the saloon bar to see if I had just totally missed or misread its contents. I hope that there are some editors that might check such pieces in the future, because this kind of train wreck slapdashery risks reflecting badly on the publisher as well.

There are many different types, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Including hybrid systems. - - The ignoring of the fact that PR might reduce the bias towards major parties, it doesn't eliminate it. Majors still hold the advantages of organisation, name recognition, deeper talent pool, bigger war-chests, media coverage and so on. - - Their 'three party PR' example is very simplistic. They fail to mention that in a two-party FPTP the 'centre' party would be the 'floating voter' part the two would normally fight over. They ignore the fact that it's quite possible to end up with a five-party layout; two 'right', two 'left' and one 'centre'. - - It also seems blind to the appeal that PR can crack the rightist bloc too. Folks who know me know I've blamed the 'moderate' Republican and Conservative for the rise of Trump and Johnson; that for all their complaints, hand-wringing and professed disgust about them, they still end up 'staying with the devil' and thus enabling them to electoral victory (mainly due to above reasons). PR in the USA would have given the 'NeverTrump'ers a few electoral claws to allow these folks 'somewhere else to go'. - - They don't think things through. They are right in the respect that UK Coalitions / Minorities are usually unstable and/or poisonous. The reason for this is simple; because it was FPTP. When you believe that an intra-party agreement is a freak situation, the major member has little to no motivation to not screw the minor over - like how the Conservatives first screwed over the Lib-Dems and then the DUP. PR provides a huge disincentive to shafting because chances are you'll need that dancing partner again soon and parties in PR systems change their actions accordingly. - - This failure means the writer doesn't get the value of minor parties. They are often limited/one issue parties, which means their price for support is relatively clear (and their voters know this too). They're 'ginger parties'; groups designed to 'enliven' the majors. Both sides win; the major gets the support but can blame the 'unwelcome' changes on the minor, while the minor gets a bit of drink in their glass. - - They are also seemingly unaware of how FPTP in three/four party situation becomes really screwed up. Case in point; the recent election in Ontario - the 'winner' got a landslide on only a 40% vote share. - - Lastly, truth be told FPTP has a dozen parties already - they're simply factions within the larger party. Theresa May had to contend with three major ones which made Brexit become a Conservative bowel obstruction, while Labour couldn't really make much hay from this for two major wings were too busy trying to knife each other and throwing hissy fits. And this isn't new either; Major spoke of 'the bastards' which hamstrung him all through his ministry, while Wilson attributed his success in government partly down to 'shoe leather and whiskey' - ie going around, drinking with faction members and talking them around to his POV. - I could easily pad this out as an essay... but this is enough today.
