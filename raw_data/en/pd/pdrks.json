With the variation of sun and shade, different plants come to bloom in the yard throughout the spring and early summer. Right now I'm watching birds and squirrels nibble on the flowering fruits of the Pineapple Guava Tree (Acca sellowiana or Feijoa sellowiana) that sits outside my office window. This tree is an energetic spot throughout the year whether as a resting point for multiple varieties of birds as they fly past our house or host to the amusing antics of squirrels who mostly keep their balance while traversing the branches. Since it sits outside the window where I often write, it's budding, flowering, fruiting, and the different animals that come to visit it have come to mark energetic starting points throughout the year for me. And so it feels appropriate to be writing about the New Moon during this time of heat and energy as it represents the point of new beginnings and often sharp and swift energetic shifts in the lunar calendar. After a long period of waning and eventual darkness, the Moon reappears in the sky as a silver crescent, marking the beginning of the next lunar cycle. It is a time of newness and possibility, of budding hope, and the result of the hard work of setting boundaries and cutting away the unnecessary in our lives. Energy, possibility, hope, transformation, new beginnings, and swiftness are all key energies of the New Moon. Herbal Traditions In Traditional Western Herbalism the New Moon is considered a time of [hot and moist herbs](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/making-herbal-medicine-by-the-moon). Continuing on the sacred structure metaphor started in the last post in our [Moon healing and ritual series](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/full-moon-ritual-and-healing), the New Moon creates the heat and damp necessary to create the material needed to build the walls of the temple. The heat begins to \"cook\" the clay that will eventually harden, but it is still early in the process where moisture is present, allowing for the malleability needed to form foundations and walls. In the garden, the right balance of heat and moisture are essential to beginning the process of breaking down plant and food material into rich and nutritive soil. This is just one approach to imagining the energies of the New Moon, inspired by Traditional Western Herbalism, and you're encouraged to create and seek out stories of the New Moon that work for you. The energies of the New Moon are often exciting and can feel like the first step across the precipice of something new. When I think about herbs of the New Moon I'm drawn to more stimulating remedies, ones that nourish the internal fires of life and digestion (like warming bitters), and those remedies that might have a bit of sharpness to them (whether in the form of heat, bitterness or energetically such as [thorn medicine](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/the-magick-of-thorns)). Remedies that call to me at this time are ones that help me to wake up to my dreams or new possibilities, that help to start a new project or release an old habit or way of thinking that no longer serves me, and almost all of them help me to shift my perspective. But this is from my personal experience and I encourage you to trust your intuition when seeking out plant allies for different phases of the Moon. Examples of New Moon Herbs: [Peppermint (Mentha Basil embodies the heat and energy-moving signature of the New Moon. Unlike other hot herbs, the heat of Basil is often more accessible and easily tolerated by a wide variety of folks. While it can be more drying, it's ability to move energy and accompanying fluid (for fluid is the primary mover of energy in our water-filled bodies) brings in the moist aspect of New Moon herbs. As a nervine and adaptogen, Basil adapts to the body's needs, relaxing us when we need to rest and invigorating us when it is time to rise. The herb supports both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system helping guide us through the cycle of fight or flight back to rest and digest. The variety of Basil I use most often in my practice is Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum, tenuiflorum) also known as Sacred or Holy Basil. Sacred Basil is well studied as an adaptogenic herb and is a highly regarded herb within Ayurvedic tradition - it is a holy panacea. The plant itself is an embodiment of the Goddess Lakshmi and growing one in the home is considered a sacred act. I find the living herb to bring on a reverential meditative state in many who spend any amount of time with them. I have personally found the plant to be a generous teacher, pouring out an abundance of wisdom to those who would take the time to sit and be with them. There is a popular quote by herbalist David Hoffman that goes, \"When in doubt, choose nettles\" and while I definitely choose [Nettles (Urtica dioica)](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/nettles-plant-profile) often, my personal \"in doubt\" herb is Tulsi, with her broad and expansive healing gifts. Within Traditional Western Herbalism, Sweet Basil (Ocimum basilicum) is named for the dragons or mighty basilisks that haunt mountains and caves. The herb not only moves heat through our body, but Basil also stokes our inner fires, helping us to digest our food and move waste from our bodies. Connecting with plants associated with dragons is to connect with the energy moving and coursing through the land we live on as well as the landscape of our bodies. It is to connect with very old energies in order to bring about very new change. Basil helps us, in a New Moon fashion, direct our will, manifest our dreams with life-giving heat, and protect the fire of our hearts. Basil features in one of [my favorite teas](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/my-favorite-tea-for-easy-evenings-self-care), I love it for [breathwork](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/herbs-for-breathwork), and it is an herb I use often for [empaths and highly sensitive folks.](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/herbs-and-essences-for-empaths-and-highly-sensitive-people) Altars + Rituals Decorate your altar with shiny and reflective items and items and images that bring a sense of energy and emerging brightness to your life. Symbols of scythes and swords, or your athames herb cutting blade or kitchen knives carry New Moon energy and fit well on the altar. Add bells and other musical instruments to stir up energy with sound. Before you begin any ritual, clap your hands, move your body, and participate in energy raising practices. Spells of fire and water, wax divination, herbal oils and hydrosols to anoint the body and scent the air. As an offering consider the habits that you can nudge towards a more value-aligned way of living such as choosing more zero waste options in your personal life while agitating for more corporate responsibility for the climate crisis (living more zero waste is great and the worst polluters are not individuals but massive, unresponsive corporations and capitalist greed - let us hold them responsible and dismantle them as necessary with the double-blade of justice-oriented legislation and reform).

A Simple New Moon Ritual To clear out old energy and make way for the new Using pins and needles in spellcraft is an old form of witchery found in multiple cultures around the world. Within western esotericism and traditional witchcraft, pins and needles can act like little swords or daggers to direct energy. I recommend using quilting pins with glass heads, but sewing needles or thorns can be used, too. We'll be using a candle to represent you and your energy and the needles will work as both energetic massage and scythe, helping to work out knotted energy and release it. Begin by creating sacred space in whatever way is meaningful to you. Place two candles and the pins before you on your altar. Wake up the energy in your body, whether this is through clapping, dancing, swaying, breathwork - do whatever works for you. When you feel like you've raised enough energy, hold one of the candles between your hands and leave the other candle on the altar. Connect your energy to the candle in your hands by saying: Candle body My body bright Holy body Candle alight Speak the charm repeatedly, a speedy murmuration, as you visualize it glowing bright with your energy. Place it back on your altar. Take a moment to scan your body, seeking out where energy may be stuck and holding you back from moving on into the next cycle of the Moon. When you find a stuck spot, pick up a needle and hold it over the area, pulling the knotted energy into the needle while saying: Knot and needle Needle and knot In the needle The knot I've caught Then poke the needle into the side of the candle, near the top, so that it stays there on its own. Repeat this process until all knotted energy has been caught up in the needles. All is whole, the way made clear - What is stuck, disappears, What is knotted, comes undone, As needles fall one by one. Now it is time to light your candle. Let it burn so that one by one the needles fall and the knotted energy is undone, clearing the path for you. During the candles' burning you can sing and move and dance or meditate quietly - whatever you are feeling called to. Just before that candle completely burns down, light the other candle on your altar. Here is the light of your energy burning bright and unhindered. You can let this burn out completely or light it periodically throughout the lunar cycle to help energize your ritual work. Once the candle with needles has completely burned, you might choose to read the patterns of the needles and the shape of any residual wax as a form of divination (sort of like tasseomancy) as some Witchfolk do. Once the spell is done, you can cleanse the needles in salt water to use them again in future spells. For particularly tough and tangled energy, take the needles to the crossroads and bury them deep in the earth, walking away from them without looking back.
