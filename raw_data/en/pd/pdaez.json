[3](#B3)Currently, most common treatment options provide only temporary relief to alleviate symptoms while sustained relief requires long-term interventions that include medication and lifestyle modifications. Part of the underlying mechanisms leading to asthma relate to immune mediated, Th2-biased allergen-specific responses [4](#B4)and immunomodulatory approaches such [5](#B5), [6](#B6)However, neonatal prophylactic vaccine-based strategies offer an even more effective approach that could lead to protection from asthma. [6](#B6) [7](#B7), [8](#B8)and therefore, attempts to prevent asthma would likely be most effective if initiated perinatally. Studies in human and animal models have identified the time around birth and early infancy as a period during which allergen-specific immune memory responses of pro-allergic Th2 versus non-allergic immune responses to environmental stimuli are made. [8](#B8), [9](#B9)The increased risk for the development of asthma and allergy in early life has been attributed to an apparent Th2-bias in the newborn's immune system, [10](#B10), [11](#B11)and the immune-mediated physiological parameters that lead to clinical asthma are known to be driven by an increased production of allergen-specific CD4 Th2 cytokines, in particular IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These cytokines have been shown to initiate and sustain, via immune memory, allergic asthmatic inflammatory responses by enhancing the production of IgE antibodies as well as the growth, differentiation and recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells to the lung tissue (e.g. eosinophils). [10](#B10)In summary, a successful therapy aimed at altering the underlying cause of asthma would need to focus on modifying or reducing pro-inflammatory allergen-specific Th2 model allergens can effectively prevent allergic sensitization and/or allergic inflammation in animal models. [14](#B14), [15](#B15)One of the most potent inducers of IFN- non-Th2 effector molecules is live Lm. [16](#B16), [17](#B17)Previous publications harnessing the benefits of Lm to modify hypersensitivity reactions have focused on the efficacy of heat-killed Lm (HKLm) in adult mice. In these studies, HKLm successfully suppressed allergen-specific, Th2-dominated responses by inducing allergen-specific Th1-dominated responses in adult mice. [12](#B12), [18](#B18)However, these studies have not evaluated the ability of Lm-based vaccines to modulate atopic diseases originating in early life. Additionally, live attenuated Lm may have higher potential than HKLm for preventing or treating allergic diseases. Thus, the novelty of our study is determining the efficacy of neonatal Lm vaccine. Our findings show that this approach can work in early life, which is a time point that is clinically important. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals [19](#B19)F1 mice were vaccinated either 6 days post-partum ( [Fig. 1](#F1)and [4](#F4)). All animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the Child and Family Research Institute of the University of British Columbia according to animal experiment protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. When analyzing the asthma model, we did not detect any difference between males and females for any of the parameters tested, and thus data presented were derived from both genders combined unless specified. We did, however, detect a significantly higher response in female vs. male mice to Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR)-antigen in the HP model for all parameters tested and thus data presented were obtained using female mice only in this model. Bacterial strains and growth conditions [19](#B19)We have shown previously that it provides a strong and broad immune response against ovalbumin (OVA), including CD4 and CD8 T cell responses as well as humoral responses. [19](#B19)Lm platform strains were grown to late logarithmic phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600], 1.0) at 37 in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Medium (BD, MD, USA), washed and resuspended in (0.9% NaCl) and stored in 20% glycerol at -80 prior to injection as described below. Immunization of animals Induction of airway inflammation [Fig. 1A](#F1)). Non-immunized naive mice received alum hydroxide gel alone on the same schedule. Subsequently, anesthetized mice were challenged intranasally (i.n.) on days 22, 23, 24, 26, and 28 with 200 \u00b5g OVA in 100 \u00b5L PBS prior to sacrifice on day 29. Non-immunized naive mice were i.n. with saline only on the same schedule. The following abbreviations are used for the different experimental groups ( [Fig. 1](#F1)): \"Na\u00efve\" - immunization with immunization with NaCl without SR exposure; - immunization with NaCl followed SR exposure; \"Lm\" - immunization with Lm (trpS actA)/pSP0, followed by SR exposure. Cytokine production by lung cells after in vitro stimulation with OVA or SR [20](#B20): a total of 2.5\u00d7106 lung cells were cultured for 48 hours in 200 \u00b5L of complete medium R10 (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, streptomycin, penicillin) in the presence or absence of either OVA (500 \u00b5g/mL) (asthma experiments), or endotoxin-free SR (10 \u00b5g/mL and 100 \u00b5g/mL) (HP experiment). Supernatants were collected and stored at -80 until batch analysis for cytokine production was evaluated using a 6-Milliplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Immunoassay according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore USA). Immunopathology [21](#B21) Lung pathology analysis [21](#B21), [22](#B22)to rank the degree of cell infiltration and goblet cell metaplasia. A score of \"0\" indicated that there was no cell inflammation/goblet cell metaplasia while a score of \"5\" referred to the highest amount of cell infiltration/goblet cell observed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Determination of airway reactivity (flexiVent) [23](#B23)and visualized by establishing the area under the curve of the AHR response. [24](#B24) Statistics RESULTS Neonatal immunization with live-attenuated Lm vaccine strains attenuates OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation [19](#B19)These neonatal vaccinated mice were then subjected to a well-described model of OVA-induced asthma [25](#B25), [26](#B26), [27](#B27)as outlined in instillation, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the murine airways was collected and evaluated for total cell numbers ( [Fig. 1B](#F1)) as well as differential cell [Fig. 1C](#F1)). Mice immunized with HKLmOVA as neonates, exhibited a similar degree of airway cell infiltration as the allergen exposed control group (Ctrl). Strikingly, however, mice immunized with live-attenuated OVA-expressing strain (LmOVA) exhibited significantly reduced total numbers of cells infiltrating the airways. Intriguingly, mice immunized with control Lm (lacking OVA) also exhibited a trend towards protection from allergen-induced infiltrates into the BALF, but this did not reach statistical significance ( [Fig. 1B](#F1)). [28](#B28)Most strikingly, eosinophil levels exhibited significant differences between the control and vaccinated groups ( [Fig. 1C](#F1)). While eosinophils were found in greatest abundance in the control and HKLmOVA group, mice from both the LmOVA and Lm groups exhibited significantly fewer eosinophils in BALF. We found no significant difference in the number of macrophages, lymphocytes or neutrophils between mice from any of the vaccine groups compared to mice from the negative or positive controls. Neonatal mice immunized with live-attenuated LmOVA produce antibodies associated with a Th1-driven immune response [Supplemental Fig. 1](#S1)). However, only the LmOVA mice showed significantly elevated circulating levels of anti-OVA IgG2a antibody ( [Fig. 1D](#F1)). Somewhat surprisingly, this was not at the expense of Th2-associated isotype production since all experimental groups exhibited similar levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1. Lm-based vaccines lead to altered cytokine responses in neonatally immunized mice [29](#B29), [31](#B31), [32](#B32)IL-4, IL-12, TGF-, and IL-2 production in response to OVA-stimulation in any of the groups remained at the level of control mice (data not shown). IFN- production was, overall, very low ( [Fig. 2A](#F2)) and while there was no significant difference between any of the vaccinated groups, it tended to be higher in the LmOVA group. IL-5 ( [Fig. 2B](#F2)) on the other hand was produced at significantly lower levels in the Lm, LmOVA, and HKLmOVA groups in comparison to the control group and showed the highest statistical significance in the LmOVA groups. Lastly, following ex vivo OVA restimulation of lung resident cells, IL-10 was found to be produced at significantly lower levels selectively in the LmOVA vaccinated group, while production of IL-10 in other groups was unaltered ( [Fig. 2C](#F2)). In summary, these data suggest that neonatal Lm immunization induces a significant dampening of Th2 inflammatory mediator production in the lungs of allergen challenged animals and that this response is further enhanced by immunization with Lm carrying OVA. Immunization of newborn mice with live-attenuated Lm results in lower airway hyper-responsiveness and airway resistance [21](#B21), [33](#B33)We omitted the HKLmOVA group since we failed to observe reduce inflammatory infiltrates in the BALF of this group (see above), and thus were unlikely to observe protection from AHR with MCh challenges. Dose-response curves of increasing MCh challenges revealed that at the highest dose of 2 mg/kg, the control group responded with a far greater AHR than the \"Na\u00efve\" group ( [Fig. 3A](#F3)). Indeed, the allergic control group was the only cohort that exhibited statistically significant hyper-responsiveness above the na\u00efve controls. To highlight the dose-response relationships between the experimental vaccine groups, we calculated the area under the curve of these responses ( [Fig. 3B](#F3)). This revealed that both, LmOVA as well as the non-allergen-specific Lm groups exhibited reductions in AHR following MCh challenge. Thus, our data suggest that neonatal immunization with Lm ameliorates this second major hallmark of allergic inflammation. Immunization of newborn mice with live-attenuated Lm does not alter susceptibility [34](#B34)( [Fig. 4A](#F4)). Thus, neonatally vaccinated mice were primed and challenged with SR antigen intranasally 3 times per week for 3 consecutive weeks. They were then evaluated for BALF infiltrates, and histological parameters associated with HP. The results are shown in [Fig. 4](#F4). We were unable to detect a significant alteration in cellular - and in particular lymphocytic - infiltration into the BALF, airways, pulmonary vessels or parenchyma following Lm-immunization ( [Supplemental Fig. 2](#S2)). From these experiments, we conclude that although neonatal immunization with Lm protects against subsequent Th2 mediated allergic disease, it does not broadly increase the sensitivity to Th1/Th17-driven lung inflammatory disease. DISCUSSION [35](#B35); however, the precise molecular underpinnings at the intersection of host and environment that predispose to the development of clinically apparent asthma are still largely obscure. In the absence of detailed mechanistic insight, empirical interventions continue to represent the main approach to slowing this growing epidemic. We therefore set out to investigate live, virulence-attenuated Lm as an immune-modulatory vehicle to redirect the inflammatory immune trajectory of atopic asthma. [7](#B7), [8](#B8)therefore, attempts to prevent asthma would likely be most effective if initiated perinatally. We found that newborn mice vaccinated with live LmOVA and then challenged with OVA as adults exhibited a significant reduction in the total number of cells infiltrating the bronchial airways ( [Fig. 1](#F1)). In particular, we observed a significant reduction in BALF infiltrating eosinophils, which are known to be major contributors to asthma-induced pathological changes in lung structure and function. [36](#B36), [37](#B37)However, neonatal mice that were immunized with HKLmOVA, exhibited a similar degree of airway cell infiltration as the Ctrl group (the group that was sensitized and challenged with OVA in the absence of Listerial infection), arguing that HKLm does not alter the total number or type of inflammatory cells recruited to the BALF in response to OVA-induced asthma. IL-5 is known to be the principal cytokine involved in eosinophilopoiesis. LmOVA vaccinated mice were also observed to produce less of this cytokine upon ex vivo restimulation of resident lung inflammatory cells ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). This, however, is not sufficient to fully explain the protection conferred by LmOVA vaccination since similar reductions in IL-5 production were observed in Lm and HKLmOVA vaccinated mice, which exhibited a more modest or no reduction in eosinophil recruitment, respectively ( [Fig. 1](#F1)and [2](#F2)). An additional paradox is the diminished production of IL-10 selectively from the lungs of mice receiving LmOVA vaccinations ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). IL-10 is typically thought to act as a suppressor of inflammation and therefore one might expect a decrease would result in enhanced, rather than reduced inflammation. Furthermore, the trend towards increased IFN- production and reduced IL-10 production in the LmOVA group further support the notion that these mice are skewed towards a more mixed immune response to what would typically be a potent Th2-eliciting immune regimen. More detailed analysis of the exact mechanisms of immune modulation by Listeria-based vaccination is warranted, particularly the assessment of allergen-specific cytokine production by cells from mediastinal lymph nodes. In addition, it has been shown that alveolar macrophages produce a significantly higher level of IL-17 in OVA-sensitized mice compared to na\u00efve mice. Thus, it will be interesting to investigate how Listeria-based vaccination affects IL-17 production from the alveolar OVA-sensitized mice. [38](#B38)( [Supplementary Fig. 1](#S1)and Although the full significance of the increased OVA-specific IgG2a in the face of unchanged IgE and IgG1 levels remains to be clarified, these data suggest that perinatal LmOVA vaccination leads to a more mixed (or perhaps, more balanced) immune response to what is, normally, a highly Th2-polarizing inflammatory insult. Thus, the mechanism by which Lm inhibits allergic inflammation remains to be clarified. [Fig. 4](#F4)). Here we saw no significant exacerbation or protection from disease in the vaccinated groups using a variety of parameters. The fact that neither systemic parameters (serological response to the SR antigen), nor pulmonary histological assessment in our study indicated a worsening of HP in neonatally vaccinated mice suggests, again, that early life Lm immunization appears to induce a balanced immune response, rather than a simple Th2/Th1 shift. [39](#B39), [40](#B40)Likewise, additional studies in mice have suggested that perinatal, and in some instances prenatal, exposure to bacteria or antibiotic-induced shifts in host flora can have protective or exacerbating effects on future susceptibility to allergic airways disease, respectively. [41](#B41), [42](#B42), [43](#B43) [18](#B18)HKLm immunization also reduces antigen-specific IL-4 production in lymph-node cells, reduces antigen-specific IgE production and enhances protective immune responses in the respiratory tract. [12](#B12)However, the ability of Lm-based vaccines to modulate atopic diseases originating in early life has not been evaluated in these studies. Asthma has been shown to begin early in life [7](#B7), [8](#B8); therefore, asthma prevention would likely be most effective if initiated perinatally. [12](#B12), [18](#B18), [44](#B44)Different mouse strains or protocols used to prepare HKLm could potentially explain these opposing findings. [45](#B45)Although the mechanisms are still unknown regarding which microbial stimuli - such as Lm - could possibly protect children from developing asthma and atopy, changes of the innate immune system likely play a role in mediating immune responses away from allergic responses. [14](#B14), [46](#B46), [47](#B47), [48](#B48)Our study shows that early life exposure to a single live-attenuated bacterial strain can reduce susceptibility to asthma. This sets the framework to test multiple hypotheses about the mechanism of immune skewing towards or away from the development of asthma and other atopic diseases in early life. The many available tools in the Lm-based experimental system will permit detailed dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying Lm's ability to prevent allergic airway inflammation. These efforts will open the door to development of rationally targeted specific therapeutic interventions mimicking the effect of our live Lm vector. "}
