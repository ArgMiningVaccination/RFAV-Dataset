Come get grounded with us with a natural plant medicine used by shamans across the globe, a guided meditation with breathwork, sound healing, and some good conversation after for integration. We will be starting with intention stating for each individual. Intention creates action. It is important to get really clear on what intention you are asking for when you are participating in ceremonies such as this. We suggest you take the time to reflect on major changes in your life that you may be seeking, form an intention statement that is short and precise, and write it down and bring it with you. We will then move on to some breathwork and sound healing that will help to awaken your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual energies. The breathwork is kundalini awakening and helps to balance the chakra system. Once we awaken our energies we will be ready for the shamanic plant medicines. Sananga is a liquid form of plant medicine that is put into the eyes. It is a strong medicine that helps with nervous conditions, near or far-sightedness, and helps cleanse negative energy. Hape' (Rape'), which is a prepared powder of medicinal herbs from Brazil, often with a tobacco base and other blends of herbs. Hape' is typically made with mapacho, which elicits a feeling of alertness and elevation that surpasses most other natural plant-based effects. (All Hape' used will be provided and administered by the facilitator, Stephanie) After the medicines are administered participants will be guided through a meditation that will help the intentions set to be manifested. Also, the participants will be lead to connect to Source and deepen the connection to Mother Earth. Afterward, we will have time to socialize and share our experiences in order to integrate what we experienced. Integration is a key factor in making lasting changes that these types of ceremony's produce. This is an \"in-person\" event and will take place indoors, so there is limited space.
