Counsel Roslyn Windholz, Deputy Counsel Elliott Marcus, Associate Commissioner Lynn Silver, M.D., Assistant Commissioner 3 1 THOMAS FRIEDEN: The remarks 2 are not only transcribed, 3 but are reviewed by the 4 entire Board of Health. In addition, 5 the Department of Health responds, 6 analyzes and thinks hard about all of 7 the remarks that are submitted. 8 So without any further notice, 9 I'll now turn it over to Mr. Lopez who 10 is General Counsel of Mental Health and 11 Hygiene. 12 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you and 13 good morning. First, I would like to thank 14 Thomas Frieden. 15 This public hearing is now called to 16 order. Today is Monday, October 30th, and 17 it is approximately five after 10:00. My 18 name is Wilfredo Lopez. I'm Counsel to the 19 Board of Health and General Counsel to the 20 Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. 21 With me today are some members of the Board 22 of Health, Dr. Thomas Frieden, who's the 23 Chair. To his left, Dr. Marlon Brewer, and 4 1 to his left, Dr. Sixto Caro, and at the end 2 is Dr. Kenneth Popler. 3 We are here today for a public hearing 4 on two proposals, 81.08 and 81.50 of 5 Article 81 of the New York City Health Code. 6 Please note that this hearing does not 7 constitute a formal meeting of the Board 8 of Health. The Board will not be voting 9 on any matter today, nor taking any other 10 action. The purpose is to allow the public 11 to testify or present written comments on 12 the two proposals. Anyone wishing to submit 13 written comments today should give them to 14 the staff of the Secretary of the Board of 15 Health at the table at the vestibule outside 16 of this room. 17 Board members may not be able to 18 stay for the entire hearing, however, as 19 Dr. Frieden indicated. Please be assured that 20 a transcript of this hearing is being taken 21 and a copy of those minutes as well as all 22 written comments submitted today or which 23 have otherwise been submitted as comments 5 1 to the Department, will be provided to 2 the entire Board of Health for its 3 consideration. 4 Notices of this public hearing along with 5 the actual text of the proposals to amend 6 the Health Code were published in the City 7 Record on September 29th, 2006. The notices 8 advised the public to request a sign- 9 language interpreter or other form of 10 reasonable accommodation for a disability. 11 No such requests were received. Copies of 12 the Notices of Intention are available at 13 the table in the vestibule. Persons wishing 14 to speak at this public hearing were asked 15 to pre-register. I will first call on those 16 of you who pre-registered, and please note as 17 of 5:00 o'clock Friday, October 27th, 70 18 speakers are pre-registered. If someone is 19 not here when his or her turn comes, I will 20 call the next person and later will call the 21 names of those who may have missed their 22 turns. Anyone may also register now at the 23 table in the vestibule if you wish to speak. 6 1 Such persons will be called after 2 pre-registered speakers. Each speaker will 3 be limited to five minutes. Let me remind 4 you that the purpose of today's meeting is 5 to elicit comments and information to help 6 the Board of Health in determining whether 7 to adopt these proposals or possibly change 8 the proposals. While your testimony can 9 certainly raise questions that you may have 10 about the proposals, please understand that 11 neither the Department, nor the Board members 12 will be responding to comments here today. 13 Laboratories can be accessed on this floor 14 by going past the elevators. For the 15 ladies room, take two right turns, and for the 16 men's room, make two left turns. 17 I'll now call upon Assemblyman 18 Richard Gottfried. Please identify yourself 19 for the record by stating your name, and if 20 you represent an organization please state 21 your title and the name of the organization 22 you represent. Also, please identify which 23 proposal you are commenting on, 81.08 for the 7 1 trans fat restrictions or 81.50 for the 2 calorie-posting requirement. And please 3 remember that you must limit your remarks 4 to five minutes. 5 Will Assemblyman Richard Gottfried 6 or his representative come to the speaker's 7 table, please. If no one is here for 8 Assemblyman Gottfried, we'll now go to 9 Assemblyman Felix Ortiz. 10 ASSEMBLYMAN FELIX ORTIZ: Thank you 11 and good morning. First, I would like to 12 thank Dr. Frieden. I hope I pronounced it 13 right, and the Board members of the Health 14 Commission. 15 I think this is a historical public 16 hearing and a very first step forward to 17 ensure that the people of the City of 18 New York and the people of the State of 19 New York finally will have an opportunity 20 to make better choices for their healthy 21 lifestyles. 22 Good morning. My name is Assemblyman 23 Felix Ortiz. I represent the 51st Assembly 8 1 District in Brooklyn. As a state 2 representative, my priority has always been 3 to protect the life and health of all 4 New Yorkers. I have introduced and have 5 sponsored numerous pieces of legislation 6 to address the growing health care issues 7 including childhood obesity, diabetes, 8 anorexia, among others. 9 I have also tried to help bring 10 awareness to consumers so that they can 11 make health care choices for their families. 12 I welcome New York City's effort to improve 13 the health and the well-being of our 14 families and hope you are successful 15 right away. 16 We just found out that Kentucky 17 decided to remove trans fat this morning 18 so I think that you are really right now, 19 Commissioner and the Board, are making a 20 giant and significant impact. 21 Obesity and implications, such as 22 heart disease and diabetes, are serious 23 problems facing New York and America today. 9 1 We must all join together to solve this 2 problem. We are spending 3.5 billion 3 dollars in Medicaid alone in New York State 4 to treat the result of obesity. That is by 5 far the highest amount in the country. This 6 has also led to a diabetes epidemic which is 7 killing thousands of our citizens and also 8 costing billions of dollars. And these 9 problems are getting worse and are starting 10 at a very early age. 11 Several months ago, the New York City 12 Health Department issued a report that found 13 that by the age of 2 there is one in four 14 chances that a child will be obese if he or 15 she is from a low-income family. Well, let 16 me just point out that this is an issue that 17 just does not impact low-income families; this 18 is an issue that impacts all Americans in 19 this country. 20 When I first came to fight for 21 the Childhood Obesity Prevention Program 22 that finally came to law two years ago 23 in New York City, signed by the Governor, 10 1 this particular bill took us about five 2 years to get it done. The only way that 3 this bill has managed to pass both houses 4 and signed by the Governor was because I 5 have a wonderful senator from Buffalo who 6 finally came and said to me, \"Felix, I would 7 like to sponsor that bill because this is 8 not a Hispanic, African-American or Asian 9 issue by itself. This is also impacting 10 our people in Buffalo.\" And I will tell 11 you that I literally visited the 62 counties 12 throughout the state. Sixty-two counties to bring 13 awareness about the importance of why we had to 14 talk and address this issue, the childhood 15 obesity that is impacting our children in 16 our schools, in our community, in our 17 neighborhood and in our state. And we 18 need to bring everybody together. I think 19 it's very critical that we need to turn 20 this issue around for the children who 21 will suffer and for the taxpayers who 22 will pay later, including our partners 23 in the business sector. But to turn it 1 1 1 around, we need to take some giant steps 2 to prevent the problem from getting worse. 3 For example, food businesses need to provide 4 healthier alternatives that are really 5 healthy for our kids and our families, 6 especially in low-income neighborhoods where 7 healthy foods are hard to find or are very 8 expensive. That is why I strongly urge you 9 to adopt the new proposals, rules prohibiting 10 the use of artificial trans fats and requiring 11 calorie information for certain restaurants 12 in New York City. At least some of the 13 foods our children eat will be improved. 14 I hope that the next step will be banning 15 it across the state and eventually around 16 the country. 17 Each state in USA and every country 18 outside the United States, Mr. Commissioner, 19 you should feel proud that they today are 20 watching what's happening in New York City, 21 and, as a result of that, I wish you the best 22 and I hope that we can count on developing a 23 good collaboration and a good relationship. 12 1 It's not about partnership; it's about 2 relationship to understand each other better 3 with the private sector to make this happen. 4 Thank you very much. 5 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. 6 Assemblyman, I would note that your written 7 comments are submitted and will be made part 8 of the record including that part that you 9 didn't get to read. 10 The next speaker is Mr. Peter Vallone 11 from the New York City Council. 12 MR. PETER VALLONE: Thank you. I'll 13 be speaking of proposal 81.08. Let me start 14 off, Commissioner Frieden, and members of the 15 Board, by saying that, again, thank you all, 16 thank you very much. 17 I am proud to be part of a City where 18 our Board of Health cares so much about its 19 people. Let me state first off that I'm no 20 Johnny-Come-Lately to this issue. Before, as 21 you know, Commissioner, we spoke about this 22 before this Board took its unprecedented 23 action and are ready to do some resolutions 1 3 1 calling on the food industry to 2 eliminate trans fats and request that a 3 law be drafted banning trans fats. 4 I've held off on that law out of 5 deference to a learning body. You are the 6 experts. I want my law to codify what you 7 do. I will be moving forward eventually 8 because I think we can all agree that the 9 best way to send a message to this country 10 is through a law drafted by its legislation. 11 But again, you are the experts; I want to let 12 you take the lead on this and I will codify 13 what you do here today. 14 Why is the Public Safety chair of City 15 Council leading this fight in the legislature? 16 Because this is a Public Safety issue. 17 Trans fats kill kids; trans fats kill 18 adults. We have a duty and responsibility 19 to protect our citizens. We regulate 20 tobacco; we regulate alcohol to save lives. 21 This is no different. 22 I would like to let you know that 23 you have the full support of our Health 14 1 Chairs who are over there and our former 2 Health Chair now speaker, Christine Quinn. 3 Ideally, the Federal government 4 should be doing this, but the food industry 5 has so much influence there that Washington has 6 not gotten up off its trans fat filled 7 backside to do anything. It has taken 8 them -- it took them a decade to even get 9 the food industry to list trans fats on its 10 labels. We can't wait for them. It's once 11 again up to us, New York City, to protect 12 our kids and lead the way for the entire 13 nation. 14 By the way, if this is really about 15 choice, as some of the opponents are trying 16 to falsely say it is, why did the opponents 17 fight tooth and nail against putting trans 18 fats on food labels? To give consumers an 19 educated choice as to whether or not they 20 want to eat trans fats because it has 21 nothing to do with choice. 22 Some of the people who oppose this are 23 telling big, fat lies. They cannot only 15 1 serve Whoppers, they can tell them, too. 2 Rest assured, we will not be slapping 3 ice-cream cones away from any little girls 4 like some of the opponents' ads show. We 5 may, however, be saving those little girls' 6 lives. 7 Federal government may fall for that 8 type of nonsense, but this is New York City. 9 We consider ourselves a little smarter up 10 here. Heck, we banned lead paint 18 years 11 before the Federal government got around to 12 doing it, so we'll once again lead the way. 13 We'll have the same food, the same taste; 14 it will just be less poisonous. 15 I'll be brief, so let me close with 16 this. Because of the chemicals and the 17 additives that are being put in our foods, 18 because of the natural foods that they 19 process into poison food like high-fructose 20 corn syrup, trans fats, obesity, diabetes, 21 and heart disease are at epidemic levels. 22 We are forced to take action. We refuse 23 to let our bodies be dumping grounds for 16 1 companies looking to make profits. 2 History will report that the fight to save 3 our children, to reclaim our bodies and our 4 health, started right here in New York City 5 with us. 6 Commissioner, members of the Board, 7 I am so proud of you, and I, the City 8 Council, look forward to working together 9 with you to save lives. 10 Again, thank you for everything 11 you're doing, and I completely support you. 12 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The 13 next speaker is Kelly D. Brownell. 14 KELLY D. BROWNELL: Thank you for 15 the opportunity to speak before you today. 16 I hope that we all realize the historic 17 nature of these hearings and of these actions 18 that have been proposed in New York City. 19 The issue that comes most frequently 20 to my mind is why not do these things. 21 There is abundant science. The science is 22 fairly clear. This all seems in the spirit of 23 protecting consumer health and well-being, so 17 1 why in the heck will anybody oppose this? And 2 I would like to take what I think that these 3 arguments are going to be that you are 4 about to hear and address them one by one. 5 By now, the industry has a pretty 6 predictable script in fighting off advances 7 to protect public health, and I think you 8 will hear the script played out today. 9 First of all, you will hear claims 10 that it's hard to do. Well, the entire 11 country of Denmark has gone trans fat free. 12 Famous for its pastries and its desserts, 13 Denmark seems to have survived just fine. 14 Today, KFC is going to announce they're removing 15 of trans fats from all their foods so it can 16 obviously be done. 17 Second, is that somehow the little 18 guy will get hurt, the little guy being 19 small restaurant owners. Well, the little 20 house are what we'll go to when the 21 restaurant industry oppose getting rid 22 of smoking in their places of business. 23 Now, you may remember how hard they 24 fought public awareness to do that, but, in 18 1 fact, that turned out to be a great benefit 2 for public health, and, in fact, the little guy 3 is not going to be hurt by this. 4 Another thing you'll hear is the 5 moving target that science presents that 6 one day we hear X and the next day we hear 7 Y, and scientists can't agree on anything. 8 Well, in fact, that's not a bite; that is a 9 virtue because if science didn't change, we 10 wouldn't learn as time went on. We'd simply 11 be using leaches to cure people from dreaded 12 diseases, but, in fact, there is a predictable 13 order in the way that science proceeds. 14 First, you have the original evidence. 15 You have other evidence that comes out. 16 Sometimes it supports the initial evidence, 17 sometimes it doesn't. But at some point, 18 you develop a robust amount of science to 19 support public-health action, and I believe 20 we are at the point now where the sciences 21 are robusting on this particular issue. 22 And so the fact that the science changes, is 23 good; it's necessary; it's completely to be 24 expected, and it's not true that scientists 19 1 don't agree on this. 2 Generally, when cries are raised that 3 scientists don't agree on some issue related 4 to public health, it's mainly industry-funded 5 science that might contradict what otherwise 6 is a pretty robust finding. 7 Second, there will be the claim 8 that consumers are somehow hurt by this. 9 That their choices are being restricted, 10 they won't have the same foods available, 11 they'll have to pay more and the food will 12 taste worse. None of these things really 13 turn out to be the case, and so I believe 14 these are the superficial reasons that 15 appear today. 16 The real reason is that industry 17 wants to be able to do whatever it wants 18 with the food it serves people and doesn't 19 want anybody telling them any different. So I 20 believe that trans fat is a very hard change 21 for the industry to make. They're fighting 22 you getting involved later in other issues 23 related to food supply, which I think is a 24 completely appropriate thing for the health 20 1 Commissioners to do. 2 And then finally, you'll hear clear cries 3 of freedom, somehow that consumers' choices 4 and freedom are being restricted by this but 5 in fact they're enhanced. Freedom is the 6 opportunity to live in a society where one 7 is free of dangerous things in food, the 8 air, the water. And health officials step in 9 routinely to protect us from these things, 10 and I believe that is the case where freedom 11 is enhanced by this rather than defeated by 12 it. 13 If we look at the real reasons that I 14 believe are behind this, the industry has 15 been tremendously successful in fighting off 16 any Federal legislation, as Mr. Vallone said. 17 They've also been very effective in preventing 18 action at the state level so the local level 19 becomes not only important but absolutely 20 necessary in this fight to improve diet 21 overall. And so this is very much a 22 precedent setting event. 23 I would like to also add an economic 24 concept here of optimal faults. What we 25 hope to do in public health is to set up 21 1 conditions where the default leaders, that is, 2 when you drink the water, you are by default 3 getting something healthy into your body. 4 You're not given a choice of contaminated 5 water and good water and then expected to 6 make the choice of the good water. You're 7 only given the good water; you're given good 8 air; you're given things like this. This is 9 very, very important in setting up 10 conditions that will help the public health. 11 The industry that will come up and 12 contest these are the same industries as I 13 said that forth the smoking ban in restaurants. 14 They're fighting the state legislation tooth and 15 nail to do anything related to public health 16 and they're also I believe trying to deflate 17 the trans fat action here with the calorie 18 labeling action. These are two very 19 different things. 20 The trans fat action will not do 21 much about the obesity problem. You switch 22 one fat for another, you have some number of 23 calories. That is a health related move. 24 The calorie wave which I think has been 25 lost in the shuffle here because everybody 22 1 is focused on trans fat is what I believe 2 scares the industry the most. Because what 3 is likely to happen is consumers will have 4 sticker shock when they see the calories in 5 the food they have. That means they'll demand 6 smaller portions, the industries has its 7 profit margins hurt by this and I believe 8 that's what they're fighting. 9 So thank you for considering this. 10 I hope the history is a positive one. 11 WILFREDO LOPEZ: If I may just 12 ask the public to hold off on your 13 applause. Also, I would like to read 14 people's titles as I call them. I did 15 not do that with Dr. Brownell. He is a 16 Professor of Psychology, Epidemiology and 17 Public Health, Director of the Rudd Center 18 for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale 19 University. 20 The next speaker is Dr. Elena Rios, 21 President of the National Hispanic Medical 22 Association. Is Dr. Rios here? 23 The next speaker is Zebulon Taintor, 24 President of the New York County Medical 25 Society. 23 1 ZEBULON TAINTOR: Good morning. I 2 will try and be very brief. I have here 3 prepared testimony by Dr. Dennis Cage who 4 is a renowned nutritionist, I'm speaking on 5 behalf of all five County Borough medical 6 societies. The President of that group is 7 Kenneth Booker, himself an expert in insulin 8 resistant diabetes so there's a lot of us 9 but it's very simple. We are in favor of those 10 initiatives. We are delighted that these 11 are proceeding. We would very much like to 12 support both the cardiovascular and diabetes 13 initiatives that the Department of Health 14 has undertaken. 15 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 16 speaker is Amie Hamlin, Executive Director, 17 New York Coalition for Healthy School 18 Lunches. 19 Okay, the next speaker is Stephen L. 20 Joseph, CEO of BanTransFats.com. 21 STEPHEN L. JOSEPH: Good morning. 22 My name is Stephen Joseph. I bring you 23 greetings from my home base of Tiburon 24 California, America's first trans fat free 25 City. We support the proposed trans fat 24 1 regulation and congratulate the 2 Commissioner, the Board of Health, and the 3 Mayor for this important and enlightened 4 initiative that will make New York America's 5 second trans fat free City. 6 How did we do Project Tiburon to 7 make it trans fat free? We asked all 8 restaurants in Tiburon that were 9 frying with partially hydrogenated cooking 10 oils to switch to trans fat free oils. 11 They all agreed without hesitation, no 12 excuses, no moaning, they just got on with 13 it. The transition happened literally over- 14 night. Not one restaurant owner in Tiburon 15 has had anything negative to say about the 16 change. 17 One Tiburon restaurant fries huge 18 volumes of French fries, chicken and fish 19 for at least 10 hours a day. They've been 20 using the same amount of new oil now for two 21 years. They say the new oil is costing 22 about the same as the partially hydrogenated 23 oil they've previously used because the new 24 oil, while having a slightly higher cost has 25 a longer fry life. That's what's important 25 1 to restaurant owners, fry life. I eat there 2 often. The food is just as crispy and tasty 3 as any other fried food. It is a myth that 4 food cooked in non-partially hydrogenated 5 oil doesn't taste as good, natural oil 6 tastes better. If trans fat free oils work 7 in Tiburon, they'll work in New York, period. 8 We did project Tiburon because we 9 wanted it to be an inspiration and a model 10 for other cities and towns. After Project 11 Tiburon was adopted in 2004, I was contacted 12 by New York City officials interested in 13 developing a similar program here, and I was 14 very happy to assist. 15 In 2005, New York City launched a 16 comprehensive trans fat education campaign. 17 However, an education campaign could never 18 be expected to produce acceptable results 19 for a City truly committed to solving the 20 trans fat problem. Regulation, however, will 21 guarantee virtual 100% success. 22 To say the restaurant operations all the 23 way up to medium-sized restaurant chains, there 24 are many trans fat free cooking 25 oils on the market today which 26 1 are used in hundreds of thousands of 2 restaurants across the country. There are 3 also many trans fat free baking shortenings, 4 including the trans fat free Crisco. 5 Availability of trans fat free alternatives 6 is simply not a problem. The large, fast 7 food chains have special issues, but nothing 8 that justifies considering delays in 9 getting the job done. 10 McDonald's announced a change to a 11 trans fat oil in 2002, but it never implemented 12 it. It is now almost 2007. That's an 13 unreasonable delay. When you want to get 14 something done, you set a deadline. New York 15 should say to McDonald's and other chains who 16 haven't made the change yet, \"You've had more 17 than enough time. Wendy's, KFC and others 18 have done it so can you. You've got six 19 months to finish the job, no more excuses.\" 20 Now, if you say that to them, you will 21 galvanize them and they'll succeed. 22 A combination of litigation and 23 proposed regulation galvanized KFC. It 24 works. It will certainly help if there 25 was less negativity and a more cooperative 27 1 attitude by all concerned. I think that some 2 people have got their priorities wrong. 3 Public health must be the number one 4 priority. 5 Now let's switch hats. I'm 6 also here in my capacity as the CEO of a new 7 company called Frytest.com. Frytest.com 8 is holding a contest to find out which are 9 the best zero trans fat restaurant cooking 10 oils. About 12 companies, including 11 several major manufacturers, will be entering 12 about 18 oils in the contest. The contest 13 will take place at Texas A&M University 14 commencing in December. 15 University personnel will compare 16 the relative fry lives of each oil, and 50 17 consumers will sample French fries cooked in 18 each oil to see which one they like best. 19 The results will be posted on the Frytest.com 20 web site so that restaurant owners 21 nationwide will have mutual verified data 22 comparing available trans fat free oils. 23 The Frytest.com web site will become a great 24 source of information to restaurant 25 owners. 28 1 One more thing. I was talking 2 earlier about the spirit necessary to make 3 this initiative succeed. We don't need foot 4 dragging and we don't need negativity. 5 There's one person who does have 6 his priorities right and he's here today, and 7 he is the co-owner of Jason's Deli. On 8 his initiative, Jason has removed the 9 partially hydrogenated oil from all of its 10 156 restaurants in 20 states among 11 1.6 million school box lunches per year. 12 Instead of making excuses, he got the 13 job done. That's the spirit that New York 14 needs. I hope that's the spirit we hear 15 today, and I hope some of the people who are 16 coming up here later to try to wreck this 17 proposal start to think with a bit more 18 imagination. Thank you very much. 19 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Next speaker is 20 Joseph Aranha, member of the public. Is 21 Mr. Aranha here? 22 Next speaker is Michael Jacobson, 23 Executive Director, Center for Science in 24 the Public Interest. 25 MICHAEL JACOBSON: Good morning. 29 1 I greatly appreciate the opportunity to 2 speak at this hearing, and I applaud the 3 Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 4 for its two ground breaking 5 proposals that would make it easier 6 to eat healthfully in this great City. 7 Let me start with the trans fat 8 that is introduced into foods primarily 9 through the use of partially hydrogenated 10 fats. These fats were long thought to be 11 safe, a conclusion affirmed by FDA Advisory 12 Committees in 1976 and 1985. 13 However, in 1990, new research 14 indicated that trans fat adversely affects 15 blood cholesterol levels and increases the 16 risk of heart disease. Since then, studies 17 have shown that trans fat is not only 18 harmful, but gram for gram is the single 19 most harmful fat in the food supply. 20 Trans fat is a problem for the 21 entire nation, but at least you here today 22 can protect the diners in New York City now. 23 About half of partially hydrogenated 24 fats are used for frying. Those uses can 30 1 easily be replaced using any number of 2 liquid natural oils. Naturals oils may cost 3 more per gallon but some restaurants, like 4 Wendy's, find they last longer in the fryer 5 and actually save them money. 6 Partially hydrogenated fats are 7 easy to replace when solid fats are needed, 8 such as in some baked goods. However, in 9 grocery stores where many baked goods are 10 made with partially hydrogenated shortening 11 some brands of the same foods are made with 12 high oleic, granola oil, palm oil, products 13 like trans free Crisco and other trans free 14 shortenings. Those substitutes are trans 15 free and contain less heart damaging 16 saturated plus trans fat than products made 17 with partially hydrogenated oil. 18 It certainly will take time and 19 effort for companies to switch to those 20 less harmful shortenings, and the Health 21 Department should do everything it can to 22 help, through printed materials, the internet, 23 and free advice over the telephone. 24 The nice thing about getting rid of 31 1 trans fat is that New Yorkers will enjoy 2 improved health without needing to make any 3 effort on their own. Restaurant foods will 4 automatically be healthier, and the switch to 5 healthier oil should save on the order of 6 several hundred lives per year. Of course, 7 New Yorkers would be even better off if 8 trans fat were eliminated from packaged 9 foods, and perhaps the Board of Health can 10 encourage the Food and Drug Administration 11 to take action on that front also. 12 The Health Department's second 13 important proposal would require large 14 chain restaurants to list the calorie 15 contents of their standard items on menus 16 and menu boards. 17 Studies show that three-quarters of 18 people who use nutrition labels on packaged 19 foods, also show that the use 20 of those labels is associated with healthier 21 diets. 22 I'm sure that many McDonald's 23 customers would switch from a large to a 24 small order of fries if they knew that the 32 1 small contains 300 fewer calories. Many 2 Starbucks customers would change their 3 orders if they were informed that a large 4 white chocolate frappuccino with whipped 5 cream contains 760 calories. 6 Considering that obesity rates in 7 adults have doubled, and in teenagers have 8 tripled over the last 30 years, 9 requiring calories on menu and menu boards 10 is a logical extension of nutritional 11 packaging. 12 Companies say that listing calories 13 simply can't be done. There's no space on 14 menus and menu boards, but they always manage 15 to find space for pictures of those combo 16 meals or the latest marketing campaign or 17 new food items. And they say that there are 18 too many varieties for foods or meals but 19 they themselves have nutrition brochures 20 that provide the nutrient content of their 21 standard items. They say that providing 22 brochures or web sites or posters that 23 provide complete nutrition information would 24 be far more helpful to consumers than simply 33 1 listing calories on menus. But 20 years 2 ago, McDonald's itself derived at the notion of 3 providing nutrition on packaging because 4 consumers don't see it until after they buy 5 the foods. 6 Listing calories next to each item 7 on menus and menu boards would be feasible, 8 useful, and inexpensive, and the benefit to 9 consumers would be great. I only regret 10 that the proposal doesn't cover more 11 restaurants. 12 And I'd like to leave here a more 13 complete written testimony, and I've left 14 your clerk letters from 300 New Yorkers, 15 members of the Center for Science in the 16 Public Interest, who support both measures. 17 Thank you very much. 18 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 19 speaker is Fern Gale Estrow, MS, RN, CEN. 20 FERN GALE ESTROW: Good morning. I 21 want to thank Commissioner Frieden and the 22 New York City Department of Health and 23 Mental Hygiene and their Board for taking 24 the initiative to propose important changes 25 to this City's Health Code which are the focus 34 2 of these hearings. 3 I am Fern Gale Estrow, a Registered 4 Dietician who formerly ran corporate dining 5 rooms in consultation with food service 6 operations in another career. Currently, I'm a 7 Nutrition Consultant working predominantly 8 in the New York City area with Head Start 9 programs and low income communities. 10 As a food service operator I ran both 11 food operations locally and nationally. My 12 background is important as my testimony will 13 address the populations I currently work 14 with and some of the questions and concerns 15 that have been raised over the past few 16 weeks. 17 I would like to acknowledge while I 18 am not speaking on behalf of any of these 19 organizations, I am an active member of the 20 New York City Food Network, New York City 21 Nutrition Education Network, the American 22 Dietetic Association and providing nutrition. 23 I would like to go on record as supporting 24 these amendments. 35 1 Statistics associated with New York 2 City's Head Start population are known to 3 those who work in the community. There was 4 a study conducted by our Health Department 5 and the Agency for Children Services in 6 October of 2004. Height and weight data was 7 collected for over 16,000 Hispanic children 8 in New York City and it reflected that 27% 9 of our children were obese. In addition, 10 15% were overweight. About one in four Head 11 Start children is obese at age 2, by age 12 4 almost one in three. This means that 13 more than 40% of our Head Start children are 14 overweight or obese and others such as 15 African-American children, are at greatest 16 risk. 17 Health conditions associated with 18 weight include diabetes and heart disease 19 and many other conditions that many of you 20 will hear about through the course of the 21 day. 22 The Hispanic and African American 23 population suffer disproportionately from this 24 this and several other conditions mentioned. 36 1 Diabetes now affects three-quarters 2 of a million New Yorkers, and indicated an 3 increase of diabetes amongst children. 4 There was a time when Type II diabetes was 5 the reference. It is the current 6 reference. That was because we had to 7 change it from the term adult onset diabetes 8 because it does apply to children. 9 Having menus with calorie information 10 easily accessible prior to purchase is 11 important for the public to make informed 12 decisions. I also believe it is important 13 to point out the technology access issue. 14 Low income populations, 15 some of those at greatest risk, 16 are the least likely to have 17 active computer based information which is 18 where many companies know the information 19 is available. 20 It is also these communities that 21 we have the highest density of fast food 22 outlets operated by companies with an 23 internet presence. Putting this data on a 24 wrapper or at the bottom of the fast food 37 1 cart is not sufficient. 2 The argument offered by some of these 3 fast food industries is that standardized 4 recipes would be required to provide 5 information. If a company is posting this 6 information for the public, they should have 7 used trans fat recipes to begin with. 8 In addition, I assure you the sector of 9 that and the bottom line for a food 10 service establishment with multiple outlets, 11 standardization is the way to go, simply 12 based on production controls. 13 As for the fear that companies will 14 defraud this information to the public based 15 on this amendment, I would suggest they would 16 not want to be associated with that level of 17 negative publicity. 18 With regard to trans fat, the 19 mandatory removal of harmful artificial 20 trans fat is to accept that it's in the 21 interest of the health of all New York City 22 citizens and again potentially impact the most 23 vulnerable, our children. 38 1 Please note I work with the emergency 2 food system and am a former Chair of the 3 Hunger and Environmental Nutrition Council of 4 the American Dietetics Association. 5 While I do not speak for this group, 6 my involvement speaks to my awareness of the 7 complex relationship between food resources 8 and the industry providers, including 9 restaurants, sidewalk vendors, schools, 10 Day Cares, Head Start programs and emergency 11 food providers is critical. 12 I have heard concern spread that shelters 13 from establishments will be dumped on the 14 emergency food community. Much 15 has been the case, in part are no longer 16 acceptable, such as low carbs. In this 17 instance, we are talking about a dangerous 18 substance that should not be permitted in 19 the emergency food systems. Food companies 20 have known for a long time that partially 21 hydrogenated oils are unsafe and are working 22 to replace these with more acceptable 23 alternatives. I have provided documentation to 39 1 this effect. I also heard a suggestion that 2 food companies may not provide the good food 3 unless the emergency food community would accept 4 the bad food. Again, I'm suggesting that 5 negative publicity and that they do not want 6 their tax write-off removed. 7 It is appropriate for our government 8 and our food companies to use -- it is 9 inappropriate for them to use our low income 10 population as a dumping ground. It is my 11 hope the UFD will take this opportunity to 12 address this right now. I thank you, and I 13 support these proposals. 14 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. I have been 15 asked to make an announcement. There are a lot 16 of people who cannot get into the room who may 17 want to speak, so we would ask that all staff 18 who have not been directed to be here by 19 their supervisors, should leave and make 20 room for the public. Thank you. 21 The next speaker is E. Charles Hunt, 22 Executive Vice President, New York State 23 Restaurant Association. 24 CHARLES HUNT: Good morning. I'm 40 1 Charles Hunt. I'm the Executive Vice 2 President of the New York City Chapter of 3 the New York State Restaurant Association. 4 I wish to speak on both proposals. 5 I am here to discuss the efforts that are 6 taking place in New York City's 24,000 7 food service establishments to eliminate 8 artificial trans fats and underscore our 9 desire to work with the City on this issue. 10 I am also here to lay out some of our 11 concerns about the Board of Health's 12 proposed ban on trans fats as well as 13 the menu labeling proposal. 14 Both are measures we think, while 15 well-intentioned, will unfortunately not 16 achieve the health benefits sought by the 17 Board. I am particularly concerned that 18 the lack of education on this issue among the 19 City's restaurants coupled with significant 20 fines are a recipe for disaster that could be 21 devastating for New York City's restaurants, 22 the City's largest private sector employer 23 of over 200,000 food service workers. 24 I think we can agree that the outcome 41 1 of that Board of Health and the New York City 2 Restaurant Association seeks is the same, to 3 see a move away from trans fats in oils and 4 products consumed in restaurants. However, 5 the challenges and potential unintended 6 consequences of the proposal to ban trans 7 fats in the time span of 18 months have not 8 been fully thought out. 9 Many people may wonder why trans 10 fats are being used in the first place. 11 To briefly explain, several years ago 12 medical opinion pointed to concerns over 13 saturated fats like butter and lard and 14 the need for more healthy alternatives. 15 As a result, many restaurants substituted 16 partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and 17 other alternatives containing trans fats in 18 oils, margarines, shortenings in prepared 19 foods. 20 Now that science has progressed 21 and the medical community is telling us 22 that trans fat has negative health effects, 23 restaurateurs have been looking for 24 alternatives. But this cannot be 42 1 accomplished overnight or even in 2 18 months. In fact, the reason all 3 restaurants have not switched to trans 4 fat-free options is that there simply are 5 not enough suitable trans fat free products 6 and oils on the market today. 7 This is truly a farm-to-table issue. 8 It takes time to develop, plant, harvest and 9 process new alternative crops and test new 10 oils. Because of this supply problem, if an 11 18 month timetable were enacted, many of the 12 City's restaurateurs would have no choice 13 but to switch to oils high in unhealthy 14 saturated fats, a move opposed by experts as 15 a backward step for public health. As the 16 Chair of the American Heart Association's 17 Nutrition Committee concluded, \"Consumers 18 should avoid increasing their intake of 19 saturated fat in an effort to minimize trans 20 fat.\" A ban would mean exactly that for 21 consumers. Many restaurateurs would be 22 forced to use alternatives like palm oil 23 which is high in saturated fats. 24 In addition to serving customers, 43 1 New York's restaurants are customers, too. 2 We buy from food manufacturers before 3 preparing many products in our kitchens. 4 But many of the foods we prepare depend upon to 5 serve our customers, from French fries to 6 pastries and baked goods, contain trans 7 fats. And while great strides are being 8 made to provide more trans fat free oils 9 and foods, there simply will not be enough 10 supply available in the next year and a 11 half to supply all of New York City's 12 24,000 restaurants. 13 The Department of Health clearly 14 has not considered the impact to the small 15 businesses of New York City, the small 16 restaurants that are the backbone of many 17 communities within our city. The small 18 family owned independent operators who 19 have the fewest resources will be hit the 20 hardest, facing dramatic changes to their 21 menus, their pricing and their business 22 models. 23 This ban threatens popular dishes 24 and affordable menus, all of which are 44 1 critical to economic survival in a business 2 where the typical profit margin is about 3 three cents on every dollar spent by their 4 customers. 5 The City's ethnic restaurateurs 6 who provide such an extraordinary range 7 of dishes from around the world would 8 be particularly impacted. While it is 9 relatively easy to find trans fat-free 10 substitutes for some foods, many classic 11 New York and ethnic dishes are more 12 difficult to prepare in this way, whether 13 it's cannoli, eclairs, egg rolls or 14 fresh-baked cookies. 15 Ironically, the outreach and 16 education by the Board of Health has been 17 almost nonexistent. In a City where small 18 businesses and tourism are so critically 19 important, it is my understanding that no 20 economic impact study of this proposed ban 21 has been undertaken by the City. 22 Far from helping restaurateurs figure 23 out how to move away from trans fats, just a 24 letter and a brochure were mailed out last 45 1 year mentioning the voluntary ban which the 2 Department now opposes. And in a survey of 3 my members, only a few reported that they 4 had been contacted by the Department of Health 5 inspector in any way on this issue. 6 To my knowledge, nothing has been 7 communicated to New York's 8 restaurateurs in terms of practical advice 9 from any of the City's health inspectors 10 when visiting restaurants. Yet, the 11 Department could now impose hefty fines for 12 restaurateurs found in breach of this ban. 13 I am here to tell you that a fine is not an 14 educational process. The City needs to get 15 serious about working with, not against its 16 restaurateurs to achieve this goal that we 17 share in common. I am here today to ask you 18 to sit down with us and start that 19 conversation. 20 Moving to the menu labeling issue, 21 I would first like to point out that the 22 remarkable efforts that have been made by 23 many of the City's restaurants and chain 24 restaurants in the past few years to provide 46 1 more nutrition information to customers on 2 the web, in brochures, posters, tray liners 3 and in other forms. 4 May I continue just a few more 5 minutes? 6 WILFREDO LOPEZ: We really do have 7 a lot of speakers. If you have your written 8 testimony please submit it and it will be 9 incorporated in the record and provided 10 to the Board. 11 CHARLES HUNT: Yes, I have submitted 12 my written testimony. I just would like to 13 say that our industry wants to work with the 14 Board to do what is in the best interest of 15 our customers' health, the City's economy 16 and our restaurants. We look forward to the 17 opportunity to establish an ongoing dialogue 18 with the Board of Health toward a shared 19 goal of providing restaurant customers with 20 information so that they can make positive 21 nutrition and lifestyle choices. 22 Thank you for the opportunity to 23 speak. 24 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 47 1 speaker is Peter H. Kostmayer, President, 2 Citizens for New York City. Is Mr. Kostmayer 3 here? If not, the next speaker is Joel Berg, 4 Executive Director, New York City Coalition 5 Against Hunger. 6 JOEL BERG: Good morning. I'm Joel 7 Berg. I'm Executive Director of the 8 New York City Coalition Against Hunger. We 9 represent the more than 1,200 soup kitchens 10 and food pantries in New York City and 11 more than 1.2 million New Yorkers who are 12 forced to rely on these agencies. 13 My testimony offers a bit more 14 detail, written testimony, but basically has 15 three themes. One, we generally support the 16 ban on trans fat and the improved labeling. 17 Two, those are only small drops in the 18 bucket compared to the broad public health 19 measures that need to be taken to reduce 20 obesity and to reduce hunger in New York 21 City. And related to that, if food isn't 22 acceptable or isn't affordable, we're 23 creating a two-tiered system where better 24 healthier foods are only available to the 48 1 wealthy, not for the more than 1.8 million 2 New Yorkers living below the poverty line. 3 And three, we have very grave concerns about 4 how this is going to impact emergency food 5 systems in New York. And let me go through 6 each of those one by one very briefly. 7 We support the ban. I won't go 8 over all the reasons that so many much more 9 accomplished public health experts have given 10 except that we are often critical of the City. 11 For instance, on food stamps we want to know why 12 370,000 fewer people are getting food stamps 13 today in New York City than 10 years ago 14 and that's hundreds of millions of dollars 15 that could be and should be used to better 16 purchase nutritious foods. So that when we 17 put in our support for the mayor, a lot of 18 people were shocked, and I got a lot of angry 19 e-mails from people telling us what are you, 20 engaging in any state? You've deprived us free 21 choice. And I think the key point that 22 needs to be made over and over again is, if 23 you don't know something, you can't make an 24 informed choice. If the information isn't 49 1 available whether trans fats are in your 2 food, you are not making an informed choice. 3 And by the way, if you're served food at a 4 food pantry or soup kitchen you have no 5 choice whatsoever. 6 I have a little crop today on the 7 importance of broader nutrition labeling. 8 These were all bought within two blocks of 9 my office on Beaver Street two blocks from 10 here. One claims to have one portion; one 11 claims to have two portions, one claims to 12 have five portions. They are all nearly 13 identical to the naked eye. By the way, 14 none of them have trans fats and all of 15 them were delicious. 16 My point is we need a much broader 17 effort in the City to have labeling, to have 18 choice, to have affordability. We're about 19 to put out a study that shows that fresh 20 produce, whole grains, are what's available 21 in low income neighborhoods and less 22 affordable in low income neighborhoods. So 23 again, if you're taking things out of the market 24 and increasing prices what's going to happen 50 1 to all these people eating at restaurants? 2 And so that is a really critical note to 3 point out over and over again, we need more 4 users of food stamps. WIC utilization is 5 far below the national average in New York 6 City. Participation in the school breakfast 7 program, are the mere great things to make 8 university program. 80% of the kids are 9 eligible for school breakfast in New York 10 City do not get it. So again you use this 11 form to strongly support speaker Christine 12 Quinn's call for the city office of food 13 policy that will really coordinate these 14 issues. That's 90% of a high profile stance 15 for taking trans fats out of restaurants 16 but again there are 1.2 million low income 17 New Yorkers who the Federal government 18 not us, unreliable advocates, the Federal 19 government describes as food-insecure. The 20 Mayor says there is no one starving in New York 21 City, that's true. But according to the 22 Federal government, there are people choosing 23 between food and rent. There are people 24 buying less nutrition, more fattening, less 51 1 expensive food for their families. There 2 are kids going to school nonprepared to do 3 well on tests or focused because they don't 4 have enough food. So again the point is 5 look at this in the broader picture. 6 Again pantries and kitchens most are 7 run in New York City by unpaid volunteers. 8 My reading of the regulation, it would cover 9 soup kitchens but not food pantries. 10 A little crazy if you are a volunteer 11 organization. About half the agencies in 12 New York City are food pantries, roughly 13 half are soup kitchens that will be covered 14 and roughly a quarter have both. So imagine 15 you are a volunteer-run soup kitchen and 16 food pantry and you have one already 17 paperwork nightmare and you have a physical 18 quarantine nightmare as a volunteer-run 19 agency coming up with separate storage room for 20 the food you can use in these soup kitchens, 21 but not in your food pantries. 22 I know other people are going 23 to speak from hunger groups about the 24 difficulty of accepting donated food. 52 1 The reality is that the pantries and 2 kitchens in New York City today do not 3 have enough food to meet the growing need. 4 According to a survey our group did 5 last year, nearly half, 47%, had to turn away 6 New Yorkers because they were running out 7 of food currently. We urge, of course, the 8 City, the State, the Federal government, to 9 increase uses of Federal nutrition 10 assistance program so people don't have to 11 go to pantries and kitchens, but when they 12 do, the money has got to be there. There can 13 not be continued proposals to cut these 14 programs at the state level funding for soup 15 kitchens and food pantries, and the Hip Now 16 Program is two million dollars less. We 17 need more funding to make sure that agencies 18 that have to take out the trans fat don't 19 have to make more people go hungry. 20 Thank you for your time. 21 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The 22 next speaker is Lori Tansman, Nutritional 23 Coordinator, Mount Sinai Hospital. 24 LORI TANSMAN: Good morning. I 53 1 want to address the two proposals from 2 the perspective of public health policy. 3 When it comes to public health, 4 there are two opposing theories, minimal 5 documented interference and social justice 6 philosophy. This refers to the fact that 7 society may share in the responsibility for 8 a person's health. In this situation, the 9 government is that society. 10 The mission of public health is to 11 assure conditions in which people can be 12 healthy. To assure this requires policies 13 that do result in government intervention 14 such as the recent actions by the FDA 15 regarding the spinach scare with E-coli. 16 As per Dr. Sarah Edelstein in her 17 textbook which she edited, Nutrition and 18 Public Health, we want the government to 19 ensure that our food supply is safe, yet 20 we also want the freedom to purchase 21 unhealthful food. 22 In regard to the trans fat ban in 23 food service establishments, consumers do 24 not essentially have the freedom to make 54 1 unhealthful choices because many of them 2 are not even aware that they are making 3 unhealthful choice. There are many ways 4 that trans fats are used in food preparation 5 unbeknownst to the consumer. 6 I have personally witnessed the use 7 of large amounts of partially hydrogenated 8 fat that was added to the dish in which a 9 frozen half of spring chicken was being 10 broiled. The chicken was indeed being 11 broiled as indicated on the menu but was 12 also being fried as it was being cooked in 13 large amounts of fat at high temperatures. 14 But the innocent consumer had no idea of 15 this and so was unknowingly going to be 16 consuming large amounts of unhealthy trans 17 fats. 18 With the approval of this, ban 19 consumers will be protected from the 20 unknowing consumption of such an unhealthful 21 food ingredient. In this way, the 22 government, that is, the New York City 23 government, is interfering to assure a safe 24 food supply. But if this ban is going to 55 1 have a successful impact on the public 2 health and assure safe food supply, then it 3 must also include that the fats that will be 4 used in place of the trans fat be healthful 5 fats or neutral fats, not other unhealthful 6 fats such as many saturated fats. 7 In regard to the second proposal, 8 this is an outstanding step by the New York 9 City government in helping the public to 10 be an educated consumer, yet allowing that 11 consumer the freedom to make what might 12 be an unhealthy food choice if that consumer 13 has a significant weight problem and a 14 particular menu item is especially 15 calorically dense. 16 The next step will be in requiring 17 all restaurants to make available the 18 caloric amount of their menu items. This 19 would be a wonderful government initiative 20 to help in directing the pandemic of 21 obesity. 22 Now, this is really just an innocent 23 turkey sandwich. It's a great healthful 24 choice. Can you guess how many calories are 56 1 in it? It's five ounces of turkey breast, 2 two slices of rye bread; 396 calories which 3 is fine, but, you know, the person says well, 4 you know, I had this low calorie turkey 5 sandwich not knowing how many calories are 6 in here so you know what, I can treat myself 7 to maybe a piece of cake for dessert or maybe 8 I'll treat myself to the French fries and 9 thereby, you put the calorie content of that 10 lunch way over a thousand calories. Thank you. 11 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. It is 12 now 11:00 o'clock, and at the end of each 13 hour I will try to recall those who missed 14 their turn. So is Richard Gottfried or his 15 representative here? If not, Dr. Elena 16 Rios, President of the National Hispanic 17 Medical Association. 18 ELENA RIOS: Mr. Frieden and 19 members of the Health Board, 20 and Dr. Caro whom I was just presented to 21 this weekend. 22 I am honored to join you today. I 23 am Dr. Elena Rios, President and CEO of the 24 National Hispanic Medical Association, a 57 1 non-profit association representing over 2 36,000 licensed Hispanic physicians in the 3 United States. 4 The mission of NHMA is to improve 5 the health of Hispanics and other 6 underserved. Our foundation, the National 7 Hispanic Health Foundation, which directs 8 research and national Hispanic health 9 professionals through the scholarship 10 program, is affiliated with the Robert F. 11 Wagner, Graduate School of Public Service, 12 New York University. 13 Hispanics are the largest ethnic 14 group in the United States, a number of 15 40 million people or 14% of the U.S. 16 population. Hispanics are a young 17 population with less access to health care 18 services due to being the group with the 19 largest proportion of black and health 20 insurance, least educational attainment, 21 high poverty rates, living in areas that 22 are medically undeserved, and having few 23 Hispanics in the health work force and little 24 information in Spanish who are targeted to our 58 1 community. 2 I am here today to support the 3 proposals of the New York City Health 4 Department to faze out artificial trans 5 fats and to increase calorie information 6 at point of purchase in restaurant in 7 New York City because we believe policies 8 that will change our environment, encourage 9 the public to make better nutrition 10 decisions will lead to decreased heart 11 disease and obesity in our society. 13 ELENA RIOS: NHMA has partnered 14 with the U.S. Department of Health and Human 15 Services, the Clinton Foundation, the 16 American Heart Association, and the Robert 17 Wood Johnson Foundation in a campaign where 18 NHMA doctors tell students and parents and 19 teachers in our middle schools to change 20 their nutrition habits in New York, 21 California, and Texas, the states with the 22 largest Hispanic populations in our country. 23 Heart disease is the major cause of 24 death in our country and obesity has been 59 1 recognized by the Center for Disease Control 2 and Prevention this year as a disease with 3 the greatest potential to lead to mortality 4 from chronic diseases in our country 5 surpassing smoking tobacco. 6 There are several societal factors 7 since the 1950s from the start of the TV 8 dinners, fast food restaurants, women 9 working, schools purchasing foods and 10 beverages outside of government lunch 11 programs, et cetera, that have contributed 12 to the rise of these diseases, and obesity 13 especially is an epidemic in our current 14 generation. 15 This is the first generation where 16 parents will be burying their children with 17 chronic diseases seen earlier and earlier. 18 Not only are Hispanics afflicted with higher 19 rates of obesity and heart disease in the 20 general population, since they are a younger 21 population, the rates of increase are greater 22 for children and adolescents in our 23 communities. Hispanics and other poor 24 minority populations will become afflicted 60 1 with greater rates, all of chronic diseases, 2 diabetes, heart disease, et cetera. 3 Higher health costs will be shifted 4 to our clinics and our hospitals and there 5 will be lowering of quality life and 6 premature death. In some way the National 7 Hispanic Medical Association supports the 8 proposals of the New York City Department 9 of Health and Mental Hygiene for restaurants 10 to have partial take-out of artificial trans 11 fats and the point of purchase for calorie 12 labeling because these efforts will assist 13 in decreasing heart disease and obesity and 14 reverse the trend of premature death for all 15 Americans. Thank you. 16 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 17 speaker who missed her turn was Amie Hamlin; 18 is she here? If not, the next one was Joseph 19 Aranha; okay. Then the next one was 20 Peter Kostmayer. 21 Okay, then we'll go to our next 22 registered speaker, John R. Whipple, 23 President, National Counsel of Chain 24 Restaurants. Mr. Whipple here? Okay. 61 1 Sheila Cohn Weiss, National 2 Restaurant Association. 3 SHEILA COHN WEISS: Good morning. 4 My name is Sheila Weiss. I'm a registered 5 Dietician and the Director of Nutrition 6 Policy of the National Restaurant 7 Association. 8 I would like to thank the New York 9 City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 10 for this opportunity to testify before you 11 regarding the Notice of Intention to add 12 81.08 and 81.50 to Article 81 of the health 13 code. 14 Due to the strict time constraints on 15 the oral testimony, a full testimony on each 16 proposal is available for your information. 17 In addition, detailed written comments have 18 been submitted by our organization. 19 As a national organization, we have 20 many members who operate within the City, and 21 the concerns reflected in this comment apply 22 to all restaurant operators. The diversity 23 of our membership and the substantial impact 24 of the proposals prompts every segment of 62 1 our broad industry to urge that these 2 proposals be permanently withdrawn. 3 The issue of banning trans fats is 4 not an effective means of improving the 5 overall health of New Yorkers. This 6 proposal takes a very narrow approach to 7 a much larger health issue. It does not 8 propose a meaningful solution and may prove 9 to be misleading to both restaurants and 10 consumers. The City of New York should 11 focus on the larger health issue at hand 12 and work to educate its citizens and 13 business communities on the important 14 aspects of leading a healthy lifestyle. 15 Prematurely making switches in 16 product formulation can lead to unintended 17 consequences. 18 One major issue that some restaurants 19 are facing is that of the supply of trans 20 fat free oils. There simply is not 21 currently enough oil available for some 22 restaurant chains. It will be a matter of 23 years before the crop supply is adequate to 24 produce enough trans fats free oil for some 63 1 restaurant chains. 2 Due to a decreased supply of substitute 3 oils some restaurants will have no choice 4 but to revert to higher saturated fat oils. 5 This is not a good solution. Public health 6 officials consistently warn that consumers 7 should avoid increasing their intake of 8 saturated fat in an effort to minimize 9 trans fat. The two kinds of fats must be 10 considered together. 11 We don't believe the solution for 12 New York City is to simply follow Denmark's 13 lead where food service companies have 14 simply substituted palm oil for partially 15 hydrogenated vegetable oil. We believe 16 that it is important for you to find better 17 longer-term solution and ensure that we are 18 all fully informed about the science behind 19 them. 20 New York City restaurants may not 21 have a foundation for nutritional analysis 22 to even care that they have a trans 23 fat issue or not. If the information is 24 available, maybe the vendors are relying on 64 1 computer modeling at best, and this is a 2 very expensive validation process for most 3 suppliers to do actual testing. 4 Nutrition testing of a finished 5 product is very costly if the owners would 6 even think or have an idea that they would 7 need this review. City regulators would then 8 have to validate their own. 10 (TAPE 1 ENDS HERE*******************************) 11 Many of our nation's restaurants, as 12 shown in this mornings news and in the last 13 few weeks, have been successful in switching 14 to trans fat free oils. Others are still 15 exploring trans fat alternatives but this 16 is not a switch that can happen immediately. 17 In some cases it can take years for 18 a restaurant company to find appropriate 19 alternatives as shown in the last few weeks. 20 These companies that have successfully 21 switched have been doing research for as 22 many as two years. 23 Many of these restaurants have been 24 doing a great deal of testing with their 65 1 frying oils. It becomes a matter of taste, 2 quality, and shelf life. 3 While we applaud the New York City 4 Health Department in its efforts to address 5 the growing obesity issue affecting 6 Americans, we believe that simply posting 7 calorie information on menus and menu boards 8 will not advance the goals underlying the 9 challenges being taken up by the Department 10 and, therefore, is not supported by the 11 National Restaurant Association. 12 The restaurant industry is already 13 providing consumers with more comprehensive 14 information. The proposal penalizes 15 restaurant change to already lead the way 16 in providing nutrition information and 17 education on healthy lifestyles to our 18 customers and provide this disincentive 19 for other restaurateurs to provide this 20 nutrition information. 21 Our industry has been successful 22 because we've listened to our millions of 23 customers and responded to their needs. 24 For those customers who want information, 66 1 many restaurant chains already provide 2 comprehensive nutrition information, and 3 that's more than just calories, in 4 brochures, tray liners, posters, web sites, 5 computer vestibules on-site. We are 6 committed to providing -- thank you 7 again and look forward to working with the 8 members of the State restaurant partners. 9 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. I was 10 remiss earlier in not introducing Ms. Pam 11 Brier, a member of the Board of Health who 12 has joined us. 13 The next speaker is Carol Horowitz, 14 M.D., MPH, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. 15 CAROL HOROWITZ: Good morning. 16 I'm a primary care doctor, researcher 17 of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. 18 Before I begin I'd like to ask the 19 calorie labeling law be clarified to specify 20 what will be posted for combination meals. 21 In my research, I partnered with 22 Harlem leaders to conduct research and 23 develop programs to improve health. The 24 East Harlem Diabetes Center of Excellence and 67 1 the East Harlem Partnership for Diabetes 2 Prevention are using this community-based 3 research model to begin to tackle the 4 diabetes and obesity epidemic in East 5 Harlem. 6 We believe that having calories 7 posted on menus in places that already make 8 calorie amounts public could help people 9 make informed choices and could help in the 10 struggle to prevent and treat diabetes and 11 obesity. We know people grossly 12 underestimate the calories in less healthy 13 meal items. We know that people given 14 nutrition information choose lower calorie 15 foods. No one makes them change; just 16 giving information gives people the option 17 of using the information to make food 18 choices. 19 We have learned lessons from our 20 research in East Harlem that apply to much 21 of our city. The best way to describe 22 East Harlem is to compare it to the adjacent 23 upper east side. These two communities 24 are separated by only one city block, but 68 1 differences in health make it seem like 2 they're separated by an ocean. 3 East Harlem is the most obese 4 community in New York City; upper east side 5 is the least obese. East Harlem has the 6 highest rate of diabetes in New York City; 7 Upper East Sidehas the lowest. 8 What accounts for these differences 9 in health? In addition to large 10 socioeconomic differences, our research 11 reveals several important factors. East 12 Harlem food stores have less healthy foods 13 than those in the upper east side. Fast 14 food venues are pervasive in East Harlem. 15 One in seven restaurants in East Harlem 16 fast food venues versus only about one in 17 25 on the upper east side. 18 One of the top three barriers East 19 Harlem adults say prevent them from eating 20 healthy is difficulty finding healthy fast 21 foods. We have a new community-based peer 22 lead program that has resulted in people 23 losing weight and keeping weight off. And 24 our research revealed that the participants 69 1 find learning to read labels particularly 2 helpful. 3 While East Harlem stores may not have 4 all the healthy food choice that upper east 5 side stores have, people are now researching 6 their choices and making better ones at those 7 same stores. When they ask us about how 8 to eat healthier fast food in take-out 9 places, should we tell them to avoid those 10 food venues? We don't, and we don't think we 11 should. We advocate providing information 12 about these foods just as people have 13 information about the foods they buy in 14 stores because food manufacturers are 15 mandated to have an interest about the labels 16 on food items. Yes, most large chains do make 17 information about nutrition public. But in 18 our current digitally divided world, those 19 with the most financial and educational 20 resources also have the easiest access to 21 this information. 23 If this information is out there why 24 can't it be in the restaurant easy to read 70 1 and understand for everyone? What is the 2 downside of posting a calorie content next 3 to the price of foods? Is it likely to make 4 people stop buying fast foods? Why should 5 it? They're inexpensive; people like it; and 6 it is so convenient and many venues do want the 7 lower calorie option. 8 Would a burger business owner's menus 9 and menu boards regularly change to include 10 new prices and new items? Calories could be 11 incorporated with those changes. Would 12 everyone want or use all the information? No. 13 But not everyone uses the information that's on 14 menus now or reads the labels mandated on 15 food items and stores, but some people would 16 use it. Think about it and have an 17 opportunity to use it. 18 If I see that I have the choice of 19 two extra large sodas that cost the same 20 amount, but if I chose diet soda, it would 21 save me 800 calories, I might choose the 22 diet soda. Remember, turning 100 calories 23 a day results in losing about 10 pounds a 24 year. And if restaurants saw people 71 1 prioritizing lower calorie foods or people 2 began to ask for more low calorie options, 3 they could expand their business to 4 accommodate their patrons just as they 5 change their menus to reflect other food 6 trends. 7 One in two Latino children born this 8 decade will have diabetes as adults, and 9 nearly one in two African-American children 10 face the same fate. We know weight loss 11 can prevent diabetes and help people with 12 diabetes live longer. If we don't act now, 13 generations after us will wonder why we sat 14 back and watched the diabetes and obesity 15 epidemic and the poor health that comes 16 with them spread through our city. What are 17 we waiting for? Thank you. 18 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Next 19 speaker is Walter Willett, M.D., Nutritional 20 Epidemiology from Harvard School. 21 Oh, I'm sorry. I inadvertently 22 skipped someone, so - that's all right. I'll call Sharon Akabas 23 next. I apologize. Dr. Willett. 24 WALTER WILLETT: Thank you very much. 72 1 I do want to thank the New York City Health 2 Department for providing this opportunity to 3 comment on the proposed restriction of trans 4 fatty acids in serving public places. 5 Our research group at Harvard School 6 of Public Health has been investigating the 7 health effects of trans fatty acids since 8 the late 1970s when the potential for harm 9 came to our attention. This concern was 10 based on the fact that trans fatty acids are 11 similar to but not exactly the same as the 12 natural non-essential fatty acids and thus 13 they could compete with essential fatty 14 acids that play a critical role in cell 15 structure and function. Also, trans fats are 16 by far the most abundant artificial chemical 17 in our food supply. Also during the last 18 century, the increase in trans fatty acids as 19 quoted give rise to coronary heart disease 20 and other major illnesses. That's not proof 21 but at least reason to be concerned and 22 investigate this further. 23 Since 1980 we have examined intake 24 of trans fatty acids in relation to the 73 1 incidents of major health outcomes including 2 coronary heart disease in several large 3 populations that include over 200 adults of men 4 and women across the United States. We have 5 found that persons who consume greater 6 amounts of trans fatty acids have higher 7 risks of coronary heart disease, a finding 8 that has been confirmed by investigators 9 elsewhere in many different countries. 10 We and others have provided what is 11 now firm evidence that trans fatty acids 12 have adverse effects on blood cholesterol 13 fractions and inflammatory factors and 14 that they also inhibit the lining clogging 15 of arteries. Together, these findings have 16 provide a compelling evidence that trans 17 fatty acids contribute importantly to 18 development of coronary heart disease in 19 the United States. 20 My colleague, Dr. Wilson Farley, will 21 describe in detail the number of cases that 22 are likely to be prevented by reducing trans 23 fatty acids in our food supply, and those 24 numbers are enlarged. 74 1 In addition, to the effects on rates 2 of coronary heart disease, we have found that 3 trans fatty acids predict greater risk Type 4 2 diabetes. And my colleague Dr. Margaret 5 Morrison, has found those who consume more trans 6 fatty acids have a higher risk of Alzheimer's 7 Disease. These other adverse effects of 8 trans fats are probably related to the poor 9 inflammatory effects of trans fatty acids. 10 So the point is that there's likely 11 to be a much larger benefit, much 12 broader benefit in health than just the 13 reduction of coronary heart disease by the 14 proposed ruling. 15 Also, we have seen in several studies 16 that intake of trans fatty acids is related 17 to weight gain more strongly than any other 18 specific dietary factor, and this has 19 recently been confirmed in a five-year 20 feeding study among monkeys. 21 So interestingly, it appears that 22 there is not a complete independence of the 23 proposed ruling on labeling of calories in 24 foods, but that trans fat reduction is also 75 1 likely to still have an important 2 contribution to the reduction of overweight 3 and obesity. 4 In summary, the restrictions on 5 use of trans fatty acids by restaurants 6 proposed by the New York City Department 7 of Health will have major benefits for the 8 residents of New York and those of us who 9 visit here. Because this is an issue of 10 food safety, this restriction is absolutely 11 appropriate for the Department of Health, 12 just in the same way that the Department 13 would restrict the addition of arsenic to 14 food if it was knowingly being adultered 15 in this way. 16 My colleagues and I applaud the 17 Department for taking this very important 18 step forward. 19 I also wanted to comment briefly on 20 some of the previous speakers. Specifically, 21 it's hard to be very sympathetic for the 22 New York Restaurant Association or the 23 National Restaurant Association about the 24 need for more time in doing this on a 76 1 voluntary basis. 2 I have given talks to groups in the 3 food industry for the last five or six 4 years their work. There have been some 5 progressive restaurateurs and food producers 6 who are interested in reducing eliminating trans 7 fats. In one of the obstacles that I did 8 run into was that people in the food 9 production industry, farmers, are basically 10 saying they would like to be able to plant 11 more oils that would be appropriate 12 replacements for partially hydrogenated 13 vegetable oils but they wouldn't have any 14 guarantee or any assurance that those new 15 oils will be purchased. They need a strong 16 signal from the food industry that there 17 was a market and that's exactly why this 18 legislation is important. 19 There is a need for a very strong 20 signal to the suppliers so that they will 21 make sure that trans free products and oils 22 that can be used for trans free products are 23 available. Actually, probably just there's 24 not enough food supply if the whole country 77 1 were to go trans fat free but from everything 2 I understand there will be a lot more 3 available next year, certainly enough for 4 New York to be trans free. Thank you. 5 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The person 6 I skipped over inadvertently, Sharon Akabas. 7 Ms. Akabas? 8 Okay, the next speaker is 9 Aine Duggan, Vice President, Food Bank 10 of New York City. 11 AINE DUGGAN: Good morning. I'm 12 Aine Duggan, Vice President for Government 13 Relations with the Food Bank of New York 14 City, and I want tot hank you for the 15 Opportunity to present testimony this morning. 16 I have submitted a written testimony and I'll 17 just keep these comments pretty brief. 18 The Food Bank of New York City is 19 what might be described as the hub of the 20 emergency food program system in New York 21 and I talk to explain why we're sitting 22 here this morning to say that we're a little 23 bit concerned about implementation of trans 24 fat ban at the soup kitchen level. 78 1 I should first explain how the 2 emergency food program assistance 3 works in New York City. I believe there 4 are a very few people in the City in fact 5 who realize the intricacies of the system. 6 The Food Bank supplies most of the food to 7 approximately 1,200 programs throughout the 8 City. Those are primarily soup kitchens and 9 food pantries, but also include senior 10 centers and we have programs and other 11 community centers. 12 The vast majority of the food that we 13 supply actually comes from national sources. 14 Most of the food is supplied by USDA's 15 emergency food assistance program, which is 16 commonly known as TEFAP, and them the second 17 biggest supplier of food is private 18 donations. 19 The New York City Emergency Food 20 Assistance Program, which is administered by 21 HRA, only accounts for 19% which is currently 22 less than a fifth of the entire food that is 23 distributed by the Food Bank. And then the 24 State also supplies food through a program 79 1 called Hunger Prevention and Nutritious 2 Assistance Program, but again, it's a very 3 tiny percentage of people involved in 4 distribution. 5 The Food Bank, in fact, only controls 6 8.5% of the purchasing for all of the food 7 distributed in New York City. So we only 8 have it in our power to control whether or 9 not trans fat is supplied in the food chain 10 to that 8.5%. We cannot control the rest. We 11 expect that the City's HRH Division will 12 actually be in compliance with the ban. 13 However, we cannot expect that USDA or that 14 the private donors will be in compliance 15 with the ban and, therefore, we see a problem 16 and we're hoping that you can help us fix 17 that problem. 18 The vast majority of soup kitchens 19 and food pantries and other emergency food 20 programs are operated by volunteers. 21 In fact, 90% of the programs rely on 22 volunteers. So we're not talking about 23 establishments that have the wherewithal 24 or the capacity to monitor labels as food 80 1 is coming in. In fact, they don't have 2 enough food to supply to the lines of people 3 that are turning up on their doors day in 4 and day out, and they are not in a position 5 to turn away food, neither is the Food Bank 6 and here is the reason why: 7 The donated food which comes to the 8 Food Bank is in fact the supplier of most 9 of the nutritious food that comes into the 10 emergency food system in New York. Most 11 of the fresh food, that is fresh vegetables, 12 fruit, meat, fish and other protein comes 13 through private donations. 14 Government food provides mostly 15 shelf stable food and only 1% of it can 16 be described as fresh food. Therefore, we 17 can't turn away the fresh food, and in order 18 to turn away the bad food, we would in fact 19 have to turn away all the mixed 20 assortments. You don't get a choice with 21 donated food. It comes into the City in 22 mixed assortments which you have to accept 23 before you even know what the trailers 24 contain. So it would be, as you can imagine 81 1 yourself, irresponsible of an establishment 2 like the Food Bank currently who is 3 desperately needed in the City. 4 The other point is this: Currently, 5 government food only accounts for 63% of 6 all emergency food program food in the City. 7 Now that's down 15% in the last five years 8 alone. Donated food is constantly 9 increasing because the demand is constantly 10 increasing and government funding for 11 emergency food has been flat for the better 12 part of the decade. 13 Last year Food Bank was able to 14 increase the supply of fresh food into the 15 network by record numbers 11,000,000 16 pounds of fresh food that is fruit and 17 vegetables were distributed to emergency 18 food programs. It's up 242% in the last 19 three years alone. So there is an amount 20 of work that happens in the emergency food 21 program system as it stands to increase the 22 nutrition of New Yorkers at risk of hunger. 23 In fact, it is part of the Food Bank's 24 mission to improve the nutritional intake 82 1 of New Yorkers at risk of hunger. 2 Our biggest concern with the trans 3 fat ban is that it may in fact impede some 4 of that work because something else that 5 donated food contains is what's described as 6 \"dumped food.\" In other words, food that 7 nobody else wants which is influenced by 8 market trends. 9 When restaurants and indeed when 10 grocery stores are not accepting trans fat 11 food the manufacturers who of course are 12 not influenced by the ban will 13 continue to put trans fat food into the 14 emergency food program system. That's why 15 we'd like to see a ban on trans fat food 16 at the source level rather than just 17 distribution. 18 We'd also like to see a ban on 19 other foods that are unhealthy and hurt 20 the population of people that we serve 21 including high fructose corn syrup and 22 salt in particular but I imagine that's 23 work for another day. 24 So, in conclusion, I would like to 83 1 thank you again for the opportunity to 2 testify, and I encourage you to work with 3 us in the testimony that we've provided. 4 Thank you. 5 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 6 speaker is Dariush Mozaffarian, Professor, 7 Harvard School of Public Health. 8 DARIUSH MOZAFFARIAN: Thank you very 9 much. I'd like to thank the New York City 10 Department of Health for the opportunity to 11 speak and for the pretty close approximation 12 of my name as well. 13 I'm not a Cardiologist at the Harvard 14 Medical School. I'm an Epidemiologist at 15 the Harvard School of Public Health and I'm 16 here to focus a little bit on the science 17 and that's in contrast to the couple of 18 restaurant representatives that will speak 19 to not only as little science but any 20 science in their statements but in fact, 21 had statements that were contrary to the 22 facts such as the fact that the suggestion 23 that Denmark has increased saturated fat in 24 reducing trans fat which simply has not 84 1 happened yet. 2 So the harmful effects of trans fats 3 on blood cholesterol measures are clearly 4 established. Trans fats increase the bad 5 LDL cholesterol and decrease the good HDL 6 cholesterol, and that has not been seen for 7 any other nutrient. 8 Studies in humans also show harmful 9 effects on several other important risk 10 factors. Trans fats increase inflammation 11 in the body. Inflammation is a potent risk 12 factor of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 13 obesity and other diseases. Trans fats also 14 worsen the health of the endothelium, the 15 lining of the blood vessels, which is so 16 important for good cardiovascular health. 17 Studies in primates have shown that 18 trans fat acids cause weight gain, abdominal 19 fat by making the cause of abdominal fat 20 which is the most metabolic consequence, and 21 trans fats also worsen insulin resistance in 22 primate studies. 23 Based on these powerful adverse 24 effects of trans fats on risk factors, one 85 1 would predict powerful harmful effects of 2 trans fats on disease outcomes, and indeed 3 this is exactly what we're seeing. 4 In large studies involving more than 5 140,000 participants, trans fat consumption 6 is consistently associated with higher risk 7 of coronary heart disease. Importantly, 8 the risk is seen at very low levels of 9 consumption and in a range of 10 populations and cultures, including 11 states in the U.S., Europe, Australia and 12 Central America. 13 When we combined the evidence, there 14 was 23% higher risk of coronary heart 15 disease for each 2% of calories from trans 16 fats. This is staggering. 2% of calories on 17 a typical 2,000 calorie diet is 40 calories. 18 So calorie for calorie trans fats are the 19 most harmful nutrient in our diet. This 20 blood level risk is much higher than for 21 any other nutrient including saturated fat. 22 And as an analogy, statins which are one of the 23 most powerful medications for reducing heart 24 disease risk, reduce risk about 25%. So 86 1 40 calories of trans fats blanks out the 2 effect of the most powerful medication that 3 we have. 4 Now based on this evidence we calculated 5 estimates of the impact of trans fat 6 consumption on coronary heart disease 7 risk in the United States. But the most 8 conservative estimates based only on effects 9 of trans fats from total cholesterol are that 6% 10 of heart attacks in New York City and in the 11 U.S. are due to the consumption of artificial 12 trans fats. In New York City this would 13 correspond to about 1,200 deaths from heart 14 disease each year and that's the most 15 conservative estimate. This is a remarkably 16 high percentage given that heart attacks 17 are the number one cause of death in our 18 country. 19 Importantly, the 6% is almost 20 certainly an underestimate because it is 21 based only on total cholesterol and HDL, and 22 trans fats have many other harmful effects 23 and other risk factors. Based on what we've 24 seen between trans fat consumption and risk 87 1 in human studies, which would better account 2 for the total effect, up to 22% of heart 3 attacks may be due to consumption of 4 artificial trans fats. Whether the true 5 effect is 6% or as high as 22%, artificial 6 trans fats are a dangerous additive in our 7 food supply. They have no nutritional 8 value. They have great potential for harm. 9 They can easily be replaced by natural fats 10 and oils without any changes in food, taste, 11 price or availability. The strength of the 12 evidence and the magnitude of the effect for 13 the health risk of trans fats are greater 14 than for other food contaminants and 15 pesticide residues which are already 16 appropriately regulated to very low levels. 17 As a matter of food safety, I strongly 18 support the New York City initiative to 19 eliminate the use of artificial trans fats 20 by restaurants. Thank you. 21 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 22 speaker is Howard Weintraub of the American 23 College of Cardiology. 24 HOWARD WEINTRAUB: Thank you very 88 1 much. I'm Howard Weintraub, Co-Director of 2 the Lipid Unit at NYU. I'm also here to 3 represent the Cardiac Prevention Committee 4 at the American College of Cardiology, chaired 5 by Roger Blumenthal. I thank the City for 6 the opportunity to speak. 7 The proposal by the New York City 8 Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to 9 restrict service of foods containing 10 artificial trans fats in all New York City 11 restaurants may prove to be an important 12 step to the prevention of the leading cause 13 of death in New York City and throughout 14 the country, mainly coronary heart disease. 15 The American College of Cardiology, the ACC 16 applaud this proposal as it supports 17 measures to inform and advocate for health 18 food choices. 19 CHD is the leading cause of death in 20 the United States and claims more lives each 21 year than the four leading causes of death 22 combined. CHD is also the leading cause of 23 death in those individuals with diabetes. 24 As a matter of fact, if I can quote 89 1 Dr. Joslyn, he informed us that diabetes forms 2 from an excess of fat and from an excess of 3 fat, diabetics perish. 4 There is clear scientific evidence 5 with the association between the intake of 6 trans fats and the risk of coronary heart 7 disease through elevating LDL, the bad 8 cholesterol, and lowering HDL, the good 9 cholesterol. In fact, we now believe that 10 trans fats may be even more dangerous than 11 saturated fats. Further, replacement of 12 trans fats with heart healthy alternatives 13 appears to reduce CHD events. 14 I should remind you of some data that 15 came out of one of my favorite medical 16 journals, The New York Times. In January of 17 this year they informed us that there were 18 125 million people in our country with 19 elevated levels of LDL, 65 million people 20 with high blood pressure, 50 million people 21 who are essentially studying to become 22 diabetics, those with the cardiometabolic 23 syndrome. And then a number that many 24 people were surprised about 21 million 90 1 people who have diabetes and 8 million 2 people who have it and don't know about it. 3 It is these kinds of fats that place 4 people with the metabolic syndrome recipient 5 risk of developing a disease that makes 6 cancer look like a picnic. If you develop 7 cancer, cancer will play with you in a very 8 bad way, and over a year or two your fate 9 will be decided. However, with diabetes in 10 the first year or two it just starts to get 11 going. And after five or ten years, you're 12 willing to make a deal with the devil, 13 however, usually there's no one to broker 14 this affair. And at that point, it becomes 15 important to try and prevent this because 16 once you get down that road, it becomes 17 nearly an impossibility. 18 Another problem comes that many 19 more people are eating out as evidenced by 20 the daily food dollars spent and the total 21 calories consumed in restaurants. You go on 22 the internet, you will find out very easily 23 that a Big Mac with cheese, one of the staples, 24 704 calories, 593 calories without the 91 1 cheese, 610 calories with the super-size 2 fries which we've become use to and another 3 200 for the regular coke, 16 ounces. If 4 you take all that together you buy and largely 5 consume the caloric expenditure that we 6 should have in one meal, and for many people 7 this is a snack. So it's understandable as 8 to why we are becoming a group that looks 9 like Mr. Potato Head and we are starting to 10 have problems where physicians can recognize 11 their patients at risk by which part of the 12 anatomy enters the office first. 13 As much as I hate to say it, in 14 lectures that we did to other physicians, 15 this is the tact that we have to take 16 because so many times we are dealing with 17 this in a very down-tone and physicians 18 become intimidated. 19 Problems are that Americans are 20 consuming so many other calories not 21 prepared in the home, and, as a result, so 22 many more opportunities are there to make 23 food choices in situations where food is 24 not personally prepared with heart health 92 1 in mind. In addition, more people are 2 becoming concerned about the content of 3 their foods as evidenced by the increased 4 sales of food that contain no trans fats. 5 The replacement of trans fats with 6 healthier alternatives such as poly-and 7 monounsaturated fats known to lower LDL 8 cholesterol and raise the good cholesterol 9 HDL, can easily be accomplished without 10 negative effects on food taste or quality. 11 We should provide food that contains no or 12 minimal trans fats to the public. At the 13 same time you can take a step towards the 14 goal of preventing chronic debilitating 15 diseases that none of you would wish on 16 anybody, such as cardiovascular diseases, 17 stroke, vascular disease and heart 18 attacks and the nemesis of all that, mainly 19 diabetes. 20 There has also been increasing 21 awareness on the rising epidemic of obesity 22 in our country, as this, too, can contribute 23 to increased risks from cardiovascular 24 disease and diabetes. 93 1 A suggestion has been made to 2 encourage restaurants that already offer 3 nutritional information to make this 4 important data more easily accessible to 5 their patrons. Many people have said that 6 they've looked for calorie content on the 7 foods they purchase and this may 8 influence exactly what they eat. While 9 this may only apply to a small number of 10 establishments, we must take every step 11 possible to encourage caloric restriction. 12 For the many elderly patients we 13 see each day at our offices cutting out as 14 little as 100 calories a day can influence 15 significantly long-term weight loss with 16 dramatic benefits on their cardiovascular 17 status. 18 And if you think that twelve pounds a 19 month does not account for too much, if you 20 look at many of the studies that have been 21 done and published recently, as little as 22 eight or ten pounds can have a profound 23 effect on the metabolic consequences and 94 1 eventual cardiovascular risk. 2 In closing which is what I have to do, 3 I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to 4 speak and I hope you make the right choice. 5 Thank you. 6 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Next 7 speaker Audrey Silk, Founder of New York 8 City C.L.A.S.H. 9 AUDREY SILK: Good afternoon. Though 10 I am the founder of a smokers' rights group 11 based in New York City we have always argued 12 that our position is less about smoking and 13 more about the loss of civil liberties, the 14 encroachment of the nanny state, 15 infringement on private property rights, and 16 all things of that nature, including now this 17 proposal to ban trans fat. 18 Many take the position that this 19 proposal is \"finally going too far.\" 20 Smoking bans are not a unique or different 21 animal. It was the allowance and tolerance 22 and even the welcoming of them that puts us 23 in the position we're in now. It is one and 95 1 the same. That's where many seem to go 2 wrong. The slippery slope doesn't start now, 3 as many have said. It started then and we 4 have been screaming for years that food will 5 be next. 6 In August of 2005, I, personally, 7 warned Chuck Hunt of the New York City 8 Chapter of the Restaurant Association that 9 he shouldn't be so agreeable to Health 10 Commissioner's Frieden's request to 11 voluntarily eliminate trans fats because 12 when no one volunteers, he will mandate it 13 by law. 14 We have begged everyone to get over 15 the blind belief that the smoking bans are 16 to protect nonsmokers from the alleged 17 harm of second-hand smoke. The 18 anti-smoking crusaders have said all along 19 that their goal is a smoke-free society and 20 that bans are a way to modify the legal 21 behavior they don't approve of to 22 de-normalize smoking. 23 Simply put, smoking bans are to \"save 24 people from themselves,\" the exact same way 96 1 this trans fat ban is to save people from 2 themselves. When the smoking bans were 3 accepted that was the green light to the 4 health police that the public would offer 5 little resistance to their controlling other 6 areas of our lives for our own good. Not 7 only that, indeed you are applying the same 8 brand of junk science to do it. 9 Your premises on both the role of 10 public health and the extraordinary and singular 11 \"danger\" of trans fat are sorrily mistaken. 12 For openers, your job is not to make sure 13 that our \"dining\" is \"healthy.\" And by the 14 way \"healthy\" according to whom? 15 Almost annually, the government has 16 seemed to change its mind about what's a 17 \"healthy diet.\" Bad enough that the public 18 has been led and misled with a shifting 19 kaleidoscope of false do's and don'ts which 20 at least we've been able to take with a 21 grain of salt, but now you apparently want 22 to cram them down our throats. 23 Your second presumption is more 24 alarming. You invent for public health 97 1 a role and a power that it's never 2 historically had and never ought to have, 3 and imperially inform us that you're charged 4 with preventing chronic diseases through 5 approaches that may address individual 6 behavior. No, you're not. You just made 7 that up. And we'll thank you for keeping 8 your paws off our \"individual behavior\" 9 as well as what you call our \"community\" 10 environment. That's not public health, 11 that's social engineering. Eliminating 12 choice and coercing behavior is not The 13 American way. 14 As for trans fats themselves, you 15 overestimate their associative connection 16 to disease, and similarly their percentage 17 in the average diet. 18 According to the National Academy 19 of Science, the DHHS, the National Heart, 20 Lung and Blood Institute, and even the FDA, 21 \"trans fats are on a par with saturated 22 fats.\" No better, no worse. And 23 inconveniently, there's this: 24 \"Americans eat four times as much 98 1 saturated fat as trans fat\" according to the 2 New York Times, though the FDA itself says 3 the ratio is far greater, five to one. 4 An overload of trans or saturated 5 fats may raise cholesterol in some people, 6 which may or may not be one of the over 300 7 known or suspected contributors to heart disease. 8 And yes, it's your job to tell that fairly 9 and squarely to the public. But in any 10 case, pretending that a plate of french 11 fries is a bullet to the heart let alone 12 \"toxic poison\" analogous to lead is just 13 sheer hyperbole. 14 Finally, as you know, trans fats 15 occur naturally in foods eaten much more 16 frequently than fries, where they're also 17 accompanied by saturated fats. And since 18 your lust for engineering is apparently 19 unrestrained, it's really a no-brainer that 20 next you'll be attempting to banish eggs 21 benedict and mandate perhaps by cubic 22 centimeters, the portion-size of a steak. 23 And in the course of improving the food 24 environment which has to include stores, 99 1 what aside from the Commerce Clause, which 2 is recently scorned anyway, would stop you 3 from controlling what we buy in the market? 4 Any job worth doing is worth doing well. 5 And finally, really, the very language 6 of this law shows the bloodlessness and 7 joylessness in the Health Department's 8 sterile and medicinal view of life. Food 9 isn't medicine. And yet, with a stroke of 10 your bureaucratic pens, you manage to reduce 11 the whole playground of eating, noshing, 12 snacking, dining, feasting, to the clinical 13 concept of \"food intake\" and restaurants, 14 delis, bistros, cafes, to the food 15 environment. 16 Your approach to public health shows 17 contempt for the public, contempt for the 18 marketplace, contempt to the principles of 19 autonomy and choice. Our bodies aren't yet 20 the property of the State, nor yet the City. 21 Thank you for your time. Nice to see you 22 guys. Thank you. 23 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Next 24 speaker Ina Pinkney, Chief and Owner of Ina's 100 1 in Chicago. 2 INA PINKNEY: Good morning. I was 3 born in Brooklyn. I gave up baseball 4 the day the Dodgers last entrance and still 5 carry a grudge and I'm really sorry about 6 the mess. 7 I opened my first restaurant in 1991. 8 As an early adopter it was no smoking then. 9 My decision to operate a smoke-free 10 restaurant was really an easy decision. 11 When I put on the chef's jacket every 12 morning it is symbolic of my commitment 13 to serve safe and healthy food in a safe 14 and healthy environment. And despite my 15 personal commitment to always do the right 16 thing, I am still regulated each day by the 17 Building Department, the Fire Department 18 and the Health Department and I welcome 19 regulations and I welcome oversight. It is 20 a level playing field for me and for all of 21 the other restaurants in Chicago and so we 22 welcome the inspectors, we like this. We 23 are accountable and so are they. 24 Almost two years ago after reading 101 1 about the health detriments of trans fat 2 oils, I switched to Asoyia, a soy oil that I 3 got from a small co-op in Iowa. I even 4 asked the farmers to put it in small bottles 5 because we, as restaurant owners, get it in 6 jugs, 35 pounds, and I put it on my counter 7 in small bottles, and they absolutely flew 8 off the shelves with my customers who 9 appreciate it and who became so much more 10 aware of the health benefits. 11 So I produce a newsletter each and 12 every month and I wrote about the Asoyia 13 oil, the trans fat free Soya oil and we were 14 really put on the map for that. 15 In my never ending quest to get 16 better performance and better taste this 17 summer I switched to Nutra-ClearNT and the 18 response was even greater. As a matter of 19 fact, I use it in all of my applications, 20 my pancake batters. I use it for saute 21 and I even use it in my carrot cake. 22 Winning the \"best fried chicken\" in 23 Chicago contest didn't hurt. It brought the 24 benefits of this healthy oil to the public 102 1 and that dish now generates 28% of my dinner 2 business, mostly from people who had to give 3 up fried food years ago. Well, now they 4 don't have to do that anymore. With natural 5 chicken and trans fat free oil we really do 6 a great job. 7 Three weeks ago I invited the best 8 chefs in Chicago to my house for a fried 9 chicken night and there are now twelve 10 converts. And as my Angelo has said when 11 you know better, you do better. 12 Now lets talk about the economics. 13 The Restaurant Association, and by the way, 14 I resigned my membership in the Illinois 15 Restaurant Association because of their 16 stand on smoking which I didn't approve of 17 and their stand on non-trans fats. So I am 18 now a non-member. But the economics are 19 clear. They claim that ethnic restaurants, 20 the mom and pop restaurants will suffer. In 21 my case, the mom restaurant will suffer and 22 that is just not the case. These oils, 23 trans fat free oils, cost between 10 and 30% 24 more and last 75% longer. So deadly oil can 103 1 cost $20 and the good stuff $29 and the 2 deadly oil you have to throw out every two 3 days and the healthy oil lasts a week. 4 Count it, do the math. 5 The research about the dangers of 6 secondhand smoke was not accepted for a 7 long time. Now we have the research about 8 trans fat free oils with the fix readily 9 available and accessible immediately. 10 Manufactures are responding quickly 11 by planting more acreage and we need to 12 respond just as quickly and pass 13 legislation. This is a historic 14 opportunity that will impact the healthy well- 15 being of the citizens of New York and when it 16 begins for New York we will follow. 17 Chicago is now embroiled in this. 18 I am here speaking for me, for Chicago. I 19 am going to take all of this back and keep 20 fighting because I don't know how many 21 snow flakes it takes to break a branch but 22 I intend to be one of those snow flakes. 23 Thank you. 24 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. 104 1 Leslie Meenan; okay. Mark S. Inzetta, Vice 2 President and Assistant Counsel for Wendy's. 3 MARK INZETTA: Good morning, 4 Mr. Commissioner, Mr. Lopez, distinguished 5 members of the Board of Health. 6 My name is Mark Inzetta, Assistant 7 General Counsel, Vice President and Chief 8 Officer Compliance officer for Wendy's 9 International. The last title means it's my 10 job to make sure we follow the law, one of 11 the reasons I am here today. 12 We offer comments today on the 13 proposal regarding menu labeling, 14 notwithstanding what we consider the 15 discriminatory nature of the proposal when 16 we apply it to the select few restaurants. 17 We are in complete agreement with the 18 Department that restaurant customers 19 deserve information about the ingredients, 20 nutritional profile, as well as the allergens 21 contained in the foods that they eat. 22 We have provided this information to 23 our customers for decades. We exceed what 24 is currently required in all jurisdictions, 105 1 and we have no objections to providing 2 information in our stores. For years, we 3 have provided nutritional brochures. We 4 have also instituted a portion of our web 5 site in which customers can examine and follow 6 the nutritional information of the food that 7 they might consider and build their own 8 menu item from there. 9 We have recently this past year begun 10 to introduce in our restaurants the poster 11 that you see in front of me. This provides 12 all of the information that would be 13 necessary for a consumer to make an informed 14 choice on any menu item that they might take 15 off of the menu. We believe this is a much 16 more effective way on our part of educating 17 our customers so they make the informed 18 decisions that they need to make. It 19 contains obviously much more than caloric 20 information. For customers, caloric 21 information is only one item that they 22 need to consider in making informed choices. 23 Certainly, there are items which are lower 24 calories, but may be higher in fat or contain 25 allergens or other products, or other 106 2 ingredients rather, which may not be 3 in the best interest of that particular 4 consumer. 5 As well, we ask the Board to 6 consider that these fixed postings inside 7 our stores are far superior to what it is 8 this particular regulation would require. 9 These are going up in easily accessible 10 areas so that persons can give time and 11 consideration necessary in order that they 12 make proper menu choices. 13 As well, with our 800 line, our 14 consumer calls are managed by on-staff 15 registered dieticians when particular food 16 questions come up, and we make available 17 very detailed nutrition information as I 18 indicated on our web site. 19 We believe this is far more than 20 the vast majority of American restaurants 21 to provide and continue to improve our 22 communications with our customers in this 23 regard. We are not interested in hiding 24 anything. We think it's important for our 25 customers to know exactly what is in the 107 2 food that they eat. 3 What concerns us here about this 4 proposal is it would not apply to all 5 New York City restaurants and, in fact, would 6 apply to only a select few. Inexplicably, 7 companies that refuse to make any nutrition 8 information available would be entirely 9 exempt from this regulation. Not only do 10 we think this is unfair, but it's 11 counter-intuitive to what we believe to be 12 the scapegoat of the Department of Health 13 of increasing consumer education and 14 therefore, creates an incentive for 15 businesses which do not provide this 16 information to not provide it in the future. 17 In fact, some restaurants may consider 18 taking out the information if this proposal 19 were to pass. 20 So if the goal is to empower 21 New Yorkers to make better informed choices 22 when dining out, this proposal, in fairness, 23 should apply to all food service outlets in 24 the City instead of arbitrarily applying it 25 to just a small segment of restaurants. 108 2 As such it's impossible for us to 3 believe that this was meant to apply to 4 anyone but our own segment of the restaurant 5 industry. Other jurisdictions have 6 considered similar measures like this and 7 have seen what it is that restaurants such 8 as ours provides and have accepted that as 9 complete and full information necessary for 10 the public in order for them to make 11 informed choices. 12 To illustrate the compliance 13 challenge that we would face if this 14 proposal went through, we've also developed 15 some sample menu boards. One of the things 16 Mr. Thomas used to say was that you can get 17 your hamburgers made at Wendy's in 18 approximately 256 combinations. 19 Apparently, I'm out of time. Just 20 a portion of those 256 combinations would 21 require our menu board to look something 22 like this. 23 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 24 speaker is Florence M. Rice. Ms. Rice is Vice 25 President, I'm sorry, President of the 109 2 Harlem Consumer Education Counsel. 3 FLORENCE RICE: Good morning, and 4 thank you for the opportunity to be able 5 to talk to you. I'm not a health person 6 but over the years, I have seen how our 7 children have became so obese, so in 1981, 8 I spoke about it, so I'm glad that I'm here 9 and support what you're doing. 10 As President of the Harlem Consumer 11 Education Counsel and a resident of New York 12 City, I will support the Health and Mental 13 Hygiene's recommendation to the limits of 14 trans fat in restaurant food and to reprise 15 certain restaurants to this count of 16 calories on the menus. 17 Trans fat promotes heart disease 18 killing roughly 60,000 Americans each year. 19 Many restaurant food contains far too much 20 especially in low-income communities, Trans 21 fats. A three-piece extra crispy combo meal 22 with drumsticks, two thighs, potato wedge 23 and biscuit at KFC contains a staggering 15 24 grams of trans fat. The American Heart 110 1 Association recommends that people eat no 2 more than two grams of trans fat per day. 3 People have gotten so used to having 4 nutritious information on packaged foods 5 and grocery stores and have a right to 6 know what's in their food. In restaurants 7 without clear, easy to find nutrition 8 information it is difficult to make informed 9 choices at restaurants otherwise, how can 10 you know what kind of fish sandwich has 50% 11 more calories than the roast beef sandwich 12 or that a small chocolate milkshake at 13 McDonald's has more calories than a Big Mac? 14 The Department of Health's 15 recommendation to both limit trans fat in 16 restaurant foods and to require calorie 17 exposure on menus. In certain restaurants 18 that is an excellent step toward helping 19 New Yorkers watch their weight, which in 20 my community people are so obese, it is sad. 21 They can reduce their chances of getting heart 22 disease. Please support these important 23 health measures. 24 I'm deeply, deeply concerned. It's 111 1 not the obesity, but in my community, what 2 upsets me is the fact that today obese, 3 especially African-Americans are not able 4 to obtain jobs because they are so obese, 5 and this has been happening over the years. 6 There is another company that I was 7 deeply concerned with many, many years 8 ago, in 1981 when the Amsterdam News wrote 9 the article but I'm deeply concerned with 10 what has happened because again African 11 Americans are suffering. They don't hire 12 right in my family that I know. So I'm 13 speaking about something that I know. They 14 eat in restaurants; they feed their children 15 in restaurants. 16 I did a survey just with little 17 children, and I won't call the name of the 18 formula that I was concerned with, but it's 19 very, very important because in our 20 community, poor people, I'll use the word 21 poor people, have become very obese, and 22 this just didn't happen yesterday. Much of 23 it happened in the very early years, and 24 I said that I'm no health person, but I did 112 1 it out of concern of just seeing my 2 community become so obese. So I thank you 3 just for being here and being able for you 4 to hear these few words. 5 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. It is 6 now almost 12:00 o'clock, so I will call the 7 names of those who may have missed your turn 8 earlier. 9 Is the representative of 10 Richard Gottfried here? Richard Gottfried 11 is a New York State Assembly Member and 12 Chair of the Assembly Health Committee. 13 I guess you are representing 14 Mr. Gottfried? 15 MICHAEL KAPLAN: Yes. 16 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Could you 17 introduce yourself. 18 MICHAEL KAPLAN: Good afternoon. My 19 name is Michael Kaplan. I'm here on behalf 20 of Assemblyman Richard Gottfried. 21 My name is Richard A. Gottfried. 22 I represent the 75th Assembly District in 23 Manhattan and I chair the Assembly Committees 24 on health. I appreciate this opportunity 113 1 to present this testimony. I regret that 2 I have to be in Albany today and cannot 3 appear before you in person. 4 I congratulate Commissioner Thomas 5 Frieden for his leadership in proposing the 6 regulations on trans fats and menu items and 7 I urge the Board of Health to approve them. 8 Heart disease and obesity are a major public 9 health problem and they do not have to be. 10 We have the ability and moral obligation to 11 help reduce the epidemic and save lives. 12 These proposals are important steps 13 in this life-saving effort. These proposals 14 are in keeping with the fascination of the 15 public health including the distinguished 16 history of the leadership constituting the 17 Health Department and Board of Health. 18 Obesity is a such a sensitive subject 19 in our society and many proposals have 20 obviously struck a nerve. It is no longer 21 that these proposals have been the target 22 of attacks and wisecracks. The earlier 23 proposals were to protect us from bad 24 elements and similar reactions, but today 114 1 the public overwhelmingly supports them, 2 trans fat. 3 One proposal would effectively 4 faze out artificial trans fats mainly 5 partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in food 6 preparation in food service establishments. 7 After six months they would apply to cooking 8 oil, shortening and margarine. After 9 18 months it would apply to all food service 10 except food served in the original 11 manufacturers' sealed package. 12 Trans fat is much more dangerous than other fats 15 and food. It raises the LDL, bad 16 cholesterol and lowers the HDL, good 17 cholesterol. Trans fat has no safe level and 18 no nutritional value. 19 The Center for Science in the public 20 interest reports that scientific estimates 21 done in New York City alone, trans fats kill 22 up to 1,500 people per year. It can easily 23 be replaced in food preparation by other 24 ingredients that taste as well, work as well, 115 1 at essentially the same cost. 2 Several restaurant chains and leading 3 restaurants have already sought to use trans fat and 4 are doing fine. Sylvia's serves its world 5 famous soul food without using trans fat and 6 any restaurant can easily comply with this 7 proposed rule. 8 Customers have no way of knowing what 9 they're eating or served contains trans 10 fats. Packaged foods bought in stores is 11 now labeled with trans fat content so 12 customers can make choices, not so in 13 restaurants. In 1960 the Board of Health 14 was in the forefront of lead in paint in 15 protecting consumers from eating food prepared 16 in the presence of rats and other vermin. 17 The government consensus which 18 considered many cancer ingredients trans 19 fat regulation is a fitting step in this 20 tradition. While trans fat is more 21 dangerous than other fat it does not mean 22 that other fat is safe to consume in excess. 23 It is important to make sure the public does 24 not misunderstand the complaint against 116 1 trans fat. This makes the other proposed 2 regulation relating to calorie information 3 on menus especially important. 4 Consumer lack of information is a 5 serious factor in the efforts to prevent 6 the epidemic of overweight and obesity. 7 Most people would not think that a six-inch 8 tuna Subway has 530 calories much more than 9 290 calories in a roast beef sub. Most 10 people would be surprised to learn that a 11 McDonald's Big Mac has 560 calories but a 12 McDonald's large shake has more than twice 13 that, 1,150 calories, more than half the 14 recommended daily calorie of intake for an 15 adult. 16 With packaged foods sold in stores or 17 cooked food at home consumers want and can 18 know the ingredient and determine calorie 19 content of their food. But that is not the 20 case of food served in restaurants. Calorie 21 count produce extraordinarily higher than 22 most people with saturated fats. But the 23 proposed regulation by the calorie count can 24 be displayed on menus and menu boards. But 117 1 not only in restaurants that are already 2 making calorie boards and web sites or 3 otherwise. 4 Without information being 5 displayed, a consumer must do the research 6 and get information before ordering. It is 7 important not only to make the information 8 easily available to consumers, but also to 9 put it in front of them when they are 10 thinking about their food choices. 11 Complying with these regulations 12 will be easier to restaurants that are 13 subject to it and not those that are already 14 making the information available through 15 some form to the public. 16 I strongly support the proposal and 17 I understand the Department's reasons for 18 limiting applicability. However, I am 19 concerned in some restaurants where chains 20 that now make caloric information available 21 might be able to stop doing so. Whoever is 22 to avoid being subject to the new 23 regulation. Also, large chain restaurants 24 that do not make their calorie information 118 1 available can easily do so can easily do so. 2 Therefore, I urge the 3 Department and the Board to be open in the 4 future for expanding this Health Code 5 regulation. Of course, much more needs 6 to be done to prevent the epidemics of 7 overweight and obesity and the grave health 8 problems that comes with heart disease and 9 diabetes. 10 Most of what we eat is not covered by 11 proposed regulations. We need to build on 12 what the Department of Education has done 13 to improve what has been served and sold in 14 schools. We need to educate and persuade 15 parents and children to overcome the power of 16 advertising culture, and we also need to get 17 people to exercise more. 18 These proposed regulations are 19 important steps in the right direction. 20 They'll improve health in New Yorkers and 21 prolong a safe life. I urge the Board of 22 Health to stand firmly with 23 Commissioner Frieden to improve these 24 regulations and then to move on to further 119 1 efforts. Thank you very much. 2 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The next 3 person who missed their turn during the last 4 hour John R. Whipple. Is Mr. Whipple here? 5 Then Sharon Akabas. Ms. Akabas is an 6 M.D., Associate Director, Institute of Human 7 Nutrition, Columbia Presbyterian Medical 8 Center. 9 SHARON AKABAS: Thank you. I 10 appreciate the honor indeed. But I have a 11 Ph.D, and I apologize for my lateness. 12 My name is Dr. Sharon Akabas. I'm 13 the Associate Director of the Institute of 14 Human Nutrition at Columbia University and 15 today I'm also proud to represent the Mammoth 16 School of Public Health and fully support 17 the written testimony already submitted by 18 Dean Alan Rosenfeld. My comments are meant 19 to augment those that Dr. Richard Devonbaum, 20 who also submitted testimony. He is the 21 Director of Institute of Human Nutrition 22 and thank you for this opportunity. 23 First, I support the addition of 24 Section 81.08 the Article of the New York 120 1 City Health Code. The health risks of trans 2 fats are well-documented and after extensive 3 review by these two medicine and other 4 agencies, it's been recommended that they be 5 replaced by healthier substitutes and be 6 in the food supply in amounts as low as 7 possible. 8 In most packaged foods trans fats 9 have been eliminated but about one third of 10 American's daily calories comes from 11 restaurants. If trans fats are available 12 in restaurant food this still may represent 13 significant amounts of fat consumed each 14 day. 18 So I was trying to convey that the 19 current rates of trans fat consumptions are 20 lower due to the elimination of packaged 21 foods and to partial elimination of 22 restaurant foods in response to voluntary 23 removal. This reduction has prompted some 24 people to say that mandatory ban is no longer 121 1 necessary and that the public risk due to trans 2 fats is minimal. I disagree with this. 3 I support current legislation. 4 As you are aware, certain countries 5 have completely eliminated trans 6 fats. The adverse effects to food quality 7 or cost, replacement of trans fats and the City 8 restaurant is not only desirable 9 but fully feasible. Once this 10 change is made, we would have to 11 alert the public. Otherwise we risk the idea 12 that these revamped fries are actually a 13 healthy food. Also legislation to eliminate 14 trans fats from restaurants though very 15 important to the general health of the 16 public will not necessarily impact obesity 17 and even greater threat to public health. 18 There are in addition to Section 81.08 I 19 support Section 81.50. You already heard 20 about the traumatic rise and worrisome 21 increase about diets well documented. 122 1 It is now not uncommon to have a ten year 2 old child to present adult onset diabetes. 3 The legislation to require food services 4 establishments that they make available 5 calorie content of items on the menu 6 board and menus is an important 7 piece in the public health partnership with 8 the private sector that will be required to 9 stop this type of the obesity epidemic. Many 10 incentives occurring along the way, more 11 healthy choices and posting of this 12 information should assist in those choices. 13 Though I support this legislation 14 and the acknowledgement of the importance 15 of obesity as a public health issue, I 16 think it's also important to acknowledge 17 the potential draw-backs of this legislation. 18 The main draw-backs include one, 19 the intervention will incur an insufficient 20 ability to monitor and, two, people will not 21 know how to integrate their information into 123 1 their purchasing decisions. 2 I'll expand briefly on each of these. 3 One, the intervention will occur with 4 insufficient ability to accept the 5 things now. The purchasing behavior before 6 and after the intervention will be recorded, 7 but the information proprietary and unlikely 8 to be made available to the public sector. 9 A few studies have shown nutrition 10 information on packaged food can affect 11 purchasing practice, but there are a few data 12 on whether or not this will hold true for 13 those most susceptible to poor food choices 14 in a restaurant setting. Two, people will not 15 know how to integrate the information into 16 their purchasing decisions. We know that 17 the information is insufficient to change 18 behavior. 19 I wholeheartedly support this concept, 20 but I imagine myself in a fast food 21 restaurant with my three young children in 22 tow. They're hungry and agitated and I'm trying 23 to order. How do I put into context the 124 1 different caloric values? For my 3 year old, 2 I'll add up the value of a hamburger, french 3 fries and a drink but what should the total 4 be? Should it be a third of her daily 5 value? What is her total daily value? 6 Should it be half of her six year old 7 brother's daily value. 8 So I believe we run the risk of 9 putting more personal responsibility on 10 the people for whom they're already at the 11 greatest disadvantage. And what I suggest 12 is to ensure that we are in fact 13 achieving goals, helping people make more 14 healthful choices we should assess the 15 implementation. We should work with 16 individuals who are not currently making 17 these choices to understand what factors 18 are contributing to making less healthful 19 choices. We need to hear from and learn 20 more from the mothers who are still buying 21 the large fries for their children and 22 for the person with Type 2 diabetes who's 23 consuming one day's worth of calories in one 24 sitting. 125 1 Despite these concerns, I fully 2 support this legislation. It has the 3 potential of initiating important public- 4 private sector dialogue and partnerships 5 which will be critical to our future 6 attempt to stop the obesity epidemic. 7 The kind of initiatives that the Department 8 of Health has undertaken in bodegas and to 9 increase physical activity throughout 10 the City are also critical to making more 11 healthly options available to the community. 12 Too often the environment and food 13 choices undermine the best of intentions. 14 Thank you very much. 15 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Okay, 16 considering that the mike was not working, I 17 let the time go over, so lets not make that a 18 habit. Now we will resume with the list. 19 The next speaker is Janet Oberndorfer. 20 Ms. Oberndorfer is a Certified Business 21 Home Economist. 22 JANET OBERNDORFER: My name is 23 Janet Oberndorfer. I'm a Graduate Home 24 Economist in private practice, Communications 25 Consultant. My entire career now exceeding 126 1 40 years has been spent in the American food 2 industry and the promotion of its products 3 and the understanding of its business by the 4 general public. 5 The study of the attributes of food 6 products for human consumption, together with 7 continuing ed activities has been a center- 8 piece of my training. I conduct meetings, 9 transact business and enjoy meals in 10 restaurants throughout the boroughs. 11 As a qualified professional, I am very 12 concerned about the state of health of the 13 New York City populous. Of course, everyone 14 who lives anywhere in the country and has 15 attained majority has the right to make 16 whatever food choices he or she wants. 17 However, it has been estimated that 18 98 million of us, roughly 1/3 of the current 19 population has been deemed to be overweight 20 or obese. 21 In addition, many New Yorkers are 22 subject to various catastrophic health 23 conditions such as cardiovascular disease, 24 clogged arteries and so forth. I 127 1 recognize there may be other contributing 2 factors yet these conditions do not have to 3 occur. They put the lives of those 4 individuals at risk. These circumstances 5 are expensive for the individual and for the 6 New York City social structure which must 7 respond. 8 I firmly believe New Yorkers should 9 revise their food choices and then make poor 10 choices because they do not have enough 11 nutrition information, or they may have 12 forgotten the information, or the wisest 13 choices simply are not available. 14 Irrespective of the circumstances, a 15 campaign for healthier eating should start 16 now. I think better choices need to be 17 available and consciously offered. However, 18 with maturity comes the understanding that 19 occasionally, it is permissible to make less 20 nutritious menu and food selections, but 21 certainly not continuously because that's 22 all that's out there. 23 Addressing the State of New York food 24 choices when eating out in restaurants would 128 1 not be dramatically different than the 2 circumstance which was experienced when the 3 tobacco industry was confronted with and 4 forced to admit that the deleterious effects 5 of smoking on one's health. 6 Who would have ever imagined the major 7 players in the tobacco industry now are 8 developing resources for training the ill 9 advisability of taking up smoking. 10 In this writer's estimation, this is 11 more than a paradox. So it is with the food 12 industry. Products which taste good but are 13 of questionable nutritional value proliferate 14 throughout the country. Food companies and 15 restaurants are virtually free to offer for sale 16 anything they want, but there is no reason in 17 the world for them to do so at the eater's 18 risk. Food products offered for sale should 19 meet standards of high sanitary quality, be 20 nutritionally adequate and monetarily 21 valuable. If I can wave my wand, that's what 22 I would want. 23 There are a number of initiatives 24 the institutional food industry can take to 129 1 comply with this legislation when hopefully 2 it is adopted. I call upon the 3 institutional food industry to mount a 4 massive marketing and media campaign to 5 the New York public, its customers, to 6 educate them as to the nutrition of food 7 menu choices. If the tobacco industry can 8 do it, then surely the institutional food 9 industry can do it. Such a marketing effort 10 can only be regarded as an action of 11 integrity. 12 America's fascination on romance with 13 food is something more than simply fuel 14 with which to nourish the body, could be 15 better channeled and take its rightful 16 place if vending machines in schools were 17 filled with healthy choices, if the drive 18 to super-size portions was abandoned. If 19 contests to see who can eat more than two 20 weeks worth of empty calories in one sitting 21 was abandoned, and if the Institutional Food 22 Industry was to creatively revise its 23 formula and ingredients for preparing 24 dishes offered for sale in retail 130 1 establishments. 2 Interest in this opportunity has 3 already triggered well-known organizations 4 to do the right thing. Joining other 5 organizations such as Wendy's, Craft Food, 6 Ruby Tuesday. It was reported that Walt Disney 7 will ban trans fats in restaurants located in 8 it's theme parks. 9 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. 10 JANET OBERNDORFER: Thank you. 11 WILFREDO LOPEZ: If you can submit 12 the rest of your testimony. 13 JANET OBERNDORFER: Yes sir, I have. 14 WILFREDO LOPEZ: There was one other 15 person who had missed her turn in the last 16 hour that I neglected to call back so, if 17 she's here; Leslie Meenan. 18 So the next speaker is 19 Jim Lesczynski. Mr. Lesczynski, okay. 20 Joshua Rosenthal, Founder and Director, 21 Institute for Integrative Nutrition. 22 JOSHUA ROSENTHAL: Distinguished 23 members of the Department of Health, lately, 24 there's been a lot in the news about health 131 1 and nutrition; Alarming obesity rates, junk 2 food in the classrooms, prescription and 3 health care costs spiraling, millions of 4 Americans without health insurance, and 5 people going bankrupt over family health 6 crises even when they do have health 7 insurance. 8 Most New Yorkers are too busy with 9 life to realize that there is a major health 10 crisis happening right as we speak. Yet, 11 when our volunteers set up the web site 12 TransFatFreeNYC.org, two weeks ago, over 13 700 people responded with letters to the 14 Board of Health regarding the banning of trans 15 fats in New York City and in support of 16 Article 81.08. 17 America is in trouble in the area of 18 food, diet, and nutrition. American people 19 spend more money per capita by far than any 20 other country in the world, and yet, every 21 year, people's health continues to 22 deteriorate. 23 I find it fascinating that countries 24 like China and Cuba have the exact same life 132 1 expectancy as we do in America even though 2 they spend so little money on health care. 3 In my opinion, it all boils down to food, 4 diet, and lifestyle. 5 In very busy people, most New Yorkers 6 never notice that our Federal government 7 cause food manufacturers to list trans fat 8 on the labels. But they did, and the reason 9 they did it was because trans fats are very 10 dangerous. They reduce good cholesterol, 11 increase bad cholesterol. It's the perfect 12 food for increasing heart disease in 13 America. But these requirements do not 14 apply to restaurants and so trans fats 15 continue to lurk unbeknownst to most people 16 in the restaurant. And people take 17 themselves and their family out not 18 knowing that they are harming them. We all 19 eat in restaurants. I do, you do, we all 20 do. 21 Now, I'm a fairly well-educated 22 person in the area of nutrition, but even for 23 me, it never occurred to me that when I went 24 out to order some fried eggs that I was 133 1 vehemously getting a heavy dose of trans fat 2 because most of the oil used or 3 available are trans fat, and if I didn't 4 know that, who's going to know that. People 5 are innocently making themselves sick 6 without knowing it. 7 With the recent E-coli problems with 8 spinach, once the danger was known, once the 9 danger was cleared, the government stepped 10 in to take it off the shelves. They didn't 11 say, \"Well, let's allow Americans to decide 12 what to do.\" There was a cost of millions of 13 dollars but hundreds of lives were saved. 14 Last week, I heard a radio broadcaster 15 say that if a country like Iran was selling 16 trans fats to the United States and you 17 looked at the statistics of how many 18 Americans were being killed, we would declare 19 war. But for some reason, we allow our 20 domestic corporations to continue to affect 21 our food with this product. 22 Any related disease is the number 23 one cause of preventable death in America. 24 New Yorkers don't wake up every morning and 134 1 say, \"How am I going to make myself sick? How 2 am I going to make myself be overweight?\" In 3 a recent survey, three out of four Americans say 4 they want healthier foods in restaurants. 5 This legislation is not a minute too 6 soon. Childhood obesity in America and 7 diabetes is at an all time high. Our 8 experts say that life expectancy of today's 9 six year olds may be lower than that of our 10 parents. And I have a special guest who 11 will speak to this issue, Morgan Carmine. 12 MORGAN CARMINE: Hello, my name is 13 Morgan Carmine and I live in New York City. 14 My mom and I and a bunch of other people at 15 my school work really hard to get rid of all 16 trans fats from our lunch program. 17 Last year my school got rid of all 18 trans fats in health foods and that really 19 helps. Now I wish New York City can get rid 20 of all the trans fats in the restaurants. I 21 do not understand that if you know that 22 trans fats are bad for people, why do people 23 still serve it in restaurants? It's really 24 scary to read because I can't see it. They 135 1 blend it into the food. That is bad for my 2 heart. I'm just a kid. If grown-ups like 3 these don't look out for kids like me, how 4 will the kids of New York City grow up 5 healthy? Please protect us so we don't 6 have to go to the hospital and have other 7 problems when we grow up. It's really 8 important to me. Thank you. 9 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. The 10 next speaker is Anna Lappe, Author and 11 Public Speaker. 12 ANNA LAPPE: Good afternoon. I'd 13 just like to thank the young girl for 14 speaking. My name is Anna Lappe and I'm the co-author of \"Hope's Edge, the 17 Next Diet for a Small Planet\" and \" Grub, Ideas 18 for an Urban Organic Kitchen. And I speak here 19 this morning as a concerned eater. 20 I also speak today from the vantage 21 point of having just finished traveling the 22 country and 42 cities talking to thousands of 23 people about food health and the choices we 24 make about the food we eat. 136 1 Across the country, what I've been 2 hearing is that more and more people are 3 expressing deep concerns about the impact 4 of our highly processed diet and our 5 environment on our bodies. For most of 6 us the figures of diet related illnesses are 7 not a distraction. They afflict friends and 8 families, neighbors and colleagues. So I am 9 pleased to return to New York City and to 10 commend the New York City Board of Health 11 for the leadership you are taking to the two 12 proposals on the table, banning trans fats 13 and posting calorie information on fast food 14 menu boards. 15 I want to add my voice to the support 16 for both of these proposals and specifically 17 say a few words about the proposed ban on 18 trans fats. 19 As many others today have already 20 stressed, the health concerns of trans fats 21 are by now well-documented. There is no 22 longer cause for a debate. This isn't to 23 say, though, that there is no debate. 24 Industry backed campaigns are still 137 1 trying to confuse the public. On one 2 industry backed web site called 3 Trans Fats Facts, I read this quote: 4 \"Trans fats have been a staple in 5 the American diet for decades, and during 6 that time, American life expectancy has 7 seen dramatic increases. In fact, it 8 recently reached a record high.\" 9 I guess the authors of this web site 10 missed the specific lesson on causality. 11 But despite this kind of industry spin, the 12 evidence is certainly in. And there is 13 growing awareness that the use of trans 14 fats is one of the aspects of our highly 15 processed diets that is reeking havoc on 16 our health. 17 As Dr. Walter Willett 18 noted and mentioned today, trans fats are 19 responsible for thousands of 20 premature deaths annually. Obviously, you 21 know this, thus the recommendation. So if 22 the facts are in, if we know that trans fats 23 are bad for us, what's the resistance to 24 this kind of policy action? One of the 138 1 complaints from the food industry is that 2 this policy approach is big brother back. 3 In a recent Fox news article, the 4 question was posed this way, Should the 5 government regulate what we eat? But 6 that's actually not a question that this 7 resolution really should raise. Sure the 8 government shouldn't dictate whether any of 9 us can eat a crispy-cream donut. But the 10 government most certainly should protect its 11 citizens from unnecessary added ingredients 12 in our food which are invisible to us, which 13 are undetectable to our tongues, and which 14 harm us. The government should also most 15 certainly protect children who are even less 16 exempt to the informed choices about the 17 foods they eat. 18 Indeed, that is precisely what we 19 expect our government to do. When we find 20 out about contaminants in food that cause 21 harm, take, E-coli 015787 for instance, we 22 expect the government to step in and step in 23 fast on the side of public health. 24 In a similar way, this trans fat ban 139 1 isn't regulating what we can or can't eat. 2 It is simply helping rid our food system in 3 this City of one unnecessary ingredient 4 that has been shown to cause thousands of 5 premature deaths a year. 6 This resolution, in fact, is far 7 from the draconian big-brother move. It's 8 government taking leadership to protect the 9 public health. So the question isn't should 10 the government regulate what we eat, but 11 should the government protect us from harm? 12 And the answer is yes. 13 A corollary argument, I've heard of the 14 big brother one. Is that such a ban, 15 choice, or it's against freedom; whereas one 16 commentator, it's a push to legally prevent 17 individuals from having a french fry their 18 way. But how many New Yorkers or anyone 19 else in this country for that matter ask 20 for trans fats, or even knows when they're 21 eating it? The consumer didn't demand trans 22 fats. The process was invented to increase the 23 shelf-life of food products to increase 24 profitability for the food industry. 140 1 Real choice and real freedom means 2 being able to eat out without worrying that 3 the choice will be harmful to our health. 4 This policy will help all New Yorkers do 5 just that. Thank you. 6 WILFREDO LOPEZ: The next speaker 7 Christopher Sell; Mr. Sell? 8 Geysil Arroyo, Project Coordinator, 9 Institute for Urban Family Health. 10 GEYSIL ARROYO: Good afternoon. 11 Thank you for the opportunity to testify on 12 this important issue. 13 My name is Geysil Arroyo, and I'm the 14 Project Coordinator for a program operated 15 by the Institute for Urban Health Family called 16 Bronx Healthy Hearts. 17 The institute is a non-profit 18 organization that provides comprehensive 19 primary care for medically underserved 20 communities in Manhattan and the Bronx. 21 For the past three years, Bronx Healthy 22 Hearts has worked with restaurants in the 23 southwest Bronx to help them promote and 24 increase their healthier menu options. 141 1 There is no doubt that obesity is 2 the fastest growing cause of disease and 3 death in this country, and heart disease 4 is the number one cause of death among 5 New Yorkers. 6 While there are many reasons that 7 can explain this, one major contributing 8 factor is the food New Yorkers consume 9 at restaurants on a daily basis. Many 10 New Yorkers of all socio-economic groups 11 eat out, and while many of them think that 12 the food they're eating is healthy and 13 tasty, maybe are not aware that many 14 restaurants use oils and margarines that 15 contains trans fats to prepare their dishes. 16 At the Institute for Urban 17 Family Health, we applauded the trans 18 fat educational campaign lead by the 19 Department of Health last year. 20 We also supported the research 21 efforts the Department of Health engaged in 22 to ensure that the current trans fat proposal is 23 feasible for restaurant operators including 24 being cost neutral in the long run. 142 1 Through our experience working with 2 small ethnic restaurants in the southwest 3 Bronx we recognize the challenges owners and 4 cooks face to prepare meals their customers 5 expect while also paying attention to the 6 healthfulness of the meal. 7 For example, some of the restaurants 8 are now cooking their rice and beans without 9 any lard. We have been impressed with the 10 dedication many restaurant owners have 11 demonstrated to improving the heart health 12 of the community they serve. 13 We strongly encourage the 14 Department of Health to assist restaurants 15 and distributors through the transition to 16 cooking without trans fats by continuing the 17 trans fat educational campaign during the 18 phase out period and beyond, and perhaps by 19 temporarily discounting prices for trans 20 fats free oils and products. 21 We believe the trans fat proposal is 22 important to the health of our City and hope 23 that the Department of Health will engage 24 all restaurants as partners to ensure a 143 1 successful transition across the board. 2 On the proposal to require 3 restaurants to list calorie information on 4 menus and menu boards, the Institute for 5 Urban Family Health agrees that this is an 6 effective way to help customers make calorie 7 comparisons between different foods and 8 various serving sizes. 9 At the same time, we recommend 10 that the Department of Health lead a 11 concurrent educational campaign to ensure 12 that consumers understand what a calorie is, 13 what constitutes a perfect caloric intake, 14 and where consumers can find resources 15 that address related questions they may 16 have, and also provide a bigger picture 17 about healthy eating. 18 The Institute for Urban Family Health 19 strongly supports legislation that bans 20 trans fats in restaurants and requires restaurants to list caloric content 21 on menus and menu boards. 22 We hope that the panel today will also 23 support this proposal to protect the health 24 and lives of New Yorkers. Thank you very 144 1 much. 2 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Next 3 speaker is Diane Hes. Ms. Hes is an M.D., 4 Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, 5 New York Methodist Hospital. 6 DIANE HES: Hi, good afternoon. I 7 would like to thank my colleagues who talked 8 about the peer-review research about the 9 dangers of trans fats, and I want to talk a 10 little about the reality of what we see in 11 our practices every day with children in 12 New York City. 13 I have done a specialty in bariatric 14 medicine which until now was never a 15 specialty in pediatrics because a handful 16 of doctors who are now specializing in this 17 cause, cardiologists and endocrinologists 18 are overwhelmed with the number of children 19 who are obese in our clinics. 20 A recent study in New York City 21 showed that 35% of third and fifth graders 22 are obese, which is body mass index greater 23 than 95 percentile. And as one of the 24 former speakers said that this a generation 145 1 of children who will not outlive their 2 parents because of health problems caused by 3 obesity. 4 In the Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, 5 we have established a pediatric weight 6 management center and I also run a Be-Fit 7 program which is a free program for children 8 in the Prospect Park YMCA in Brooklyn for 9 overweight children who can come and participate 10 in health education programs and learn about 11 how to read labels. They learn about portion 12 distortion, and they learn about exercise. 13 Unfortunately, due to limited 14 funding, we can only take care of twenty 15 children every six months in these programs. 16 Just so that you get an idea, I'm the 17 only doctor who does this in my hospital 18 and there's a wait of two to three months 19 for children to come to see me. 20 Obesity is not a billable diagnosis 21 in Medicaid plans, and the hospital absorbs 22 the cost for each child I see and all the 23 blood tests that we do. 24 In part, the commercial plans, about 146 1 one third of the commercial health plans in 2 New York recognize obesity as a diagnosis 3 and the other children who have commercial 4 plans that don't recognize obesity, I still 5 see them on my own and do not get paid. 6 Most doctors in New York City do 7 not have this liberty because they are not in 8 an academic center and they do not have grant 9 funding. So you can only imagine why doctors 10 are overwhelmed and pediatricians are 11 overwhelmed by the burden of obesity. 12 Doctors have one visit. After the 13 age of four, children come one time a year. 14 Doctors have to give shots, anticipatory 15 guidance, and then they have to start to talk 16 about the dangers of trans fats, increased 17 physical activity, and dangers of sugary 18 foods. 19 So you can imagine how hard it is 20 especially with the language barriers that 21 we see in our clinics, about fifty different 22 languages a day, and we have to educate 23 these parents about what the dangers of 24 trans fats are. 147 1 That's why I think this proposal will 2 help us greatly because at least I will know 3 that when my patients leave my office they 4 will not be exposed to the trans fats in the 5 fast foods. And I can't tell you how many 6 times a day I hear that \"If you're good for 7 your shots, you'll get French fries when we 8 leave.\" 9 In the United States, between the ages 10 of 7 to 9 months, the most common vegetable 11 eaten by children are the orange vegetables, 12 the sweet potato, the carrots, the squash. 13 By the age of 19 to 24 months, the most 14 common vegetable eaten by children in the 15 United States is a french fry. 16 And this is a result of marketing 17 to parents and children, especially the lower 18 income families. They have the dollar food 19 menus. And how can parents make an educated 20 choice when things like the educational 21 channels of PBS and Discovery Kids are 22 sponsored by these fast food companies who 23 have a commercial or an advertisement every 24 15 to 20 minutes while their children are 148 1 watching these educational channels where 2 they're supposed to be learning? 3 I see children suffer from multiple 4 complications from obesity. I have kids who 5 come to me, they need a letter because they 6 can't walk the stairs in their elementary 7 school to go up to the second floor so they 8 want an elevator because they are so obese. 9 They want a letter to use the elevator. 10 I have about twenty teens that I take 11 care of who are morbidly obese, who don't 12 go to school because of panic attacks 13 because they're huge, because they are so 14 fat and they're in home-schooling programs. 15 It is my job and the jobs of these 16 other pediatricians to try to tackle these 17 problems in such a short, limited amount of 18 time. And I believe that by changing these 19 laws and eliminating the trans fats, 20 especially in fast foods, and listing the 21 calories, you will help us and our children 22 have a better future. Thank you. 23 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. 24 Our next speaker is Alvin Strelnick. 149 1 Okay, Andrew Racine. Dr. Racine is an 2 M.D., Ph.D., New York Chapters 2 and 3 of 3 the American Academy of Pediatrics. 4 ANDREW RACINE: Commissioner 5 Friedman, members of the Board, I'm honored 6 to be here this morning representing the 7 American Academy of Pediatrics, an 8 organization founded in 1930, which today 9 represent about 60,000 practicing 10 pediatricians who work in the United States 11 dedicated to promoting the optimal health, 12 physical health, mental health, and social 13 health of all infants, children, adolescents 14 and adults. 15 In Chapters 2 and 3 of District II of 16 the American Academy, we take seriously our 17 obligations as clinicians not only to counsel 18 our patients when they come to see us in 19 our office settings, but to advocate for them 20 in a public arena. It's that obligation 21 that brings me here today before you this 22 morning. 23 The American Academy enthusiastically 24 supports the proposed amendments of 150 1 Article 81 of the New York City Health Code 2 that's recently being proposed by the 3 New York City Department of Health and 4 Mental Hygiene. These two proposals are one 5 restricting the sale and distribution of 6 foods containing artificial trans fats, and 7 the other requiring the posting of caloric 8 information at the time of purchase, are 9 both important public health initiatives 10 that will have desirable consequences for 11 the health of all New York City residents. 12 As we noted in the written 13 comments to the Commissioner, trans fats 14 are known to be linked with development of 15 cardiovascular heart disease in adults. 16 But what is less appreciated is that the 17 precursors for this condition begin very 18 early in childhood at a time when food 19 consumption is first being formed. 20 Disturbing research that was 21 reported in the Journal of American Dietetic 22 Association was just quoted by Dr. Hes, which 23 in 2004, it indicated that not only did the 24 19 to 24 month old toddlers have french 151 1 fries as the single most commonly consumed 2 vegetable, but 10% of them are consuming no 3 green vegetables at all; 60% of them are 4 consuming no fruit whatsoever; and fully 60% 5 are being fed baked desserts. 6 Since the vast majority of trans 7 fats are found in commercially prepared 8 fried and baked goods, these eating patterns 9 predispose even very young children to the 10 ingestion of trans fats as regular elements 11 of their diet. 12 A sound approach to the threat posed 13 by these conditions should combine regular 14 dietary counseling as part of routine 15 primary care in the office setting with 16 innovative public health interventions that 17 promote healthy eating patterns. 18 As professionals who interact every 19 day with parents concerned about their 20 children's health, we recognize the 21 importance of both of these strategies, and 22 applaud the New York City Department of 23 Health and Mental Hygiene in its efforts to 24 have food service establishments restrict 152 1 the amount of trans fats included in the 2 foods they sell. There are health 3 substitutes for these substances that 4 are equally flavorful, easily obtained, 5 and as economical. By restricting foods 6 containing trans fats, the Department will 7 have taken a historic step in the direction 8 of improving the cardiovascular health of 9 all New Yorkers. 10 The second proposed amendment to the 11 New York City Health Code, Amendment 81.50, 12 is equally important to the health of 13 children and receives our unqualified 14 support as well. Epidemiological evidence 15 from longitudinal studies indicates that 16 overweight and excess caloric intake among 17 other risk factors track from childhood to 18 adult life. 19 Moreover, the twin epidemics of 20 obesity and Type 2 diabetes are becoming 21 increasingly severe over time in the young 22 pediatric age group, particularly in areas 23 such as New York City where recent estimates 24 indicate that one-fifth of kindergarteners 153 1 are obese. 2 As with the issue of trans fat 3 consumption, we believe that addressing the 4 problem of excess caloric intake in the 5 pediatric population must be a multi-pronged 6 approach. As has recently been expressed in 7 a Policy Statement from the American Academy 8 of Pediatrics, when addressing a primary 9 prevention approach to nutrition: 10 \"Education, with the support of the 11 health care community, combined with health 12 policy and environmental change to support 13 optimal nutrition and physical activity, are 14 essential to this health strategy.\" 15 Parents routinely struggle when 16 trying to resist the effects of 17 well-financed, food-related messages in print 18 and electronic media that daily attempt to 19 influence their children's food purchases. 20 A recent report in the New England Journal 21 of Medicine indicated that American children 22 are exposed to approximately 40,000 23 food-related advertisements per year, 72% 24 of which are for candy, cereal, and fast 154 1 food. 2 What's more, the Institute of 3 Medicine believes that these messages are 4 successful in shaping product preferences 5 and eating habits. 6 Any aid that we can provide 7 beleaguered parents to help guide their 8 choice of foods toward more nutritious 9 alternatives constitutes an important public 10 health intervention. If parents and young 11 people are to be able to make wise decisions 12 concerning which foods to consume while 13 dining out, it's imperative that they be 14 provided accurate information about the 15 caloric content of foods at the time they 16 are making their decisions about what to 17 buy. 18 Such information, clearly displayed 19 at the time of purchase, will, when combined 20 with the messages conveyed at primary care 21 visits, enable parents and their children to 22 moderate their intake of high calorie items 23 containing large quantities of fats and 24 carbohydrates. Mandated labeling of the 155 1 type proposed by this amendment brings more, 2 not less information into the marketplace, 3 thereby helping to promote more 4 well-informed food choices. 5 The American Academy of Pediatrics 6 endorses a vigorous governmental role in 7 addressing public health issues. We agree 8 with the Institute of Medicine's recent 9 report that invokes a role for government 10 at all levels, and Chapters 2 and 3 of 11 District II have historically recognized 12 the vital contributions of the New York City 13 Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in 14 promoting the health of New York City 15 residents through a variety of critical 16 activities. The two proposed amendments to 17 the New York City Health Code are very much 18 in keeping with this rich tradition, and we 19 are pleased to join with the Department in 20 support of their adoption. Thank you. 21 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Next speaker 22 Annmarie Colbin. Ms. Colbin has a Ph.D and is 23 the Author of \"Food and Healing\", and founder of 24 the Natural Gourmet Institute for Health and 156 1 Culinary Arts. 2 ANNEMARIE COLBIN: Good afternoon. 3 Thank you very much for including me in your 4 speakers' list. 5 My name is Annemarie Colbin and I'm 6 here to speak for the Natural Gourmet 7 Institute for Health and Culinary Arts, of 8 which I am the founder. The Natural Gourmet 9 is the oldest natural foods cooking school 10 in the country. We will be 30 years old in 11 2007, and have been teaching people to cook 12 and eat healthful food all these years. 13 I'm here to talk about regulating the 14 presence of trans fats in restaurant food 15 which is amendment to 81.08. I'd like to briefly 16 address two points. Number one is the 17 issue of fats in food and cooking. Number 18 two is the issue of banning unhealthy 19 ingredients in food. 20 Regarding the issue of fats, we, at 21 the Natural Gourmet, support the science that 22 has determined that artificially produced 23 trans fatty acids are deleterious to the 24 health of the public. We agree with the 157 1 concerns about the presence of trans fats 2 in the food supply. Teachers at the Natural 3 Gourmet have never used and never will use 4 artificial or hydrogenated fats with trans 5 fatty acids in them or even those without. 6 While we agree that trans fats 7 are unhealthy, the classification of 8 monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated 9 fats as good fats, and trans fats and 10 saturated fats as bad fats is misleading. 11 It appears to be based entirely on their 12 presumed effects on serum cholesterol. 13 According to our information, most 14 of the oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty 15 acids, such as corn, soybean, safflower, 16 sunflower, canola and cottonseed, should not 17 be consumed in large quantity as they 18 contain significant amounts of the Omega 6 19 fatty acid and linoleic acid. Especially 20 cottonseed should be avoided, for cotton is 21 not considered a food crop and is sprayed 22 extensively. 23 These oils are processed at very high 24 temperatures and pressures which not only 158 1 can create some trans fat, but also destroy 2 the beneficial properties of the oil. They 3 become rancid easily from exposure to light, 4 oxygen, and heat, and so become a source of 5 free radicals. 6 Although the linoleic Omega 6 found 7 in the plant oils is an essential nutrient, 8 an excess of it has been shown in several 9 studies to promote cancer and heart disease. 10 The other essential fatty acid, the Omega 3 11 or linolenic acid, is required for good brain 12 function as well as cardiovascular health. 13 Omega 3s are found in fatty fish, walnuts, 14 flaxseeds, and other foods. 15 Many researchers estimate that the 16 ideal ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 should 17 be one to three parts Omega 6 to one part 18 Omega 3, but the ratio for modern Americans 19 is closer to 20 to 50% parts Omega 6 to one 20 part Omega 3. This can lead to chronic 21 inflammation, decreased blood circulation, 22 and increased blood clotting. Furthermore, 23 these liquid plant oils don't produce the 24 same culinary effects as solid fats. 159 1 For the cook, saturated fats, those 2 solid at room temperature, fulfill a certain 3 culinary purpose of texture and flavor. 4 Traditional saturated fats, such as butter, 5 palm oil, and coconut oil, fell out of favor 6 with the cholesterol scares. They were 7 replaced with hydrogenated fats which are 8 the ones containing the trans fatty acids, 9 which, in fact, are polyunsaturated fats 10 that have been saturated artificially. Now 11 that it has been found that the imitation 12 replacement is damaging, what shall it be 13 replaced with? It's easy for non-cooks to 14 tell cooks what to cook with. But a cake 15 made with oil is not the same in any way as 16 a cake made with butter or even shortening. 17 Natural saturated fats are more 18 stable than trans fats or unsaturated fats 19 and have been used for cooking since humans 20 began cooking with fat. They have many 21 benefits, including anti-microbial properties 22 and the effect of raising protective HDL 23 cholesterol. Traditional coconut and palm 24 oils which are saturated are used traditionally 160 1 by several populations that boast much lower 2 rates of chronic diseases and, thus, plaguing 3 Americans today. 4 If saturated fats were useless or 5 harmful, why would breast milk provide an 6 abundance of saturated fatty acids, such as 7 butyric, caproic, caprylic, lauric and other 8 fatty acids? After all, breast milk is 9 designed to ensure the growth, brain 10 development, and survival of children. So 11 perhaps it's time to go back to natural 12 saturated fats from healthy animals and 13 from plants. 14 Replacing hydrogenated fats with 15 others that have been chemically manipulated 16 to be solid at room temperature, even if 17 they contain no trans fats or at least no 18 measurable amounts, is a double-edged sword. 19 It took over 50 years to figure out that 20 trans fats are dangerous. Will it take us 21 long to find out what the problems are with 22 their replacements? Have any studies been 23 done to see if they have bad effects in the 24 very long run? 161 1 We, of the Natural Gourmet, support the 2 use of natural, traditional fats, be they 3 mono or polyunsaturated or saturated. I 4 guess I'm done. Thank you. 5 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. Please leave 6 the rest of your comments. Thank you. Next 7 speaker, Rick Burman. Mr. Burman is the 8 Executive Director of The Center for 9 Consumer Freedom. Okay. 10 Next speaker, Stephen Hanson. 11 Mr. Hanson? Next, Chris Giarraputo, 12 Corporate Executive Chef, B.R. Guest. 13 CHRIS GIARRAPUTO: Good afternoon. 14 My name is Chris Giarraputo. I'm a 15 Corporate Executive Chef for B.R. Guest 16 restaurants. We're a 14-unit, multi-concept 17 restaurant group here in New York City. 18 We have Dos Caminos, Mexican, Ruby Foo's 19 Asian Blue Water Grill/Blue Fin, just to 20 give you an idea of the assortment of types 21 of restaurants that we operate. 22 Dr. Frieden approached us about a 23 year ago to explore eliminating trans fats 162 1 from our restaurants, and over the course of 2 the last year, B.R. Guest has equally found 3 products that are equal or superior in 4 quality to products that contain trans fats. 5 We found replacements for such items as 6 solid shortening used in baking, cooking 7 oils, and peanut butter. 8 Restaurants similar to us shouldn't 9 have any problem finding products that are 10 trans fat free. We cook basically from 11 scratch and use real foods and natural 12 products. Trans fat products are inventions 13 of food laboratories that were developed in 14 the '50s and '60s, not foods that our 15 grandparents used and our great grandparents 16 used. If we stuck to the products our 17 grandparents used, we would stay trans fat 18 free. 19 Since this proposal has been made, 20 more and more of our distributors are 21 stocking trans fat free alternatives and 22 prices are coming down. Just looking at 23 advertisements in food-related magazines and 163 1 reading labels in supermarkets will show you 2 the heightened awareness in the food 3 processing industry and the strong pressure 4 in the marketplace to replace trans fats in 5 processed foods with natural trans fat free 6 oils. 7 Processed food manufacturers that 8 still haven't caught on to the need to go to 9 non-hydrogenated oils containing no trans 10 fats will feel even more pressure because of 11 the proposal the Board of Health is 12 considering, and it will go a long way to 13 educating manufacturers, distributors, and 14 consumers alike. 15 I just want to thank the Board for 16 allowing me to speak, and I hope that the 17 proposal gets passed. Thank you. 18 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you very much next 19 speaker is Moqbul Hossain, President, Best of 20 Tandoor Corporation. Not here, okay. 21 Next, Maria Martins-Lopes, M.D., 22 Senior Vice President and Chief Medical 23 Officer of GHI. 24 MARIA MARTINS-LOPES: Good afternoon. 164 1 My name is Maria Lopes. I'm senior VP and 2 Chief Medical Officer of Group Health 3 Incorporated. Thank you for permitting me 4 to speak in favor of the proposed amendment. 5 GHI has a long history of caring for 6 the health needs of New York City by 7 providing health coverage and administrative 8 services for more than 2.6 million people. 9 While individuals, employers, and 10 their health plans can do much to promote 11 healthy lifestyles, there's also a role for 12 government. And in our modern society, and 13 particularly in a large urban environment 14 such as New York with thousands of dining 15 options, government can assist with 16 educating the public and setting standards 17 that limit the population's risk of exposure 18 to foods and substances that are harmful. 19 Prevention of a condition is always 20 preferable to treating someone once they 21 have the disease. This includes actions 22 such as the one being proposed today to 23 remove trans fats from the City's food 24 service establishments. 165 1 We've known for decades that 2 consumption of trans fatty acids might be 3 contributing to the significant increase 4 in coronary heart disease, and studies have 5 shown that trans fats have adverse effects 6 on the lipid profile, as my colleague 7 mentioned before, raising LDL, the bad 8 cholesterol, and decreasing HDL cholesterol. 9 According to published articles from 10 many sources, including Harvard School of 11 Public Health, removal of trans fats from 12 the industrial diet could prevent tens of 13 thousands of heart attacks and cardiac 14 deaths each year in the U.S. 15 In New York State, cardiovascular 16 disease is the leading cause of death, 17 killing more than 70,000 residents each 18 year, and for every person who dies from a 19 heart attack or angina, 18 live with these 20 conditions. For every person who dies 21 from a stroke, seven people cope with the 22 consequences of a non-fatal event. Many 23 of these survivors become disabled and can no 24 longer lead productive lives. They also 166 1 are at risk for additional events, and these 2 numbers are increasing as the epidemic of 3 heart disease and stroke continues. 4 The increase in cardiovascular disease is 5 anticipated to worsen given the growing 6 obesity epidemic in the U.S. with two-thirds 7 of American adults being overweight half of 8 these are obese, and 15% of children between 9 ages 6 and 19, and 10% of children between 10 ages 2 and 5 already overweight. 11 Disparity of obesity, diabetes, and heart 12 disease are even more pronounced among 13 Hispanic and African-American New Yorkers. 14 GHI applauds the Department's efforts to 15 educate the public about healthy, nutritional 16 choices to improve the health status of the 17 population. 18 Finally, I want to comment briefly on 19 the Department's proposal to require certain 20 restaurants to post calorie information 21 regarding their food items on sign boards 22 and menus where it can be reviewed before 23 people order. GHI is pleased to see that 24 this requirement is limited to those chain 167 1 restaurants that have the capacity to 2 produce the information. Often, these 3 restaurants already have portion controlled 4 serving sizes and already provide calorie 5 and nutritional information, but not in 6 places where it can easily be visible prior 7 to ordering. 8 Again, thank you for letting me speak 9 in support of these proposals. 10 WILFREDO LOPEZ: Thank you. It is 11 now almost 1:00 o'clock and I'd like to 12 remind the public that the hearing was 13 originally scheduled to take place from 14 10:00 to 1:00 p.m. The Board members, I 15 don't think, will be able to stay much 16 longer. We will continue with this hearing 17 so that everybody who wants to speak can get 18 their comments on the record. 19 In keeping with what we've been doing, 20 we'll call the people who missed their turn 21 during the last hour, and I will turn the meeting 22 over to Roslyn Windholz, Deputy General 23 Counsel. 24 So the first speaker who missed 168 1 his turn during the last hour was 2 Jim Lesczynski. The next was 3 Christopher Sell; Alvin Strelnick; 4 Rick Burman. 5 Dr. Strelnick is here. He's a 6 doctor at Montefiore Medical Hospital and 7 Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 8 ALVIN STRELNICK: Thank you for the 9 opportunity to speak in support of the 10 New York City Department of Health and 11 Mental Hygiene's proposed elimination of 12 partially hydrogenated oils from commercial 13 kitchens and restaurants so that New York 14 City consumers may purchase foods and food 15 products free of industrially reproduced 16 trans fat. 17 My name is Alvin Strelnick. I am 18 trained as a family physician at Montefiore 19 Medical Center in the Bronx and 20 practice family and community medicine since 21 1975. I'm a professor of Family and Social 22 Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of 23 Medicine where I direct Hispanics in our 24 excellence and Minority Health Disparity 169 1 Center, known by its acronym, Bronx Creed. 2 My remarks are based largely on the 3 recent scientific review in the medical 4 literature entitled \"Trans Fat Fatty Acids 5 and Cardiovascular Disease\" published in the 6 April 13th, 2006 issue of the New England 7 Journal of Medicine, written by authors from 8 the Netherlands and the Harvard School of 9 Public Health. 10 As you know, trans fats are formed 11 from vegetable oil during their pressure 12 hydrogenation into semi-solid fats produced 13 for margarines, official cooking and food 14 manufacturing to prolong shelf life, 15 stabilize good frying oils, and enhance the 16 power of ability of baked goods and sweets. 17 Trans fats increase the risk of heart 18 attacks and strokes through at least three 19 different and well-documented mechanisms. 20 They increase high density lipoprotein HDL 21 as the good cholesterol and increase low 22 density lipoproteins or bad cholesterol 23 triglyceride and other lipoproteins that 24 promote systemic inflammation and they cause 170 1 endothelial dysfunction, and that is they 2 interfere with the cells that lie in the 3 body's blood vessels. 4 A quote from the New England Journal 5 of Medicine \"On a per calorie basis trans 6 fats appear to increase the risk of 7 cardiovascular disease more than any other 8 macronutrient that brings a substantial increase 9 risk at low levels of consumption, 1 to 3% of total 10 energy intake. 2% increase in energy intake 11 from trans fatty acids was associated with a 12 23% increase in the incidents of 13 cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and 14 strokes. The evidence of trans fat for 15 contribution to sudden death and diabetes is 16 less well-documented. 17 Since January 1st, 2006, the U.S. 18 Food and Drug Administration has required 19 nutrition labels for all conventional foods 20 in cooked foods/trans fats, as well as 21 cholesterol or unsaturated fats and total 22 fats following its 2005 Dietary 23 Guidelines Advisory Committee's 24 recommendation to eliminate consumption of 171 1 trans fats to below 1% of calorie intake. 2 U.S. Department of Agriculture made 3 eliminating trans fat intake a key 4 element to this huge pyramid guidelines. 5 In 2004, Denmark placed a 2% limit on 6 trans fats and essentially eliminated the 7 use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils 8 which will replace unsaturated fatty acids, 9 tropical saturated oils and fully , 10 hydrogenated vegetable oils without 11 increasing consumption of saturated fats. 12 Both government and the industry 13 agree that these changes did not officially 14 alter the quality, cost, or availability of 15 food including the french fries and chicken 16 nuggets of U.S. fast food chains. Canada is 17 considering following the Danish model. 18 In Norway, Finland and the Netherlands 19 cooperative efforts between government 20 and the food industry have resulted in 21 substantial reduction in consumption of 22 trans fats, again without increasing cost or 23 reduction in the quality or availability of 24 foods. 172 1 In the United States, fast food 2 Frito Lays and Wendy's, and as of this 3 morning, Kentucky Fried Chicken, have also 4 already voluntarily reduced to eliminating 5 trans fat from their products. 6 The authors of the New England 7 Journal of Medicine article estimated that 8 near elimination of trans fats from the 9 American diet can considerably prevent 10 72,000 or 6%, to 228,000 or 19%, of the 11 1.2 million heart attacks, strokes, and 12 deaths from cardiovascular disease each 13 year. The article's senior author, 14 Walter C. Willett, M.D., Ph.D, who was 15 on the testimony list of the Harvard 16 School of Public Health, calculated a trans 17 fat ban would mean 500 fewer deaths from 18 cardiovascular disease in New York City 19 each year. 20 The New York City Department of 21 Health and Mental Hygiene first tried the 22 voluntary program to achieve these goals 23 in reducing and eliminating trans fats 24 from the City's restaurants and commercial 173 1 kitchens, but this failed to move the 2 industry. Consumers do not have labels to 3 read to determine whether trans fats are in 4 their french fries, chicken nuggets, or a 5 morning muffin. They have no real choices. 6 For a modest cost, New York City can 7 save lives now by eliminating the 8 unnecessary risky chemical from our diet and 9 benefit those living in low income 10 communities like the south 11 Bronx where most rely on fast foods 12 because they're the only restaurants 13 in their neighborhood. Thank you. 14 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Okay, Rick Burman; 15 Stephen Hanson; Moqbul Fichera? 16 SAL FICHERA: Commissioner, 17 Dr. Frieden and the Department of Health as 18 well as anyone interested in freedom of 19 choice. This is such a vital issue and I am 20 very pleased that we have the opportunity to 21 speak here today. After all, the banning of 22 trans fats is not at all about the increase 23 of costs for businesses or control by the 24 government. Instead, it's about freedom 174 1 of choice, the freedom to avoid toxic 2 substances that don't belong in food. It's 3 about having the freedom to eat and live 4 more healthfully. 5 As an exercise physiologist, public 6 speaker, and author, I spend each day studying, 7 researching, and teaching principles for 8 living a longer, stronger life. I've 9 appeared on TV channels like CNN, Dateline 10 and NBC addressing a variety of issues that 11 concern health. 12 Today, I'm here to speak about life, 13 the life of our citizens, life of our 14 economy, our culture, because our culture 15 today is being threatened. We are at war. 16 Billions of dollars are being spent 17 each year and hundreds of thousands of lives 18 are being lost, and I'm not talking about 19 the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm 20 talking about a war right here within our 21 own boundaries, not in the form of bullets 22 and bombs, but in the form of glitzy 23 advertising and misleading information. 24 Nationally speaking, we are losing 300,000 175 1 American lives prematurely due to obesity 2 alone and overweight. This is costing us 3 118 billion dollars. 4 Now, from what I understand, the 5 National Restaurant Association has a few 6 concerns about this proposal. They believe 7 it is a violation of rights. But anyone who 8 steps outside to have dinner at a restaurant 9 if there's trans fats in their foods, is being 10 violated. None of my clients asked for it 11 and every time I teach my clients to eat 12 healthy, they take two steps back again. 13 They commented that this is based merely on 14 a computer model. That's false as has been 15 mentioned several times before. 16 Denmark, for example, in 2004, made it 17 illegal for any foods to have more than 2% 18 trans fats, and the results, first of all, 19 consumers didn't even know the difference. 20 The fries are still crispy; the chicken is 21 still tasty. 22 Another result, the Danish 23 cardiovascular disease has fallen by 20% 24 over the last five years. In countries that 176 1 aren't making an effort in food, like Hungary 2 and Bulgaria, their heart disease rates have 3 continued to rise. 4 Another statement made earlier by 5 someone from the health establishment, from 6 the restaurant establishment, was that 7 saturated fats and trans fats are the same. 8 They're not. When you eat trans fats it 9 elevates bad cholesterol. Not only does it 10 elevate the bad cholesterol it lowers the 11 good as well. That does not happen with 12 saturated fats. And please don't 13 misunderstand me. If you had to 15 pick your poison it is a chemical. 16 It is not a food but a chemical, a toxin. It 17 does not belong in food. This is not at all 18 a question of freedom of choosing foods but 19 I choose to keep poisons, toxins, drugs, 20 anything outside of my own food. So for the 21 National Restaurant Association I ask which 22 matters more shelf life or life itself? 23 I support Dr. Frieden in this ban. I 24 think that we need to realize that there are 177 1 many factors involved when we're dealing 2 with heart disease but it all starts with 3 one step at a time. And this is a big step 4 because once again, I suggest that we all 5 vote, we all strive to have the freedom to 6 choose what is in our foods. 7 And so I want to thank the Department 8 of Health and Dr. Frieden for addressing 9 this critical issue. We have no choice. We 10 have a very serious crisis and if we don't 11 start making changes our health care system 12 will collapse. So let's start now and lets 13 take trans fats from our foods. Thank you. 14 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Next speaker we 15 have is Paul Kligfield, M.D, President of 16 the New York State Chapter of the American 17 College of Cardiology. 18 PAUL KLIGFIELD: My name is 19 Paul Kligfield and I'm going to speak today as 20 the President of the New York State Chapter of 21 the American College of Cardiology and also 22 as President-Elect of our educational 23 affiliate, the New York Cardiological 24 Society. I represent most clinical and 178 1 academic cardiologists in New York City and 2 New York State. 3 At a recent meeting of our State Council 4 the New York State Chapter of the American 5 College of Cardiology endorsed the 6 initiatives of the New York City Department 7 of Health and Mental Hygiene regarding the 8 phasing out of artificial trans fats and the 9 listing of calorie content on menus in 10 New York City. We applaud the leadership 11 demonstrated by the Department in ensuring 12 the health of New Yorkers. 13 To be brief, I'm not going to restate 14 the issues regarding the dangers of trans 15 fats, but summarize this by saying that the 16 use of trans fat oils in food served in 17 restaurants constitutes a major risk and 18 also an unnecessary risk to the health of 19 New Yorkers. 20 Most of the trans fats in our diets 21 is found in industrially produced trans fats 22 used in frying, baking, and in processed 23 foods. We note the particular dependence of 24 children and working New Yorkers on 179 1 commercially available food products during 2 daily life. Experiences in other settings that 3 you've heard suggests that trans fats can be 4 replaced with heart healthier alternatives without 5 significant effects on taste or cost of 6 preparation. It is, therefore, in the best 7 health interests of all New Yorkers that the 8 Department of Health amendment of Article 81 9 of the Health Code be adopted to restrict 10 our food service establishments from using 11 trans fats products. 12 For similar reasons, we also endorse 13 the labeling of calorie content of foods on 14 menus to help limit the impact of diabetes 15 and obesity on the mortality and morbidity 16 of New Yorkers by providing informed food 17 choices in restaurants. We believe it is in 18 the best health interests of all New Yorkers 19 that the Department of Health amendment of 20 Article 81 of the Health Code be adopted to 21 list caloric content of foods. 22 And with regards to both amendments, 23 we recognize the importance of the food service 24 industry's commitment to change in the best 180 1 interests of the population of New York. We 2 look forward to solution of some of the 3 problems that we've heard discussed here today 4 that might impede implementation of these 5 resolutions, and we will be happy as a group 6 to assist the Department, the food industry, 7 and our citizens in any way that will 8 facilitate better health for all 9 New Yorkers. Thank you. 10 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Kate Mackenzie, 11 Director of Food and Nutrition at FoodChange. 12 KATE MACKENZIE: Good afternoon. My 13 name is Kate Mackenzie. I am the Director 14 of Food and Nutrition at FoodChange. I am 15 also a registered dietician. FoodChange is 16 a 26 year old non-profit organization in 17 New York City that strives to improve lives 18 through nutrition, education, and financial 19 empowerment. We do this in schools 20 primarily through our schools 21 health initiatives which is served to change 22 the food that is served in New York City 23 schools, our community kitchen in 24 West Harlem and community organizations 181 1 throughout the City. 2 Thank you for holding this hearing 3 to not only provide public comment about the 4 two proposed amendments to the New York City 5 Health Code, but also for allowing the 6 community to request recommendations for 7 implementation. 8 FoodChange fully supports making 9 calorie information known to consumers. 10 This information is already widely available, 11 but it is not easily accessible. Typically, 12 such information is available via our web site 13 or occasionally in a small print brochure if 14 requested. 15 The increasing rates of overweight 16 and obesity presents a significant threat to 17 the current and future public health of the 18 city. While food choices clearly are not 19 the only cause for these conditions, they 20 are a large contributor. 21 Providing consumers with calorie 22 information about food choices can lead to 23 an informed choice. Think to yourself, how 24 many times have you eaten out in the last 182 1 week? The majority of New Yorkers get at 2 least a third, if not more, of their 3 calories from food eaten away from home. 4 Even when we think we know the nutritional 5 value, including calories of the foods we 6 choose, the reality is we don't. As a 7 result, too many people are consuming too 8 many calories and without adequate energy 9 expenditure. This leads to weight gain. 10 One pound of weight gain is equal to an 11 excess of 3,500 calories. It sounds like a 12 lot, but when you consider that a large soda 13 contains as many as 600 calories, you can 14 see that it isn't hard for the excess 15 calories to add up. 16 Providing this service to New Yorkers 17 is a significant approach to reducing rates 18 of overweight and obesity. When paired with 19 strong nutrition education, this amendment 20 has the potential to transform the long-term 21 health of many New Yorkers. 22 To this point, nutrition education 23 alone has not been an overwhelmingly 24 effective means of informing food choice, 183 1 primarily because the food environment has 2 not allowed for health promoting choices. 3 Clearly, displaying calorie content will 4 enhance the food environment in restaurants 5 so consumers can more easily make these 6 informed choices. 7 Section 81.50 of the Health Code 8 would restrict New York City food service 9 establishments from using artificial trans 10 fats, with the exception of foods served in 11 the manufacturers' original sealed packages. 12 Again, FoodChange offers its full support of 13 this amendment. The evidence is clear and 14 sound that consumption of trans fat not only 15 increases LDL cholesterol, but decreases HDL 16 levels. This, in turn, increases the risk of 17 heart disease. 18 It's important to note that trans fat 19 can feasibly be replaced with alternative 20 items. The Health Department should be 21 commended for implementing their Trans Fat 22 Education Campaign, which aimed to 23 encourage food service establishments to 24 voluntarily switch to trans fat free oils 184 1 and shortenings. Because of the campaign's 2 limited success, the Department is taking 3 the next necessary step toward eliminating 4 artificial trans fats from the City. 5 Removing trans fats will lower the 6 risk of disease for anyone who eats out in 7 New York City, and that's just about 8 everyone, but especially for people who are 9 dependent on inexpensive and highly 10 processed food. Lower disease rates, in 11 turn, will likely lower medical costs to the 12 City associated with nutrition-related 13 disease risk factors. 14 In addition to our support for 15 Section 81.50, FoodChange encourages the 16 Board of Health to take special 17 consideration about implementation in free 18 feeding programs, particularly within the 19 emergency food system. 20 It's well-known that soup kitchens in 21 particular are, in fact, not \"emergency sources\" 22 of food for their recipients, but rather 23 they are regular and they are necessary. 24 These food service establishments obtain 185 1 their funding through City Emergency Food 2 Assistance Program dollars, State, HPNAP 3 dollars, and Federal Emergency Food 4 Assistance Program dollars, TEFAP dollars, 5 in addition to very needy donations. 6 Technically, food coming into soup kitchens 7 from each of these sources would have to be 8 artificial trans fat free. This idea and 9 its potential reality is brilliant, yet its 10 practicality is slim at best. However, if 11 it's accomplished, New York City could 12 revolutionize the emergency food system of 13 the country by slowing the influx of foods 14 of poor nutritional value into this system 15 which feeds vulnerable consumers. 16 Given that soup kitchens generally 17 don't have enough food to meet their demand, 18 FoodChange strongly encourages the Board of 19 Health to consider the repercussions of 20 further limiting this food supply. 21 Again, FoodChange offers its full 22 support to these amendments. Thank you. 23 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Dr. Ruth Kava, 24 Director of Nutrition, American Council on 186 1 Science and Health. 2 RUTH KAVA: Thank you very much for 3 having me speak. I am a representative of 4 the American Council on Science and Health 5 in New York City, a public health consortium 6 that is directed by approximately 350 7 leading scientists and physicians, and I 8 really want to speak very briefly to the 9 issue of the amendment to restrict the 10 New York City food service establishments 11 from providing foods containing trans fatty 12 acids that are produced by artificially 13 hydrogenated vegetable oils. 14 This proposed ban is predicated on 15 the assumption that doing this ban will 16 significantly decrease the consumption of 17 these fats by food service patrons, and that 18 this decreased consumption will have a 19 discernible health benefit, in particular 20 a decrease in heart disease. It is the 21 position of the American Council on Science 22 and Health however, that the scientific data 23 do not strongly support such a health 24 benefit. 187 1 As of 2003, the FDA estimated that 2 the average intake of trans fats by 3 Americans contributed about 2.6% of total 4 calories and since that time, especially 5 since labeling requirements that went into 6 effect this January, food manufacturers have 7 been required to list trans fats on their 8 food labels, and the amount of these fats in 9 foods has been declining. Although some 10 media reports attribute unique detrimental 11 health effects to trans fats, in fact, the 12 strongest evidence indicates that they are 13 similar to saturated fats in their health 14 effects. That is, they increase blood 15 levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol which is 16 in turn linked to an increased risk of heart 17 disease. 18 There is some evidence, by no means 19 conclusive, that TFAs also decrease the 20 blood levels of HDL or good cholesterol. 21 But the data suggesting that this is the 22 case are not robust. Only at high levels of 23 consumption have trans fats been seen to 24 have such an effect, not at the levels that 188 1 are commonly consumed by Americans. 2 Because of these effects of blood 3 lipids LDL increases and possible HDL 4 decreases, it is logical to assume that 5 further decreasing the amounts of trans fats 6 consumed will have an effect on the 7 prevalence of deaths from heart disease. 8 But there are no data actually demonstrating 9 that the effect on blood lipids actually 10 translates into an effect on heart disease. 11 All we have are widely varying estimates. 12 The FDA has estimated that nationwide, 13 they could prevent something like 120 deaths 14 a year, and epidemiologists' reports have gone 15 as high as 200,000, so you have quite a 16 range of possibilities. 17 As has been mentioned, before Denmark 18 has limited the amount of trans fats allowed 19 in their foods, but again, we don't know yet 20 if their replacement of trans fats with 21 other fats has had a beneficial effect on 22 the population's health. And when I say 23 that, I mean we don't have any peer-reviewed 24 published studies yet that follow the health 189 1 of the people. Since then, trans fats were 2 banned and we may not know this for a number 3 of years yet. 4 To a great extent, any health effects 5 of minimizing trans fats from our foods and 6 diets will depend on the nature of their 7 replacements. If they are replaced with 8 highly saturated fats, which are known to 9 also raise LDL cholesterol, the effect may 10 not be beneficial. There are other proposed 11 replacements, but again, we don't know the 12 health effects of all of them. Let us not 13 forget that the reason we now have as much 14 trans fats in our diets as we did in the past, a 15 few years ago, food manufacturers and purveyors 16 were encouraged to substitute them for more 17 highly saturated animal fats because trans 18 fats were thought to pose a greater health 19 risk. Now, how do we know that number 1, 20 further reduction in trans fats will be 21 beneficial or 2, their replacements would be 22 any better in terms of the blood lipid 23 levels and heart health? 24 Although the proposed ban on the 190 1 use of trans fats by New York City food 2 establishments sounds like a health- 3 promoting step, in fact, the science to 4 support such a move is not yet robust, 5 and such a ban is, in our opinion, both 6 coercive and premature. 7 We have just finished and posted on 8 our web site a report on trans fatty acids 9 and heart disease which can be accessed by 10 any one at www.ACSH.org in which we reviewed 11 the scientific underpinning of the health 12 effects of trans fats. Thank you. 13 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Dr. Elizabeth 14 Whelan. Melissa Rodin-Ramirez. 15 Dr. Theodore Strange. 16 Fay Cesarano, Director of Nutrition. 17 Catherine Abate, President and CEO, 18 Community Health Care Network. 19 CATHERINE ABATE: Yes. Thank you 20 very much. My name is Catherine Abate. 21 I'm President and CEO of Community 22 Health Care Network and I want to thank 23 the Commissioner of the Department of 24 Health in fostering these initiatives. 191 1 We've waited these hours and submitted 2 these testimonies because we believe this 3 is a very important matter that affects our 4 patients. 5 Community Health Care Network has 6 been in existence for 25 years, serving 7 some of the poorest and most underserved 8 communities in New York City for the five 9 boroughs. We provide primary care, mental 10 health, and social services. 11 We support these initiatives and we'd 12 like to speak, although we haven't gotten an 13 informed consent from our patients, but we 14 think we safely can speak for the thousands 15 of patients we serve, and we overwhelmingly 16 support these initiatives for three reasons. 17 One, we believe it will not only 18 increase general awareness to our patients 19 of what they're eating, it will increase 20 their health literacy and their ability to 21 make healthier decisions in their life. 22 The ban of trans fats, of course, will improve 23 their health outcome. And third, we're 24 uniquely positioned in supporting this 192 1 initiative because our patients are the 2 very persons who will benefit from these 3 proposals. 4 The individuals we see are by and 5 large uninsured or underinsured. They're 6 the working poor; they are the homeless. 7 90% of the people we see are at or below the 8 Federal poverty level and they come from 9 communities where the epidemic of obesity, 10 heart disease, and diabetes is rampant. And 11 the communities they live in, oftentimes 12 supermarkets that offer a variety of 13 affordable health foods are not available 14 therefore, they rely more and more on 15 fast foods for a quick meal and thereby, 16 consume low cost, high caloric foods 17 saturated in trans fat. 18 So let me just end before I turn this 19 over to our Director of Nutrition, that we 20 support this, but we also recognize that 21 these initiatives are not a total solution, 22 but they are an important step. 23 And I invite you, Commissioner, 24 to think about building allies within 193 1 government itself. It should not be up 2 to health providers and the Department of 3 Health to promote a public health campaign. 4 And some day I envision a government in 5 New York City where every agency who reaches 6 out to their own constituents in that agency 7 have their own health messages coordinated 8 by the Commissioner, so there are teachable 9 moments throughout the day, throughout 10 government, in every work of every agency 11 to reach out and be part of this effort. 12 And also, I want to include the 13 agencies they contract with in the private 14 and not-for-profit sector. In a coordinated 15 way, we could increase public health 16 messages and in a public health campaign. 17 FAY CESARANO: Hi, everyone. My 18 name is Fay Cesarano and I'm a registered 19 dietician and a certified diabetes educator. 20 In more than 15 years of experience 21 in the field of nutrition, health patients 22 face the challenges of fighting 23 nutrition-related diseases on a daily basis. 24 Of all the thousands of patients we service, 194 1 there is not one who is not in need of or 2 would not benefit from nutrition 3 intervention. Of particular concern to 4 us are our children who generally come from 5 underserviced, low income communities that 6 are inundated with fast food restaurants 7 that serve high calorie, overly processed 8 foods. Being exposed to trans fats and 9 non-nutrient dense foods from an early 10 age puts them at even greater risk with 11 developing nutrition-related problems as 12 they get older. 13 It saddens me to report that it is 14 not uncommon for our pediatricians to refer 15 patients as young as 9 and 10 years old for 16 medical nutrition therapy secondary to 17 obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, and 18 pre-diabetes. 19 No matter the economic costs of 20 phasing out trans fats, the health and human 21 costs would be even greater. In our 22 health centers, patients who report regular 23 consumption of foods high in trans fats 24 consistently have more health problems, such 195 1 as overweight, pre-diabetes, elevated 2 cholesterol levels, and borderline 3 hypertension, which is left unattended in 4 developing the costly and chronic medical 5 condition. 6 Our goal at Community Health Care 7 Network is not only to treat 8 nutrition-related conditions, but to prevent 9 illness through education and information as 10 well. 11 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 12 Earl Ellis. Trishann Williams. 13 Trishann Williams is a Community 14 Board Five member. 15 TRISHANN WILLIAMS: Hello. My name 16 is Trishann Williams, and I am here on behalf 17 of Manhattan Community Board Five. 18 At the regularly scheduled monthly 19 meeting of Community Board Five on Thursday, 20 October 12th, 2006, the Board passed the 21 following letter by a vote of 17 in favor, 22 16 opposed, 0 abstention: 23 Manhattan Community Board Five, 24 representing Midtown Manhattan, would like 196 1 to thank you for the opportunity to comment 2 on two proposed Health Department 3 initiatives. 4 The first would require New York City 5 restaurant owners to substitute trans fat 6 oils for other healthier oils such as olive, 7 canola, safflower, or grapeseed. While 8 Community Board Five agrees that restaurants 9 should limit the amount of trans fat, we 10 are uncomfortable with mandating the removal 11 of such trans fat oils. 12 Community Board Five is concerned 13 that enforcement of the current proposal 14 as is will be difficult and costly. 15 Additionally, it would be problematic for 16 health inspectors to ensure that trans fat 17 oils were not present in restaurant foods. 18 Community Board Five instead favors 19 a campaign aimed at continued education of 20 restaurant owners and their consumers about 21 the dangers of trans fat oils. We recommend 22 requiring restaurant owners to indicate the 23 presence of trans fat oils in foods through 24 a visible and easily recognizable symbol 197 1 placed near the item on a menu. This symbol 2 would serve the purpose of educating 3 consumers about the presence of trans fat 4 oils and allow them to make an informed 5 choice as to whether or not to consume the 6 item. 7 The second proposed initiative will 8 require restaurants that currently display 9 the calorie contents of food and drink items 10 to now display these calorie contents on 11 menus and menu boards. 12 We are concerned that this may place 13 an unfair burden on restaurant owners who 14 may incur significant costs in order to 15 upgrade menus and menu boards to provide 16 this new mandated information. 17 Furthermore, we are concerned about 18 the imposition that this new initiative may 19 place upon smaller restaurants that may 20 have variable or changing menu items on a 21 frequent basis. 22 Community Board Five prefers a pilot 23 program that targets the larger chain 24 restaurants such as McDonald's and Starbucks. 198 1 We believe that this pilot program should 2 require all restaurants at a certain seating 3 capacity, volume of service and/or with 4 multiple locations, to display calorie 5 information on menus and menu boards. 6 Important information on the favorable 7 and/or unfavorable impact of the legislation 8 and costs should be gathered and assessed at 9 completion. 10 Community Board Five does not want to 11 burden smaller restaurants that are already 12 seeking to educate their consumers through 13 their voluntary provision of nutritional 14 information with additional mandated 15 requirements. 16 Manhattan Community Board Five 17 appreciates and recognizes your commitment 18 to the health and well-being of all 19 New Yorkers and we thank you once again for 20 the opportunity to comment on both these 21 important health measures. Thank you very 22 much. 23 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Thank you. At this 24 point, I just want to say we apologize for 199 1 the cold. I've just been told that there's 2 some pipe work being done, so hopefully, it's 3 only temporary. 4 Okay, moving on. Russell Coco, member 5 of the public. 6 RUSSELL COCO: Thank you very much to 7 the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 8 and thanks to New York City for putting the 9 spotlight on trans fat. 10 I'm from Boma, Texas and excuse the 11 twang. I am co-owner of Jason's Deli. 12 It's 150 store deli chain in 20 states, and 13 we eliminated trans fat completely from our 14 menu a year and a half ago. We had 47 15 ingredients that affected 80 menu items and 16 five years ago, I realized that I could not 17 eat in my own restaurant and did not want to 18 serve partially hydrogenated oils to my 19 customers. We have a large family base. 20 We have a lot of children that eat with us 21 and I couldn't consciously serve the product 22 any longer, so we embarked on eliminating 23 trans fat 100% from our menu, and it took us 24 two years. At that point, this was five 200 1 years ago, and it was difficult at that 2 point to find manufacturers that produced 3 anything that was trans fat free but we 4 challenged our suppliers and said, \"You are no 5 longer going to be one of our vendors if you 6 don't get it out,\" and a number of them did, 7 some didn't. 8 I have a list of suppliers who 9 eliminated trans fat and I saw two of them 10 at the National Restaurant Show last year, 11 and I went to their booth and I said, \"You're 12 advertising no trans fat and they said yes, 13 thanks to you at Jason's Deli.\" So it was a 14 little thing but it was important enough 15 that they wanted to remain a supplier of 16 ours. 17 We've been in business thirty years. 18 We started with heart healthy items in the 19 80s and we believe that the restaurant 20 industry is making excuses if they think 21 that trans fat cannot be eliminated. Some 22 testimonies I heard today made my blood boil 23 because it's hogwash, excuse the language because 24 if you are serious about eliminating 201 1 partially hydrogenated oils from your menu 2 it can be done. Again, there's more 3 availability today. 4 We had fun with it. We had food 5 schools for our 5,000 employees. We taught 6 trans fat classes. We had employees submit 7 recipes and we started calling ourselves 8 trans fat freedom. We had trans fat 9 freedom. We rewarded employees for 10 submitting recipes that we used on our menu. 11 So there is no excuse again and again that 12 the restaurant industry cannot get serious 13 about eliminating trans fats. It's a lot 14 easier than these gentlemen said it was. 15 We have test stores. We tested the 16 product on our customers. They noticed no 17 difference. In fact, you're using better 18 products when you're eliminating partially 19 hydrogenated oil. The taste is better. The 20 cost was minimal. It was mostly in 21 research and testing, that's where most of 22 our costs occurred, but as far as our food 23 costs, it was very minimal. So it's doable 24 and the restaurant industry needs to realize 202 1 that and take a stand. We have to move 2 forward. If there aren't going to be 3 guidelines by government agencies, it's 4 up to us, and I challenge my fellow 5 restaurateurs to do something. 6 We've got to get serious about 7 portion sizes. We're guilty of it; we're 8 not perfect, but we're working on it. We've 9 got to get serious about styrofoam. We've 10 got to get serious about aerosols. We've 11 got to get serious about high fructose corn 12 syrup, but we take a step at a time, and the 13 first step for us was partially hydrogenated 14 oils. 15 So again, I'm here to finish, but I 16 would like to say this. I would like to say 17 this to fellow restaurateurs, call me. We 18 have a web site, JasonsDeli.com. I'll be 19 glad to help anyone in the industry 20 eliminate partially hydrogenated oils. 21 We are all in this together, and if we 22 are going to save the planet, we have to 23 take it a step at a time and eliminate trans 24 fats. Trans fat freedom. Thank you. 203 1 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 2 Marcy Benstock, member of the public. 3 MARCY BENSTOCK: Good afternoon. My 4 name is Marcy Benstock, and I strongly 5 support the Department's proposals to phase 6 out trans fats and require calorie labeling. 7 But the rule could actually harm public 8 health unless the Board of Health also 9 requires restaurants to provide information 10 on which specific cooking oils and 11 shortening they use. Otherwise, if 12 restaurants replace trans fats with edible 13 oils that come from nuts and seeds and don't 14 disclose that, there will be an increase in 15 allergic reactions, emergency room visits, 16 coma and death for diners who are allergic 17 to nuts and seeds and the cooking oils 18 extracted from them. 19 Many diners have true food allergies 20 to the oils that come from nuts and seeds, 21 including canola which is rapeseed, 22 cottonseed, safflower, sesame, and sunflower 23 oils, almond and walnut oils, and others. 24 There's no cure for food allergies. 204 1 Strict avoidance is the only means to 2 prevent potentially serious reaction, but 3 people with allergies can't avoid 4 ingredients like nuts, seeds, and seed oils 5 unless the ingredients are honestly 6 disclosed. 7 Allergic patients have very strong 8 incentives to act on ingredient 9 information if restaurants are required to 10 provide it. Within minutes or hours of 11 eating seed oils, for example, allergic 12 patients will vomit or suffer from hives, 13 shortness of breath, et cetera. More severe 14 reactions can lead to loss of consciousness, 15 asphyxiation, shock or death. 16 Estimates of the percentage of adults 17 or children with food allergies are based on 18 gross underreporting. Anaphylaxis is 19 systemic shock which can result in death. 20 There is no code for the diagnosis of 21 food-induced anaphylaxis in the 22 International Classification of Diseases as 23 of '92. Few allergy sufferers even go to 24 allergists, much less report their 205 1 symptoms to any recordkeeping agency. Thus, 2 guesstimates of the prevalence of the 3 problem are sure to be understated. 4 Sesame-seed allergy is a good example 5 of the regulatory deficiencies for this 6 gross underreporting in the 7 United States. The European Commission and 8 Canada have both added sesame to the list of 9 major food allergens for food labeling 10 purposes, even though the U.S. Congress and 11 FDA have shied away from this appropriate 12 step. Studies have shown that sesame was 13 the second leading cause of anaphylaxis in 14 Israeli children and the fourth most common 15 cause of allergic reactions to foods in 16 Australian children. 17 Claims that most food allergies stem 18 only from the ingredients subject to current 19 FDA labeling regulations do not have any 20 adequate foundation. Similarly, the claim 21 that low levels of certain allergens doesn't 22 present a problem just isn't true. Even 23 trace amounts of sesame, for example, can 24 unleash life-threatening reactions. 206 1 There's been an explosion in food 2 allergies in recent years. The New York 3 Department of Health and the Board of Health 4 need to address this better than they have 5 so far. Most allergy-related fatalities now 6 occur in eating establishments. Allergenic 7 oils were a relatively rare problem until 8 the 1970s because of the old standards. Corn 9 and olive oil and butter and lard were the 10 ones that were used. Then there was an 11 explosion because of food industry changes. 12 Anaphylaxis and other reactions have 13 skyrocketed. Restaurant disclosure is now 14 absolutely essential. McDonald's already 15 has a handout listing all the ingredients in 16 their foods, and this is incredibly helpful as 17 well as being a great selling-point for food 18 allergy patients. 19 Epipens in restaurants were sometimes 20 proposed, but that's not a good enough 21 answer. Epipens can be lifesavers when 22 someone has an anaphylactic reaction to 23 food, but epipens can't always save you 24 once a food allergen has been ingested. A 207 1 1992 study reported on six fatal and seven 2 near-fatal cases of food-induced anaphylaxis 3 in 13 children and adolescents who had to be 4 admitted to an intensive care unit for 5 intubation, mechanical ventilation, and 6 vasopressor support. While all of those 7 subjects were given epinephrine, seven died 8 anyway. Three of the seven who died seemed 9 to get better at first and then they died. 10 The history of mild reactions doesn't preclude 11 the possibility of a future severe reaction. 12 Also, food allergies tend to get 13 worse with every exposure. And finally, the 14 administration of too much epinephrine can 15 precipitate hypertension and cardiac 16 arrhythmias. 17 The Department's web site says, 18 \"Assuring safe and healthy dining options is 19 a public health priority,\" along with 20 preventing \"dangerous and preventable risks 21 to restaurant goers.\" That's as it should 22 be. I urge you not to push allergic diners 23 out of the frying pan and into the fire, 24 however, with these proposals. These 208 1 require, at a minimum, the disclosure of the 2 specific nut and seed oils used in food 3 preparation in restaurants. 4 There are references and written 5 statements which I'll give to you. 6 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: You can submit 7 them. Thank you very much. 8 MARCY BENSTOCK: Thank you. 9 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: At this point, 10 I'm going to be joined by some Department of 11 Health's personnel. This man at the table 12 is Elliott Marcus, Associate Commissioner of 13 the Bureau of Food Safety and Community 14 Sanitation, and Dr. Lynn Silver, 15 Commissioner for the Bureau of Disease 16 Prevention and Health Promotion. 17 Moving on, Cesar Vasquez. 18 Dr. Lisa Young, Ph.D., R.D., Nutritionist 19 and Author of \"The Portion Teller,\" Adjunct 20 Faculty at NYU. 21 LISA YOUNG: Good afternoon. 22 I'm Lisa Young, a nutritionist in private 23 practice, author of \"The Portion Teller\" and 24 user-friendly weight loss guide, and adjunct 209 1 professor at NYU. 2 I am in support of New York City's 3 proposal to require chain restaurants to 4 display the calorie content of standard food 5 items on menu boards. Restaurants should 6 post calorie information in a manner that is 7 easy for consumers to read and use as part 8 of their purchasing decisions. Without 9 clear, easy to use nutrition information, 10 it's difficult to make informed choices 11 while eating out. Because Americans are 12 eating out more today than ever before, 13 restaurant labeling regulations would give 14 the citizens of New York City the important 15 information to help them eat well and take 16 responsibility for their own health. 17 Obesity is currently a major public 18 health concern in New York City and it is 19 associated with an increased risk for a 20 variety of medical conditions. It is caused 21 by an imbalance of energy intake, which is 22 calories in, and energy expenditure, 23 calories out. People tend to eat more 24 calories when they eat out than when they 210 1 eat at home. 2 Posting the calorie content of food 3 directly on the menu boards is an excellent 4 idea as it would enable consumers to see how 5 many calories are in the food they're 6 planning to buy and eat. Few people have 7 a clue how many calories are in foods that 8 are prepared by restaurants. 9 In a study that I conducted with 10 colleagues at New York University and the 11 Center for Science in the Public Interest, 12 we found that not even trained nutritionists 13 were able to determine the calories in 14 restaurant meals. Without knowing how much 15 a food weighs and how a food is prepared, it 16 is virtually impossible to correctly 17 estimate its calorie count. 18 Particularly problematic is the fact 19 that portion sizes have ballooned in recent 20 years, and these large portions are providing 21 consumers with many more calories. While 22 conducting research on portion sizes, I 23 found that the increase in the prevalent of 24 obesity has occurred in parallel to an 211 1 increase in the portion sizes of foods 2 consumed away from home, suggesting that 3 larger portions might be contributing to the 4 obesity epidemic. 5 Portions offered by fast food chains, 6 for example, are often two to five times 7 larger than their original size and have 8 increased since the 1970s. 9 Posting calories on menu boards would 10 enable consumers to compare the calorie 11 count of food portions available in several 12 sizes such as french fries and soda, at fast 13 food chains. While it seems obvious, the 14 large portions contain more calories than 15 small portions. 16 As a nutritionist counseling 17 overweight individuals, I have found a huge 18 disconnect between how hard it is for people 19 to relate the size of a food to its calorie 20 count. For example, while this soda, an 21 8 ounce soda contains 100 calories, people 22 are shocked to hear that the 64 ounce Double 23 Gulp at Seven-Eleven is eight times the size is 24 nearly 800 calories. 212 1 If restaurants would post calories 2 of foods, it would educate consumers on the 3 relationship between portion sizes and 4 calories and perhaps encourage them to 5 purchase smaller sizes. 6 Finally, the portion distortion 7 problem becomes compounded for families that 8 have mixed dishes because consumers rarely 9 have a clue what ingredients goes into each 10 dish. 11 Consider Burger King's newest 12 edition, the BK stacker sandwich, available 13 in four sizes. The larger size, called the 14 quad, contains four patties, four slices of 15 cheese, eight slices of bacon, a bun, and a 16 special sauce. Who would forget that it 17 contains a thousand calories, half the 18 calories recommended for an entire day for 19 certain segments of the population. Only by 20 posting such information would consumers 21 have a clue and perhaps begin to scale back. 22 Thank you for allowing me to speak, 23 and thank you for the proposals. 24 ROSLYN WINDHOLZ: Thank you. At this 213 1 point, we're just going to adjourn for two 2 minutes so we can get our next stenographer 3 over here. 4 (Brief recess was held at 2:00 p.m.) 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 214 1 2 MS. WINDHOLZ: So this part we're 3 just going to go back and see if anybody 4 that was not here when we initially called 5 their number -- their name has arrived. 6 Peter Kostmayer, President, Citizens for 7 New York City. 8 MR. SCOTT CODEY: Can I testify on 9 his behalf? They told me I could. 10 MS. WINDHOLZ: Just come to the desk 11 and identify yourself. 12 MR. SCOTT CODEY: My name is Scott 13 Codey. I'm with the Citizens for NYC. I 14 apologize on behalf of Peter Kostmayer that 15 he couldn't be here today, and I will 16 submit the written testimony. 17 Citizens for NYC is an organization 18 that has been around for about 30 years, 19 and what we do is we help small scale 20 community groups address problems in their 21 own community. What we've seen in recent 22 years is that a growing number of community 23 groups have come to us for help in getting 24 access to fresh affordable nutritious 25 produce, and as a result of that, we 215 1 2 developed a program where we helped 3 community groups start instituting farmer's 4 markets, start CSA's, start buying healthy 5 food products all for the service of 6 helping grass roots community groups 7 define problems at the local level, and 8 then develop strategies to address them, 9 and citizen activism can go a long way in a 10 healthy democracy, but it cannot be the 11 full story. A healthy democracy also 12 requires sound public policy, and for that 13 reason, Citizens for NYC strongly supports 14 this particular proposal. 15 This issue has, this issue is very 16 important in New York City and for that 17 reason these community groups have defined 18 this as a major problem. We are helping 19 these community groups solve the problems 20 at the local level, and this proposal is an 21 important and easy measure to pursue the 22 same ultimate objective which is promoting 23 a healthy community in New York City by 24 creating access to safe, healthy food for 25 people who eat in restaurants. So we 216 1 2 commend the administration, Mayor Bloomberg 3 as well as Health Commissioner Frieden for 4 their leadership on this, and we encourage 5 the panel to support this proposal. 6 Thank you. 7 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 8 Melissa Rodin-Ramirez. Dr. Theodore 9 Strange, with Staten Island University 10 Hospital. 11 DR. THEODORE STRANGE: Good 12 afternoon. My name is Dr. Theodore 13 Strange, and I'm the Associate Chairman of 14 Medicine at Staten Island University 15 Hospital. 16 We commend the City Department of 17 Health and the Bloomberg Administration in 18 the proposal of this limitation of trans 19 fatty acids as something that's very 20 important to the community. 21 As we all now, the instances of heart 22 disease in New York City is clearly the 23 number one killer. In Staten Island the 24 presence of heart disease is one of the 25 highest of any county in the state of New 217 1 2 York. We have an obligation both as health 3 professionals and as a Department of Health 4 in terms of looking after our citizens in 5 the city, the state and the country in 6 terms of allowing the proper education so 7 that the proper decisions can be made in 8 terms of their health care, whether that be 9 with smoking cessation in the past with 10 other carcinogens that have been found in 11 our food products. Clearly that has been 12 noted well in the literature and as most of 13 us practice medicine in society today, 14 evidence based medicine clearly supports or 15 doesn't support the use of the partially 16 hydrogenated vegetable oils, because while 17 there clearly are alternatives there that 18 are safe, that are inexpensive, and that do 19 not cause, pose the same risks in terms of 20 the cholesterol healthy L -- increase the 21 HDLR and the facts in the instance of heart 22 disease that this group of food products 23 does. 24 There were articles in the New 25 England Journal of Medicine, there have 218 1 2 been studies from many other countries, 3 Denmark and Canada, it has been stated that 4 clearly have shown that by using 5 alternative products - using alternative 6 products that are as inexpensive, that 7 continue to provide the taste and quality 8 and that clearly do not have these effects 9 is the only way to really educate and to 10 prevent, or to help to prevent this 11 devastating disease, this group of diseases 12 called heart disease. 13 As physicians we see daily in our 14 practices, strokes, coronary disease 15 causing major heart attacks, people going 16 for bypass surgery and the like that not 17 only cause a tremendous burden on the 18 health care system itself, but pose a 19 tremendous burden on society in general, 20 just in terms of work time lost, 21 rehabilitation and all the things that go 22 along with the tertiary care that needs to 23 then be provided once patients have already 24 gone on to have their significant heart 25 disease. 219 1 2 So we at Staten Island University 3 Hospital, and I think the physicians 4 community in general strongly support this 5 amendment which will limit the use of these 6 products in the food establishments. I 7 think that safety first is always our 8 primary concern and goal as patient 9 advocates, which we are as physicians, as 10 you are as the Department of Health, and 11 therefore we again strongly support this 12 bill. 13 Thank you. 14 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 15 Earl Ellis. Cesar Vasquez. Louisa 16 Sanchez, Citizen's Committee for Children. 17 MS. DANIELLE MARCHEON: I'm mostly 18 here in place of someone else. 19 MS. WINDHOLZ: Okay, who are you with? You 20 should indicate your affiliation if any. 21 MS. DANIELLE MARCHEON: Good 22 morning. My name is Danielle Marcheon, and 23 I'm the government physician's associate at 24 Citizens Committee for Children of New 25 York, CCC. 220 1 2 CCC is an independent multi-issue 3 child advocacy organization that works to 4 make sure that every New York City child is 5 healthy, housed, educated and safe. Thank 6 you for this opportunity to testify. 7 CCC is here today to encourage the 8 New York City Board of Health to approve 9 two amendments to the New York City Health 10 Code that will go a long way in helping 11 children, adolescents and families live 12 healthier lives. 13 For many children and families, 14 access to affordable, nutritious food is a 15 difficult challenge, and meals prepared 16 outside the home are often more readily 17 accessible and are frequently consumed by 18 New Yorkers. The proposal will require 19 disclosure of calorie information on 20 restaurant menus or menu boards and will help 21 parents to make better food choices that 22 will improve their children's nutrition, 23 reduce obesity, and promote lifelong 24 healthy diet and life-style. 25 Close to a quarter or 470,000 New 221 1 2 York City children are obese, increasing the 3 likelihood that they will develop chronic 4 conditions, such as diabetes later in 5 life. With obesity rates in the city more 6 than double the national average, it is 7 critical that the Board of Health adopt 8 this proposal. The proposal to phase out 9 artificial trans fats from restaurants and 10 other food service establishments in the 11 City will also help our children live 12 longer, healthier lives. Though the health 13 effects of this proposal may not be evident 14 until later in life, the phasing out of 15 artificial trans fat will help determine 16 our children's health in the future. 17 Artificial trans fats are worse than any 18 other natural fats, lack nutritional 19 value and are easily replaceable. New 20 Yorkers and their families should not be 21 forced to unknowingly consume trans fats 22 when dining out. 23 Together these amendments will help 24 control both the obesity epidemic and 25 reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease 222 1 2 in New York City. 3 We urge the New York Board of Health 4 to approve the proposed amendment to the 5 City's Health Code to further the goal of 6 promoting and protecting the health of New 7 York's children, adolescents and families. 8 Thank you. 9 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 10 Cathy Nonas, Director of the 11 Diabetes and Obesity Programs at North 12 General Hospital. 13 MS. CATHY NONAS: Thank you all for 14 elongating this time so we could all 15 speak. I actually have one short thing. 16 As a representative of North General 17 Hospital in Harlem, we are in support of 18 both proposals, but I'm here to speak on 19 one proposal, on proposal 81.08 on trans 20 fats. We have a teenage group of 21 kids in our hospital who tried to 22 lose weight and live a healthy 23 life-style, and their ages are from 13 to 24 18, and they wrote this letter to you which 25 I'm going to read. 223 1 2 \"We are told that our generation was 3 supposed to be the longest living 4 generation so far, but this isn't the 5 case. Instead trans fats and other 6 technology have shortened our lives and 7 increased our health risk at a young age. 8 Each year heart disease is becoming 9 more common in children. If we take trans 10 fats out of the foods we enjoy, we decrease 11 the risk of high cholesterol and heart 12 disease. By taking the lead, New York will 13 show that they care about our generation 14 and the future of other generations to 15 come. 16 Everyone talks about changing the 17 environment, but no one does anything. We 18 work hard to make our lives healthier by 19 increasing our physical activity, by eating 20 more fruits and vegetables, and reducing 21 our fats despite advertising that promotes 22 the opposite, but we still enjoy our french 23 fries, just in smaller sizes. By reducing 24 trans fats, New York will show us that 25 they're working hard to help us, and that 224 1 2 french fries will still be part of a 3 healthy life-style.\" 4 Thank you. 5 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 6 Ellen Fried, Chair at the New York 7 City Nutrition Education Network. 8 MS. ELLEN FRIED: Good afternoon. 9 As you just stated, my name is Ellen 10 Fried. I'm an attorney and a food policy 11 educator as well as an adjunct professor at 12 NYU, and I'm speaking here today as chair 13 of the public policy working group of the 14 New York City Nutrition Education Network 15 known as NYCNEN. 16 Founded in 1998, NYCNEN is a 17 collaborative network of individual 18 nutrition professionals and educators and 19 50 plus organizations in New York City. 20 Members may be tax supported, voluntary, 21 for profit or not for profit, and include 22 representatives from health centers, 23 emergency food providers, agricultural 24 organizations, advocacy groups, academic 25 programs, government agencies, nutrition 225 1 2 education programs, and private 3 consultants. 4 What all members of NCYNEN have in 5 common is their mission to improve the food 6 and nutrition environment for a healthy New 7 York City. We've submitted written 8 testimony today, but what I will do is 9 highlight what's unique to NYCNEN members, 10 and I don't want to be remiss and also want 11 to put into the testimony that we'd 12 like to thank Commissioner Frieden and 13 the New York City Department of Health and 14 Mental Hygiene for taking the initiative to 15 propose important changes in the City's 16 food supply. 17 NCYNEN supports both amendments to 18 Article 81 of the New York City Health 19 Code, since the proposals are actions which 20 members agree will improve New Yorkers' 21 health. The mandatory removal of harmful, 22 artificial trans fats especially from fast 23 food chains, takes the guesswork and most 24 importantly the harmful ingredient out of 25 eating out. 226 1 2 As nutrition and food educators, 3 NCYNEN members are particularly concerned 4 with populations, adults and children 5 alike, who are most at risk for nutrition 6 related diseases. Removing trans fats will 7 lower the risk of disease for anyone who 8 eats out in New York City, but especially 9 for people who are dependent on inexpensive 10 and highly processed foods. 11 The Department's proposals will have 12 a positive, far-reaching effect to 13 nutrition educators who will be able to 14 urge New Yorkers to follow the City's lead 15 and acknowledge that trans fats are 16 unhealthy. Building upon the City's 17 proposals, educators can more easily 18 discourage the use of products that contain 19 trans fats, and encourage the use of 20 alternatives with equivalent taste and 21 (inaudible). Nutrition educators can also 22 emphasize the importance of moderating 23 calorie intake with the aid of specific 24 calorie count for popular standardized fast 25 food menu items conspicuously posted and 227 1 2 readily available at the point of 3 purchase. 4 The changes in the proposed 5 amendments is a significant step forward to 6 combating the dual threats of obesity and 7 other diet related chronic diseases. 8 Specifically, NYCNEN supports the inclusion 9 of free feeding programs in the ban on 10 artificial trans fat. The populations that 11 rely on free feeding programs from 12 Headstart programs to soup kitchens are 13 often at risk for nutrition related 14 diseases. The removal of harmful fats from 15 these food sources is likely to have a 16 positive health effect. 17 Providing consumers with the basic 18 calorie information they need, in plain 19 sight, at the point of purchase, by clear 20 and conspicuous posts on menu boards at 21 their use, the readily available calorie 22 information, will finally provide consumers 23 with the tools to make informed food 24 choices at the time and place, the 25 information can actually influence their 228 1 2 decision making. And to focus on 3 restaurant chains with standardized menu 4 items, many adults and children frequent 5 these restaurants several times a week, the 6 simultaneous removal of trans fats from 7 products coupled with the posting of actual 8 calorie counts, acts to counter typical 9 consumer assumptions that trans fat free 10 also means reduced calorie. This is also 11 important because of typical market 12 campaigns to increase consumptions of value 13 meals and other pricing strategies. 14 NYCNEN wishes to applaud the bold 15 and necessary steps being proposed by the 16 Department and its leadership in banning a 17 harmful substance from the food supply. 18 Indeed other cities and states have already 19 been encouraged to follow New York City's 20 lead in taking action to protect and 21 improve the nutritional health of its 22 citizens. 23 Thank you. 24 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 25 Frank Capaci. Jennifer Araujo. Amy 229 1 2 Schwartz. Lori Mosca, Dr. Lori Mosca, 3 Director of Preventive Cardiology at New 4 York Presbyterian. 5 MS. LORI MOSCA: Thank you very 6 much. 7 Dr. Lori Mosca, and I'm here as the 8 representative and immediate past chair of 9 the American Society for Preventive 10 Cardiology, and it's a pleasure to speak to 11 you from my heart about the heart. 12 As a physician that specializes in 13 preventive cardiology and as a 14 cardiovascular epidemiologist, I am acutely 15 aware of both the impact on patients and 16 society due to the burden of cardiovascular 17 disease. Many of you may not be aware that 18 New York City really has an opportunity 19 right now to serve as a microcosm for not 20 only the problem of cardiovascular disease, 21 but also the solution. 22 The world has undergone what we call 23 an epidemiologic transition. As we have 24 moved into a more industrialized society, 25 our health problems have transitioned from 230 1 2 one of nutritional deficiency and 3 infectious diseases to one of nutritional 4 excess and chronic diseases, and this 5 proposal which I strongly support, as does 6 the American Society of Preventive 7 Cardiology, is an opportunity to really 8 keep the epidemic at bay. 9 There's no argument you've heard 10 wonderful testimony that artificial trans 11 fat is a contributor to cardiovascular 12 disease. Part of the issue I believe is 13 the potential burden that this is gonna 14 cause in the short term, and I'd like to 15 think of this problem as a short term pain 16 for a long-term gain. Yes, there will be 17 some burdens that we will suffer in making 18 changes as I see with every patient in my 19 clinic, and of course as a society, but 20 this will work. We have evidence that this 21 will work. In fact, a study published this 22 month in the leading journal of the 23 American Heart Association and Cardiology 24 circulation published a study in Pueblo, 25 Colorado that after the smoking ban was 231 1 2 enforced there, there was a 40 percent 3 reduction in hospitalizations due to heart 4 attacks. This is gonna translate into 5 benefits for humans, for their families, 6 but also for the restaurants and 7 entrepreneurs that have to buy health care 8 premiums, and pay for the long-term health 9 care cost associated with cardiovascular 10 disease. 11 When I counsel my patients, I tell 12 them that life-style change is difficult, 13 and environmental change is perhaps even 14 more difficult because we have to make the 15 decision collectively; but as I tell my 16 patients an old Turkish proverb, no matter 17 how far you've gone down the wrong path, 18 turn back, if it's the right thing to do, 19 it will be hard to do, but we will all 20 benefit from living in a healthier society. 21 Thank you very much. 22 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 23 Dr. Wanda McCoy, Chief Medical 24 Officer for Morris Heights Health Center. 25 DR. WANDA MCCOY: Good afternoon. 232 1 2 As the Chief Medical Officer of Morris 3 Heights Health Center, a practicing 4 pediatrician, and as a representative of 5 the entire staff of the center, I am happy 6 to testify at this public forum in full 7 support of the proposals put forth by the 8 New York City Department of Health 9 specifically to partially phase out 10 artificial trans fats in food preparation in 11 all food establishments. This is an 12 excellent way to have an impact on the 13 whole population of the City of New York. 14 Morris Heights Health Center's main and 15 oldest site is situated in the southwest 16 Bronx, and has been delivering 17 comprehensive primary and specialty care to 18 Morris Heights and its surrounding 19 communities for the last 25 years. 20 As you all are aware, especially 21 after the recent release of the health 22 profiles of New York, the Bronx has some of 23 the highest rates of diabetes, heart 24 disease and obesity in the city and in the 25 state. In fact, poor communities all 233 1 2 across the city are besieged by many 3 environmental factors that lead to poor 4 health options not the least of which is 5 food service establishments that primarily 6 serve items that are high in fat with high 7 calorie counts that are often fried. Fresh 8 fruits and vegetables are not usually 9 available or affordable as choices or part 10 of the meal. 11 Our community residents spend a 12 large amount of their limited income and 13 dollars on prepared foods outside of the 14 home, and our community is no different 15 than most other poor communities that are 16 surrounded by the typical fast food 17 establishments and other restaurants that 18 unfortunately offer choices that are not 19 heart healthy. Many of our community 20 residents and patients are already at an 21 increased risk for diabetes secondary to 22 genetic and family history. 23 These proposals, if approved, will 24 be a boost to the armor and terrain that we 25 have to help our fellow New Yorkers live 234 1 2 healthier lives and make more informed 3 choices. 4 We've heard about analogies of 5 smoking, lead based paint, requiring car 6 manufacturers to develop appropriate seat 7 restraints and passing a law mandating the 8 use of seat belts and car seats have saved 9 countless lives in ways that counseling and 10 education one on one in the office setting 11 could never do. 12 It is staggering to see the rate of 13 obesity in our practice over the last 14 several years, especially in infants, 15 children and adolescents, and we as 16 practitioners and educators often feel 17 helpless in our ability to make a 18 difference given the variables that we 19 face. 20 The second proposal which would 21 ensure prominent displays of the calorie 22 content of all items on the menu in certain 23 restaurants will undoubtedly inform choices 24 and educate consumers. Just as people 25 comparison shop for the best prices on 235 1 2 items that are clearly labeled, so too will 3 individuals comparison shop for meal 4 choices when they are informed about the 5 amount of calories. 6 We desperately need a multi prong 7 collaborative approach to effectively turn 8 the tide on the rising epidemic of obesity 9 and diabetes. Health care providers, 10 educators, politicians, community based 11 organizations, business leaders, 12 and others have to strategize together. 13 Morris Heights Health Center on its part 14 will continue education and counseling 15 efforts to the community on issues of 16 diabetes, heart disease and obesity in the 17 perils of trans fat. 18 We applaud Dr. Frieden, Commissioner 19 of Health, and the Department of Health and 20 Mental Hygiene and his staff for making 21 this proposal. 22 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 23 Sandy Solomon, CEO, President, 24 Director of R and D Sweet Street Desserts. 25 MS. SANDY SOLOMON: Thank you for 236 1 2 giving me the opportunity to speak today. 3 My name is Sandy Solomon, and I am 4 president, founder of Sweet Street 5 Desserts, tongue twister. We're a 6 Pennsylvania based company. We manufacture 7 gourmet desserts, I'm also director of 8 R and D, of research and development. We 9 employ 750 people, and we distribute across 10 North America, Europe and also Asia. 11 I traveled here today from Reading 12 to speak because I feel that there is some 13 misunderstanding about trans fats that needs 14 clarification. After listening to 65 15 people speak, I realize it truly is. 16 There's an oversimplification, it 17 has to do with the FDA mandated trans fat 18 labeling which does not separate 19 artificially and naturally occurring trans 20 fats in labels. All the labels that are on 21 products, not just prepackaged 22 products, but a cheesecake such as this 23 that you see up and down the streets of New 24 York, we must label our cheesecakes and by 25 the portion. In that label, all trans fats 237 1 2 are collected, the ones that naturally 3 occur in dairy also . 4 I want you to also understand that 5 my company is committed to removing 6 artificially created trans fats from our 7 products, and I can proudly say that we do 8 today use no artificial trans fats other 9 than that manufactured in flour. However, 10 it still does not mean that our product is 11 labeled and says, no -- trans fat free. 12 When the new ruling was proposed in 13 New York, it was clearly and specifically 14 meant to prevent the use of artificially 15 created trans fats in foods, and when the 16 FDA passed labeling requirements, I believe 17 they let New York have a specific focus. 18 For instance, on their website March, '04 19 and updated on January, '06, they stated a 20 similar definition to New York, defining 21 trans fats and hydrogenated fats adding 22 almost as an afterthought that small 23 amounts appear in animal based products. 24 They then went on to demonstrate the trans 25 fat content of butter and margarine using a 238 1 2 one tablespoon measure. A one tablespoon 3 of margarine contains three grams of trans 4 fat, one tablespoon of butter contains zero 5 trans fat. 6 They also label cheese in a package, 7 one ounce of cheese contains no trans fat, 8 but when you put the cheese on a small 9 prepared pizza, you'd have an excess of one 10 to one and a half trans fats. So these are 11 naturally occurring trans fats. 12 So what does that do to 13 manufacturers such as I, to the dairy 14 industry of New York, and to the 15 cheesecakes that you see up and down the 16 streets of New York. 17 I'm going to sort of take you 18 through a little bit of a process so you 19 understand that, and here's a little label 20 to show what the FDA has on their site. 21 So, I'm going to take an example, our big 22 cheese brulee, this product contains one and 23 a half grams of trans fats. Artificial 24 trans fat, we cannot figure out where 25 the .03 of a gram comes from at this point 239 1 2 but from someplace but we have one and a 3 half grams of trans fats in our product, 4 and that will appear on our label like 5 this, as mandated by the FDA. 6 So, where do we go from there, well 7 the dilemma is, how does your inspector 8 translate or interpret the label. I have 9 to remind you, most of the cheesecakes 10 served in New York or any other 11 cheesecakes, and I can show you pictures of 12 our products, beautiful, high quality 13 products, cheesecakes, you know, I mean, 14 things that we love to indulge in, you 15 know, they come from companies such as us. 16 There are new markets to markets that 17 contain no trans fat, so we can use them, 18 but we can't get the cream cheese out of 19 the cheesecake. We can't get the whip 20 cream out of whip cream. 21 So how do they go in, how does 22 somebody go in and look at the cheesecake 23 label and distinguish, do they have to read 24 the fine print because the standard .5 gram 25 of trans fat does not hold, or will it just 240 1 2 mean because the purveyors are fearful of a 3 fine. 4 Can I finish the argument because it 5 really is an original argument. 6 MS. WINDHOLZ: Well, you know we 7 have been sticking to the time frame and 8 the comments will still be -- we will take 9 them. 10 MS. SANDY SOLOMON: Well, let me 11 just try to finish this off. 12 I feel that un-educated customers 13 will be forced to stop using pre-made 14 products because they are going to be 15 afraid of being fined. 16 I, until last week, or two weeks 17 ago, could not understand that though we 18 took all the trans fats out of our 19 products, we could not find out why a 20 little lemon bar had trans fats in it, and 21 we found finally through the instance of 22 baking, we did our nutritional analysis, we 23 finally found out that butter had too much 24 trans fat. 25 So, if we took our product and 241 1 2 changed to palm oil, we would, we could 3 inch down the trans fats. I mean this was, 4 you know, amazing what happens with 5 packaged cheesecakes, with oils, with, you 6 know, with dough. 7 How do people know that, it does 8 not, I mean I have a chart here -- 9 MS. WINDHOLZ: Ms. Solomon, I'm 10 going to have to stop you because there 11 have been obviously people have been 12 waiting here for a really very long time. 13 You can submit your comments, but 14 everybody's been sticking to the time 15 frame. 16 MS. SANDY SOLOMON: Okay. Can I say 17 one more thing? 18 MS. WINDHOLZ: No, no, I'm stopping 19 you. 20 MS. SANDY SOLOMON: Can I just say 21 one more thing? 22 Denmark managed to label their 23 products and exempt dairy containing 24 products from the labeling, and I think 25 that before you -- you need to understand 242 1 2 how the FDA might separate the trans fats 3 from labels. 4 MS. WINDHOLZ: Okay. Okay. I'm 5 going to call the next speaker. 6 MS. SANDY SOLOMON: Okay. Thank 7 you. Anyway. 8 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 9 Anthony Marzuillo. Dr. Jerome 10 Tolbert, with the Greater New York City and 11 National Volunteer American Diabetes 12 Association. 13 DR. JEROME TOLBERT: Good evening. 14 I want to thank the board first for 15 allowing me to be able to present on behalf 16 of the American Diabetes Association. 17 I'm an endocrinologist here in New 18 York City. I practice endocrinology. I'm 19 also a local and national volunteer for the 20 American Diabetes Association. The 21 American Diabetes Association certainly 22 wholeheartedly supports both of these 23 proposals, and personally I support them as 24 well. 25 As an endocrinologist, I'm really on 243 1 2 the front lines of trying to make a 3 difference in terms of what we are seeing, 4 diabetes, early premature cardiovascular 5 deaths. Let me just give you a couple of 6 examples. 7 I was sitting in my office one 8 day -- I do a lot of lecturing around the 9 country -- I got a call from a member 10 practitioner who said, Dr. Tolbert, I have 11 this young man sitting in front of me, he 12 weighs 170 pounds, what am I going to do. 13 My initial response was, you know, 14 don't make him angry but, you know, it's 15 the kind of thing that we are lost. I mean 16 I could hear in his voice the frustration 17 of having this young man whom he knew was 18 headed down this slippery slope towards 19 diabetes or cardiovascular complications, 20 and that sort of thing, and I ended up 21 sending him to a cardiovascular 22 endocrinologist up at Columbia 23 Presbyterian. 24 In my church one day, someone came 25 up to me, a parishioner came up to me, and 244 1 2 said, you know -- this was during the 3 holidays -- I lost one of my niece -- 4 nephews from a heart attack, he was in his 5 20s, in his 20s, he died of a heart attack, 6 you know, and it just really brought tears 7 to my eyes. 8 I was sitting down one day with a 9 pathologist, and some other health care 10 professionals, and the pathologist, as we 11 were talking said, you know, I see, when I 12 do autopsies, I have all these cases of 13 young women and men in their 20s and 30s 14 who die from heart attacks, and this makes 15 it very real to me, because we've heard 16 today -- we understand what the statistics 17 are -- but when you hear from someone who 18 is sitting at that autopsy table, doing 19 these procedures on real people that 20 really makes it real, and we really 21 understand what's really going on. It's 22 very frightening. 23 We know about the children, we know 24 that we have an epidemic of, of, of this 25 disease but let me just point out 245 1 2 something, this obesity issue is real but 3 before someone becomes diabetic, for 4 example, we know that they come with 5 metabolic syndrome in most cases, and it's 6 a very silent type of thing, you know this 7 atherosclerotic process is taking place, 8 and we know that it's about ten to 12 years 9 before that certain glucose goes up before 10 we make the diagnosis of diabetes, that 11 this atherosclerotic process is taking 12 place, heart disease is taking place, and 13 that's the reason you have a lot of people 14 who die suddenly of cardiovascular disease 15 who had no clue that they had this 16 disease. This disease starts early. If 17 you go back and look at autopsies from 18 children who are killed in accidents, from 19 Vietnam war and other wars, you will see 20 that atherosclerosis exists already. So we 21 know that this process takes place very, 22 very early but it's very frustrating 23 because how -- what tools do we have. 24 Let's go to the diabetes prevention 25 program, and you've heard some of this 246 1 2 information before, this is a program that 3 took prediabetics who are overweight, and 4 they said, okay, we want you to lose seven 5 percent of your body weight, and control 6 your calories, exercise for 30 minutes a 7 day, and 58 percent of those prediabetics 8 did not develop diabetes, and that was a 9 tremendous revelation to us because people 10 who needed to lose a lot of weight lost a 11 little bit of weight but this, this new 12 edition syndrome that takes place over this 13 period of time was decreased where people 14 responded better in terms of their, of 15 lowering their cardiovascular risk. 16 The American Diabetes Association is 17 clearly on board with you with these 18 proposals, and there are a number of 19 programs, one is called, Make the Link, 20 because we need to really make this 21 awareness that there is this link between 22 heart disease and diabetes because a lot of 23 people don't know, a lot of women don't 24 know that heart disease is the leading 25 cause of death, and we need to make sure 247 1 2 that they understand that but when it comes 3 down to life-style changes, it's one of the 4 most difficult tasks that we have, getting 5 people to eat properly because if they 6 don't know that these trans fat and these 7 calories are there, then it's more 8 difficult for them. 9 So, we support this proposal and 10 hopefully this will be a part of our 11 landscape in the future. 12 Thank you. 13 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 14 Afroz Haseez. Blaine Becker, 15 Director of Communications and Marketing 16 with the Hartman Group. 17 MR. BLAINE BECKER: Good afternoon. 18 As an experienced consumer researcher with 19 keen interests in public policy matters, we 20 at the Hartman Group would like to share 21 our insight perspective on proposal 81.50, 22 Article 81 of New York City Health Code. A 23 written copy of our entire commentary in 24 response to the proposed changes to 25 Article 81 has been provided to the 248 1 2 Secretary to the Board of Health. 3 Our motivation for entering this 4 dialogue was prompted in large part by one 5 of the critical documents supporting the 6 bill of changes to Article 81, the Keystone 7 forum on away from home foods. 8 Specifically the Keystone document 9 observes, \"much of the existing data and 10 information about consumer eating behavior 11 and attitudes is either not specific to 12 away from home foods, not sufficiently 13 timely or not publicly available, thus the 14 research generally ultimately augments 15 publicly available knowledge and more 16 continual development of consumer 17 programs.\" 18 In fact, for the past ten years the 19 Hartman Group has been immersed alongside 20 consumers, in studying their behavior in away 21 from home food settings at a variety of 22 quick service restaurants and food service 23 establishments. 24 During this time period, our 25 research teams comprised of THB cultural 249 1 2 anthropology and sociology have been 3 studying consumer behavior using 4 quantitative, qualitative methodology with 5 regard to obesity, calorie intake, food 6 labels and, nutrition information in restaurant 7 behavior. 8 With regard to the numerous heart 9 disease publications, we in the U.S. have 10 been teaching our consumers how to eat, 11 simply with our food labels, nutritional 12 guidelines, and build an evermore elaborate 13 food service for the better part of 30 14 years now, and according to all that, the 15 obesity problem is only getting worse. 16 While they have nearly advanced us to 17 believe that healthy nutrition information 18 should be readily available and while 19 interested in certain aspects of 20 information, our efforts suggest consumers 21 are unable to translate such information 22 into effective weight management 23 strategies. 24 The vast majority of consumers we 25 studied demographically failed to act on 250 1 2 health or nutrition information on any 3 consistent basis to derive desirable weight 4 management outcomes. Because of the social 5 nature of food preferences and eating 6 habits, consumers find it very difficult to 7 act upon nutrition information with any 8 consistent regularity. 9 What we know from our behavioral 10 research is that few, if any, consumers are 11 ever likely to rely on nutrition 12 information when making a menu selection. 13 When presented with nutrition information 14 in a variety of formats ranging from menu 15 boards to pamphlets to receipts, trade 16 liners, napkins and food packaging, we 17 found no evidence that the information in 18 question would lead to different outcomes, 19 that is effectively change the eating 20 behavior in neither the short term nor the 21 long-term. 22 If there is one constant thing 23 uniting all of our research on consumer's 24 eating behavior away from home it is this, 25 any interest in trying to adhere to weight 251 1 2 management practices by eating better or in 3 a more nutritionally sound manner, all that 4 disappears once the consumer leaves the 5 confines of the household or workplace. 6 Our conclusion had nothing to do 7 with the lack of available nutritionally 8 sound options on restaurant menus or lack 9 of available nutrition information. 10 Instead we find that consumers abandoned 11 almost all interest in weight management 12 practices, such as label reading, making 13 healthier choices when dining out because 14 of a powerful cultural tendency to view the 15 home or workplace as a site of regulatory 16 behavior, and the restaurant as a site of 17 indulgent celebratory behavior. 18 In addition, virtually no consumer 19 we've interviewed in our study for weight 20 management thought it was appropriate to 21 blame food manufacturers and restaurants 22 for one, their own weight problems; for 23 two, the obesity epidemic in general. 24 Based on a research analysis with the 25 Hartman Group, the state requires that they 252 1 2 display calorie count in bold typefaced 3 next to menu preparations on menu boards. 4 Results, as we just discussed, would have 5 little effect in changing the eating 6 behavior, it may exacerbate the problem 7 altogether. 8 Changing eating behavior is a very 9 complex life-style issue, largely a social 10 and cultural issue, and people by their 11 very nature will say one thing in a survey, 12 and we know from research, alongside of 13 them in their homes, in their kitchens, and 14 in the restaurants, know they will do 15 something different entirely. Perhaps the 16 time has come maybe to consider to donate 17 less energy to what's in our food to what 18 it is we eat and look more carefully at how 19 and why we eat. 20 Thank you for allowing me to share 21 our views. 22 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 23 Morgan Carmen. Denine Madunn. 24 Virginia Schaffina. 25 MS. VIRGINIA SCHAFFINO: Thank you 253 1 2 for the opportunity to speak. My name is 3 Virginia Schaffina, double F, and I'm here 4 to speak on behalf of myself and Dr. Marion 5 Nessel, Professor of NYU Department of 6 Nutrition and Public Health, and it's a 7 pleasure to appear before the Board. 8 We commend the Department for its 9 proposal to amend New York City's Health 10 Code to require calorie labeling by certain 11 food service establishments. We strongly 12 support this proposal and applaud the 13 Department for a much needed step in 14 addressing the high rates of obesity and 15 overweight that effect more than half of 16 New York City residents. 17 Heart disease, strokes, cancer, 18 diabetes are all preventable diseases that 19 are associated with overweight and 20 obesity. Such diseases may be reduced in 21 part by combating the high risk of 22 overweight and obesity in New York. 23 Providing New Yorkers with the knowledge to 24 make informed food choices is a necessary 25 component of a broader strategy to improve 254 1 2 the health of City residents. We urge the 3 board to approve the proposal for the 4 following reasons: 5 First, consumers need accurate 6 information to make informed choices. The 7 absence of readily available information 8 about calories at the point of purchase 9 effects consumer's ability to make informed 10 decisions leading to inadvertent 11 consumption of excess calories. Consumers 12 have inadequate information to support 13 healthy choices of foods that comprise one 14 third of their daily caloric intake. This 15 constitutes a significant environmental 16 barrier to healthy food choices, and this 17 is exacerbated by the fact that consumers 18 can be misguided by the clutter of 19 advertisement, marketing messages and 20 techniques, weight loss and weight 21 management claims to which they are 22 exposed. 23 Also an indicative fact is value 24 marketing from over-consumption of foods 25 through pricing incentives to buy larger 255 1 2 portions of meals. Buying larger portions 3 for a few extra cents can seem like a 4 bargain that justifies over-consumption of 5 calories. Point of purchase calorie 6 information could engage consumers by 7 providing them the ability to compare 8 options, and make more thoughtful decisions 9 before they order. Although some 10 restaurants voluntarily offer some 11 nutritional information, in most places the 12 information is difficult for consumers to 13 find and use. 14 Second, calorie labeling is a sound 15 public health approach to the obesity 16 epidemic and its consequences. It has been 17 firmly established that overweight and 18 obesity constitute a major public health 19 care threat to physical and economic health. 20 As the number of overweight and obese 21 people continues to rise, so will the rates 22 of morbidity, mortality and related medical 23 treatment and costs. Whereas the financial 24 concept will be -- can, can quantify a 25 person's life or quality of life is 256 1 2 invaluable. 3 Although obesity has no single cause 4 or solution, dietary improvement can help 5 reduce diseases. Because the present food 6 environment promotes over-consumption of 7 junk foods, active and direct intervention 8 is needed to help customers make informed 9 choices. Requiring food service 10 establishments to post calorie information 11 at the point of purchase directly addresses 12 the environmental factor that contributes 13 to consumer behavior. Point of purchase 14 calorie information removes the need for 15 guesswork, it also reveals the real value 16 of certain meals, and that the trade-off 17 between the price and an unhealthful 18 weight. 19 Although obesity affects people of 20 all races and backgrounds, in New York 21 City, disproportionately high rates affect 22 low income people. Because low income 23 neighborhoods contain larger numbers of 24 fast food establishments, the Department's 25 proposal is likely to have an especially 257 1 2 large impact in areas where it is needed 3 the most. 4 Third, the narrow retainer 5 regulations pose a low burden for the food 6 service establishments. The proposal only 7 applies, to ten percent of the 8 food service establishments in the City. 9 These already have occurred in response to 10 determining the nutritional contents of 11 their meals. 12 In addition, the restaurants are 13 asked to display only calorie information. 14 Providing calorie information alone should 15 have a significant impact on consumer behavior 16 by making it clear that larger portions do 17 have more calories. 18 The proposal managed to serve as an 19 impetus for change both for consumer 20 behavior and ultimately for the quality and 21 the quantity of foods offered away from the 22 home. The Board's favorable decision on 23 this urgent issue will constitute an 24 important precedent on public health 25 strategy to control and prevent obesity and 258 1 2 to set the stage for change at the state 3 and national level. Mandatory calorie 4 labeling is a risk communication strategy 5 analogous to any other public health 6 approach that encourages behavioral change, 7 such as banning cigarette smoking in public 8 indoor establishments. 9 New York City should not have to 10 wait until overweight and obesity surpass 11 tobacco smoking as the number one 12 contributor to death in America. So, thank 13 you for your time. 14 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 15 At this point, it's 3:00, so I'm 16 going to call over the names of the 17 individuals who were not here when we 18 called them last, Frank Capaci. Jennifer 19 Araujo. Amy Schwartz. Anthony Marzuillo. Is Martina Navoli here? 21 Richard Lipsky. Nancy -- and I'm sorry I 22 can't read the handwriting here -- Pleejer, 23 with Manhattan Chamber of Commerce. Luis 24 Nunez. Alfredo Cassons with Hispanic 25 Chambers. 259 1 2 Okay. At this point we're going to 3 hold on just for two minutes, and I'll be 4 right back. 5 (Brief recess was taken.) 6 I'm just going to call a couple more 7 of the names to make sure that they haven't 8 shown up, Amie Hamlin. Joseph 9 Aranha. John Whipple. Leslie Meenan. Jim 10 Lesczynski. Claudia -- difficult to read 11 the handwriting but -- Claudia Luddy. 12 Donna Tinnerello. 13 MS. DONNA TINNERELLO: Thank you. 14 My name is Donna Tinnerello, and I'm a 15 registered dietician. I'm in private 16 practice, and I'm representing myself but 17 as a registered dietician living and 18 working in the City of New York, I support 19 the proposed legislation under Article 81 20 of the New York City Health Code. 21 ADA, The American Diabetic 22 Association, supports both of these 23 amendments and has expressed an additional 24 opinion involving saturated fats as well as 25 trans fats. Foods containing artificial trans 260 1 2 fats, artificial trans fats serves no 3 purpose in the food supply, and can be 4 easily replaced by a healthier fat that is 5 trans free. 6 ADA supports the reduction of trans 7 fats intake, and advises that it not be 8 replaced with saturated fats. We do not 9 want to replace one bad fat with the 10 other. There are healthy fats that do not 11 cause disease. Food manufacturers are 12 already using them, and restaurants can as 13 well. Fats have an essential role in the 14 diet for life and normal body functions, 15 and should never be fully eliminated. 16 On calorie labeling, nutrition 17 education of the public is essential for 18 promoting a healthy New York. Calorie 19 information in restaurants will support 20 this goal. 21 Registered dieticians can better 22 educate our clients when and what to eat if 23 the information is readily available to us 24 and to the public. 25 Thank you. 261 1 2 MS. WINDHOLZ: Thank you. 3 Okay. Our final scheduled speaker 4 is Tanazio Frazier with Holcomb L. Rucker 5 High School. 6 COMMISSIONER FRIEDEN: I think that 7 brings us to the close of the hearing. 8 I just want to thank the remaining 9 people who are here for all of their 10 patience, and all of the members of the 11 public who testified. We will be carefully 12 reviewing all the testimony that was 13 received, as well as the testimony that was 14 submitted in writing, and the Department 15 will take into consideration all of the 16 views expressed here. Thank you all very 17 much. This hearing is now closed. 18 (Time noted 3:05 p.m.) 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 "}
