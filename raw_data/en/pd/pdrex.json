THE UNIVERSITY Our Identity Union University is an academic community, affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention, equipping persons to think Christianly and serve faithfully in ways consistent with its core values of being excellence-driven, Christ-centered, people- focused, and future-directed. These values shape its identity as an institution which prioritizes liberal arts based undergraduate education enhanced by professional and graduate programs. The academic community is composed of quality faculty, staff, and students working together in a caring, grace-filled environment conducive to the development of character, servant leadership, and cultural engagement. Our Core Values Excellence-Driven: We believe that excellence, not mere compliance, is the goal of our teaching, our research, and our service. We are not motivated to excellence out of pride but out of a desire to do all things for God's glory because He cares about our work and wants to be involved in everything we do. We will not be satisfied with mediocrity, but will pursue excellence in all things. This means our truth claims carry with them the challenge of living out that truth in the minutes and hours of our daily life. Thus we will pursue excellence, without arrogance. Christ-Centered: A cohering core value of our guiding vision is a call to faith, a call to be Christ centered in all that we are and in all that we do. We will seek to build a Christian liberal arts based community where men and women can be introduced to an understanding and appreciation of God, His creation and grace, and to humanity's place of privilege and responsibility in this world. We will seek to establish all aspects of life and learning on the Word of God, leading to a firm commitment to Christ and His Kingdom. To be a Christ-centered institution calls for us to establish the priority of worship and service in the Christian life while seeking to develop a generation of students who can be agents of reconciliation to a factious church in a hurting and broken world. This commitment calls for all faculty and staff to integrate Christian faith in all learning and doing, based on the supposition that all truth is God's truth and that there is no contradiction between God's truth made known to us in Holy Scripture and that which is revealed to us through creation and natural revelation. People-Focused: A third pillar on which we will build our common commitments is the core value of being people focused. At the heart of our commitment to being people focused is the visible demonstration of valuing one another. We will give honor to one another through our words and actions, and by committing to each person's success. We therefore jointly commit ourselves to the success of Union University. Future-Directed: We will seek to maximize the windows of opportunity the Lord has presented to us to the greatest degree that resources allow. All of our resources and efforts must, by God's grace, be maximized to fulfill our common mission. A commitment to being future directed means we want to have a short-term focus and a long term view. We want to involve ourselves in efforts that prepare us effectively to impact the world of the 21st Century. Our Mission Union University provides Christ-centered education that promotes excellence and character development in service to Church and society. The University's History Union University is an heir of three antebellum Tennessee schools\u2014West Tennessee College and its predecessor, Jackson Male Academy, both located at Jackson, and of Union University, located at Murfreesboro\u2014and it is the inheritor of another college in 1927, Hall-Moody Junior College of Martin, Tennessee. Jackson Male Academy, founded February 3, 1823, shortly after the opening of West Tennessee for settlement, was chartered by the legislature in 1825. West Tennessee College West Tennessee College originated in the mid-1840s when supporters of the Academy secured a charter for a college and received an endowment from the state to come from the sale of public lands. Under its charter, the property rights and governance of the Jackson Male Academy were vested in the trustees of the College. The College offered three degrees\u2014 bachelor of arts, bachelor of philosophy, and master of arts\u2014 and had four departments: Moral Philosophy, Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy and Chemistry. Southwestern Baptist University and Tennessee Baptist West Tennessee College continued until 1874, when, at a time of depressed economic conditions, the trustees offered the College's buildings, grounds, and endowment to Tennessee Baptists in the hopes of attracting the southwestern regional university planned by the state's Baptist leaders. Meanwhile, after years of discussion and the raising of an endowment, the Baptists of Middle Tennessee (there were three separate conventions in Tennessee at that time) in 1848 established Union University in Murfreesboro, near the geographical center of the state. Union University came upon hard times when in 1859 its highly respected president, Joseph H. Eaton, died and when during the Civil War its campus was badly damaged. It reopened in 1868 only to close again in 1873, largely because of its financial condition and an epidemic of cholera.4 OVERVIEWSouthwestern Baptist University, the immediate predecessor of the present Union University, originated because of a desire by Tennessee Baptists, who still had a separate convention for each of the state's three Grand Divisions, for greater unification. Education became the core issue around which such unification was promoted. Committees of the three conventions met jointly in Humboldt in 1873 and issued a resolution supporting the establishment of a first-class regional university. An Educational Convention met in Murfreesboro in 1874, at which time a committee was appointed to select a location for the proposed university. The committee recommended the acceptance of the offer made by the citizens of Jackson to assume ownership of West Tennessee College. Southwestern Becomes Union University In September 1874, the new Tennessee Baptist-related institution opened in Jackson, and in 1875 it was chartered as Southwestern Baptist University. In 1907, Dr. T. T. Eaton, a trustee at Southwestern from its beginning, bequeathed his 6,000 volume library to the institution. He was a former professor at the Murfreesboro campus, where his father, Dr. Joseph H. Eaton, had been president. In 1907 the name of Southwestern Baptist University was changed to Union University to honor the Eatons and others from the Murfreesboro campus who had made a major impact on Southwestern as faculty, administrators, trustees, and contributors. In a further move to unify its educational efforts, the Tennessee Baptist Convention in 1925 secured a new charter for the University in conjunction with the adoption of the Cooperative Program and clarity regarding the election of the University's trustees. Two years later, the Convention was able to consolidate Hall-Moody Junior College at Martin (1900-1927) with Union University. During the 1920s, Union discontinued its graduate program, its Law Department, and its high school and added a bachelor of music degree program. After a major campus fire in 1912, several new buildings were constructed, including Barton Hall, the centerpiece of the Jackson campus for the next 60 years. In 1948, during the administration of President Warren F. Jones (1945-62), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Union University its original accreditation. In 1962, at the request of area healthcare leaders, Union developed a nursing program with the assistance of Jackson- Madison County General Hospital. The Move to North Jackson Campus in 1975 Because of an aging and landlocked campus, Union, in 1975, moved from near downtown to a new campus located along Highway 45-Bypass in north Jackson. This visionary move was accomplished during the administration of President Robert Craig (1967-85). Under President Craig and President Hyran Barefoot (1986-1996), enrollment increased from less than 1,000 students to nearly 2,000; the multipurpose Penick Academic Complex was enlarged several times; many additional housing units were erected; and the Blasingame Academic Complex (1986) and the Hyran E. Barefoot Student Union Building (1994) were constructed. The Building Years - 1995-2014 When David S. Dockery was elected as the fifteenth president of Union University in December 1995, he brought with him a compelling vision to build on a great tradition while taking Union to the next level of regional and national prominence in Christian Higher Education. During his tenure the university grew in its commitment to the integration of faith, learning, and service, among other ways, through the establishment of a Center for Faculty Development. Undergraduate majors and graduate programs grew to include doctoral programs in education, nursing, pharmacy, and theology. The annual non- duplicating headcount increased from 2,183 (in 1996) to more than 5,300 (in 2012). Nine new buildings were constructed and a campaign for a new library was begun. In addition, the university achieved top tier recognition in U.S.News & World Report, Princeton Review, and other important listings, and the Chronicle of Higher Education named Union one of the Great Places to Work in the United States. United and Grounded - 2014-Present In June 2014, Samuel W. \"Dub\" Oliver became Union's sixteenth president. Coming from a distinguished career at Baylor University and a five-year presidency at East Texas Baptist University, Dr. Oliver has demonstrated a firm commitment to lead Union University to inhabit her mission and core-values. In July of 2014, a new library and a new greenhouse project were begun. The Logos\u2014Union's three-story, 54,000-square foot library was dedicated on November 6, 2015. A new strategic plan, United in Spirit. Grounded in Truth., 2016-2020, was adopted by the Board of Trustees in the fall of 2015. Union also in 2015 launched the EDGE program to provide educational opportunities and job skills training for youth adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In 2017, an academic reorganization took place that created two new schools: the School of Social Work and the School of Adult and Professional Studies. In 2018, the university launched its Writing Center, a result of the Quality Enhancement Plan that Union was required to produce as part of its reaffirmation of accreditation. Union approved a campus master plan in 2019 that calls for new buildings and an extension of the university's Great Lawn all the way to Highway 445 Bypass over the next 20 years. Dr. Oliver leads with energy and a Christ-centered optimism about the future. Our Statement of Faith 1. The Scriptures. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament were given by inspiration of God, and are the only sufficient, certain, and authoritative rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience. 2. God. There is but one God, the Maker, Preserver, and Ruler of all things, having in and of Himself, all perfections, being infinite in them all; and to Him all creatures owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. He exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit each with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, 5 OVERVIEWalone for justification and eternal life. Justification is God's gracious declaration of righteousness of sinners, who believe in Christ, from all sin, through the satisfaction that Christ has made. Believers are also sanctified by God's Word and Spirit dwelling in them. Sanctification is the process of progressing toward moral and spiritual maturity, enabled by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Those who are accepted in Christ and sanctified by the Holy Spirit will never totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end, and be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation. 7. The Church . The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, which is composed of all true followers of Christ, and in Him is invested supremely all power for its government. Christians are to associate themselves with local churches; and to each church is given the authority to administer order, to carry out ministry, to worship, and to practice discipline. 8. Last Things . The bodies of humans after death return to dust, but their spirits return immediately to God-the righteous to rest with Him; the wicked to be reserved under darkness to the judgment. God in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its appropriate end. According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth. At the last day, the bodies of all the dead, both just and unjust, will be raised. God has appointed a day, when He will judge the world by Jesus Christ, when all people shall receive according to their deeds; the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment; the righteous, into everlasting life. This Statement of Faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. With respect to faith, doctrine, practice, policy, and discipline, the Board of Trustees is the final arbiter on the Bible's meaning and application for the purposes of the University. or being. God as Father reigns with providential care over all things that come to pass, and perpetually upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and all events; yet so as not to destroy the free will and responsibility of intelligent creatures. 3. Jesus Christ . The second person of the Trinity is the eternal Son of God. In his incarnation Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself human nature, yet without sin. He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and by His substitutionary death on the cross He made provision for our redemption from sin. He was buried and rose again the third day, and ascended to His Father, at whose right hand He lives to make intercession for His people. He is the only Mediator, the Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church, and Sovereign of the universe. 4. Holy Spirit . The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine, who exalts Jesus Christ. The Spirit convicts men and women of sin, of righteousness, and judgment, enabling them to understand the truth. He calls men and women to the Savior, and brings about regeneration, which is a renewal of heart and nature. 5. Humankind . God originally created humankind in His image, and free from sin; but through the temptation of Satan, they transgressed the command of God, and fell from their original righteousness, whereby all humans have inherited a sinful nature that is opposed to God, and are thus under condemnation. As soon as they are capable of moral action, they become actual transgressors. God created only two genders and He fashioned each one of us as either male or female. Sexual relationships are designed by God to be expressed solely within a marriage between a man and a woman. 6. Salvation . Salvation involves the redemption of the whole person, and is offered freely to all who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior; accepting and trusting in Him External Associations Accredited By Union University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, educational specialist, and doctoral degrees.

Academic Integrity Union University upholds the highest standards of honesty. Students are to refrain from the use of unauthorized aids during testing (including but not limited to technology devices such as digital cameras, cellphone cameras, pen-based scanners, translation programs, and text-messaging devices), to refuse to give or receive information on examinations, and to turn in only those assignments which are the result of their own efforts and research. Failure to provide correct documentation for material gleaned from any outside source, such as the Internet or any published/unpublished work, constitutes plagiarism, a form of cheating subject to strict disciplinary action. On the other hand, faculty are responsible for discouraging cheating and will make every effort to provide physical conditions which deter cheating and to be aware at all times of activity in the testing area. Any student found guilty by the professor of cheating will be subject to disciplinary action by the professor. The professor will file a report of the incident and the intended disciplinary action with the Office of the Dean. If the student deems this action unfair, he or she may file an appeal with the administrator with whom the report was filed. The administrator will convey the results to the student and to the instructor by email (copied to the Office of the Dean of Students). If either the student or the professor involved deems the administrator's action unsatisfactory, within 10 working days of the sent date of the email conveying the results he or she may email the Dean of Instruction to request a hearing before the Graduate Appeals Committee. The committee will convey its decision to the student and to the professor by email. The decision of this committee will be final upon approval by the Provost in consultation with the President. Credit Hour The unit for counting credit is the semester hour. A semester hour is defined as an hour of class work a week, or its equivalent in laboratory, pursued for one semester. Numbering of Courses Unless otherwise noted in the course description, courses numbered in the 500's may be taken for graduate credit or by upper level undergraduates for undergraduate credit. Expectations will be greater in these courses for students registered for graduate credit. Courses numbered 600 and above may only be taken for graduate credit. Courses numbered 595 are workshops. No more than six hours of credit from courses numbered 595 may be used to satisfy the degree requirements. No more than six hours may be taken for pass/fail credit in the M.A.Ed. program. Grading System Grades for graduate courses at Union University shall be interpreted as follows: A Superior academic performance. B Strong academic performance. C Below average, but passing academic performance. P Pass. F, FF Failure. (P or FF apply to pass-fail courses.) I Incomplete. An Incomplete must be removed within the first five weeks of the term following issuance of the Incomplete; otherwise, the incomplete becomes an F IP In Progress, issued for a course which by design extends into the following term or semester. PR Progress as related to the doctoral dissertation W Withdrawal beyond the period officially allowed. See \"Withdrawal from Classes.\" N Audit. Requirements for Grade Point Average In order to graduate with a Masters or Ed.S. degree or a post masters certificate, students are required to have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all courses taken for graduate credit at Union University. To graduate with the Ed.D., a 3.2 minimum graduate GPA is required. To graduate with the Doctor of Pharmacy, a 2.33 minimum graduate GPA is required. Quality points shall be awarded as follows: A - 4 quality points for each semester hour of credit B - 3 quality points for each semester hour of credit C - 2 quality points for each semester hour of credit P - 0 quality points (course hours are not applied in computation of the grade point average) F - 0 quality points FF- 0 quality points (course hours are not applied in computation of the grade point average) W - 0 quality points N - 0 quality points Repeating of Courses A student may repeat a graduate course one time. Although the credit for the course will be given only once, only the final attempt will be used in the computation of the grade point average unless program policy requires other action. A 500-level course taken for undergraduate credit may not be repeated for graduate credit. Credit From the American Council on Education Regarding National Board Certification Graduate programs in education at Union University award credit as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) regarding National Board Certification up to 6 semester 10 OVERVIEWhours in a degree program. The Registrar will award transfer graduate credit upon recommendation of Program Directors for Masters, Education Specialist, and Doctor of Education (School Administration) programs. Application for the coursework to the student's degree program is determined by the Dean or Program Director in the respective program after review of an official copy of the Registry of Credit Recommendations (transcript) from ACE. Academic Probation and Suspension After completion of 9 graduate hours at Union University, a graduate student whose cumulative GPA from courses taken at Union University for graduate credit is below 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. A graduate student whose GPA from courses taken at Union is below 2.5 will be suspended from the graduate degree program. While suspended from the degree program, the student may, in an effort to improve the GPA, repeat courses in which a grade of C or F has been received. When the student's GPA has been raised to 2.5 or higher, the student may apply for readmission to the degree program. See also each program for program specific progression policies. (For pharmacy students, this component is monitored by the Academic and Progression Review Committee of the College of Pharmacy. Continued enrollment eligibility in the College of Pharmacy is deemed to be satisfactory academic progress for financial aid eligibility since the School's standards are more stringent than Federal requirements.) A graduate student suspended from the graduate program is not eligible to file for Veterans Administration Benefits. Academic Grievance and Appeal Procedures Orderly procedures are provided by which a student may be heard concerning a just academic grievance. Procedures are outlined in the Campus Life Handbook for the student who wishes to register dissatisfaction with the quality of instruction or performance of a professor. Both the Campus Life Handbook and the Faculty Handbook detail the procedure for a formal grade appeal. The student should first ask the instructor how the grade was determined. It is hoped that most problems can be resolved at this level. A student who wishes to appeal for a variance from graduate policies or procedures such as admission to or dismissal from a graduate program should direct a written petition to the academic dean requesting the variance and carefully outlining the reasons for the request. If the student is dissatisfied with the dean's response to the petition, the student may then appeal the dean's decision to the Graduate Appeals Committee following the sequence of the appeal procedures outlined in the current Campus Life Handbook Admission Information General Admission Requirements 1. Completed application for the specific program, including any payment for an application fee charged by a particular program. 2. Official transcript(s) showing completed degrees or prerequisite requirements which inform program admission decisions or are subject to consideration for transfer credit must be sent from the awarding institution(s). International transcripts must be evaluated by a National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) certified transcript evaluation company. 3. International students must complete the international student application for admission (www.uu.edu/international/ forms/graduate-application.pdf). All documents must be in English. Other program specific admission requirements are included in the program sections of this Catalogue. Requirements for International Students Applying for Study in the United States In addition to the general application forms referenced above, and any program-specific requirements, all international students studying on one of Union University's campuses must submit the following: A. Student insurance meeting visa requirements purchased through the UU group plan or individually. If an individual plan is purchased, a Declaration Page should be sent to the International Officer for proof of insurance. B. A financial affidavit as required by the United States Student Exchange & Visitor Program (SEVP), a division of the United States Immigration and Custom Enforcement. Each international student shall prepay or show responsible evidence (such as a government scholarship) of having an adequate sum of money for one academic year. This money shall be enough to cover tuition and other expenses for the student while enrolled at Union University. Declaration of Finances will be sent out from the International Student Office. C. Proof of English proficiency: From a country where the native language is English, students will be admitted on academic credentials without regard to language requirements. Academic requirements will be the same as for regular admission. From a country where the native language is not English, students must show proof of English proficiency with scores from TOEFL, IELTS, or iTEP test centers. Proficiency scores may vary by program. From another accredited institution of higher learning in the United States, international students will be required to meet the same requirements for admission as well as meeting the required TOEFL score. In addition, SEVP requires full-time course enrollment in face-to-face classes for international students who have been issued an F-1 visa to attend school in the United States. The student may only enroll in 1 three-credit hour online course to complete the full-time load requirement per semester. If the full 11 OVERVIEWload requirement has been met with face-to-face classes to include one 3-hour class, then the international student may enroll in additional online classes to a maximum load allowed under the degree being pursued. Dropping any face-to-face classes within the semester could result in being out of compliance with visa requirement. Any online course enrollment that falls outside of these guidelines for international students in the U.S. will result in the student being out of compliance and cannot be registered in SEVIS (part of Homeland Security). Contact the university's International Student Office for additional information concerning these guidelines. An SEVP-approved I-20 form may be issued only after admission requirements and the above monetary requirements have been satisfied. Requirements for International Students Not Studying in the United States In addition to the general application information at the beginning of this section, international students applying for an online program with no study/residence in the United States must communicate directly with the coordinator of the intended program about additional application information, including finances and English language proficiency requirements. For international students outside the U.S. who enroll in online programming, SEVP guidelines do not apply. Special Categories of Admission Provisional Students With limited exceptions, provisional students are enrolled in eligible programs for the purpose of obtaining a degree from Union University. These students do not have immediate access to official documents in order to be fully admitted. Any credit taken while in this status will not be transferred as regular matriculated credit until the status has officially been changed. Students will be required to submit all outstanding items to complete the admissions file in order for the provisional status to be changed. The student will be bound by all general academic requirements imposed upon regular matriculated students so far as prerequisites, amount of work, and quality of work are concerned. All work completed or attempted will be fully documented in the Academic Center. The student will sign a contract at the time of admission defining the status of a provisional student accepting the limitation of that status. The student must also sign a waiver so that Union University will have the right to request those documents needed to complete the admission file. A student may remain on provisional status for only one semester and the subsequent short term unless special circumstances exist and permission for an extension is given in writing by the Program Director. A personal conference with the Program Director may be required before the student is accepted for admission on a provisional basis. Non-Degree Seeking Students Some students may be admitted in this category if they desire to take courses primarily for special interest or on a \"visiting student\" basis. Often these special students are enrolled in other institutions and are enrolled for only one or two terms at Union. Students must submit an application to the appropriate graduate school, pay the application fee (nonrefundable), and submit an official transcript as proof of at least the baccalaureate degree. Students must meet all requirements for admission to change from Non-Degree Seeking status to Degree Seeking status. A maximum of 6 hours may be taken as a Non-Degree student. Registration Information Registration dates for each term are given in the calendar of this catalogue. In order to accommodate the varied personal schedules of students, early registration is also allowed. The dates and times for early registration will be published for each term. Students can also obtain this information from the appropriate graduate program office. Late Registration and Class Changes Late registration and changes of classes are allowed in some courses and in accordance with published deadlines in the Academic Center. A late registration fee or a class change fee will be charged for these changes. Those considering late registration for a cohort program should contact the appropriate graduate program office. A student making a change in his/her class schedule after completing registration will follow this procedure: 1. Obtain proper forms from the appropriate graduate office, 2. Secure the signature of his/her advisor, 3. Present the forms to the appropriate graduate office for the schedule change. Withdrawal from Classes Students seeking to withdraw from all classes should consult the academic calendar and/or their program director for withdrawal deadlines. In order to withdraw, students must submit the \"Withdraw from All Classes\" form via the portal (https://portal.uu.edu ). Students discontinuing class attendance without permission will receive an \"F\" in those courses. In exceptional cases, such as extreme illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control, the Registrar may assign a grade of W for a withdrawal after the allowable period. Readmission Students who have not been enrolled for at least one semester will be required to readmit by completing a new application to the appropriate graduate program. Official transcripts from other schools attended during the interval will be required. No additional application fee will be required. Readmission is not guaranteed. Graduation Policies and Requirements Commencement is held in Jackson following spring semester (May), following fall semester (December), and following summer sessions (July). Students should participate in the appropriate ceremony according to degree completion deadlines. An Application for Graduation must be completed online after being cleared by the appropriate graduate office. Attendance at the activities related to graduation is expected. Students wishing to graduate in absentia must download and 12 OVERVIEWcomplete the In Absentia Letter found on the Graduation website ( www.uu.edu/events/graduation/IAletter.pdf ). Students who successfully complete a graduate degree or post masters certificate program are granted a diploma/certificate. A candidate for the graduate degree must: Successfully complete all degree requirements which are in effect for his/her program. Earn a cumulative Union University GPA of 2.33 (minimum) for Pharm.D.; 3.0 (minimum) for Ed.D. Complete online Application for Graduation according to deadlines provided by the program office. Pay remaining balance on his/her account Settle all other obligations (fines, credentials, etc.) at the University. Financial Information Expenses Due and Payable All expenses for the semester, after subtraction of financial aid, are due and payable before the first day of class for that semester. Students who have not paid in full or have a payment plan agreement will be withdrawn from all classes after the last day to add, which is one week after the beginning of the term. Students with an outstanding balance will not receive a diploma or academic transcript or be eligible to enroll for a subsequent term. Students preregistering for a semester must have their current account paid in full. The General Student Fee covers a variety of University costs, including but not limited to the following: health services fee, admissions to athletic and campus-sponsored events, student activities, counseling services, student organization fees, career services, academic tutoring, wellness center membership, intramurals, post office box rental, student publications, computer lab/technology fee, online learning management system, graduation fee, printing, class dues, student ID, parking fee/sticker, and library services.

All above rules and regulations put the responsibility on the student. He/she saves money and avoids misunderstanding by immediately seeing the Senior Vice President for Business Affairs or the Assistant Vice President for Business Affairs. Equipment Any University equipment such as musical instruments, athletic equipment, laboratory apparatus, etc., that may be made available for students' use is the responsibility of the student. Any damage or breakage, other than by normal use, will be charged to the student's account. No equipment is to leave the campus, unless in care of the faculty member responsible for it. Financial Assistance Financial Aid which is available to graduate students includes the Federal Direct Loan, the Federal GradPLUS Loan, and the Federal TEACH Grant as well as Alternative Educational Loans. Some restrictions may apply. Information on how to apply for aid can be found at www.uu.edu/financialaid. Financial Aid Policies and Practices, Consumer Information, and other important information can be found at www.uu.edu/financialaid . Veterans Union University is approved by the state approving agency for Veterans training. Veterans and/or their dependents who may be eligible for VA education benefits should go to www.uu.edu/financialaid/veterans to apply. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will send a Certificate of Eligibility to the applicant, after the application is processed. After being enrolled in courses leading to a degree, students who qualify should review our Veteran Services page at www.uu.edu/financialaid/veterans . This site details what is needed in order to get your enrollment certified to the VA. The Director of Student Financial Planning serves as the Veteran Certifying Official for all Union University students. Treatment of Financial Assistance when a Student Withdraws Federal Aid - Return of Title IV Aid Regulations If a student in a semester based program withdraws from a semester on or before the 60% point in time (calculated using calendar days) without having completed any course in the semester for which federal aid has been disbursed or could have been disbursed (credited to the student's account), a percentage of that aid must be returned to the source. The percentage to be returned is equal to the percentage of the semester which has passed on the day student withdraws. Return of Title IV Aid regulations also apply to a student in a cohort program who withdraws from a single course without having completed any previous course in the enrollment period (semester), unless the student documents the intention to return to the program during that same enrollment period. Should the student not return to the program during that period as intended, Return of Title IV Aid regulations will then be applied. Other Financial Assistance Financial assistance credited to the student's account from sources outside the university will remain on the student's account unless otherwise indicated by the donor or source. Effect on the Student's Account If funds which must be returned due to withdrawal have already been credited to a student's account, it may result in the student owing additional funds to Union University. Employer Tuition Reimbursement The student is responsible for providing information to the University regarding their employer's policies for reimbursement. If the employer reimburses the student directly, the student must pay the University in full at the time of registration. If the employer provides partial reimbursement directly to the University, the student must pay their portion of the tuition at the time of registration. The University will provide any required information to an employer when requested by the student.14 CALENDAR 2022-2023Accelerated Courses follow their specific calendars shown below.

Degrees Offered Master of Business Administration (MBA) Master of Accountancy (MAcc) Mission Statement Developing business leaders to fulfill their purpose in Christ and society. Developing business leaders is central to the mission of the McAfee School of Business. Academic excellence is fundamental to developing people who are strong in their functional area and leaders in business. In the McAfee School of Business, we focus on disciplinary knowledge and high impact practices such as collaborative projects, research, community-based learning, internships, and course projects. Being future-directed, we believe business leaders will develop from functional knowledge and opportunities to practice business with faculty supervision. Business provides a unique opportunity for leaders to fulfill their purpose in Christ . Paul spent time in the marketplace (Acts 17:17) so that he might join in conversation with the people of his day. To prepare our students to be Christ-centered in the modern-day marketplace we focus on faith integration, which includes faith practices such as modeling Christ-like business decisions, integrating Biblical lessons with business, developing meaningful interactions with students, and praying for students. The people-focus of the McAfee School of Business is demonstrated through strong student--faculty interaction and faith integration which prepare students to fulfill their purpose in society . This is exhibited through the development of programs based upon business community needs, superior career outcomes, and the ongoing success of our students. 31 BUSINESS 2022-2023MCAFEE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS Available on the Jackson and Germantown Campuses and Online The MBA Program The Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree provides advanced study for individuals interested in managing and leading organizations.

Doctoral Processes The Qualifying Paper. Required of students who specialize in P-12 School Administration and the Higher Education program, the Qualifying Paper is a substantial critical analysis of the theoretical and empirical literature related to educational leadership, which may or may not be related to the student's dissertation topic. The Qualifying Paper is completed by doctoral students in EDR 707-Leadership Research Seminar (P-12 School Administration) and EDR 750-Research in Higher Education (Higher Education Program) during the student's first year and a half of enrollment. This seminar serves as experimental ground for creating a scholarly community among doctoral students while they explore communication essentials, such as evaluating research articles, writing academic pieces including abstracts and literature reviews, and examining effective presentation skills. The final product of the seminar is the completion of the Qualifying Paper. EDR 707 and 750 prepare students for academic writing in other doctoral classes and assists students in preparation for Educational Leadership Comprehensive Examinations. Each student's dissertation chair, who is assigned during this seminar, augments advising for the Qualifying Paper. Students present the Qualifying Paper to a symposium of doctoral students, faculty, and community as an exit requirement for EDR 707 and EDR 750. The Comprehensive Examinations. Upon completion of all courses prior to the dissertation, the student will receive clearance to take the written and oral Comprehensive Examinations when: The student has earned a minimum GPA of 3.2 in pre- dissertation coursework as specified by the Program of Study. A dissertation committee for the student has been approved by the Program Director. The Comprehensive Exams serve as an integrated measure of assessment and are directed at practical application of knowledge across the curricula. These examinations cover issues, practice, and research in educational leadership. The written exam is prepared by program directors with specific input from professors who write the examination questions. The written exam consists of questions designed to provide students the opportunity to demonstrate an ability to analyze and synthesize pertinent knowledge in educational leadership while addressing significant problems and issues in their field. The exam is administered under supervision without the aid of texts or related materials. An oral comprehensive examination with the student's dissertation committee follows. Successful completion of the comprehensive examination advances the student to doctoral candidacy, a requirement for registration for dissertation hours. No more than two attempts to pass the examination are permitted. The Dissertation. The doctoral dissertation is the culminating experience and exit requirement of the Doctor of Education program. The dissertation is scholarly inquiry into an area of professional and intellectual interest. It is a highly individualized experience for the graduate student; thus, the topic of research may vary depending on the professional goals and area of specialization of the student and expertise of the faculty. Working with a dissertation chair early in the program and with faculty throughout the coursework, the student develops a research problem and proposal. Using the expertise and knowledge developed in the research core courses and under the direction of a dissertation chair and committee, the student conducts the research and produces a quality 74 EDUCATIONreport of the findings. It is expected that the dissertation will follow standard accepted research methodologies and format. Requiring a broad-based understanding of theory and research, the Ed.D. dissertation should integrate knowledge and provide solutions to problems in the educational community, focusing on a specific setting. Results should include specific solutions or changes in educational practice. As a final demonstration of scholarly competence, the student conducts an oral presentation in defense of the research. For more information about the doctoral process and the dissertation, please refer to the Dissertation Handbook at www. uu.edu/programs/education/graduate/edd/dissertation-handbook. cfm The Dissertation Committee. Doctoral students are assigned a dissertation committee chair by the program director during the first year of enrollment while in EDR 707, Leadership Research Seminar (P12) or in EDR 750, Research in Higher Education. Selection of the dissertation chair is a critical step in the completion of the doctoral degree. Factors considered in selection are: 1) expertise in the area of proposed research, 2) availability, and 3) compatibility. The chair is an integral part of a doctoral scholarly community where students, chairs, seminar leaders, and research design and statistics instructors collaborate to ensure quality inquiry and writing. The dissertation committee is composed of two additional members, one who is assigned by the Ed.D. program director, and the other who is recommended by the student and approved by the Ed.D. program director in EDR 712 or 751. In addition, the faculty members who teach one or more of the research courses (EDR 710, 720, 725) serve as resource committee members for all dissertation committees.
