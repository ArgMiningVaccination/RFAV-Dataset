Don't get me wrong, I love my curls...but I don't want my hair to look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The key is to find a way to smooth out the frizz without ruining the waves and curls. Sound impossible? Well, here are a few tricks of the trade that help me tame the wild beast that is my hair.

[Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse [Apple cider (ACV) is one of those wonder ingredients.](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2014/08/16-ways-to-use-apple-cider-vinegar-every-day-stephanie-carlton/) It's a detoxing, disinfectant that is soothing, freshening and balancing, while making a mean salad dressing too. And if that's not enough you can add de-frizzifying to the list. What does it do? The acid in ACV closes the cuticle of the hair, helping it lay flatter on your head. It also adds shine, which never hurts, and whenever I use ACV, I notice how amazingly soft my hair feels afterward. Sadly, I can't use it very often because the acid also strips hair color. It's nothing that happens immediately, but I have found that my color fades faster when I've used ACV on a regular basis, so I had to cut back. How to use it: Wash and condition your hair as you usually do. Follow that with a rinse of apple cider vinegar. About 1/4 to 1/2 a cup will do, depending on how much hair you have. (Note: some people use ACV instead of hair conditioner. With my thick mane, I need me some conditioner or else I won't be able to comb it. At all. Experiment for yourself and see what works best for you.) Coconut Oil Conditioner Multi-tasking coconut oil comes to the rescue yet again! This time as an easy conditioner [works wonders on hair in many ways](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/8-ways-to-use-coconut-oil/), including frizz-busting. What does it do? Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft and smooths out those pesky flyaways. It also provides great shine and lots and lots of moisture. How to use it: After shampooing, rub a tablespoon or so of coconut oil into your hair (emphasis on the ends), then rinse. For a deep conditioner, heat up 1/2 cup of coconut oil and apply to hair. Wrap in a hot towel and leave for about 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. If your hair feels dry and stripped during the day, rub a tiny bit of coconut oil into the ends and fluff it about a bit. Your curls will be more defined, without looking greasy. Hair Oil Blends Hurray for the smart thinking companies who created anti-frizz oil blends just for people like me (and you too, fellow frizz warriors!) [ Balanced Guru No Frizz Oil](http://balancedguru.com/collections/hair-oils/products/no-frizz) - This lightweight blend of sesame, argan, jojoba and tamanu oils smooths out the frizzies without weighing your hair down. I rub a tiny bit into my hands and scrunch it into the ends of my hair and then carefully smooth what's left on the top of my head. Just be careful not to squeeze too much out of the handy dropper - it comes out fast! Other things to love about this product: the lemongrass scent, the glass bottle and the fact that it is certified USDA Organic and cruelty free. (Thanks to Balanced Guru for the product sample.) [Weleda Rosemary Hair Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Weleda-Rosemary-Conditioning-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B00DCUVYWS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1SVG7YWWBV1FK&dchild=1&keywords=weleda+rosemary+hair+oil&qid=1599679613&sprefix=weleda+rosemary+,aps,169&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=5235c6a6c5ce1087648ca48dcb0fab3b&language=en_US) - Another fabulous hair oil that has been in my frizz combating arsenal for years. The formula is a little heavier than the Balanced Guru, and a bit more moisturizing (some use it as an overnight hair treatment.) Scented with natural rosemary and lavender oils.
