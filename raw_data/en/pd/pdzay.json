Healthcare literature supports the need for prenatal education as a mean to reduce risks and enhance a couple's positive experience during pregnancy and the parenting cycle. Interventions aimed at preventing risks and promoting healthy lifestyles during pregnancy are well known determinants of children's positive health and growth during their first years.

Doctor visits during this time are known as Prenatal Care. Even if you are feeling well, it is very important that you go to each and every appointment. Vaccinations The CDC recommends the Tdap vaccine for anyone-both adults and children- who will have close contact with a newborn to protect the baby against pertussis. It is also recommended that mothers get the flu shot during pregnancy. Consult your health care provider for more information. Your Changing Body Weight Gain - Recommended weight gain for most women is 15-25 pounds. Ask your doctor if you should gain more or less weight. Breast Change s - Your body is planning on breastfeeding this baby. Your breasts may be larger, firmer, and tender. Halfway through your pregnancy, your breasts may start to leak early or \"first milk,\" known as colostrum. This is normal. Be sure to keep your nipples clean and dry and wear a good supportive bra. Urination - Your baby needs you to drink at least 8 glasses of fluid a day, mostly water. As your uterus grows, it pushes on the bladder and you will need to go to the bathroom more often. Be sure to contact your doctor if you notice any pain or burning upon urination. Heartburn - As your uterus grows it makes your stomach capacity smaller and acid from your stomach rises up the esophagus and causes a burning sensation. Try eating smaller more frequent meals and avoid eating right before you go to bed. Do not take over the counter medications without first talking with your doctor. Shortness of Breath - As the uterus grow it puts a lot of pressure on the internal organs and the diaphragm and the lungs are not able to expand as they did before pregnancy, thus you may experience shortness of breath. Nasal Congestion - Pregnancy causes your blood volume to increase by nearly 45%. This affects the membranes inside your nose causing them to swell and even bleed. Try increasing your fluids and using a cool mist humidifier to help increase the moisture in your home Swelling - Many women experience normal swelling of the feet and legs toward the end of the pregnancy, especially in the hot summer months. If you have excessive leg swelling and swelling in your face and hands it is important than you let your doctor know, this could be a sign of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). Sciatica - Some women experience this tingling, numbness and pain affecting the buttocks, hips and thighs. The heavy uterus puts pressure on the sciatic nerves. Sometimes simply a change in baby's position can alleviate the discomfort. Talk to your doctor if this pain continues. Hemorrhoid/Constipation - Hormone changes can affect the digestive system and vitamin supplements containing iron can make the problem even worse. Eating a diet high in fiber and drinking plenty of fluids will decrease your symptoms. Do not give yourself an enema or take over-the-counter laxatives. Consult your doctor if problems persist. 9 Warning Signs That Require Immediate Physician Attentio n Preterm labor (before 37 weeks): - Contractions - more than 6 in an hour - Lower backache - Pelvic pressure - Change in vaginal discharge Vaginal bleeding Abdominal pain Decreased fetal movement Fever of 100\u00b0F or higher/chills Severe headache Blurred vision or seeing spots/flashing lights Swelling of hands, feet and face that has not happened before Urinary discomfort Early Labor at Home If you think you may be in labor and your baby is full term, the first thing to do is relax. Begin to time your contractions. If your water breaks, whether you have contractions or not, call your doctor. You will need to report COAT: Color of fluid Odor of fluid Amount of fluid Time water broke When to Head to the Hospital It is important to have this conversation with your doctor dependent upon your medical history and pelvic exam. Remember, no 2 labors are alike. If contractions are growing more intense, following a regular pattern, lasting longer and coming closer together it is probably a good time to head in. Listen to your body. If you think you are feeling different or something is not right go to the hospital and get checked out. 10Every birth is unique, every baby a miracle. My Advocate Condell Medical Center Birth Experience Communication between you and your health care provider is the most important step in developing your plan of care. When you arrive at Advocate Condell Medical Center, please share with the labor and delivery team, what is most important to you during your baby's birth and hospital stay. Each birth is unique and can be unpredictable. Expect that you may need to alter your plan if the health of you or your baby becomes a concern. Please take time to carefully review the following information about labor and birth practices at Advocate Condell Medical Center. Your Labor Support Team A support team is important. We strongly encourage our patients to bring a loved one, friend, or a doula with you for continuous support. Plan for a supportive birthing environment, carefully considering who you would like to help you through labor and birth. Up to three people can remain with you during labor and delivery at Advocate Condell Medical Center. Comfort Measures Listen to your body, it will give you signals that help guide you into positions of comfort and help to speed up the labor process. Our Labor and Delivery suites are designed to help create a peaceful and relaxing labor environment. Be sure to adjust the room lighting and temperature to make yourself comfortable. All rooms have a TV and DVD player. We have several birth balls as well as hydrotherapy available upon request. Monitoring Your Contractions and Baby's Heart Rate We follow the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologist (ACOG) recommendations for monitoring your contractions and baby's heart rate, helping to give us a good indication of how well your baby is tolerating the labor process. Continuous monitoring is indicated if your baby's heart rate is unstable, if you are receiving medications to stimulate labor, or if you have pregnancy complications. Nutrition Sips of clear liquids are often allowed during the uncomplicated labor, including ice chips, water and broth. Women who have a planned cesarean birth will be instructed to not eat or drink for several hours prior to surgery. Be sure to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding food and fluid intake prior to labor induction. 11IV Fluids For the safety of you and your baby, most health care providers prefer IV access to provide fluids or medications. An IV will not limit your mobility during labor. Pain Management Having a baby is hard work. There are several ways to manage the pain during labor and birth. Some women prefer to go without or delay receiving pain medicine by trying natural comfort measures first. Taking a prepared childbirth class can help you learn the risks and benefits of your choices. Breaking of Your Bag of Water For some women the bag of water breaks on its own as labor begins. If it doesn't, your health care provider may recommend artificially breaking your bag of water to help labor progress. Induction of Labor The last few weeks of pregnancy can be physically and emotionally overwhelming for some pregnant women. It is important to remember that during the last weeks of your pregnancy your baby's lungs and brain continue to mature. Unless medically necessary, it is not recommended that labor be induced until you have completed at least 39 weeks of pregnancy. Pushing Preferences Your labor nurse will assist you with a variety of pushing positions. An upright position takes advantage of gravity to help your baby move down into the pelvis. Episiotomy Although the practice of routine episiotomy is no longer common it may be medically necessary in some cases. Please discuss this intervention with your medical care provider prior to labor. Cutting the Umbilical Cord Many labor partners enjoy being involved in cutting the baby's umbilical cord following birth. The physician will provide guidance when the cord is cut. Cord Blood Banking Cord blood can be used to treat many life threatening illnesses including leukemia, metabolic disorders or immune deficiencies. Some parents choose to pay a fee to a private company to have the cord blood stored for their own personal use. This is a decision that needs to be made before labor and will require some research on the expectant parent's part. Please consult with your medical care provider if you have any questions regarding this option. Immediate Care of My Baby Following Birth In alignment with the 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, and to assist in your baby's transition, your baby will be placed skin-to-skin immediately following birth. Your nurse will stay close and monitor your baby's breathing, heart rate, color, and temperature. 12Feeding My Baby Babies are very awake and alert the first hour following birth, so this is a great time to start breastfeeding. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) infants should breastfeed a minimum of 8 times in a 24 hour period. Frequent feeding will help to establish a good milk supply. All of the New Life Center nurses are prepared to help you begin this process. The best way to learn your baby's breastfeeding cues is to have her or him room in with you during your hospital stay. If you have chosen to formula feed your baby all feeding supplies will be provided by the hospital. Administration of Antibiotic Eye Ointment/Vitamin K The state of Illinois requires that all babies receive erythromycin eye ointment shortly after birth to prevent the chance of eye infection in the newborn period. Vitamin K is strongly recommended in the prevention of brain bleeding in the newborn. Circumcision Circumcision is a common surgical procedure involving the removal of the foreskin covering the tip of a baby boy's penis. Your obstetrician can help prepare you for what to expect and answer any questions you may have about circumcision. Rooming in At Advocate Condell Medical Center we strive to keep families together as much as possible. We encourage rooming in so parents can feel comfortable with feeding, newborn care, and normal newborn behavior patterns. Rooming in improves breastfeeding by providing opportunity to watch infant for early feeding cues and feed when baby is ready. Feeding on demand helps decrease infant weight loss, lowers jaundice rates, increases maternal attachment and increases early breast milk production. Our nurses are there to assist you and facilitate your discharge teaching. 13Entering the Hospital Main Entrance The hospital's main entrance is open from 5:30 am - 8:30 pm during the week and 7:30 am - 8:30 pm on the weekends. Valet parking is available. Please use the main entrance when visiting or for scheduled appointments in the laboratory or radiology. The Emergency Room entrance needs to be used before and after hours. Emergency Department Please use the Emergency Department if you are in labor or if your physician sends you to the hospital for a problem or complication during your pregnancy. A nurse will assess your status and prioritize your transfer to the New Life Maternity Center. New Life Maternity Center At the entrance to the New Life Maternity Center is a doorbell. Please ring the doorbell. You will be buzzed in. Proceed through the doors and check in at the desk. You will be directed to the appropriate area.

You or your labor coach may help yourselves. After your delivery a hospital meal will be ordered. Snacks and beverages also are provided for labor support people. A refrigerator is located at the Mother-Baby nurse's station. Please ask for assistance if you would like a snack item. Labor and Delivery Support Support people are welcome in the labor and delivery area. Two to three people at a time may be in your room during your labor; your nurse will use her discretion to maintain your privacy and respect your wishes. The family waiting room and library are available for additional family members who are waiting to welcome your new arrival. Phone Use For local calls: Dial 9 + 1 + area code + number (no charge). All incoming, personal phone calls will be directed to your room. If you do not wish to receive phone calls for any reason, simply unplug the phone or alert the nurse. Your phone calls will come to the nurse's station and the callers will be told to call back at a later time. No information is given out over the phone regarding you or your baby. Cellular phones may be used in identified areas of the hospital. Your nurse will carry a wireless phone and will give you her extension at the beginning of her shift. You may call her directly at any time from your room phone if you need assistance. Room Comfort The thermostat is individually controlled in each room so you may adjust it as needed. Please check with your nurse if you need assistance locating the thermostat. Siblings at Birth If you are considering having the baby's siblings attend the labor or birth, preparation is necessary. Please discuss this option with your physician well in advance of the birth. At the birth, a support person for the child is required. Seeing their sibling born can be a wonderful experience for children who are emotionally ready, well-prepared and well-supported. Please contact the Perinatal Education Department at 847.990.5407 to make these arrangements. Following the class, students will receive a signed consent form from the instructor which must be presented before the child is allowed to participate in the labor or birth process. Visiting Hours in the Mother Baby Unit The birth of your newborn is an exciting time to share with close family members. All visitors to the New Life Center will be asked to show photo ID upon entry to the department. Liberal visiting hours of 10 am - 8 pm offers the family time to bond and get to know the newest family member. However, too many visitors can overwhelm many new parents. One support person over 12 is allowed to stay overnight on the mother baby unit with you. Pillows and blankets will be provided. Always ask visitors to wash their hands before having contact with your newborn. Visitors who are sick should not visit to avoid exposure of illness to newborns and mothers. Special Care Nursery visitation is arranged with the baby's primary nurse.15Infant Safety and Security The safety and security of you and your infant is very important to us. Several security measures are in place. You will notice all staff members will be wearing an Advocate Condell Medical Center photo identification badge. Your nurse will introduce herself at the beginning of every shift. Take note of her name. She will coordinate your care with your baby's care and will be aware of all testing ordered by your physicians. The following are suggestions to foster safety. When the nurse brings your baby to you, mom and baby bands will be matched to confirm identification. You may go to the nursery to get your baby, and the same band checking procedure will be done. Only Mom or the significant other may get the baby from the nursery. Do not leave baby alone in your room. If you plan on walking in the hallway, place your baby in the crib and take him/her with you When showering, close the outer door, push the baby's crib near the bathroom and leave the bathroom door open. Never leave the baby alone on the bed. Newborns move around a bit so always keep a hand on your baby when he/she is out of the crib. Question unfamiliar people entering your room or inquiring about your infant even if they appear to belong there. Contact your nurse immediately if you have any question or doubt about someone. No one should carry your baby out of the room in their arms. Anyone trying to do so should be stopped and reported to your nurse immediately. Birth Certificate Your baby's birth certificate will be completed during your hospital stay. Your baby's Social Security card will be applied for at the same time. Social Security cards will be mailed to you approximately two to five months following application. You will receive paperwork regarding obtaining copies of the legal birth certificate, once all information is verified. If you are a single parent, a form, \"Voluntary Establishment of Paternity,\" will be available for your consideration. If you have questions regarding your birth certificate or Social Security card application, please let your nurse know.16Advocate Condell Medical Center provides evidence based maternity care with the goal of achieving optimal infant feeding outcomes and maternal infant bonding. All nurses are trained to educate, support and assist families in feeding their newborn. Immediately Following Delivery Congratulations! These first few moments after birth are unbelievable and sometimes a bit of a blur. As you bond with your baby, the nurse will place the infant skin to skin on your chest. There are several advantages to this time including maintenance of infant body temperature, induced infant calmness and relaxation, attachment/bonding as well as optimal blood glucose levels. You will remain in your Labor and Delivery suite approximately two hours. Your nurse will be monitoring your vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiration) as well as your uterine bleeding. It is our goal for breastfeeding to be initiated within one hour of birth. Your baby will be closely assessed and monitored during this time and will receive two medications: erythromycin eye ointment and Vitamin K. After the initial skin-to-skin time and first feeding, the infant will receive his/her first bath. Mom will be offered a meal or snack at this time and oral fluids are encouraged. Take this time to bond with your baby and rest. This recovery time lasts approximately two hours. Any IV fluids you received will be discontinued when it is safe to do so. You may experience afterbirth pains or cramping. Pain medication is available if you feel discomfort. Your nurse will assist you to the bathroom to urinate. Urine output is measured as long as necessary following a delivery. While up in the bathroom you will receive instructions on perineal care. All supplies are provided for this care during your stay. If you had an episiotomy, your physician has closed this incision with sutures that will dissolve in 2 - 6 weeks and do not need to be removed. If your perineal area causes you discomfort, let your nurse know. Your physician will provide orders for oral and topical pain medication. Transfer to Mother-Baby Unit Once your recovery time is complete, your nurse will transfer you and your baby by wheelchair to your room in the Mother-Baby Unit. You will be oriented to your room. For your safety, call your nurse for assistance to the bathroom your first few times up. All of your personal items will be transferred with you. You will meet your mother-baby nurse who will provide her phone extension so you can call her directly with any needs or requests. Please share any questions or concerns with your nurse. A menu will be delivered to your room so you can select your meal. 17Babies Who Require Special Care Sometimes babies require special care and Advocate Condell Medical Center's New Life Center's Special Care Nursery (SCN) is ready to provide that special care. Our SCN is designated as a Level 2 with Extended Capabilities Perinatal Center by the State of Illinois. This allows us to care for infants as small as 2 lbs 12 oz (1250 grams) and as young as 30 weeks gestation. The SCN is staffed with board certified Neonatologists and specially trained nursing staff to meet the needs of our sickest, tiniest patients. This dedicated staff cares for families as they go through the unexpected journey of having a sick newborn. It begins by helping families understand their child's illness and treatments while in the hospital. Next, the staff is there to teach family members how to care for infant while he/she is hospitalized. Finally, our staff is there to help families prepare to take their baby home from the hospital. Mother-Baby Care Your nurse will coordinate the care you receive in the Mother-Baby Unit. She will introduce herself as each shift begins and write her name and wireless phone extension on a small white board visible from your bed. She will assist you as needed with your care and your baby's care. First-time parents may wish to have the nurse help with caring for the infant, while experienced families may prefer asking questions only as necessary. Whatever your comfort level, your nurse is there to help you. Rooming in with your baby is strongly encouraged. During Your Stay Breastfeeding: Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended and achieved when an infant receives only breast milk. Exclusive breastfeeding provides health benefits for infants including: protection against respiratory illness, ear infections, eczema, less gastrointestinal illness, and childhood obesity. For mother benefits include: faster loss of pregnancy weight, delayed menstruation, less missed work related to childhood illnesses. Internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultants are available and all New Life Center nurses have special training to support all of your breastfeeding needs. Bottle feeding: If you are bottle feeding your baby, nurses will educate and assist with feedings as necessary. All bottle feeding supplies will be provided by the hospital. Birth Certificate: A birth certificate worksheet will be given to you upon arrival to the mother- baby unit. A dedicated Birth Certificate Registrar is available to answer any questions that may arise. Diet/Menu Selection: It is important for you to follow the same well-balanced diet after delivery as you followed prior to the birth of your baby. Choose 3 - 4 servings of calcium-rich foods, 3 servings of protein-rich foods, 3 servings of fruit, 3 - 4 servings of vegetables, and 9 servings of bread. Continue to take your prenatal vitamins daily. Room service is available for inpatients from 6:30 am - 6:30 pm daily. 18 Discharge: Both your physician and your baby's physician must write an order for discharge and then discharge will take place in a timely manner, usually around 11 am. Please have clothing for you and your baby that is appropriate for the season. You will also need a car seat for the baby's ride home. Your nurse will review infant care as well as postpartum care with you and you will receive written discharge instructions in the form of a booklet similar to this one. Identification will be confirmed. The cord clamp will be removed as appropriate. You will then be taken via wheelchair to your car. Pain Management for Mom: Let your nurse know of any discomfort or pain you are experiencing. You will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 0-10. While some pain or discomfort is to be expected following the birth process, several things can be done to keep you as comfortable as possible. Please use the following table to help you describe your level of pain: 0-1 ...................... hurts a lot 9-10 ..................... intolerable Your physician has prescribed medication for use as needed. Topical medications, ice and other comfort measures also may be used. Discuss your options for pain relief with your nurse and let her know if they are working. Pain Management for Baby: Your newborn's pain will be assessed as well throughout his/her hospital stay. Physical characteristics, facial expression and cry are evaluated before, during and after procedures such as IV placement, blood draws and circumcision. Interventions such as swaddling, breastfeeding and sucrose pacifier use as well as medications such as acetaminophen and EMLA Cream are common treatments for treating pain in the newborn. Pediatrician: Upon admission, you will need to specify a pediatrician or family practitioner to provide care for your newborn. If you have not chosen a pediatrician or family practitioner, your obstetrician may recommend one, or the physician on call will be notified to care for your baby. These physicians are notified following your delivery and make rounds daily. Rest: Rest is extremely important following the birth of your new baby. Try to rest when the baby is sleeping. A hospital is a busy place with numerous people involved in the care of you and your baby. Visitors and phone calls can be overwhelming. Safety: The safety of you and your baby is extremely important to us. During your stay, always transport your baby in his/her crib. Never walk in the hallways carrying your baby. Please wear shoes or slippers on your feet. Use your side rail and a pillow as a barrier to prevent your baby from falling from your bed. Please do not sleep with your baby in your bed or propped on you. Your baby should sleep on his or her back in the crib. Never leave your baby alone in your room. When showering, bring the crib into the bathroom or in the bathroom doorway and close your outer door. If bottle feeding, never prop the bottle when feeding. Always hold your baby when feeding him/her. Cesarean Section When your physician determines the safest delivery method will be a Cesarean section, you will require additional information and preparation. If the surgery is planned and scheduled, you will arrive a few hours before the scheduled time. The admission process will begin from the front lobby of the hospital. The admission clerk will escort you up to the New Life Maternity Center to meet your nurse. You will be asked to change into a patient gown and the fetal monitor will be applied. 19IV fluids will be started, a urinary catheter will be inserted, lab work will be completed, and your abdomen will be prepped for surgery. You will review and sign a consent form for the surgery. Your nurse will explain your procedure and answer any additional questions. Foods and oral fluids will be restricted several hours before the surgery. If your surgery is done on an emergency basis, several of these preparations and procedures may be done simultaneously. Immediately Following Cesarean Section You will spend the first two hours following a Cesarean section in the recovery room. During this time, a nurse will monitor you very closely. Your baby will have been taken directly to the nursery and placed on an infant warmer. Your support person will follow baby to the nursery. While the baby is being examined and measured in the nursery, you will begin your recovery period. Vital signs and sensation will be observed and pain medication will be given, and you will be asked to cough and take deep breaths. Your support person and baby will rejoin you in the recovery room as soon as possible. Once your condition is stable, you and your baby will be transferred into your postpartum room on the Mother-Baby Unit. Mother-Baby Care Following Cesarean You will meet your mother-baby nurse and she will assume your care, paying close attention to your vital signs, condition and pain level. You will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 0-10. The anesthesiologist may have given you pain medicine right through the epidural catheter during surgery that will provide pain relief for the next 12-24 hours. If not, you may be given a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) pump, which will give you the ability to administer your own pain medication. The use of oral pain medication, such as Tylenol with codeine or Motrin, usually begins on the first post-operative day. The first few hours after birth you will be on bedrest, after that time you will be able to sit on the side of the bed or up in a chair as tolerated. You will be allowed to eat as soon as you are feeling hungry and show no signs of nausea and vomiting. Your physician has prescribed medication for use if necessary for nausea and vomiting. Topical medications, ice and other comfort measures also may be used. Discuss your options for pain relief with your nurse and let her know if they are working. A urinary catheter will remain in place for 12 hours, while the IV and abdominal dressing will remain for up to 24 hours. You will be able to shower and walk about your room and hallway as early as 6 to 8 hours. Your hospital stay usually is extended a day for recovery following a Cesarean section. Your incision was closed with staples, sutures, or surgical adhesive. Physicians remove the staples in their office approximately one week post-operative. Once the staples have been removed, strips of tape called steri strips will be applied across the incision to give it support as it heals. As they loosen, you may remove them. Your nurse or your support person will assist with baby care. If you are breastfeeding, you may need assistance finding a comfortable position to nurse. Newborn Metabolic Blood Screening Why Your Baby Should Be Tested Some babies who seem healthy at birth may have a rare hidden disease. If a disease is found and treated early, serious health problems may be prevented. To make sure at-risk infants are identified, the State of Illinois requires testing of all newborns for certain genetic/metabolic disorders before they leave the hospital. The screening procedure begins with a simple blood test. If you are going home from the hospital before 24 hours, the blood test will need to be repeated. The nurse will inform you about the arrangements for repeat testing. Your doctor will inform you if these tests or your baby's health indicate a need for further testing.20Breastfeeding The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes the benefits of breastfeeding and recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complimentary foods are introduced for one year of life or longer as mutually desired by both the mother and infant. If you decide to breastfeed, the New Life Maternity Center will assist and support your decision. Your nurse will assist you with getting started in your Labor and Delivery Room (LDR) suite during your recovery period. All staff nurses have received breastfeeding continuing education and are ready to support your breastfeeding journey. Along with help from your nurse, the services of the Lactation Consultants are available to all patients. These consultants will see you during your stay at the New Life Center, maintain a \"Lactation Warmline\" 847.990.5403 for breastfeeding questions and problems, and are available for out-patient consultations as needed by appointment. If you have questions about breastfeeding or need assistance after discharge from the New Life Center, please call the Advocate Condell Medical Center Lactation Office at 847.990.5403. During your hospital stay, alert your nurse if you have any questions or problems. Benefits of Breastfeeding Milk Production The breast is a gland consisting of fatty and connective tissues that support milk production. The milk is produced in the alveoli and travels down the milk ducts to the nipple pores on the surface of the areola. Milk production is based on supply and demand. The baby's sucking stimulates the milk production. After the first few days of breastfeeding, the supply can exceed the demand, causing engorgement, or an over-filling of the breast. Over a period of time, this supply and demand will balance. Anatomy of the Breast The nipple and areola (the dark area around the nipple) enlarge and darken during pregnancy. This may assist the baby in latching onto the breast. The small bumps on the areola are called Montgomery Glands . They secrete oil, which cleans, lubricates and protects the nipple during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The oil contains a bacteria- killing enzyme, which helps prevent infection. The nipple has 15-20 small openings through which the milk flows. As the baby begins to suck on the nipple and areola the milk flows through these openings. This stimulates the let-down or milk ejection reflex . The let-down reflex activates the release of milk from the breasts. It is experienced in different ways; as your infant actively sucks and swallows, milk may also drip from the opposite breast, or you may feel a tingling or a full sensation. Lactiferous glands milk nipple areolaDucts Ductules Anatomy of the Breast For infant: Increased bonding/attachment Decreased risk of diarrhea, ear infections, respiratory illness, allergies, botulism Decreased risk of childhood obesity, leukemia, asthma, diabetes and eczema Decreased risk of SIDS Better oral development For Mother: Special bonding Decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer Decreased risk of osteoporosis Decreased risk of Postpartum Depression Lose pregnancy weight more quickly Less maternal blood loss Saves time and money Environmentally friendly 21This reflex can occur several times during a feeding. Other times, let-down can occur when you think about your baby, when you hear any baby cry, when it is about feeding time, when you are sexually stimulated or during orgasm. Fatigue, inadequate sucking, emotions and fear of pain all can interfere with the let-down reflex. It is helpful to create a supportive nursing environment to ensure that let- down occurs. Here are some suggestions: Find a peaceful environment Insist on your privacy if necessary Position your baby properly and comfortably Use a warm shower or warm packs prior to nursing to encourage the flow of milk Unplug the phone, play relaxing music, abdominal breathe before beginning to feed Establish a routine; get a beverage, a book to read or position your pillows prior to nursing If you experience difficulty, consult the Lactation Office. Your Breast Milk Colostrum is the early or first milk produced by your breasts and is usually present by the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy. Colostrum is yellow, thick, high in protein and low in fat and sugar. The protein content is three times higher than mature milk due to the immunities passed on from the mother. Colostrum not only contains enzymes and immunities to protect your baby, but also acts as a laxative, which helps in eliminating the baby's first stool, called meconium. Your milk will change from colostrum to mature milk during the first 72 hours after birth. Foremilk is the name for the milk that comes out at the beginning of a breastfeeding session. It looks thin and watery with a light blue tint. Hind-milk, which follows the foremilk, is higher in fat and is released after several minutes of nursing. It is similar in consistency to cream. This milk makes your baby feel full and has a sleepy effect. Breast Care Cleanse your breasts when you shower, it is best to avoid using soap on the nipple or areola area because it can have a drying effect. Also, wash your hands before each nursing session. Wear a nursing bra to provide support, even at night. The increased size and weight of the breasts can strain the Cooper's ligaments, which support the breast tissue. The bra must fit well and should not be tight in the cup area or around your ribs. Breast creams usually are not needed. If nipples become sore during nursing, it is most often caused by improper positioning. A helpful treatment for sore nipples is to express and apply breast milk to the affected area and allow it to air dry. (Leave the flaps of the nursing bra open until dry.) If breast cream is desired, a purified lanolin cream, such as Lansinoh or Pur-Lan can be used following a feeding by applying a thin coating on the areola and nipple. These creams are available at your pharmacy. Once nursing is established, breast pads or breast shells may be worn to keep outer clothing dry. Breast pads should be changed when damp. Do not pull off a breast pad if it is sticking. Wet it first with warm water to help remove it from the breast. If you are wearing breast shells milk may collect in the base of the breast shell. This milk may contain bacteria and should be discarded. Wash shells with warm, soapy water in between usage. Positioning and Latch There are many positions which may be used to breastfeed. A few of the most commonly used positions are: football, cradle, cross cradle, side lying and laid back positioning. Getting your baby to latch correctly is one of the most important steps to successful breastfeeding. The baby should latch on to more than just the nipple. When the baby opens his or her mouth wide and latches on to the breast tissue surrounding the nipple the latch is more comfortable for mom and the infant will drink more easily. 22Glossary of Terms 500 ml: Approximate blood loss during a delivery Amniotic Fluid: Bag of waters, approximately 2 quarts, clear and odorless Amniotomy : Breaking of the bag of waters by the physician with an amnihook Blood Show: Bloody mucous, presents as cervix dilates BPP: Biophysical Profile.
