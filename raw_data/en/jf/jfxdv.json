We ask the pharmacy technician members to please look for sessions that have that \"T\" designation in order to gain approved pharmacy technician CE credit. How do I record my CE for symposia?

Is there special hotel information for students? Yes, please see the [Hotel Reservations for Students](/Hotel-Reservations-for-Students) for more details. Is Wi-Fi free in my guest room? If you [book your hotel room through Orchid.Events](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23), ASHP's official hotel reservation partner, your rate includes complimentary internet access in your guest room. In addition, by booking your room through Orchid.Events, you will also receive the following exclusive benefits: - No resort fees - Peace of mind you booked in an official ASHP hotel - Protection in the event the hotel oversells its rooms - And more Why are rooms often unavailable at the headquarters hotel only days after reservations open? Over the past several years, ASHP has communicated the opening date of our meeting registration site well in advance of the meeting. Attendees and exhibitors have started to mark their calendars for the opening of the Midyear Clinical Meeting website in July. ASHP reserves the largest number of guest rooms offered to us by each hotel and reserves rooms in a variety of hotels to meet all budgets and tastes. The headquarters hotel is the most popular and, therefore, receives the largest number of reservations in the first several days, often selling out. However, hotel reservations fluctuate. As the meeting approaches, attendees and exhibitors cancel and/or change their dates, making rooms available again. ASHP recommends that, if you are unable to book a room, select another hotel from the official hotel list, and periodically check the ASHP [hotel reservation web page](/Hotel-Reservations-for-Attendees) regarding availability. My preferred hotel is sold out; what should I do? Many hotels in the official hotel room block sell out quickly. In order to secure the best rate possible on your meeting accommodation, you should choose another hotel from the list. How do I book a group of rooms for my organization? Five or more rooms is considered a room block. Individuals or companies wishing to secure five or more guest rooms must complete the online [Hotel Room Block Reservation Form](https://tinyurl.com/ASHPMCM2023) or email a [completed and signed form](/-/media/midyear-conference/docs/2023/mcm23-room-block-request-form.pdf) protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6120322931210e13020908054f0417040f1512). The [Hotel Room Block Policies](/-/media/midyear-conference/docs/2023/mcm23-room-block-hotel-policies.pdf) [PDF] must be read prior to submitting the [ Hotel Room Block Reservation Form](https://tinyurl.com/ASHPMCM2023). I received an acknowledgment from Orchid.Events. Will I hear from the hotel directly? You will not receive an additional reservation confirmation from your hotel. The hotel acknowledgment, received from Orchid.Events when you book your room, serves as confirmation of your reservation. The hotel will not have a record of your reservation until a few days prior to the beginning of the meeting. If you have questions about your reservation or need to make a change, you may access your [reservation online](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23) or email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d293819a8292bda0b1babbb6fcb7a4b7bca6a1). What do I do if I am contacted or receive an email/call from a hotel or reservation company other than Orchid.Events? Do not book a room and email ASHP at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1a59595e5a7b69726a3475687d) with as much information about the company as soon as possible. Unauthorized hotel companies have been approaching ASHP attendees and exhibitors offering hotel reservations via unauthorized or even sham websites, e-mail communications and phone calls. These companies are in no way affiliated with ASHP, the Midyear Clinical Meeting, Visit Anaheim, or Orchid.Events. Neither ASHP nor Orchid.Events can verify the authenticity of these companies or the reservations. [Orchid.Events](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23) is the only official hotel reservation company for the meeting. Why shouldn't we reserve our hotel rooms directly with the hotel or a discount internet provider? When attendees and exhibitors reserve rooms directly with the hotels or through internet providers, ASHP is exposed to penalties for not fulfilling our room block commitments. We risk our ability to rebook preferred meeting hotels and receive reduced rates, possibly lose qualification for the amount of space needed at the convention center, and/or are subject to higher convention center usage fees. This, in turn, could translate to higher registration fees. In addition, if attendees and exhibitors do not use the official ASHP hotel reservation provider, [Orchid.Events](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23), ASHP is unable to help if a reservation is not located in the hotel's reservation system, to protect reservations if the hotel oversells its room inventory, and to plan properly for the meeting (e.g., secure the appropriate number of shuttle buses, communicate to attendees, and provide door drops or in-room material drops). To help ASHP make this meeting a success, please remember to book early and through [Orchid.Events](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23). What should I do if I can't book all nights at my preferred hotel? You may select to be waitlisted for those nights. If you select a waitlisted reservation, currently, one or more nights of your stay are unavailable. [Orchid.Events](https://queue.passkey.com/?c=lanyon&e=ahsp23) is continually working with the hotels on room inventory, and there is a high probability they will obtain additional rooms for the waitlisted nights. Should your waitlisted reservation be confirmed, you will receive a new acknowledgment within five business days from Orchid.Events. If they are unable to clear your waitlisted reservation, Orchid.Events will contact you to discuss alternative accommodations. If you are experiencing difficulty making your reservation, you may also call 1-877-505-0675 to speak with an Orchid.Events customer care representative. Orchid.Events is open Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET, excluding Federal Holidays. I would like to extend my hotel stay and the dates are not available online? If your desired dates are unavailable or you would like to stay before or after the official meeting dates, call 1-877-505-0675 to speak with an Orchid.Events customer care representative. Orchid.Events is open Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET, excluding Federal Holidays. I am required to book a room at the GSA rate. Is that possible? If you require the GSA established hotel per diem rate, please contact Orchid.Events directly to inquire about availability. Orchid.Events customer care representatives are available Monday through Friday (excluding Federal Holidays), from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET at 1-877-505-0675. Why was I placed \"in line\" when trying to book my room online? Due to a high volume of traffic to the online booking site, you were placed in to a temporary virtual waiting queue for the site. The waiting room service helps to control website traffic and surges to ensure access to the site and provide a better overall user experience. What is the closest airport to the Anaheim Convention Center? Anaheim is centrally located with four airports all within an hour's drive. Los Angeles (LAX), Long Beach (LGB), Ontario/San Bernardino (ONT), and John Wayne, Orange County (SNA).
