Read to find out which home and natural remedies for colic in babies aren't recommended.", "sitename": "Happiest Baby", "date": "2017-05-05", "cleaned_text": "Colic Remedies: Do Home and Natural Remedies for Colic Work? Colic Remedies Homeopathy is a philosophy of healing that teaches \"like cures like.\" In other words, the illnesses can be cured by giving a tiny dose of something that-in a large dose-would actually cause the very same problem. For example, a homeopath might recommend minuscule amounts of poison ivy extract to stop an itchy rash. Some of the homeopathic treatments recommended for [colic](/blogs/baby/colic-symptoms) are chamomile, colocynth, magnesium phosphoric, and pulsatilla. Some parents swear by them, but there is no convincing evidence of benefit. Over $2.5 billion dollars has been spent by the National Institutes of Health to test herbal and other alternative health remedies for colicky babies. Unfortunately, almost no effective homeopathic tonics have been found. Homeopathic Colic Remedies for Babies Aren't Always Safe Just because a medicine is labeled homeopathic doesn't mean it is harmless. Two medical reports have detailed how one colic treatment, named Gali-col Baby, was associated with near-death choking reactions in 12 babies. The same skepticism relating to homeopathy surrounds claims that chiropractic or osteopathy calm crying. These anatomical approaches to colic assume a birth-related skull and/or spinal misalignment. But if birth trauma was the cause of colic, why is it that [preemies](/blogs/baby/help-preemies-sleep) never have colicky screaming...until they reach their due date? And, why does colic spontaneously evaporate after 3 to 4 months? Studies have yet to produce clear evidence that bone manipulation reduces infant fussing. Note: Manipulation of a baby's skull (cranial) bones may be a harmless expense, but I am very concerned that spinal adjustment risks seriously injuring a baby. Home and Natural Remedies for Colic I don't believe that tummy troubles are true causes of colic. But if you do suspect that gas, constipation, or other gastrointestinal distress is at the heart of your baby's cries and the 5 S's do not soothe your baby, you could try one of these natural home remedies: - Probiotics: While probiotics are no silver bullet solution, [several studies](https://www.cochrane.org/CD012473/BEHAV_probiotics-prevent-infantile-colic)have found that probiotics may be helpful in reducing colicky crying. It's thought that probiotics may reduce intestinal inflammation in some babies, which could relieve cramping...and tears. - Bicycling Your Baby's Legs: To alleviate pain associated with constipation, try Bicycling your baby's legs and tucking them into your baby's chest. Learn more about [constipation here.](/blogs/baby/baby-constipation-how-to-help-a-constipated-baby) - Massage: Touch is much more than a reminder of the womb; like milk, it's an essential nutrient for growth. Some research has found that healthy, full-term babies who were massaged daily cried less, were more alert and socially engaged, and had lower levels of stress hormones. (Here's [how to massage a baby](/blogs/baby/baby-massage).) - Chamomile Tea: Traditionally, mothers brewed chamomile tea for babies\u2014as well as peppermint, fennel, or dill teas\u2014to help upset tiny tummies. I prefer not to give babies any oral supplements (including tea), but if this is something you would like to explore, you can learn more about the risks and how to safely introduce [chamomile tea to a baby here](/blogs/baby/chamomile-tea-for-babies). The bottom line: [Give the 5 S's a good chance ](/blogs/baby/the-5-s-s-for-soothing-babies)to work.
