GENERAL INFORM ATION 1.1 DEFINITIONS i) Biopharmaceutical/ Biotechnology Product ii) Biologic/ Biological Product The term 'biopharmaceutical' was coined in the 80's to define proteins that were made by recombinant DNA technology [which includes hybridoma technology for mono clonal antibody (mAb) production]. Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active substance is made by or derived from a living organism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormones, enzymes or antibodies. Biological substance is defined as a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs, for it s characterization and the determination of its quality , a combination of physicochemical -biological testing together with the production process and its controls. Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Biological products can also be defined as: \"A protein (incl uding antibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other than direct extraction from a native (non -engineered) biological source\". This corresponds to the new biotechnology view (that is, by elimination , it is largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products). The term 'Biotechnology product' and 'Biological product' are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceuticals (by the broad biotechnology view). Note: Today, bi ologics have become inextricably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consensus is that a 'Biologic' and 'Biopharmaceutical' are interchangeable terminology, but a biologic might incorporate some other p roducts (e.g. allergenics, somatic cells etc.). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 4: Guideline on Registration of Biologics Page 4 of 21 Biologics include a wide range of products such as: 1. Vaccines; 2. Blood products; 3. Monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics); 4. Recombinant proteins: - Insulins - Hormones - Erythropoetins and other hematopoietic factors - Cytokines: interferons, interleukins, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis factors 5. Cell and Gene Therapy Products (CGTPs) But do not include : 1. Metabolites from microorganisms; e.g . antibiotics and some hormones. 2. Macromolecules produced by chemical synthesis; e.g . peptides/ oligonucleotides produced by chemical synthesis. 3. Whole blood or cellular blood components. Unlike small -molecule generic drugs, exact copies of biologics are impossible to produce because these are large and highly co mplex molecules produced in living cells. A 'biosimilar' medicinal product (a short designation for 'similar biological medicinal product') is considered as a new biological medicinal product developed to be similar in terms of quality, safety and efficac y to an already registered, well established, medicinal product. For details, please refer to Guidance Document and Guideline s for Registration of Biosimilars in Malaysia . Cell and Gene Therapy Products (CGTPs) are regu lated as Biologic products. Unlike biotechnology products which are mostly purified proteins of cells, CGTPs contain living and functiona l cells. Therefore, CGTP is regulated under a separate framework. For details, please refer to Guidance Document and Guidelines for Registration of Cell and Gene Therapy (CGTPs) in Malaysia . This document provides information for manufacturers, applicants, healthcare professionals and the public on legal arrangements in Malaysia for the registration of CGTPs. The implementation of the guideline will be compulsory on 1 January 2021 as state d in Directive No. 6, 2017. Please also refer to Directive No. 19, 2020 regarding the details of mechanism for registration and enforcement of CGTPs in stages.

Nevertheless, because of their nature, biologicals demand special attention with regard to their regulations to assure quality, efficacy and safety. Biologicals are inherently vari able due to their biological nature, produced from biological materials, and often tested in biological test systems, themselves variable, a feature that has important consequences for the safety and efficacy of the resulting product. Each product must be evaluated on its own merits. A prerequisite for the use of biological is therefore to assure the consistency of quality and safety from lot -to-lot. Today, the biological field is one of enormous expansion and increasing diversity, most especially in the area of new biotechnologies. The revolution of DNA -based and other cell technologies has opened up a new and exciting vista, and in many instances, traditional products are being replaced by equivalents derived by recombinant DNA technologies or other cutting -edge technologies. It is important to note that the demonstration that a product consistently possesses a desired characteristics of safety and efficacy will depend on a multifaceted approach on the part of manufacturer and the regulatory authority - drawing on thorough characterization of starting materials, demonstration of consistency of production, and appropriate selection of lot release tests - all under the stringent and documented controls imposed by good manufacturing practices - as well as rigorous post marketing surveillance activities.

Vaccines for human use include one or more of the following: a) microorganisms inactivated by chemical/ physical means that retain appropriate immunogenic properties; b) living microrganisms that have been selected for their attenuation whilst retaining immunogenic properties; c) antigen extracted f rom microorganisms, secreted by them or produced by recombinant DNA technology; or d) antigen produced by chemical synthesis in vitro . The antigens may be in their native state, truncated or modified following introduction of mutations, detoxified by chem ical or physical means and/or aggregated, polymerized or conjugated to a carrier to increase immunogenicity. Antigens may be presented plain or in conjunction with an adjuvant, or in combination with other antigens, additives and other excipients.

Plasma -derived therapies and their recombinant analogs are unique among pharmaceuticals and biologics. Their production begins with a biological starting material, human plasma. Each therapy has a unique biochemical profile as a result of differences in production and processing methods that can lead to differing clinical responses and efficacy among patients. Hence, from the starting material, through manufacturing and final distribution to patients, the complexities of producing blood products place s it in a unique class of biologics. Blood products are regulated as medicinal product. Blood products are inherently variable due to their biological nature, and the biological methods to test them. They are subjected to comprehensive assessment of the q uality, efficacy and safety. Four (4) principal complementary approaches are adopted: Starting material: Assurance of the quality and safety of the plasma for fractionation. Manufacturing technique: Control of the fractionation and subsequent manufa cturing procedures for isolation, purification, viral inactivation and/or removal steps. Good manufacturing practice (GMP): Strict adherence to GMP. Adoption of GMP as an essential tool of Quality Assurance System. Product Compliance: Standardization of b iological methods needed in characterisation of in -process and finished products. Plasma for fractionation and blood products that are regulated by NPRA includes: Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated in Malaysia for use in Malay sia; Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated overseas for use in Malaysia; and Plasma products derived from overseas -sourced plasma fractionated in Malaysia for use overseas. Note: This document is applicable to all plasma -derived products containing an active and inactive ingredient that is derived from human blood.
