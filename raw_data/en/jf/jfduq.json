The mother of a little girl you have diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) calls you.''I know you said she has ADHD and should be on medicine, but I don't want to put my child on drugs. What if she gets addicted? My husband found out that cutting downon sugar and food dyes can help calm her down. Also, Iread on the Internet that pycnogenol and blue-green algae can cure ADHD and they don't have any side effects. Is that true? How come you didn't tell me about these treatmentsfor ADHD?'' Formanyparentsandclinicians,choosinganacceptable therapy for the young child with ADHD is very difficult.First, clinicians have generally avoided prescribing stimu- lants except as a last resort for very young children, although in recent years the use of psychotropic medica-tionsforpreschoolershasincreaseddramatically. 1,2Unlike evidencedemonstratingthebenefitsofstimulanttherapyfor school-aged children, data supporting the effectiveness of stimulants in children under 6 years of age are sparse.3 Second,parentsoftenareconcernedaboutgivingtheirchild a ''mind-altering'' drug without knowing how long the childwillneedtobetreatedandwhatlong-termsideeffectsthere might be. Understandably, then, parents may search for what they consider to be more ''natural'' therapies, hopingeithertolessentheneedforstimulanttherapy(i.e.,as adjunctive or ''complementary'' therapy) or to avoid stimulantsaltogether(i.e.,as''alternative''therapy). Thus, it is important for clinicians caring for children with ADHD to be familiar with complementary andalternative medicine (CAM) and its role in ADHD. This paperwillreviewtheepidemiologyofCAMuseinADHD, discuss a conceptual model of CAM as well as selectedtherapies used to treat ADHD, and suggest ways to incorporateCAMintopediatricpractice. WHAT IS COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE? A DEFINITION In 1993, ''unconventional medicine'' was defined as ''medical interventions not taught widely at United States medical schools or generally available at United Stateshospitals.'' 4Intheyear2001,asmoremedicalschoolsoffer coursesinalternativemedicine, more hospitalsandclinics offertherapiessuchasacupuncture,hypnosis,andmassage, all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanyingtheoriesandbeliefs,otherthanthoseintrinsicto the politically dominant health systems of a particularsocietyorcultureinagivenhistoricalperiod.'' 5 Implicitinthisdefinitionistherealitythattheboundar- ies between CAM and mainstream medicine are oftenunclear, as what was once considered alternative (e.g., acupuncture for management of pain) moves into conven- tionalmedicine. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE USE IN CHILDREN: EPIDEMIOLOGY Adult use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased significantly in the past decade.6 Althoughtherearenosimilarnationalepidemiologicstudies inchildren,aseriesof regional studies overtimesuggests that CAM use in general pediatric populations is alsoincreasing, with more recent estimates of 20% to 21% ofchildrenintheBath(UnitedKingdom)andWashington,DC areas. 7-9Among children withserious or chronic medical and psychosocial conditions, rates of CAM use are much S370196-206X/00/2301S-0S37 Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Vol.23,No.1S,February2002 Copyright 2002byLippincottWilliams&Wilkins,Inc.

There are remark-ablyfewsystematicstudiesoftheprevalenceofCAMusein ADHD. A developmental referral center in western Australia found that approximately 64% of their patients diagnosed with ADHD had used ''other'' therapies inaddition to stimulants, most commonly dietary restriction, multivitamins, and occupational therapy. 13Data from our institutionsuggestthatoverhalfoftheparentsofchildrenreferredforADHDevaluationhaveusedsomeformofCAM therapyfortreatmentofADHD(E.Chan,L.A.Rappaport, andK.J.Kemper,unpublishedmanuscript,May18,2001).In a 1997 American Academy Pediatrics Improvement Program self-assessment exer- cise, 38% of pediatricians reported being asked about alternativetherapiesbytheirpatientswithADHD. 14 CONCEPTUAL MODEL: THE THERAPEUTIC WHEEL OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE What complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD)using?Theanswersdependongeography,theavailability and types ofCAM practitioners ina given area,andthecurrentfadsatanygiventime.Thediversityof CAMtherapiesisremarkable;itiswellbeyondthescopeofthispapertoreviewthemajorityofCAMtherapiesandtheir effectivenessinADHD.Severalotherarticlesonthissubject have recently been published. 15,16However, learning a comprehensive model for CAM helps one to organize an understandingofCAMtherapiesandtodevelopapractice ofdiscussingCAMwithfamilies. One useful conceptual model, proposed by Kemper,17 also demonstrates how conventional therapies for ADHD integrate into a holistic therapeutic approach. Kemper's modeltakestheformofawheeloftherapies,withthepatientat the center and different therapies at the rim (Fig. 1). Specifictherapiesaregroupedintooneoffourbroadhealing modalities roughly based on the proposed mechanism ofaction: biochemical, lifestyle/mind-body, biomechanical, and bioenergetic. therapies fallinto thebiochemicalandlifestyle/mind-bodygroups. Biochemical Therapies Biochemical therapies act at the level of biochemistry and are perhaps the most familiar and readily understood by physicians. Among the most common biochemical therapies are medications, herbal remedies, vitamins, andnutritional supplements. Table 1 summarizes the uses, suggested dosages, adverse effects, potential drug inter- actions, and contraindications of these substances. Treatment of ADHD symptoms with herbal remedies is generallybasedontheherbs'traditionaluses.Forexample,the anxiolytic and soporific properties of sedative herbs suchaschamomile,kavakava,andvalerianarethoughttobe useful for treating the restlessness, decreased concen-tration, and possible sleep difficulties associated with ADHD. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)hasrecognizedchamomileandvalerianasgenerallysafe,kavakavaisassociatedwithadverseeffectsrelatedto chronicorheavyuseandmaypotentiatetheeffectsofother central nervous system depressants such as alcohol andbenzodiazepines. 18,19Anotherpopularherb,Gingkobiloba, is often used to treat memory problems and to improve cognition.Arecentmeta-analysishassuggestedthatlong-term Gingko therapy may improve cognitive function,memory, and concentration in adults. 20Because Gingko antagonizesplateletactivatingfactor,itshouldbeusedwith caution in patients on antiplatelet or other anticoagulanttherapy. Subtledeficienciesincertainvitaminsandmineralshave often been suggested as causes for hyperactivity andimpulsivity. Certainly, early nutritional deprivation has been associated with long-term effects on cognition, behavior, and learning. 21,22In addition, iron deficiency, withorwithoutanemia,hasrecognizedeffectsonattention and cognition. However, little evidence suggests that supplementing otherwise adequate diets with ''extra''vitamins or minerals or using ''megadose'' therapy (oftenseveraltimestherecommendeddailydosage)iseffectivein treating ADHD. Such therapy may even be harmful. One double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study ofcombination megavitamin treatment found that children with ADHD exhibited 25% more disruptive classroom behavior while on megavitamins, and more than 40% hadelevatedserumtransaminases. 23 Nevertheless, parents often use iron, pyridoxine, zinc, magnesium,coenzymeQ,andothervitaminsandmineralstotreathyperactivityandinattention.Itisthusimportantto FIGURE 1.Thetherapeuticwheelofcomplementaryandalternative medicine (CAM).

Iron is particularly danger- ous. Although it is often perceived as safe because of itsubiquitous presence in multivitamin supplements, cereals, and other foods, iron is the leading cause of poisoning deathsinchildrenunder6yearsofage.24Acutetoxicitycan occurinamountsaslittleas20mg/kgofelementalironin children.25Nutritionalsupplementshaveoftenbeenusedtoenhance overall well-being or for their specific physiologic effects. For example, blue-green algae is touted as a ''powerfulimmune system enhancer.''26Supplements such as pycno- genol and evening primrose oil are used for their antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing properties, presum-ably to improve the function of the nervous system. Melatonin may be useful for promoting sleep in the seizure threshold in children with pre-existingneurologicdisabilities.28,29Whereasthehealth benefitsoftheseandothersupplementsarecurrentlyunder scientific investigation, published randomized, controlled studies for their effectiveness in ADHD are lacking. TheevidencefortheeffectivenessofseveralpopularherbsandsupplementsfortreatingADHDwasrecentlyreviewed. 16 It is important to remember that the FDA does not regulatenutritionalsupplements.Parentsneedtoknowthatthe consistency, purity, potency, and safety of natural remedies can vary among manufacturers and even within the same lot produced by a single manufacturer. Contam-inationbypesticides,heavymetals,andotherproductsmay alsooccuratanytimeduringthemanufacturingprocess. Lifestyle/Mind-Body Therapies Theseinterventionsareoftencommon-sensetherapiesall of us incorporate into our daily lives, including exercise, nutrition, environmental changes, and mind-body techni-quessuchashypnosis,psychotherapy,andbiofeedback. Parents often encourage their children with ADHD to engage in exercise, whether to improve their overall well-beingor(consciouslyorunconsciously)to''tirethemout.'' Common activities include gymnastics, martial arts, and teamsports.Althoughitisdoubtfulthatexercisealonecan''cure''ADHD,exercisecancertainlyprovideopportunities to develop social skills and to help improve the motor incoordinationsooftenpresentinchildrenwithADHD. Perhaps the most popular and enduring alternative therapy for ADHD is dietary manipulation, especially the Feingold/Feingold-likedietsandthelow-sugar/sugarelim- inationdiets.Inaneraofincreasedfocusonhowdietcaninfluencebehavior,mood,anddisease,parentsoftenturnto elimination diets in an effort to lessen their child's symptoms and to promote overall health. Dietary changesaddtotheparents'senseofefficacybecausethehousehold diet is more directly under their control. Because other familymembersoftenalsoadoptsuchdietarychangesandattitudes to make it easier to plan meals, whole-diet interventionsarebestclassifiedaslifestyletherapiesrather thanasbiochemicaltherapies. TheFeingolddietoriginatedfromallergistDr.Benjamin Feingold's observation that the rise in hyperactivity and learning disabilities among children appeared to coincide withtheriseinuseofartificialsalicylatesinfoodadditivesand colorings. 30By eliminating from the diet foods con- tainingartificialandnaturalsalicylates(e.g.,aspirin,Pepto- Bismol,apples,berries,citrus,cucumbers,grapes,tomatoes,tea), Feingold reported behavioral improvement in 50% of the children with ADHD. Subsequent well-controlled studieshaveshownthattheFeingolddietisnoteffectiveforADHD, although it may be useful for a small group ofchildrenwithtruesensitivitiestofoodadditives. 31,32 Another popular dietary manipulation is the recent studies,aswell as ameta-analysis,havefailedtodemonstrateasignificantassociation betweensugarandbehavior.33,34However,the''sugarand principles behind environmental interventions are straightforward:clearorganizationandminimizingdistrac- tions.EnvironmentalchangesoftenusedforADHDinclude adherence to regular daily schedules, structured home andschool settings, sitting at the front of the classroom, andusingwhitenoiseduringhomeworktime.Musictherapyis anotherpotentiallyusefulenvironmentalintervention: One study has found that hyperactive boys made more errorsthan healthy boys while listening to fast-tempo music, whereas both groups performed as well when listening toslower-tempo music. 35 Mind-body therapies are geared toward invoking the mind's ability to influence body function and symptoms. Thekeyprincipleisthatthoughtsoremotions(''stresses'')have an important impact on health. By improvingawareness of one's own bodily systems, one develops a senseofself-efficacyandcontrolandismoreabletomove from a state of internal disorder to one of homeostasis.Probably most relevant for children with ADHD is that mind-body therapies can help reduce autonomic hyper- arousaltostressbyelicitingtherelaxationresponse. Several mind-body therapies are commonly used for ADHD. Many of these are readily recognized and are considered established interventions: professional counsel-ing,parentingskillstraining,andbehavioraltherapiessuch aspositiverewardsfordesiredbehaviors. A growing literature suggests that relaxation training through a variety of techniques (progressive musclerelaxation, meditation, deep breathing, hypnosis, medita- tion, biofeedback) can help children with ADHD learn thus presumably decrease autonomic activity.Otherreportedbenefitshaveincludedreductionsinparent- andteacher-reportedproblembehavior,moreinternallocus ofcontrol,andgreaterattentiontotask. 36-39Thesestudies mustbeinterpretedcautiouslybecauseofverysmallsample sizes, but their results are nevertheless intriguing. Relaxa- tion-training skills need to be practiced regularly at homeforcontinuedeffect. Twotypesofbiofeedbackhavebeenstudiedinchildren withADHD.Electromyogram(EMG)biofeedbackfocusesspecifically on developing the child's ability to recognizeand reduce his own muscle tension, resulting in more re- laxation.SeveralstudieshavesuggestedthatEMGbiofeed- back can decrease hyperactivity and problem behaviorssuch as impulsivity and aggression. 40-42 Electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback therapy was developed after it was observed that a subset of childrenwithADHDappeartohaveexcessivetheta(slow)waveand decreased beta (fast) wave activity on EEG. Teaching childrentoaltertheirEEGpatternthroughbiofeedbackthusmayhelpnormalizetheircorticalfunction.Onestudy,usinga pre/post-training design, found a correlation between decreased theta wave activity and improvements in visual attention,ADHDbehaviorscores,andintelligencescores. 43 However,studieswithmorerigorousmethodologyneedto be done. EEG biofeedback can be an unwieldy therapy requiring35to50trainingsessions,althoughresultscanbeobservedafter15to20sessions.44Complementary and Alternative Medicine in ADHD S41Biomechanical Therapies Thesetherapiesstimulate,align,move,orremovelarger tissuesandorgans.Therapiessuchassurgery,massage,and manipulation (including chiropractic) are in thiscategory.Fewhavebeenevaluatedfortheireffectivenessin ADHD. Massage,whichhelpstolowerheartrate,increaseblood flowthroughthebody,andincreasecirculatingendorphins, is often used to promote relaxation and to reduce stress. Massage's relaxing effects probably explain its popularityfor children with ADHD. However, only one study has evaluated the effects of massage therapy on symptoms of ADHD. In this study, male adolescents who receivedmassage therapy reported improved mood and were ratedbyteachersaslesshyperactivethanthosewhohadreceived relaxationtherapy. 45 Chiropractic originated from the concept that misalign- ment of spinal segments leads to illness. In theory, sub- luxationscausenerveirritability,whichleadstoineffective nervous system function and agitation, decreased concen-tration, and abnormal behavior.46Very few studies of chi- ropracticinADHDexist. Bioenergetic Therapies Theunderlyingprincipleofbioenergeticinterventionsis that they restore the harmonious balance of an invisibleenergyorspiritthatsurroundsandflowsthroughthebody. These therapies are often not based on known scientific laws,butseveralhavebeenshowntobeeffectiveforcertainconditions in well-conducted studies. Examples of bioen-ergetic therapies include acupuncture, therapeutic touch, prayer,andhomeopathy.

Mostclinicianscaringforchildrenalreadyusethisapproach,althoughtheymaynotconsciouslydefineitas''holistic.''It bears emphasizing that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is only one component of holisticpediatrics.However,acommon-senseapproachtoincorpo-ratingCAMintopracticecanhelpmakeone'spracticemore holistic. Several studies have found that perhaps one-third of patientsdiscusstheiruseofCAMwiththeirphysician. 6,13 Many patients are reluctant to approach their physician,fearing disapproval or disparagement. Clinicians may bereluctanttodiscussCAMwithpatientsandfamilies,often becauseoftheirownskepticismorlackofknowledgeabout CAM. It is clear, however, that we must overcome thisreluctance.DiscussingCAMaffordsavaluableopportunity tolearnaboutandunderstandafamily'svaluesandattitudes towardtherapy,allowmutualexchangeofinformation,andforgeaneffectivetherapeuticalliance.Giventheopportunity,mostfamiliesareeagertodiscussCAMwithphysicians.The mostimportantprincipleisthatproviders need to ask. Clinicians should have several goals in mind when discussing CAM with families. First, they need to learn whattherapiesfamilieshavethoughtaboutorhavetriedfor treatingtheirchild'sattention-deficithyperactivitydisorder(ADHD). Asking about CAM is no different from asking about parents' methods of discipline or ways of dealing withafever;acomprehensivehistoryisessential.Thekeyto a good history, of course, is a systematic approach\u2014 whether asking for symptoms by organ system or asking about use of therapies by the therapeutic wheel. Just as aclinician would ask a series of questions to characterize asymptom(e.g.,Howlongdoesitlast?Whendoesitoccur? When does it go away? What makes it better or worse?), one should also try to characterize use of a therapy. Forexample, in the case of a parent wondering (Table 2 ). 48This necessarilyleadstoadiscussionofthefamily'svaluesandS42 CHAN JDBP/February,Vol.23,No.1SattitudestowardtreatmentforADHD.Forsomefamilies,a treatmentisn'teffectiveunlessitcurestheirchild'sADHD.Forothers,treatmentshouldpromotefamilysolidarityora sense of peace. Other possible goals of therapy include lessening symptoms (e.g., decreasing impulsive behavior),enhancing their child's well-being and resilience (e.g., eating well, getting enough sleep), and preventing symp- toms(e.g.,futuredelinquency). Implicit in this discussion is acknowledging the differ- encesbetweentheparent'sgoaloftherapyandtheclinician's goal of therapy. Whereas both parents and clinicians canusually agree that decreasing symptoms of hyperactivity,impulsivity,andinattentionisimportant,manyparentsalso hopeforacure(''He'llgrowoutofit,right?'').Promotinga child'swell-beingandresilienceisanotherimportantmutualgoal but may mean different things. For the physician, stimulantscanhelpdecreasedifficultbehaviorsandimprove schoolandhomefunctioning.Fortheparent,stimulantsmayaffect their child's appetite, growth, mood, and sleep\u2014all necessary for physical and emotional health. Whereas physicians may be focused on short-term goals such asincreasing attention and improving school performance,parentsmayalsobeconcernedaboutpreventingadolescentdelinquency and motor vehicle accidents. Understanding howgoalsdiffercanlessenmisunderstandingandfrustration and pave the way for mutual prioritization of treatmentobjectives. A third goal is parent education. Clinicians are the family'sbestsourceofinformationregardingpotentialsideeffectsofCAMtherapies,interactionsamongdifferentCAMtherapies (e.g., different herbs), and interactions between conventionalandCAMtherapies.Resourcesforinformation aboutCAMtherapies,includingsideeffects,toxicity,inter-actions,andcurrentclinicaltrials,areinTable3. Clinicians can also help families establish a system to evaluate how well a therapy is meeting their mutually-agreedtreatmentobjectives.Havingawritten''actionplan'' listing the priority goals of therapy and concrete daily or weekly measurements of target behaviors can be veryhelpfulasparentstrynewCAMtherapies. Finally, clinicians can teach families how to critically appraise the advertising for a CAM therapy. For example, the rationale for using many CAM therapies is based ontraditional uses or purported mechanisms of action rather thanonscientificdata.However,aggressiveandwidespread marketinginthelaypressandontheInternetoftenpromotesuchtherapiesas''miraclecures''forADHD.Someofthis marketingcansoundinsidiouslyscientificandmayappearto be logically sound, if not necessarily biologicallysound; other marketing may be factually accurate yet its overall message misleading.
