[Brahmi: The Brain Tonic ](http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/prodinfo.asp?number=6363&a_aid=52f071e0) The Sanskrit name brahmi is loosely translated in The Yoga of Herbs as that which \"gives knowledge of Brahman, or Supreme Reality.\" This herb promotes mental calm and clarity while improving memory and concentration. According to Frawley and Lad, \"brahmi helps awaken the crown chakra and balance the right and left hemispheres of the brain.\" Add 1/2 teaspoon of [organic brahmi powder](http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/prodinfo.asp?number=6362&a_aid=52f071e0359d9) to a cup of hot water, then add honey to taste, and drink the tea just before your meditation practice. Jatamamsi: The Mental Soother For an anxious, agitated mind, jatamamsi can soothe your nerves. This Himalayan-native herb has similar calming properties to its relative valerian, but without the dulling effects. It's also a powerful brain tonic and memory booster. Boil 1 teaspoon of jatamamsi in 1 cup of milk for five minutes and drink in the morning. [Hibiscus: The Devotion Potion](http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/prodinfo.asp?number=6427) The Sanskrit name for hibiscus, japa, literally means \"mantra repetition.\" Frawley and Lad write that the delicate flowers of this plant \"strengthen devotion in japa, help make mantras fruitful, and enhance attention in meditation.\" Set 1/4 ounce of the [organic flowers](http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/prodinfo.asp?number=6428&a_aid=52f071e0359d9) in 1 pint of cool water, and drink a cup of this refreshing summer tea to encourage devotion to your spiritual practice. Shankha Pushpi: The Mind Rejuvenator According to Frawley and Lad, shankha pushpi enhances overall intelligence and creativity by increasing circulation to the brain. The ancient treatise on ayurveda, the Cha-raka Samhita, reports that the herb promotes learning, memory, and recall, making it a favorable meditation aid.
