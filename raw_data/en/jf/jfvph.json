As for which name to use, the fact is that they're all extremely similar in their nutritional profile: They have just under 40 calories, about 1.5 grams of fiber, tons of powerful flavanoids, and about as much Vitamin C as you'd expect from a petite doppelganger of an orange.

To double your feel-good efforts, consider pairing a tangerine snack with one of these weight loss teas! Tangerines Are Good for Your Skin This one's the biggie! (And really, is there anything more youthful than glowy, clear skin?) Tangerines, thanks to their antioxidants that fight skin-ruining free radicals, possess a third of your daily dose of vitamin C. While you can reap the benefits from the inside out, you can also brighten your skin with a homemade mask that removes oil and bacteria. Simply mix 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt, a teaspoon of honey, and the juice of 3 or 4 tangerine slices. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes, rinse off, pat dry, and follow up with your usual moisturizer.

You Can Absorb Iron More Efficiently You've heard about how certain food combos are especially powerful, and here's another great example. When a tangerine's vitamin C syncs up with the dietary iron from something like spinach, the result is that your body can absorb the iron much more easily. Not getting enough iron often means you'll be more tired than you should be (possibly even be short of breath!), have darker circles under your eyes, and even appear paler.

They Boost Your Mood As if having great hair days doesn't make you happy enough, the scent of citrus (especially an orange-y one) can perk you up, too.
