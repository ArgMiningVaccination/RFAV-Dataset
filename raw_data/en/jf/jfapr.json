Detox Support Protocol The Detox Support Protocol is a four-month approach to supporting drainage, mitochondrial function, and systemic detoxification.* It includes the Jumpstart Kit (one-month supply), the Para Kit (one-month supply), and the Detox Support Kit (two-months supply). One month of drainage support (via the Jumpstart Kit) is included in this protocol to optimize mitochondrial function and the body's elimination pathways prior to initiating deeper cleansing.* The Para Kit provides key herbs and nutrients traditionally used to support detoxification in the gut and assist in a balanced gut microbiome, including Mimosa pudica seed, amla fruit, black walnut hull, clove bud, holy basil, and neem.* These ingredients also lend increased support to digestive function and immunity.* The Detox Support Kit includes four of our most potent supplements for cleansing support that build upon one another: CT-Biotic, Metabolic Activator, CT-Minerals, and HM-ET Binder.* Together, these supplements help protect the body against life's daily stressors, maintain a balanced gut microbiome, and aid in optimal kidney, liver, and thyroid function.* How It Works: Patients will first complete the Jumpstart Kit for one month. Next, the Para Kit is introduced and completed over a one-month period, followed by the Detox Support Kit, which is completed in months three and four. Formulated with Carbon Technology Carbon Technology is a proprietary blend of fulvic acids that support cellular repair and the body's natural ability to detoxify.* With a low pH, Carbon Technology also helps protect ingredients from being digested by stomach acid, so that they remain intact as they enter the desired location in the body. All of our supplements are formulated with Carbon Technology, with the exception of Para 1, Para 3, and the IS-products.
