Oprah interviews Jonas Elrod, a young filmmaker who says he woke up one day and suddenly began seeing angels, demons, auras and ghosts. In the world television premiere of Elrod's thought-provoking film \"Wake Up,\" directed by Elrod and Chloe Crespi and produced by Steve Hutensky, Elrod and his loving, but skeptical girlfriend Mara Evans travel the country seeking answers to his puzzling spiritual awakening from physicians, religious teachers, mystics and spiritual healers. How could a God-fearing man born in a God-fearing town in the South believe he can access other dimensions? Following the documentary, Oprah interviews Evans to discover what it's like to live with Elrod as he grapples with his uncanny \"gift.\" Plus, the debut of a series of short films that explore \"life's big questions,\" produced exclusively for \"Super Soul Sunday\" by Soul Pancake, the production company of \"The Office's\" Rainn Wilson.

Heartfelt and gripping, \"Crazy Sexy Cancer,\" directed by Carr and produced by Carr and Brian Fassett, is the story of one woman who went looking for a cure and found her life. Then, Carr talks about how her life has changed since the film's release and she invites \"Super Soul Sunday\" to her farm for an update on how she's doing today. Also, Oprah continues the conversation with best-selling author Kathy Freston who teaches us how to reach our highest level of health and contentment through small, focused changes. Plus, a fresh, funny look at the world through the lens of Soul Pancake.
