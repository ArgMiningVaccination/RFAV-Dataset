I know what you're thinking: Do natural beauty products actually work as well as their not-as-eco-friendly counterparts? Like many of you, I was skeptical that the formulas wouldn't perform, the colors would be dull, and the experience would feel less luxe than I was used to. But, after months of testing (it's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it!), I was proven way, way wrong. I'm now on year two of a totally clean makeup bag and cannot recommend the transition more\u2014I've never gotten so many compliments on my skin before. Curious about trying clean, natural makeup? Ahead, we've given you a list of the brands that really stand out in the clean makeup world. Everything in their lines is safe, so you can feel confident shopping and wearing these brands. Prepare to feel beautiful\u2014naturally. \"Vald\u00e9 Beauty prides itself on crafting long-lasting, highly-pigmented lipsticks from the cleanest ingredients. The brand's Creamy Satin lipsticks are made with cruelty-free, vegan formulas and are even refillable and reusable.\"\u2014Danielle Jackson \"Kosas has really been a standout for its skincare-first approach to clean makeup. It has innovative formulas and impressive shade ranges both for skin tones and colors to play with. The first time I tried this now cult-favorite oil, I was shocked and how water-thin the liquid was while still having impressive coverage. It made my skin look like skin, but totally undid any redness on my face. Plus, it's so lightweight I don't feel it at all, even during sticky humid summer weather.\"\u2014Kristina Rodulfo \"I'm personally obsessed with Ilia's foundations and tinted moisturizers. (Especially their new Super Serum Skin Tint) They're formulated with a mix of organic and natural botanics, plus safe synthetics. That combo equals textures that glide on gorgeously, while leaving skin feeling healthier than before. And that chic aluminum packaging? It's recycled.\" \u2014MT Advertisement - Continue Reading Below LAWLESS Conseal The Deal Long-Wear Full-Coverage Foundation LAWLESS Conseal The Deal Long-Wear Full-Coverage Foundation \"When you think of clean makeup, you think of a more minimalist look. But, Lawless is the opposite. For the maximalists out there who still want to be conscious about ingredients, you'll find everything you need for a glam, colorful face of makeup\u2014including this matte full-coverage foundation.\"\u2014KR Plain Jane Beauty Creme Minerals\u00ae Natural and Organic Foundation Plain Jane Beauty Creme Minerals\u00ae Natural and Organic Foundation \"The clean beauty movement is still largely lacking in diversity, and Plain Jane Beauty is a black-owned brand that fights that by keeping all skin tones in mind. The sustainable brand defines \"clean\" as being plant-based and free of mineral pigments, animal testing, and synthetic dyes. Bonus: the ingreedients also include botanical wonder workers like rosehip seed, green tea extract, and Vitamins C, E, and A.\"\u2014KR \"Into the farm-to-table movement? Then this is your new farm-to-beauty obsession. Juice Beauty sources many of the ingredients for their products from USDA-certified organic farms. Oh, and they manufacture many of their products using solar power. I'm hard-pressed (sorry, bad juice pun!) to pick my fave product of theirs, but their Phyto-Pigments Perfecting Concealer is up there for sure.\"\u2014MT \"Want a little sustainable luxury with your clean makeup? Then this is the line for you. The products are formulated with either natural or certified organic ingredients, and the weighty, super-chic compacts are refillable. Give their cream blushes a try\u2014they go on like butter and give the most beautiful flush.\" \u2014MT \"Vapour is an OG organic makeup brand that has just about every makeup product you can think of. It has dreamy colors inspired by the founders' hometown of Taos, New Mexico. Most clean makeup brands make cream blushes, but this powder one mimics the pigment you get from conventional brands. It also has skincare benefits thanks to squalane made with olives to soften wherever it touches.\"\u2014KR \"Westman Atelier is the brainchild of legendary makeup artist Gucci Westman, whose work has graced the faces of A-listers like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. She has an extensive list of ingredients not included in the products (parabens, suflates, PEGs), but doesn't sacrifice anything in the luxurious formulas. This blush, for example, gives the most rosy natural-looking flush but can be built up to be more poppy. I get compliments every time I wear it.\"\u2014KR \"When a line is created by a makeup artist (in this case, Rosemarie Swift), you can rest assured it's going to work. I can't live without their Champagne Rose Luminizer\u2014it gives the most perfect dewy glow to cheekbones. As for what's inside their products: raw, food-grade organic ingredients. And what's not? Synthetic preservatives, genetically modified ingredients, and harmful chemicals.\" \u2014MT \"Alima's Bronzer is a staple in my own makeup bag. Many natural bronzers can contain shimmer, but this is hands-down the best matte version I've tried. The rest of their line of cosmetics is just as great. Not only are the products themselves free of any controversial ingredients, but the company is also carbon neutral (they offset 100 percent of their carbon emissions through donations to CarbonFund.org) and they're a a certified B Corporation (a hard-to-achieve status based on a company's impact on its workers, customers, community, and environment).\" \u2014MT \"From pop music to fashion, and now beauty, everything Victoria Beckham touches turns to gold. I really admire how transparent the brand has been about its clean makeup standards\u2014including a big effort to be sustainable by not using plastic. The products also look and feel high-end. Case in point: This tiny tortoise shell palette (just half the length of an iPhone X) is compact but has a beautiful blend of shades to wear everyday.\"\u2014KR \"One of the O.G.s of the clean beauty scene, Burt's Bees has recently expanded into the makeup world. Just like their beloved skincare and lip balms, the cosmetics are formulated without parabens, phthalates, and petrolatum. I love their pencil liner, which is super gentle on eyes while still giving the definition you expect from a traditional liner.\"\u2014MT \"That little '3' in the name? It represents the trio of founders: a makeup artist, dermatologist, and eco-entrepreneur. This line is for the person who's all about the no-makeup look. My personal must-have is the cult-fave Expressionist Mascara\u2014it builds such incredible volume, you'd have no idea it wasn't a conventional mascara. It's free of petroleum derivatives, coal tar, aluminum, and parabens\u2014making it safe for the sensitive eye area.\" \u2014MT \"I'm obsessed with this brand's cool, witchy vibes. products are handcrafted without parabens, phthalates, or synthetic dyes; and are cruelty-free. Their Ash and Ember Eye Soot is seriously magical and makes a smoky eye super quick and easy.\"\u2014MT \"Makeup artist to some of Hollywood's coolest women (Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence, the list goes on), Jillian created a curated collection of good-for-you makeup. Her first and star product is the Lid Tint. It's formulated with organic jojoba oil and shea butter and free of synthetic fragrances or dyes. I personally love this peach color, which gives lids a subtle healthy glow (I wear it on my cheeks sometimes, too).\" \u2014MT \"Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty line has quickly become one of my go-to brands because I really trust their extensive standards\u2014the \"no\" list of ingredients they don't use is 3,000 items long (meanwhile E.U. product regulation bans 1,300 and the U.S. bans 11). I also love that Honest is affordable and available at a wide retailer like Target so clean makeup can be accessible. The liquid lipstick is, by far, one of the best I've tried. It's long-lasting and doesn't dry down sticky or suck moisture from your pout. I have every color.\"\u2014KR \"Calling all organic makeup purists\u2014100% Pure has stringent parameters. Everything is organic, cold-pressed, and with zero synthetics or unrefined ingredients. Fruits, vegetables, tea, and other plant pigments color the products\u2014including this lipstick. It's just as nourishing as a lip balm, with a punch of color.\"\u2014KR Kristina Rodulfo is the Beauty Director of Women's Health\u2014she oversees beauty coverage across print and digital and is an expert in product testing, identifying trends, and exploring the intersections of beauty, wellness, and culture.
