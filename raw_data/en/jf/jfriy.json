Medical Acupuncture and Pain Management Clinic, Franca, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Received Date: November 10, 2021 Published Date: January 04, 2022 Abstract Introduction: According to Western medicine, headache is not a symptom but a disease in its own right. There are four types of primary headache: migraine, tension headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, and other primary headache disorders. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory classifies migraine as an external invasion or an internal disruption. Depending on the area where the headache is occurring, the doctor will be able to identify which energy meridian is affected. Frontal headache means involvement of the Stomach meridian. Temporal headache (Gallbladder); parietal (Liver); occiput (Bladder). Weight pain means moisture retention. Purpose: The aim of this study is to demonstrate that there is a correlation between eating certain types of food and headache. Methods: Through an extensive literature review by PubMed and NCBI on headache in Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine and the report of a clinical case demonstrating the importance of dietary counselling in the adequately treatment of headache symptoms. Foods that imbalance the Liver and Gallbladder are: fried foods, chocolate, honey, alcoholic beverages, coconut, and eggs. Foods that imbalance the Bladder are: coffee, soda and matte tea, and foods that impair the balance of Spleen and pancreas meridian could cause the sensation of weight pain are dairy products, Cold water, sweets, raw food. Results: The patient reported in this article had a significant improvement of her headaches symptoms, changing completely her dietary habits and rarely had headaches like in the beginning of her treatment. Conclusion: The conclusion of this study is that the ingestion of some kind of foods is correlating with the headaches symptoms. To prevent the headache symptoms, it is important to understand which energy meridian is affected by the patient and which kind of food should be inducing or maintaining the patients' symptoms that needs to take out from the patients' Keywords: Energy Centers; Homeopathy Introduction According to Western medicine headache is not a symptom but a disease in its own right [1]. Asa common manifestation in primary care, headache presents itself, which can affect the patients' relationships and social activities, work, and entails a significant social and financial cost [2]. While headaches make up 5% of the global disease burden in terms of disability, the Singapore lifetime prevalence of headache has been reported to be 82.7%, and that of migraine 9.3% [2]. This study was based on the knowledge of Hippocrates that says \"Foolish the doctor who despises the knowledge acquired by the ancients\". For this reason, I will use the reasoning used in traditional Chinese medicine to explain if there are some correlations between the ingestion of some kinds of foods and the headache symptoms [3]. Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that there is a correlation between eating certain types of food and the induction of headache symptoms. Methods I used to write this article, an extensive search in the PubMed of articles related the correlation between the ingestion of some kinds of foods and headache in Western and in traditional Chinese Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): 2022. ANN.MS.ID.000779. DOI : 10.33552/ANN.2022.12.000779Page 2 of 14medicine. To illustrate this article, I am presenting one case report of a women with chronic headache that did not improve her symptoms using Western medicine treatment. She went to a consultation searching for another kind of treatment using Chinese dietary counseling, acupuncture and also was submitted to a study of her chakras' energy centers. The description of this case is in the following paragraphs. Case Report A.L.J., 32-year-old female patient. The background of the patient showed that when she was 16-years-old, she started having pain on the Stomach and a burning sensation, as well as strong headaches, mainly in the parietal region. She was diagnosed with reflux through an endoscopy and treatment was started with the use of lansoprazole and pantoprazole and diet for prevention of reflux orientated by her gastroenterologist doctor. She performed this treatment for four years, with no improvement of her condition. She performed surgery for reflux, maintaining the diet, lost 17 kilos in a month, had anemia, and lack of vitamin D. She suffered with these symptoms for several years, having performing more than eight endoscopies, which would reveal only gastritis, even though she did not respond well to the medications. She then searched for treatment with ancient medical tools. She was first diagnosed with Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood deficiencies and Heat retention according to traditional Chinese medicine. The patient was submitted to the chakras' energy centers measurement through radiesthesia procedure. The result was that from one to seven, six of seven chakras were completely lack of energy, rated in one (the minimum level) out of eight (the normal level), with the exception of the seventh chakra that was normal (rated in eight). The treatment consisted in Chinese dietary counseling avoiding foods that would harm the Spleen-pancreas energy meridian, such as dairy products, raw food, sweets and Cold drinks specially water. It was also recommended the patient to avoid foods that would harm the Kidney energy, such as the ingestion of coffee, soda and matte tea. The third group of foods that was orientated to avoid was fried food, eggs, honey, coconut, chocolate, alcoholic beverages, dairy products, especially when the cheese is melted. The ingestion of this kinds of foods would harm the Liver and Gallbladder energy meridian, and could also induce the formation or more Heat retention. She also received treatment with auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting. I also started the treatment for replenishment of the chakras' energies with highly diluted medications such as homeopathies, according to the theory created by me entitled Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine, and crystal based medications. The treatment using homeopathies medications were done according to this sequence: Sulphur dose), dose), Phosphorus 30CHXX-20 (single dose). The homeopathies were prescribed to be taken in a single dose with a hiatus of one day between the medications, necessarily on the sequence described. One months later, a new sequence of treatment was started, with the same medications taken on the same order, but now with 200CHXX-20 instead of 30CHXX-20. One months later, a new sequence of treatment was started, with the same medications taken on the same order, but now with 1000CHXX- 20 instead of 200CHXX-20. One months later, a new sequence of treatment was started, as the others, with the same medications taken on the same order, now with 10,000CHXX-20 instead of 1,000CHXX-20. Two months later, a new sequence of treatment was started, as the others, with the same medications taken on the same order, now with 50,000CHXX-20 instead of 10,000CHXX-20. It was also prescribed crystal-based medications, and both kinds of medications (homeopathies and crystal-based medications) were used to replenish the energy of the chakras' energy centers for a period of one year or more, or probably for the entire life. Results The patient had great improvement of her symptoms, with the use of the Chinese dietary counseling (avoiding all kinds of foods that was orientate to do not eat, acupuncture associated with apex ear bloodletting, replenishing the lack of chakras energy meridians with highly diluted medications (homeopathies according to Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese Medicine) and crystal based medication. With the treatment done, she was able to stop using the highly concentrated medications (aluminum hydroxide, omeprazole, and antibiotics) for the Stomach that was prescribed in the beginning of her treatment that were not improving her symptoms. After one month of treatment, we discovered that her diagnosis was auto-immune hepatitis, with markers for auto-antibodies positive (Antinuclear factor and Antimicrosomal factor positive and prothrombin time 86%.) Discussion According to data from the Brazilian Headache Society, thirteen million Brazilians have headaches daily, a number higher than that found in other countries, such as the United States, for example [4]. People usually take painkillers, increase doses, then change the types, ask for tips from friends, relatives and pharmacy clerks on more powerful painkillers. When they get to the specialist, the pain is already daily, and the list of painkillers that no longer resolve is long [5]. The difficulty in finding a specialist for its correct diagnosis and treatment, make the patients believe that he can use self-medication [6]. Overuse of analgesic medications is now the main cause of chronic migraine., as I demonstrated in the article written by me (2021) entitled Why Chronic Headache Patients Do Not Improve Symptoms by Taking Pain Control Medications? [7] According to Jahromi et al (2019), in the article entitled \" Association of diet and headache\", among lifestyle modalities, nutraceuticals and diet play a notable role in headache/migraine and therefore adjusting one's diet could be useful in preventing and treating headaches. The main components of a comprehensive diet include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and ions. According to Jahromi, it is not clear whether these dietary factors prevent or Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): Volume 12-Issue 1Page 3 of 14provoke headache attacks. The initiation of a headache/migraine attack may occur following consumption of specific food items. These food items should be identified and eliminated. Moreover, making specific dietary recommendations based on patients' needs, and types of comorbidities could be effective in reducing the frequency of headache or even preventing initiation of an attack [8]. But according to my experiences in the treatment of patients with headache, if we analyze the energy imbalances presented by each patients with the energy of each food and the location of each headache pain, we can know that if the patient ingest foods that could harm the energy of the Liver, that is the main organ affected by patients with headache symptoms, we will know which kind of foods that the patient should avoid to do no harm to that specific meridian [7]. But according to traditional Chinese medicine, all internal massive organs are interconnected by the energy flow and one organ can affect the balance of the other organ and for this reason, the treatment is holistic and not just treating the symptoms [9]. I will follow what Hippocrates said that it is important to consider other ancient medical traditions prior to the knowledge we have nowadays, so I will use explanations made by traditional Chinese medicine to explain why the ingestion of some kinds of foods can trigger the headaches symptoms [3]. Before I explain the theories of TCM that is important in the treatment of patients with headache, I would like to show the reasoning I am using in all my studies and how everything began. This history began when I treated one specific patient in 2006 [10]. The patient in question is a 70-year-old male patient that was complaining pain in the legs and was using anti-inflammatory medications with no improvement of his condition for the last 6 months. He went to my clinic to try another kind of treatment using traditional Chinese medicine's tools. According to traditional Chinese medicine's reasoning, he was diagnosed with Kidney- Yang deficiency (because he fells colder in the feet). He received treatment with Chinese dietary counseling, acupuncture and auricular acupuncture associated with apex ear bloodletting [10]. With the treatment done, the pain in the legs diminished and the patient was submitted to an interview 30 days after the treatment (after 10 acupuncture sessions). In this interview, the patient revealed that his eye pressure had also lowered with the treatment, as his ophthalmologist confirmed. During the treatment, he had not reported to me that he was treating glaucoma in the last 40 years with no improvement of his condition using eye drops. With the treatment performed to treat the pain in the legs, his eye pressure lowered from 40mmHg to 17mmHg, in the first time of his life [10]. This interesting case became the cornerstone of all my studies and all my treatment nowadays is based on the root of the problem (that are the energy imbalances and not just treating the symptoms), as I did in the patient described of pain in the legs and glaucoma. The reasoning I used in the treatment of the patient described in this article, motivated me to use this kind of reasoning in the treatment of all kinds of symptoms and diseases and I began to participate in many conferences worldwide to show the results of these treatments in diverse pathologies in a variety of specialties, to show the importance in treating the root of all disease formations, that are the energy imbalances and not just the treating the symptoms [10]. To explain better this point of view, I used to demonstrate the different perspectives between Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine using the metaphor of the tree, shown in the Figure 1 [10]. Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the tree demonstrating the different perspectives between Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): 2022. ANN.MS.ID.000779. DOI : 10.33552/ANN.2022.12.000779Page 4 of 14In this metaphor, there is a line dividing the root from the rest of the tree. This line is the earth. What is above the earth, we can see by the naked eyes, that are the trunk with several branches. Each branch corresponds to one medical specialty and coming out of each branch, you can see many leafs, that represents one symptoms or diseases treated by each medical specialty. What is under the earth, we cannot see by the naked eyes, that represents the root of the tree. The root corresponds to two theories in traditional Chinese medicine, that are Yin and Yang theory and the Five Elements theory [9]. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine understand that external pathogenic factors such as the Cold, Wind, Heat, Dryness and Humidity can induce the formation of some diseases that Western medicine do not understand and do not take into account in the reasoning used in the prevention and in the treatment of many diseases nowadays, such as the formation of COVID-19 symptoms, as I showed in the article (2021) What Are the Foods We Need to Avoid in Acute COVID-19 Infection? [11]. According to TCM thoughts, there are twelve main energy meridians in the human body and all pass through the limbs. There are three Yin meridians on the ventral surface of the upper limbs (from the Lung, Pericardium and Heart), and three Yang meridians on the dorsal face (Large Intestine, San-Jiao to Small Intestine) [12]. In the lower limbs, the three Yin meridians are those of the Spleen-pancreas, the Liver and the Kidney, which pass through the medial face. The three Yang meridians corresponds to the Stomach, Gallbladder and Bladder. All these three meridians pass through the anterior, lateral and posterior surfaces respectively [12]. All Yang meridians come to the head. The Small intestine meridian reaches the head through the temporal region, while the Bladder meridians are distributed over the parietal and occipital regions, as showed in the Figure 2 [12]. For Chinese wise men, everything in the world is ruled by the \"measure of balance\" understood as Yin and Yang. Everything in the universe is composed by Yin and Yang, including the human body [9]. The symmetrical arrangement of the dark Yin and the light Yang is not static and one can transform in other, as we can see in the Figure 3.Figure 2: Energy meridians channels. Figure 3: Yin and Yang symbol. Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): Volume 12-Issue 1Page 5 of 14The Yin and Yang energies have a rotational symmetry relationship and continuous cyclic motion. Yang cyclically returns to its beginning, Yin reaches its apogee and gives way to Yang. The two dots on the diagram symbolize the idea that each time each force reaches its extreme point, it manifests within itself the seed of its opposite [7,9-11]. If there are imbalances between these two energies, symptoms occur, and if not properly treated, they can result in diseases in the future, in this case, the imbalance state of Yin and Yang energy can also lead to headaches symptoms and the treatment rebalancing this internal energy using in the first step, the diet as the main tool, is of paramount importance in the treatment of patients with headaches [7, 9-11]. Inside the body, Yin is associated with organ tissue, while Yang is associated with organ function. With a Yin deficiency, organs are deficient in nourishment, while a Yang-deficiency reflects a functional or performance deficiency in an organ or organ system [9]. For Yin and Yang energy to flow inside the meridians there is the necessity of two other energies to work in harmony with it, that are Qi and Blood. Qi is basically the energy that circulates throughout your body and Blood is the energy important to nourish the entire body, as you can see in the Figure 4 [13]. Figure 4: Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood. To achieve health, the main aim is to balance these four energies of Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood, as I demonstrated this theory in the Acupuncture Research Conference that was held in 2015 in Boston, USA. This theory was based on the patient that I described in the beginning of the discussion section, of the patient with pain in the legs and glaucoma, that improved from his intra-ocular pressure even I did not know that the patient had such symptom (glaucoma) when I treated him using the balance of these four energies to achieve health. Using this kind of reasoning, all the patient symptoms could improve at the same time even the doctors does not know that the patient has such symptoms [10]. The lack of energy of one of these energies or a combination of them can lead to the formation of internal Heat inside the body, as you can see in the Figure 5 [10]. Figure 5: Yin or Yang or Qi or Blood deficiencies or a combination of these deficiencies and the formation of internal Heat. Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): 2022. ANN.MS.ID.000779. DOI : 10.33552/ANN.2022.12.000779Page 6 of 14The diagnosis of how we can do the diagnosis of the energy imbalances of the patients were well described in the article written by me (2019) entitled Why Are Diabetic Patients Still Having Hyperglycemia Despite Diet Regulation, Antiglycemic Medication and Insulin? [9]. Any food that unbalances the Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood energy system can cause headaches, in addition to the foods that can cause the energy imbalances in the five internal massive organs also can cause headache. For this reason, the dietary orientations used in the patient reported in this article were to balances the Spleen-pancreas meridian avoiding raw food, Cold water, sweets and dairy products [9]. When the patient have Yang deficiency and eats a lot of Cold food, this patient can have a headache too, due to Yang deficiency ( felling colder) , for example, if the person eats a lot of lettuce, this Yang deficiency will get worse, causing headache too, it is necessary to remove the Cold from the food, cooking or saut\u00e9ing to remove the Cold, and orientate this patient to do not eat raw foods ( such as the ingestion of vegetables and fruits ) that can cause more Yang deficiency, leading to the worsening the Yang energy deficiency and aggravating the headaches symptoms. These foods should be ingested only cooked or dried [14]. The second group of foods to avoid was the ingestion of fried foods, eggs, chocolate, honey, coconut, alcoholic beverages and all dairy products especially if the cheese is melted. This group of foods are very important to avoid in the majority of cases of headache because they imbalances the energy of Liver and Gallbladder, that are the major cause of formation of headache, according to traditional Chinese medicine. [14]. The third group of foods that we need to orientate to avoid is the ingestion of coffee, soda and matte tea because these drinks can induce Kidney energy deficiency and the use of them could harm even more the production of Yin and Yang energy that it is produced by the Kidney, that could be altered in patient with headache [9]. The other theory based upon traditional Chinese medicine principles of treatment is the Five Element Theory. The Chinese wise men were able to observe another feature from the nature, the relation between the five basic elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water, as you can see in the Figure 6 [9]. Contrary of what Western medicine understand, all the internal massive organs are interconnected by the energy flow, as you can see in the Figure 5. This is the major difference between what Western medicine (WM) and traditional Chinese medicine because the understanding about the interrelationship between one organ and the other organ. According to traditional Chinese medicine, if one element became imbalanced, the other organs can be imbalanced also, leading to an energy alteration in all internal organ with the time, as one organ is responsible for sending energy to the following organ, as I (2021) showed in the article entitled Chakras' Energy Deficiencies in Patient with Congestive Heart Failure [15]. Figure 6: Five Elements and Generation and Control Cycle. The major cause of energy imbalances of the Five Elements is the wrong eating habit and the emotions. For this reason, all kinds of diseases formations can have in the back ground, the energy alterations generated by wrong eating habits inducing any formation of disease, in this case, the formation of headache symptoms. In this article, I am showing that in many cases, the patients with headache symptoms do not have problem inside the head but only energy imbalances that in many times, it is caused by the energy alterations in the five internal massive organs, that usually cannot see by the naked eyes. For this reason, the use of laboratorial or radiological exams, in this case, to evaluate if the patient has or not any alterations inside the head, cannot do the correct diagnosis because all these organs and meridians are not inside the head and the localized way of thinking, only looking at the affected area, usually cannot do the correct diagnosis, because these alterations are in the energy level, that we cannot see by the naked eyes [9,14].Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): Volume 12-Issue 1Page 7 of 14One of the causes of imbalances of the five elements is the wrong eating habits that could be causing deficiency in one of the five internal massive organs. For example, it is very common to see people drinking caw's milk nowadays, even in the hospital. Caw's milk can cause the imbalances in the Spleen and pancreas meridian that is responsible for the absorption of nutrients and subsequently formation of Blood. When the body is producing less Blood, the nutrition support for the entire body will be reduced and all the organs and system could suffer from this deficiency and go to a deficient state also [9]. Traditional Chinese medicine observed and systematized these relationships into the Generation Cycle and Control Cycle. In this theory, one element represents one internal massive organ and one organ is responsible for one external sensorial organ. For example, the Wood element corresponds to the Liver, and has the eye as its external sensorial organ, being responsible for vision. The emotion that unbalances the Liver is anger [9]. The Fire Element corresponds to the Heart, represented by the tongue and is responsible for language and communication. The emotion that unbalances the Heart is excessive joy [9]. The Earth Element corresponds to the Spleen, represented by the mouth and being responsible for taste. The emotion that unbalances the Spleen is excessive worry [9]. The Metal Element corresponds to the Lungs, represents the nose, and is responsible for the sense of smell. The emotion that unbalances the Lungs is grief [9]. Finally, the Water Element corresponds to the Kidney and represents the ears and hearing process. The emotion that unbalances the Kidney is fear [9]. For each massive organ, there is a hollow organ attached. In the case of the Liver, the attached hollow organ is the Gallbladder. The imbalances in the Liver energy meridian can cause headache in the parietal region of the Head, as you can see in the Figure 7. This is the region where the patient described in this article has since the beginning of her headache symptoms and after the clinical evaluation, it was discovered that her headache was due to an auto-immune-hepatitis. In the article written by me (2019) entitled Can Autoimmune Hepatitis Be Treated Without the Use of Corticosteroids and Immunosuppressive Drugs? In this article, I am showing that auto-immune hepatitis can be treated only rebalancing the internal energy without using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs because according to traditional Chinese medicine's reasoning, all auto-immune diseases are caused by Yin deficiency Figure 7 [9,16]. If the energy that is imbalanced is in the Gallbladder, the headache can be happening in the temporal region of the head, as you can see in the Figure 8. If the headache is occurring in the area above or under the eyes, in one line that is cutting the iris of both eyes, this could mean Stomach energy disharmony, as I am showing in the Figure 9. Frontal headache is a problem in the Stomach energy center and usually generated when the patient has not eaten for many hours; it is recommended to prevent this kind of headache to orientate the patients to avoid being so many hours without eating anything and eat at smaller intervals Figure 9 [14].Figure 7: Headache in the parietal region of the head mean Liver energy alterations. Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 14Figure 8: Headache in the parietal region of the head, meaning Gallbladder energy disharmony . Figure 9: Headache in the frontal area of the head. When the headache is occurring in the occipital area of the head, this means that the organ that is affected is the Bladder, but the Bladder is a coupled organ of the Kidney and all the foods that can imbalance the Kidney energy centers such as the ingestion of coffee, soda and matte tea, can reduce the energy of the Kidney and lead to impairment of the Bladder and cause headache in the occiput region of the head, as you can see in the Figure 10 [14] Figure 10: Headache in the occiput area of the head meaning that the Bladder meridian is affected. Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): Volume 12-Issue 1Page 9 of 14In the case of headache in the area near the ear, the energy meridian that could be affected is the small intestine, as you can see in the Figure 11 [14]. In the case of Large intestine energy meridian affected, the patient can have problems in the jaw and nose and the treatment of this meridian is very useful in all this kinds of affections, as you can see in the Figure 12 [17]. All this information was presented by me in the Webinar on Food Science & Food Safety, that was held on April 5th, 2021 [14,17]. Figure 11: Small intestine meridian imbalances (that has the Lung the coupled organ). Figure 12: Large intestine energy meridian and the location of the pain. The internal five massive organs representing the five elements and their coupled hollow organ are demonstrated in the Table 1. The five elements are represented in the generation cycle showed in the Figure 13. What I want to show in this Figure 13, is that all the organs depend on the energy of the organ that is generating it. For example, Kidney sends energy to the Liver, that sends energy to the Heart. Heart sends energy to the Spleen that sends energy to the Lung. To know this interrelationship is very important to understand the formation of diverse disease nowadays and how we can treat them because all the alterations generating the emotional Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL .

This could reveal that the majority of the population could be classified as immune depressed and not immune competent as the energy is responsible for our immune system according to traditional Chinese medicine, demonstrated in the article Are We Vaccinating Immunocompetent or Immunocompromised People for COVID 19? [20]. The treatment of this condition, replenishing the chakras' energy centers using highly diluted medications (through Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine) are very important to treat many emotional and physical manifestations such as reducing hyperglycemia in diabetes patients, as I showed in the article Why Are Diabetic Patients Still Having Hyperglycemia Despite Diet Regulation, Antiglycemic Medication and Insulin? among many other diseases [9,18-20]. The explanations about the five elements were well described in the article written by me (2019) Why Are Diabetic Patients Still Having Hyperglycemia Despite Diet Regulation, Antiglycemic Medication and Insulin? [9]. The use of highly diluted medications in this case were explained by the Arndt Schultz law (Figure 14), created in 1888, by two German researchers. In this law, they are saying that highly concentrated medications can reduce the vital energy (that is already low in the majority of the population in this world) and the use of highly diluted medications can increase this vital energy that it is this result that we need to achieve in all our treatments nowadays Figure 14 [21].Figure 13: Generation cycle. Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): 1Page 11 of 14Figure 14: Arndt-Schultz Law. In my daily practice, usually when the patient arrives with a headache symptom, I usually question what he ate before the beginning of the headache symptoms to appear. Depending on the area affected by the headache, I will know which energy meridian is affected and which kind of food that induced that symptoms. I usually follow what Hippocrates said that is \"we must use our food as our medicine and our medicine as our food\" [3]. So the wrong eating habits should be prompt corrected to do not maintain the headaches symptoms, mainly to stop the ingestion of caw's milk and all the foods that can contain dairy products especially when there is melted cheese [14].The other types of milk can be ingested, but soymilk nowadays, at least in Brazil, is made with transgenic soy and this has given thyroid alteration in patients. When the patient is ingesting soymilk, there is a follow-up by exams such as TSH, of thyroid hormones to see if the patient is not having thyroid problems [9]. It is recommended to switch to goat's milk, as it does not cause these problems, in addition to toning Kidney energy, reducing premature aging. Yam milk is also recommended, which is good for those who have Blood deficiency, such as in women who lose many Blood in the menstrual cycle, as yam is a food that tones Blood production [14]. Figure 15: Auricular acupuncture points used in the treatment of headache (leaf level and root level). Archives in Neurology and Neuroscience Volume 12-Issue 1Citation: Huang WL . Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): 2022. ANN.MS.ID.000779. 12 of 14Headache related to drinking caw's milk is characterized by heavy pain, as there is an abnormal retention of fluid in the body, causing a feeling of heaviness. Suspending everything that has milk, cheese, curd, yogurt, ice cream, cake is the major importance in the treatment of this kind of headache to avoid the cause of the formation of headache, as I showed in the article I (2019) wrote entitled Auricular Acupuncture and Chinese Dietary Therapy in the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Headache [14]. Usually, in addition to food, acupuncture is also used to rebalance Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood, and using local points to treat the pain but also, it is also used auricular points to treat the entire energy imbalances of the patient, as I am showing in the Figure 14. In this way of treatment, I am treating the leaf level and also, the root level of the tree, showed in the Figure 15 [14]. As I usually do, I follow Hippocrates thoughts that said, it is more important to know which patient has the diseases than to know which diseases the patient has [3]. In addition to the wrong diet and habits that can cause an imbalance in the patient's energies, emotions can also affect massive organs and cause headaches, however the treatment of emotions must be done with the help of other methods such as acupuncture and medications such as homeopathies, besides the patient. [14]. There is also a headache due to the invasion of external pathogens and this will be the theme for another article. What I want to say is that Western medicine does not take into account the invasion of the external pathogenic factors such as the exposition to Wind, keeping the air conditioning on, Cold, which are factors that also cause headache [15]. Another cause of energy imbalances that can generate headaches symptoms are the lack of energy inside the massive organs, as showed in this case reported in this article, where I need to use highly diluted medications such as homeopathy medications, to treat her condition, to replenish the internal massive organs energy, according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and crystal- based medications. The medications used in the treatment of each internal massive organ (that is deficient in energy) were described in the Table 2.

Is There Any Correlation Between the Ingestion of Some Kinds of Foods and Headache?. Arch Neurol & Neurosci. 12(1): Volume 12-Issue 1Page 13 of 14In acupuncture, some points are made on the ear to prevent the entry of Wind that can cause greater damage to the patient, in addition to points to treat other deficiencies and energy imbalances [14]. In the article that I (2019) wrote entitled Auricular Acupuncture and Chinese Dietary Therapy in the Treatment of Patients with Chronic Headache, I am showing very good results using acupuncture treatment. The patients that not have good results using acupuncture to treat their headaches symptoms were due to wrong eating habits because even using acupuncture to balance the internal energy that was imbalanced, the wrong eating habits were inducing energy imbalances and causing headaches, even doing acupuncture sessions [14]. I would like to point out that the data presented in this study are the results of my daily practice, since it is not possible to find in the literature concrete sources relating diets and headaches, mainly in the fundamentals of traditional Chinese medicine and even in Western medicine. According to Western medicine, this relationship is often made at random, making changes in diets, but they cannot explain the reason for the improvement or worsening when eating a certain food [14]. That is why it is important to emphasize the importance of increasingly integrating Western and traditional Chinese medicines, as in this metaphor with the symbol of Yin and Yang, one representing the Western medicine (Yin energy) that is materialized energy and traditional Chinese medicine represents Yang energy that is non-materialized energy and it is shown in the Figure 16. Both medicines can work together to understand better how disease is formed in the deepest level, in the root of the tree (Figure 1), they are opposite but complementary [9] (Figure 16). Figure 16: Yin and Yang of metaphor of Western and traditional Chinese medicine. The author wants to emphasize that all the tools she used in the treatment of the patient reported in this article were recognized by Brazilian Federal Medical Council, such as acupuncture and homeopathy, since 1995 and 1980, respectively [22]. Conclusion The conclusion of this study is that there are some kinds of foods that can cause energy imbalances and induce headaches symptoms. To prevent the headache symptoms, it is important to understand which energy meridian is affected and leading to headaches symptoms and which kind of food should be inducing or maintaining the patients' symptoms. So, it is very important to understand the formation of headaches symptoms trough the energy point of view to understand deeply what could be happening in the formation of headache to understand deeply what could be done to prevent the formation of the majority of headaches symptoms nowadays.
