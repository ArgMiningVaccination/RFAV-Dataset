Homeopathy is a system of medicine that works on restoring the body to balance. Developed in Germany over 200 years ago, it is an extremely common treatment method worldwide. Homeopathy was developed by Samuel Hahnemann and uses the concept of \"like cures like\" or the law of similars. Medicines are prescribed in extremely dilute doses using the like cures like concept. If a patient comes in with a set of symptoms, a medicine is chosen that most closely matches the current symptoms. This medicine in large doses will cause the same symptoms in the patient, but in homeopathic (small) doses turns off the symptoms and restores balance. Is it safe? Homeopathy has been used for hundreds of years and is an extremely safe form of treatment. It does not interact with other treatments and is safe for people of all ages including infants and pregnant women. It is also one of the only alternative medicine therapies that is regulated by the FDA. Is there any research supporting homeopathy? There is an growing body of research supporting the use of homeopathy. However, many poorly conducted studies tend to get more coverage by a vocal subset of the scientific community and the media. While the number of high quality studies is growing, there still is positive evidence that homeopathy can effectively treat a wide variety of conditions. A site that I like to find out more about homeopathy research is the Homeopathy Research institute. A good place to start is their frequently asked question section to clear up any common confusion about homeopathy and homeopathic research. [Click here to read more from the Homeopathic Research Institute. ](https://www.hri-research.org/resources/homeopathy-faqs/) Are Naturopathic doctors and acupuncturists trained in homeopathy? Naturopathic doctors take many courses in homeopathy and commonly incorporate it into their practice. I worked on multiple clinical shifts focused specifically on homeopathy and used it as the only treatment method. [Oriental medicine providers](/traditional-chinese-medicine) in the state of Ohio are able to prescribe homeopathic remedies. Make sure to check in with your provider about their extent of homeopathic training. Are homeopathy and naturopathy the same thing? No. This is a very common question and a point of confusion for many people. Homeopathy and naturopathic medicine are separate yet related fields. [Naturopathic medicine](/naturopathic-wellness) is a multidisciplinary medical field that includes training in homeopathy, [botanical medicine](/botanical-medicine), naturopathic manipulation, nutrition, and natural supplementation. In some states naturopathic doctors can perform [acupuncture](/traditional-chinese-medicine), prescribe medication, perform IV's and injections, and perform minor surgery. Trained homeopaths focus solely on homeopathy. Where can I learn more about homeopathy? A great site to learn more is the National Center for Homeopathy. They have extensive information about homeopathy, specific remedies, history and more. [Click here to head over to the National Center for Homeopathy](http://www.homeopathycenter.org/).
