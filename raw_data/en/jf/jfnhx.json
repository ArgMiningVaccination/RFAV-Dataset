Females generally (due to gender roles) get much more practise at socialising then males do. Autism is generally diagnosed based upon a lack of social skills. Got social skills? Don't got autism... somehow. I mean heck if it's genetic then you still do, but under current diagnostics not if you have social skills. So if have autism but practise your social skills then you may not be diagnosed as autism. Females generally practise social skills more then guys so currently i'm not convinced there is an actual disparity in autism rates between the sexes. Instead I think it's more likely that there is just a disparity in social skill practise between the sexes. Really? Better social skills in females is protecting them from autism? How deep does this rabbit hole go? There is no way in hell that autism is all genetic in origin, nor is it some majorly disastrous change and shift in the gene pool. Not with all the endless evidence to the contrary! Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders - Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, United States, 2006. Interpretation: In 2006, on average, approximately 1% or one child in every 110 in the 11 ADDM sites was classified as having an ASD (approximate range: 1:80-1:240 children [males: 1:70; females: 1:315]). The average prevalence of ASDs identified among children aged 8 years increased 57% in 10 sites from the 2002 to the 2006 ADDM surveillance year. Although improved ascertainment accounts for some of the prevalence increases documented in the ADDM sites, a true increase in the risk for children to develop ASD symptoms cannot be ruled out. On average, although delays in identification persisted, ASDs were being diagnosed by community professionals at earlier ages in 2006 than in 2002.

Excerpt: We used data sets from Denmark, California, Japan, and a worldwide composite of studies. In the Danish, California, and worldwide data sets, we found that an increase in AD cumulative incidence began about 1988-1989. The Japanese study (1988-1996) had AD cumulative incidence increasing continuously, and no changepoint year could be calculated. Although the debate about the nature of increasing autism continues, the potential for this increase to be real and involve exogenous environmental stressors exists. The timing of an increase in autism incidence may help in screening for potential candidate environmental stressors.

Insanity. Curr Opin Neurol. 2010 Apr;23(2):103-10. Contributions of the environment and environmentally vulnerable physiology to autism spectrum disorders. Summary: Prevalence, genetic, exposure, and pathophysiological evidence all suggest a role for environmental factors in the inception and lifelong modulation of ASD. This supports the need for seeking targets for early and ongoing medical prevention and treatment of ASD. Participants diagnosed with an ASD had significantly increased levels of 5cxP, prcP, and cP in comparison to controls. No significant differences were found in non-Hg associated urinary porphyrins (uroporphyrins, hexacarboxyporphyrin, and heptacarboxyporphyrin). There was a significantly increased odds ratio for an ASD diagnosis relative to controls among study participants with precoproporphyrin (odds ratio = 15.5, P < 0.01) and coproporphyrin (odds ratio = 15.5, P < 0.01) levels in the second through fourth quartiles in comparison to the first quartile.

Toxicity disorder: a blinded study of urinary porphyrins. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the levels of Hg-toxicity-associated porphyrins are higher in children with an ASD diagnosis than controls. Although the pattern seen (increased 5cxP, prcP, and cP) is characteristic of Hg toxicity, the influence of other factors, such as genetics and other metals cannot be completely ruled out. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

Age-dependent lower or higher levels of hair mercury in autistic children than in healthy controls. Autistic children had a significantly greater prevalence of adverse reactions after vaccinations and abnormal development than controls. Between 45 and 80% of autistic children experienced developmental regress. Autistic children significantly differed from healthy peers in the concentrations of mercury in hair: younger autistics had lower levels, while older - higher levels than their respective controls. The results suggest that autistic children differ from healthy children in metabolism of mercury, which seems to change with age. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20628443](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20628443) Many vaccines still contain an allowed what is stated as a trace amount of mercury used during the manufacturing process, thats right, they take it back out, but never need verify it nor the actual level remaining. Aluminum in vaccines increases the toxicity of mercury. A load of vaccines and as well mercury in itself can reduce glutathione levels in the child, which is higly essential for detoxification of mercury, even small amounts. IAOMT Testosterone has been shown to increase the toxicity of mercury and thimerosal whereas estrogen has been shown to have a protective effect. Rose (attachment: Rose et al., 2008) suggests that children with autism who inherit the ALAD2 allele have lower glutathione levels and will be at increased risk for lead and mercury induced prenatal and postnatal developmental neurotoxicity due to the fact that glutathione is the natural molecule that binds and aids in the removal of mercury from the body. It is well known in the literature that exposure to mercury causes a rapid decrease in available glutathione.

CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible cyclical interaction between the methionine cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways in some children with ASDs. RESULTS: Significantly (p < 0.01) increased levels of serum/plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and serum total testosterone relative to the age- and sex-specific normal laboratory reference ranges were observed. Conversely, serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly (p < 0.01) decreased. Plasma-reduced glutathione (p < 0.01), plasma cysteine (p < 0.01), plasma methionine (p < 0.01), serum cystathionine (p < 0.05), and serum homocysteine (p < 0.01) were all significantly decreased.

Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk.

Dr. Healy was the first woman appointed head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), former professor of medicine at John Hopkins University, professor and dean of College of Medicine and Public Health at the Ohio State University and president of the American Red Cross. Dr Healy was recognised for her brilliance, wisdom, passion, loyalty, integrative thinking and willingness to help others. In the field of autism, she stood recognising the concerns raised by parents regarding the potential triggers of vaccines. \"I think public health officials have been too quick to dismiss the hypothesis (vaccines can trigger autism) as irrational without sufficient studies of causation.\" Please take a moment to listen to Dr. Healy on CBS expressing her concerns regarding vaccine safety and a potential link to autism. [http://autismtrust.org.uk/?p=1558](http://autismtrust.org.uk/?p=1558) Common sense. Is there more to Professor Simon Baron-Cohen than meets the eye? Excerpt: However this week the professor seems a little less sure of last weeks revelations. It is reported here that Professor Baron-Cohen now has this to say :- \"We know that autism is not 100% genetic in origin, since in the case of identical twins (who share 100% of their genes), there are instances of one twin having autism and the other not having it. In fact, the liklihood of the co twin also having autism where one of them has it (in monozygotic (MZ) pairs) is about 60%. This means that there must be some non-genetic (i.e enviromental) factors that are part of the cause of Autism.\" [http://www.cynthiajanak.com/20090131pro ... baron.html](http://www.cynthiajanak.com/20090131professorsimonbaron.html) It is not just one vaccine nor one vaccine ingredient causing all vaccine induced autism, nor is it just one bio-medical treatment protocol that works for all cases. Diet changes, heavy metal detox, and antiviral detox; one of all three have been know to have worked. Ask, why are they so reluctant to consider nor believe it is the vaccines? The answers can only come from unbiased and full review of all the information! Nothing left off limits.
