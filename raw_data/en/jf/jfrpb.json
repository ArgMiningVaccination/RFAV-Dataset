However, Na-Zhi method only use the combination of 12 meridians theory and 12 Chinese-hour theory, making itself less used in the clinic. On the other band, when 12 Chinese-hour theory, Ren-Du meridian theory and 12 Xiao-Xi hexagram theory they all combined into one system, namely 12 Xiao-Xi hexagram acupuncture therapy , its clinical indication is expanded. 12 Xiao-Xi hexagram acupuncture therapy include hexagram, timing, meridians, organs and local acu-sites into a single system, indicating a more universal application .

Integration in Action: Acupuncture's Impact on Stroke Rehabilitation by Claudia Citkovitz 1 Thursday, October 27, 9:00-9:50 am CEU/PDA Patients recovering from stroke show a staggering variety of symptoms, from disabling motor and speech deficits to subtle perceptual and emotional changes. Acupuncture can help greatly, but many practitioners are unable to treat patients and loved ones acutely due to doctors' concerns (or their own). In this class, Citkovitz demystifies the potentially intimidating interface between East Asian and Western med ical diagnosis and treatment. Drawing on her recent PhD research, she explores questions such as: how can we feasibly incorporate acupunct ure into post-stroke care, and what effects should we expect in which patients? Which arguments regarding safety and efficacy will be most persuasive to physicians? How soon shou ld we treat, how often, and how can we make treatment financially workable for elderly patients on a fixed income? Acupuncture Therapy and Changing National Policy: 'Evidence-Informed Non-Pharmacologic Strategy' for Pain and the Opioid Arya Nielsen ccJ,\u00b0\" Thursday , October 27, 9:55- 10:45 am In 1999, the Veterans Administration declared pain the 'fifth vital sign'; in 2000 the Joint Commission created a pain mandate that required patients to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10 and be involved in a strategy to manage that pain. Pharmaceutical companies overrepresented the need for opioids and misrepresented time release opioids as non-addictive. By 2008, an American was as likely to die from a prescription opioid overdose as either suicide or a motor vehicle accident. The CDC has declared an opioid epidemic in the US. This talk will describe how a national pain policy set the stage for the opioid epidemic and now how evidence for nonpharmacologi c therapies has led to a change in national policy by the Joint Commission, clarifying that non-pharm therapies , including acupuncture therapy, are viable options in the treatmen t of pain. Insomnia and the Modern World: The Impact of a Modern Lifestyle on Sleep by Hamid Montakab cEJ,A Thursday, Octobe~ 0 Sleep is a necessity, and a third of our lives is spent sleeping. Sleep disorders of all kinds, insomnia in particular, are rapidly becoming a concern in modern industrialized societies, now affecting 30 to 40% of the population. Inadequate treatment of insomnia can easily transform someone who occasionally sleeps poorly into a chronic insomniac who, quite often, w ill become dependent on the regular use of .medication. This lecture will analyze the primary causes of insomnia from the perspective of wei-defensive qi, blood, yin, and shen-mind. The detrimental effects that modern lifestyles have on these substances, and ..the subsequent consequences for sleep, producing insomnia, dream disturbances , and various types of parasomnia and sleep apnea, will be examined. Therapeutic guidelines will also be explored. Priorities and Treatment for Acute and Chronic Stroke by Claudia Citkovitz rn~\u00b0\" Thursday, October 27, 2:00\u00b75:00 pm In this course, students will learn how to use a manual for systematically assessing and prioritizing the multiple overlapping 'patterns of disharmony' that commonl y present in acute and chronic stroke care. Developed for both research and clinical work, the manual provides for practitioner discretion within an evidence-i nformed structure that allows multiple acupunct urists to provide a consistent, cohesive, and personally appropriate plan of care. Guide\\ines for prioritized assessment and treatment include: blood pressure, cognitive function, retention or incontinence of bowels ancVor urine, constitutional factors such as phlegm, blood stasis, 3 Thursday, Ocl CEU/POA Proper sleep is indispE rhythm, is an excellen and depth of sleep are analysis reflects upon primarily categorized has been proposed fro is important to adapt ti lecture will present a t the extraordinary vcssc Acupuncture The Research and Ch. 3cwiPoA Thursday, Oct Acupunctur e therapv 1s done to make integratl\\ This talk will discuss th to make acupunctu re ti pain, accessible to und\u00b7 The 60-Year Cyd by Wendy Go/elm cE~oA Thursday, Oct1 2016 is the Year of the and affects all of us, si organs, emotions, and heaven and earth qi ic people during each tir what herbs we will ne and year.

The sleep/wake cycle, as the most important human circadian rhythm, is an excellent indicator of the Internal equilibrium and of health. In a state of health, the length and depth of sleep are adapted to activity by internal \"synchronizers\", the \"extraordinary vessels\". Sleep analysis reflects upon the internal balance of the five substances and the ten organs. Insomnia has been primarily categorized in TCM based on zang-fu and substance disharmony patterns, but no classification has been proposed from a classical Chinese acupuncture perspective. For the best therapeutic results, it is important to adapt the acupuncture protocol to each person and to the disturbed segment of sleep. This lecture w ill present a brief review of sleep physiology and structure from a channel perspective, the role of the extraordinary vessels, discussion about diagnosis, and treatment protocols based on the channel system. Acupuncture Therapy for Pain In Underserved Populations: Strategy, Research and Challenges by Arya Nielsen m~DA Thursday, October 27, 2:00-5:00 pm Acupuncture therapy is sometimes considered accessible only to patients with means. What work is being done to make integrative medicine, 'evidence informed non-pharmacologic therapies', accessible to the poor?

The 60-Year Cycle: Understanding the Qi of the Year and its Clinical Implications by Wendy Goldman cE~oA Thursday , October 27, 2:00-5:00 pm 2016 is the Year of the Fire Monkey. What exactly does that mean? The energy of every year is different and affects all of us, since it represents the energies of heaven and earth. It influences weather, internal organs, emotions, and health. By understan ding the 60-year cycle, and the interactions between heaven and earth qi for any given year or season, we know what kinds of health conditions will affect people during each time period and are thus better prepared to treat our patients. We can easily know what herbs we will need, and which patients will have more potential health problems in each season and year. Students will learn the basic energetic implications on health of any given year, season, and month, and how to prepare, adjust treatment plans, and educate patients about prevention issues ior the year and the season. \u00b7Enhancing Life with Chinese Medicine by Greg Bantick cE~DA Thursday, October 27, 2:00-5:00 pm Clinic practice often focuses on treating disease and distress, but our medicine also offers insight into understand ing and appreciat ing our lives more fully. It can help our patients and ourselves identify and cultivate positive states. Ease, satisfaction, contentment, a clear sense of direction, kindness, knowing our needs, and healthy relationships all arise out of a friendly, kind, and curious relationship with suffering. This course is a practical exploration using detailed case histories, from initial meeting and diagnosis to the prescription of points, herbs, diet, lifestyle suggestions, and follow-ups. Students will review early textual ideas on how all states, moods, and symptoms arise from causes and conditions . Practitioners are often good at seeing the conditions leading to patients' symptoms, but they can use the same skills to see the conditions more likely to lead to positive moods and symptoms. Students w ill review how their inner states, beliefs, and worldviews may condition their patient-practitioner relationships , and how clinics and business practices are themselves conditions that influence their work that can lead to more effective and satisfying clinic work. The Diagnostics of Classical Five Element Acupun cture by Neil Gumenick rn:tA Friday, October 28, 9:~\u00b79:50am This one-hour course will introduce the concept of Causative Factor: the primar y elemental imbalance with which every human being is born. This imbalance is the root cause of a patient's physical, mental , and spiritual problems and becomes the focus of treatment in this system of medicine. You will learn the diagnostic correspondences of each of the Five Elements and how, by assessing the patient's odor, color , sound, and emot ion, the Causative Factor is identified and treated. In this way, symptoms at every level are healed naturally-from the inside out. Simplifi ed Pulse and Tongue Diagnosis for All GI Pattern s by Jake Fratkin 1 Friday, October 28, 9:55-10 :45 am CEUI PDA The relationship between liver, stomach , and spleen determines almost all gastroin testina l disorders.

In this short presentation, Fratkin will share his 38 years of clinica l experience to show how to accurately differentiate the various patterns causing conditions such as acid reflux, nausea, irritable bowe l syndrome, abdom inal distension , weight problems, constipa tion, and diarrhea. Accurate differentiatio n leads to the correct choice of herbal ingredients or formu las. The secre t is in understanding the energetic relationshi ps of liver, stomach, and spleen. An Introduct ion to the Concept of Chrono-H erbalism of the Shang Han lun by Arnaud Versluys 1 Friday, October 28, 11:10 am-12:00 pm CEU/PDA This course will continue to build on Versluys' Symposium workshop from last year, expanding upon the topic of chrono-herba l medicine: a way of understa nding the conformations and the formulas that rectify their imbalances, from the perspect ive of times of the day and the year, with the Shang Han Lun as a primer.

Fire and Ice by Matt Callison cijPoA Saturday, October 29, 9:00-9:50 am Cold and heat therapy are probably the most commonly applied therapeutic modalities for injury rehabilitation, and whethe r to use cold or heat is a topic of ongoing debate . There are widely divergent opinions on whether or not to use ice, or cryotherapy, in the treatment of musculoskeletal injury, and some would even say that cold therapy should not be used at all. Historically, there is no preced ent in TCM theor y for the use of ice to treat musculoskeletal injury. Fortunately, an understanding ofTCM princip les provides the basis for making a more informed choice on whether to use cold or heat therapy for a particu lar injury . Callison will discuss how to choose between cold and heat therapy , based on a combination of traditional theory and modern research about the stages of tissue healing.

Many practitioners may be unaware that, for example, a chronic knee problem or frozen shoulder in a 35-year-old patient may have a strong connection to a simple surgery that the patient had as a young child. Using KMS acupuncture, attendees will learn how to differentiate between healed and unhealed scars and some of the most common symptoms associated with those surgical procedures. Strategies for treatment will give practitioners the ability to improve their clinical outcomes and provide their patients with longer lasting relief from their symptomatic presentation. KMS acupuncture strategies for scars are often crucial in solving particularly stubborn cases. The Anatomy of the Sinew Channels (Jingjin) by Matt Callison and Brian Lau 3 October 29, 2:00-5:00 pmCEU/POA /' The sinew channels (jingjin) were first described in the Nei Jing Ling Shu. Most of the descriptions for the jiingjin trajectories are vague and there have been very few new ideas about these descriptions since they were originally written. This course_will give an analysis of the sinew channels based on their classical descriptions, expanded with current information from fascia! research and functional anatomy. Offering this unique perspective, Callison and Lau will discuss common musculoskeletal injuries and demonstrate how students can diagnose and treat these injuries using the sinew channels.

The Essentials of Treating Common Scars Using Kiiko Matsumoto Style (KMS) Acupuncture by Monica Kobylecka 3 Saturday, October 29, 2:00-5:00 pm CEU/ POA Appendix and gallbladder scars are not only very common, they are also very useful as clues to the patient's underlying constitutional weakness . KMS acupuncture recognizes that supporting this weakness through treatment results in a much more successful and longer lasting treatment compared to treating symptoms alone. Students will learn how to diagnose and treat the constitutional weakness of patients with an appendicitis or gallbladder surgery history and unlock the path to treating everything from digestive problems to fertility issues and pain. Liu Family Tui Na: an Introduction to the Unique Arts and Techniques by Dong Ji 3 Saturday, October 29, 2:00-5:00 pm CEUIPOA Master Liu began his tui na training from his Sifu, Master Li Xinmin, in Shanghai , whose family has been serving in the Emperor's court for generations as doctors for the royal family. Master Li Xinmin had only seven students, each specializing in one subject, such as tui na, acupuncture, or herbal medicine. Master Liu's tui na training is different from those of the modern school system, but closer to the traditional lineage: the techniques focus on (1) \"touching tendon\" techniques, (2) painless therapy, which is contrary to many other massage therapists who emphasize the mantra of \"no pains, no gains\", (3) therapists' internal training, including the therapist's sensitivity to the qi condition of the patient and the ability to work accurately on the different layers of the body, and (4) the ability to use the mind intention.

Sexual Behavior, Practices, and TCM for Fertility by Felice Dunas 1 Sunday, October 30, 11 :10 am\u00b712:00 pm CIU 1'04 At its core, the human body's purpose is to recreate its species. When someone faces a fate as the end of a genetic line due to infertility, that person goes through deep, primitive changes. As a result, infertile individuals and couples may inadvertently live and love in ways that inhibit their most heartfelt dreams from being realized. TCM has a long history of addressing the complexity of infertility, including its effects on all aspects of self: spirit, emotion, thought, health, and behavior. In this course, Dunas will explore a unique perspective of infertility care, including behavioral patterns commonly seen in infertile individuals and couples, as well as which qi and organ syndromes are involved and why. She will also briefly detail the history ofTCM's views of and practices for sexuality and fertility. Dunas will explore how love, relationship s, and sex affect, and are affected by the struggle to conceive. She will elaborate on how TCM theoretical structures can be used to explain behavior patterns within and between infertile patterns. Dunas will expand upon the morning presentat ion about sex, its improper use as an exacerbating agent, and its appropriate use as a healing agent in the infertility process. Students should bring difficult cases to class; case studies from those in attendance will form the basis of a group conversation regarding best practices. Students will learn how to use their diagnostic skills to understand how patients' romantic lifestyles may have contributed to their conception problems and how their behavior. both in and out of the bedroom, can heal them. Learn how to address delicate topics in the treatment room without violating patient privacy or professional ethic~. -~ ;1\u00b7 Advanced Acupuncture Techniques: Warming and Cooling ~y Biao Lu 3 Sunday, October 30, 2:00-5:00 pmCEU/PCM 50 Exl The arrival of the qi is the most important step in increasing clinical therapy results.

Chronic Conditions and the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex by Kiiko Matsumoto 3 Sunday, October pmCEU/PCM Matsumoto explains and demonstrates key shaoyang scalp points that can be used to treat weakness of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). The DLPFC begins to weaken as a condition becomes chronic or due to a threatening situation (shock/trauma). This has important implications for a variety of stubborn, chronic conditions commonly seen in the acupuncture clinic, including chronic pain, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, RSD/CRPS, sympathetic dominance, and chronic digestive issues. A variety of other Kiiko Matsumoto style strategies will also be demonstrated and explained during live demonstrations. Heart-Brain Harmonics: The Ko Cycle's Water-Fire Relationship I n Our Well-Being by David Ford 3 Sunday, October 30, 2:00-5:00 pmCEU/PDA Ford will examine the dynamic relationships between the heart-fire organs (heart, small intestine, pericardium, triple warmer) and brain-water organs (bladder, kidney), their roles in health and well-being, and their intimate guidance in all aspects of physical and mental optimization. The course will examine how leading-edge Western medical science findings are confirming ancient knowledge and how Five-Elements' visual and nature-centric cartography provides the map to maintain the harmony and balance necessary to face life's daily surprises. Ford will also examine the ko cycle's role in what he has coined the body-mind-spirit-soul 's \"evolutionary cosmological journey\" through life. Simple, easy to understan d point combinat ions and insights into the use of the \"spirits of the points\" for mental and physical well-being will be shared.
