Or, less pleasantly, it means phlegm (think of \"kaph\" as \"cough\"). Kapha is the Ayurvedic constitution made up of earth and water elements. In nature, when earth and water mix, you get mud. When these elements mix in the body, you get excessive mucus production from the intestinal and respiratory mucus membranes. The good news is that this production is a way nature compensates for the excessive dryness of winter (if you live in temperate or non-equatorial regions). The kapha energy of spring helps to balance out the excessive [vata](https://lifespa.com/vata-ayurvedic-constitution/) energy of late winter. Kapha accumulates in nature and the body from March through June. But too much can cause fatigue, depression, congestion, compromised immunity, and the tendency to gain weight or hold water.

Foods that Balance Kapha There are three tastes that predominate in the spring harvest that balance excess kapha. These are bitter, astringent, and pungent. Foods with these tastes are often fiber-rich. Think dandelion, burdock, turmeric, and ginger roots, or spring greens.

Herbs that Balance Kapha In Ayurveda, certain herbs can balance kapha, too, while also helping to repopulate your gut with microbes that are appropriate for spring (yes, microbes are seasonal). Microbes that surge in the spring, such as Bacteroidetes, are known to help digest high-fiber foods that are more abundant in the spring harvest. At LifeSpa, we recommend four evidence-based herbs to help navigate spring without excess kapha accumulation. 1. Mucus Destroyer: To Soothe the Mucus Membranes and Fight Congestion [Mucus Destroyer](https://store.lifespa.com/product/mucus-destroyer-capsules/) is primarily made of a respiratory herbal churna (powder) called sitopladi. Sitopladi balances kapha (remember, phlegm) and vata, which causes the underlying dryness of the respiratory mucosa that can aggravate and cause reactive mucus production. Sitopladi is a unique combination of cane sugar, a type of bamboo called banslochan (Bambusa arundinacea), long pepper, and cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia). Its ingredients support both a dry or wet cough. Sitopladi has also been found to support respiratory immunity while providing antioxidant protection. We add turmeric, ginger, and black pepper to the sitopladi, to deliver more of the kapha-balancing tastes of pungent, bitter, and astringent. Ginger and pepper also act as natural bio-enhancers to boost the effectiveness of the sitopladi and drive it more deeply into respiratory tissues.

Tulsi Holy Basil: an Added Immunity Boost [Tulsi Holy Basil](https://store.lifespa.com/product/tulsi-holy-basil-capsules/) (Ocimun sanctum) is a pungent and heating herb that also balances both kapha and vata. Remember, the most common cause of aggravated kapha or excess springtime congestion is the dryness of vata. A harsh winter can excessively dry out the mucus membranes in your lungs and intestines, and that can lead to excessive mucus production. Tulsi is unique because it powerfully and effectively balances kapha and vata while supporting healthy immunity. In a 2017 meta-analysis published in the journal of [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376420/), researchers found that tulsi repeatedly supported a healthy immune response by supporting the healthy production of natural killer and T-helper cells. Research has also suggested that tulsi supports less fatigue and healthy breathing levels, as measured by VO2 Max. Earlier [studies](https://lifespa.com/tulsi-immunity/) found that in addition to supporting a healthy immune response and helping to manage seasonal respiratory symptoms, tulsi also had a powerful effect on mood. It promoted calmness, clarity, and stamina. [Learn more about LifeSpa's Whole Herbs Tulsi Holy Basil.](https://store.lifespa.com/product/tulsi-holy-basil-capsules/) 3. Aller-Rest: For Seasonal Sinus Support [Aller-Rest](https://store.lifespa.com/product/aller-rest/) provides fast-acting, natural support for immune reactions, including watery, itchy eyes and a runny nose, as well as other manifestations of histamine release. Formulated with a synergistic combination of vitamin C, bioflavonoids (Quescetin, rutin), amino acids, herbs, and bromelain, [Aller-Rest](https://store.lifespa.com/product/aller-rest/) addresses distressing signs of immune hypersensitivity. Vitamin C, or asorbic acid, is a kapha-balancing antioxidant and may play a role in deactivating histamine responses. Bioflavonoids, including quercetin and rutin, are active kapha-reducing agents. They protect your tissues from the negative effects of hyperimmune reactions, including oxidation and inflammation. N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) is the acetylated form of the essential amino acid L-cysteine. As a precursor to the \"master antioxidant\" glutathione, NAC plays a significant role in detoxification and antioxidant protection. NAC also reduces the viscosity of the mucus commonly produced during a hyperimmune response. Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) extract has been found to regulate a variety of inflammatory activities associated with hyperimmune response, including mast-cell degranulation, prostaglandin formation, and histamine action. Bromelain refers to an enzyme complex extracted from the stem and fruit of the pineapple plant (Ananas comosus). Research suggests it can help modulate an inflammatory response.

Guggul Lean: For Supporting Healthy Fat Metabolism Lean](https://store.lifespa.com/product/guggul-lean-capsules/) is (Piper nigrum). Each of these herbs balance kapha in their own way. In Ayurveda, guggul is considered to be the most powerful remedy for the buildup of ama, an Ayurvedic term for undigested metabolic waste. [Studies](https://lifespa.com/guggul-gallbladder/) illustrate guggul's positive effect on healthy cholesterol levels, thyroid function, fat metabolism, and liver and gallbladder function. In one [study](https://store.lifespa.com/product/guggul-lean-capsules/), individuals taking 50mg of a guggul extract, in addition to a fruit- and vegetable-enriched diet, saw a 12 percent decrease in triglycerides and a 33 percent reduction in lipid peroxidation, an indicator of oxidative stress, compared to no changes in the placebo group. Arjuna is Ayurveda's primary heart health herb. This reddish tree bark has powerful antioxidants that support microcirculation and lymph drainage for the heart and cardiovascular system. (Amalaki has similar benefits.) Turmeric helps to liquify mucus congestion. While [shilajit](https://store.lifespa.com/product/regenerate-shilajit-capsules/), with its high concentration of humic and fulvic acids, acts as a powerful kapha-detoxification agent.
