He described it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe .

The legend seems to point to the possibility that man, through wise and compassionate work with the Earth, can one day regain on a new level what was lost when the Age of Gold was supplanted by those of Silver , Bronze and Iron. T echnology could serve this aim; instead of endangering our planet's life, it could help to make the Earth a new Sun.E d i t o r i a l N o t e s W .

T oday, more even than then, one is struck by the contrast of the rapid dissolution of the Soviet Union on the one hand and the gradual forging of a European Union on the other. Many of the heels being dug in in the latter process are Anglo-Saxon ones and it is clear that the emergence of a united Europe \u2014 not merely in an economic or political sense but united increasingly by an awareness of its cultural mission, as indicated in these pages last year \u2014 will require considerable modifications to the attitudes prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon West which have historically reflected the tacit assumption of a leading role in the world. In this issue, therefore, we look from various points of view at how the sense of mission felt in the West could still provide the basis for a positive contribution to developing humanity and indeed a positive atti tude to developments in Europe and the East. In the lecture by Dr. Virginia Sease we nd emphasised the features of America which are oriented towards goals of humanity which lie far in the future, though they may seem problematic at present \u2014 namely , the culture of the freedom of the individual, particularly in the area of rights, the way in which it is becoming a melting-pot of the races and the mastery of the economic life with its attendant materialism, the latter providing a foundation for what Rudolf Steiner enigmatically describes as a more \"instinctive spirituality\". There follow two contributions by the editors, dealing with some surprising aspects of the English language \u2014 a world language on the one hand, with the largest vocabulary and the most rapid rate of change and yet, at the same time, one which is showing the strongest tendency to decline as a language. The one presents the opportunity to see through the peculiarities of usage to the character of the Folk-Souls in different countries, and the other suggests how aspects of the language serve the ego in the Consciousness Soul Epoch. In a thought-provoking piece on the destiny of Caspar Hauser, seen as linked to that of Europe, Peter Tradowsky shows how the intervention of Lord Stanhope pregures in an English gesture the strength of the opposition to Europe's mission which was later \u2014 and so much more dramatically \u2014 revealed in the figure of Adolf Hitler. Dr . Jenny Josephson follows her study of the Heart and Lungs in last year's issue with a piece on Breathing and Circulation in which the reader is invited to begin to understand this middle realm of our constitution in much more that purely physical terms without becoming mystical orsentimental in doing so. One is helped to see more specically why , in the refounding of the Anthroposophical Society in 1923/24, Rudolf Steiner so emphasised that the Foundation Stone was being laid in the hearts of those present and in their harmonious working together. There are reasons why this now world-wide movement took shape initially in Europe. Focussing more narrowly to the stresses and strains of the approach ing turn of the century. Dr. Jenny Josephson draws attention to three, as yet too-little known, meditations given by Rudolf Steiner in a course of lectures to the wives and friends at the rst Goetheanum of those who had been called up to ght in the rst World War. We conclude with a remarkable study of Shelley's Prometheus Unbound by Dr. Andrew Welbum, in which the rapidly-changing Europe of Shelley's time is contrasted with that of our own, but showing how Shelley's perception of the way forward as lying through an understanding of \"the mystery within\" is, if anything, more relevant now than it was then. W.F.7 T H E S P I R I T U A L C O N T R I B U T I O N O F T H E W E S T Virginia Sease If we look at the events of the last few decades, we can say that the West has played its part in them politically, socially and militarily. How this is valued is, of course, a matter of personal opinion. One can however ask oneself the question: \"Has the West also made its contribution spiritually?\". This is a question which many have today . Before 1914 one would probably not have asked such a question, for the answer was already there. We might think of Goethe's words, which, whilst written by him, represent a view which was widely held in his time. He wrote, in 1826: America, you fare better Than our continent, so aged. You have no crumbling castles And no basalt. You are not inwardly troubled In your life. By useless memories And vain strife. and continued in this vein about the good fortune of America. Now a moment ago we took America to be synonymous with the West. England, one might say , also belongs to the West, and of course it does, only today we nd ourselves in a situation where our perspective of the western world is changing. About a quarter of a century ago England was seen by other Europeans as being absolutely a part of the West. Not so much even western Europe as the West. The water was a great divide. Now we are faced with a situation where England is being brought into the European community , is indeed already a part of the European community. The stretch of water between England and the continent no longer seems so important as it was. From the American perspective it looks quite different, perhaps it still does even from the English point of view, since not all Englishmen are ready to say: \"Yes, we are denitely a part of Europe\". From America's point of view England was always more part of Europe, quite simply because of the distance involved: America to England, America to Holland is much the same when distances are compared. Now that, from a European point of view, England is seen as more European,8 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2THE SPIRITUAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE WEST9 America feels itself to be the West more even than before. For this reason our references today to the western world will almost invariably mean North America. In one respect only will England be included, namely when we are concerned with the language. America does indeed think of itself as the West culturally but is now also in a position to experience itself as a kind of middle. This was never previously the case and would not have been so 100 or even 50 years ago, but now , with the flourishing of Japanese culture, with the build-up of power there, America can feel itself to be between Asia in the W est and Europe in the East. This is, however , a dimension we shall not concern ourselves with today . We shall rather continue to refer to North America as the Western World. Rudolf Steiner always insisted that America should really be in- eluded when one spoke of Europe. He spoke of Europe and its American appendage. America would perhaps not care to be thought of as an appendage but Rudolf Steiner did speak of this continent in this way when dealing with questions relating to Europe. W e can see that the history ofAmerica is fairly recent. We shall not concern ourselves today with its more ancient origins, with the Atlantean period, nor with the American Indians, but will rather focus on the arrival of the white settlers about 400 years ago. Four hundred years takes us back a little before the 30 Y ears W ar , so we are really talking about modem history . It truly is modern history also in the sense that it begins with the fth post-Atlantean cultural e p o c h . F o r e v e r y E u r o p e a n w h o f o u n d h i s w a y t o A m e r i c a , f r o m t h e e a r l y days right up to, say , the middle of this century , the rst experience of thiscontinent was an experience of the abyss. Just try to picture to yourselvesf o r a m o m e n t h o w i t w a s u p u n t i l a b o u t 5 0 y e a r s a g o . B e t w e e n A m e r i c a a n d Europe lies the great ocean. That meant several weeks, months, at sea, separated from everything that one knew , from all social connections, biographical connections, everything one previously experienced as real ity . Such an experience of the abyss must have brought about a transformation so that the white people who had left Europe arrived changed by t h i s e x p e r i e n c e . S o i t m u s t a l s o h a v e b e e n f o r t h e o t h e r s w h o c ^ e o v e r i n earlier times, for the slaves who were shipped over from Africa: a lot of w a t e r , m a n y w e e k s a n d q u i t e s i m p l y a b r e a k w i t h e v e r y t h i n g t h e y h a d previously known. These two images must always be kept in mind whenone thinks of North America and its people: the white Europeans and at about the same time, a few decades laterin the 17th century , the arrival of the rst black immigrants, the black slaves. This experience of the abyss which everyone had who came to America (and one hears that people still do) is like a threshold experience, not only in the sense that one has left everything behind, but also in that one nds oneself in a quite new situationon this continent. Not only is the natural environment different from backat home in Europe \u2014 the mountains, rivers, plants \u2014 but also the human social environment\u2014no kings, for example. Above all, the spirituality of nature there is different, as anyone will notice who visits America: the natural spirituality which is bound up with the earth forces. In our century Rudolf Steiner was the rst to point out that the earth forces on this continent, the electric, magnetic forces which are so strong here, also play a strong part in the country's destiny, in the destiny of its people, since just these forces, which he describes as those of the geographic double,' also have a strong effect on the will and the intelligence of the people living there. I do not intend to go into these forces of the double or' Doppelganger' today but would like to mention in this connection that there is now a new edition of Karl Stegmann's book \"Das andere Amerika\", published by Verlag am Goetheanum, in which these matters, the forces of the double and their effects in America, are dealt with very clearly. We may see that in every part of the earth the different types of ether work together. Of course each type is to be found in every part of the world but it is also the case that in each area one type of ether is dominant.^ If we take a closer look at the ether types as they nd their expression in the four elements we discover something quite remarkable about this gulf, as it were, between America and Europe. This gulf is by no means only the ocean. The ether type predominant in western Europe, England, and even stretching across to the edge of North America, Newfoundland, is the chemical ether which is borne by the fluid, watery element. This type is dominant right across to the east of Europe. Then it is the light ether which is predominant, borne by the air through central Russia. Then from Russia far across to Asia, Japan, back round via Hawaii to the west coast of America, California, Oregon, Washington, Canada, the warmth ether, borne by the element of re. Thus there are the dominant ether types in various parts of the world. Now in Europe we can see that three ether types are strongly represented. The chemical, light and re ethers. What is not so strongly represented, though naturally present of course, is the life ether. And it is the life ether which is the dominant one in America, with the exception of the west coast (warmth ether) and the corner of Newfound land (chemical ether). The life ether is borne by the element of earth. Thus America has a certain uniformity with regard to its ether type. This is a second peculiarity. The rst is the effect of its natural spirituality through the double and the second the influence of the life ether. Both may thus be said to be characteristic of the West. Now with the exception of the Red Indian race, America has only been 1 Cf. Rudolf Steiner, OA 178.

And if one considers how long one normally spends in the spiritual world between death and a new life, as Rudolf Steiner describes it, it is quite a long time. During this time one makes certain decisions in the spiritual world, one ofthem being in which country one will be bom, for a variety of reasons, including karmic relations one wishes to acquire by means of the countryitself. For the rst people who played a signicant role in American culture the decision to incarnate there was one which was, one might say , a bit of a last minute one in the spiritual world. Let us take, for instance, Benjamin Franklin, undoubtedly one of the most important people the world has ever known. He incarnated just a hundred years after it became at all possible to have an incarnation in America as a white person \u2014 an important decision then taken shortly before the moment of incarnation. We thus have to deal with a mystery connected with numbers. The number of incarnation possibilities in relation to incarnation rhythms. We also see that a certain polarity developed on this continent. There are, on the one hand, the people who decided before birth to be bom in America, which means that they took on this particular type of geographic double immediately before birth, and on the other , those who came over as immigrants. They , of course, also have the geographic double, as do all human beings (this is not just an advantage or disadvantage enjoyed by the Americans) but it is nevertheless the case that the double works particularly strongly in America. Thus we have the polarity from a Karmic point of view of those who were bom in America and those who came as immigrants from Europe. One could agree there is nothing special in this. It happens every day . There are people who are bom somewhere and others who move there later . That is quite correct. The important point here is that in America this possibility has only existed for a few centuries and that means that certain intentions behind ttiese decisions were formed already before birth. These mysteries also are linked to a different polarity which is very strong in America and that is the black/white one. The immigration of the slaves, Ae black people, began at virtually the same time and was very much a reality throughout the 19th century . It is still the case in America that when peopletalk of their ancestors, they say: \"Oh yes, I am German\" (or French) or \"I am English\" (or Dutch) even though the ancestors involved came over 300 years ago. There is still a strong feeling for one's European ancestry , at least subconsciously so. This also affects the racial question.For non-Americans, however , America is thought of primarily as the land of the melting pot. Now what exactly happens in a melting-pot? Everything comes together , everything is dissolved a little and somethinguniform emerges. It is really a kind of alchemy. It was indeed the alchemists who perfected the melting-pot. In America this melting-pot isquite perfected, by no means only in a manner of speaking, for there is something very substantial behind this from a spiritual point of view. This morning we heard from Sergei Prokoeff about the Folk-Spirits of Europe and how, particularly in the West, they care for their allotted peoples, uniting themselves with them. If we then look across to North America, we see that, as was clearly described by Rudolf Steiner in his lectures on the Folk-Souls,' there is a quite different spiritual conguration. One cannot speak of an American Folk-Spirit. On the contrary, one observes that the various ethnic groups always keep their own characteristics, some for a while, others much longer, before intermingling and becoming one people in which there is found a variety of colours, soul-colours of course, and a multitude of different cultures. What is happening here? America has no Folk-Spirit of its own, as Rudolf Steiner remarks, but rather a higher hierarchical being, a retarded Archai. Retarded should not be taken in this context to mean in any way inferior, we are not speaking of a child having to catch up a year at school. Retarded here means toat the Archai renounced a step in its development because an important task needed to be taken up. The Archai which rules over North America is a powerful spiritual being which has remained a spirit of personality instead of progressing to be a spirit of form. It is such a being that makes it possible for the peculiarities of the various peoples, their characteristics, to be evened out. This really is an alchemical process and one can experience this strongly when one gets to know the American people more deeply. A certain quality of soul goes with this process. This quality of soul has been predominant through out all the centuries of America's existence. You may be siuprised to hear me say that this quality is one of tolerance. It may not immediately appear to be the case when one thinks, for instance, of the racial problems and the poverty. One might well ask what those have to do with tolerance, and yet there is something flowing through like a stream and it is perhaps the most Christian quality of this continent. Christian in the sense that Rudolf Steiner speaks of when he describes the words of Christ to mankind today, namely that we should value what even the least of our brethren thinks and should treat this thinking as if Christ were present in it.\"* Now of course this idea is not one which is consciously held in North America, by no means so, but the feeling of tolerance towards each individual's way of thinking is so strongly present that the American at least will somehow have a guilty t:onscience if he feels himself to be intolerant. It lives in this deeper layer of the soul as a point of conscience. It is perhaps also for this reason that 3 OA 121. Oslo, 7 to 17 June, 1910 4 Cf.

It is quite clear that there is no unifying element in Europe, neither in the ether type on the one hand, nor in the work of a retarded Archai, so to speak. Later in the course of America's development two events of decisive importance occurred decisive in their spiritual dimension, not only for America but for the whole world. If we look back 200 years we see how America fought for freedom. Outwardly this freedom was freedom from England, freedom to shape its own destiny as the United States of America. For the moment I shall focus on the U.S. and leave Canada to one side, so to speak.

W e s e e h e r ea very interesting situation. Rudolf Steiner mentions that it was not actually until the 19th century that individualities were bom whose last incarnation was not in the Fourth Epoch, that is, who had already had one incarnationin the Fifth Epoch. The group of people who played a decisive role in this W ar of Independence towards the end of 1776 was a group which had p r o b a b l y h a d i t s l a s t s t r o n g i n c a r n a t i o n i n t h e F o u r t h E p o c h , i n t h e G r a e c o -Roman cultural epoch. W e are thinking of this small destiny-conguration of people who decided to incarnate in America. You know the names: BenjaminFranklin, George W ashington, Alexander Hamilton, John QuinceyAdams.

They reached an agreement in the spiritual world to enableTHE SPIRITUAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE WEST 13 them to overcome the retarding forces of the Fourth Cultural Epoch. There were secrets of life and death at play here and we have only to hear the opening words of the Declaration of Independence to get a feel for the spiritthat inspired it, not just in connection with North America, not merely as a political declaration of independence, but as a declaration that proceeds from the Spiritual worlds: \"We hold these tmths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To serve these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of govem- ment becomes destructive of these acts, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government\". This declaration was really the foundation for the new world order which was to come, not for the U.S., but for the whole of mankind and when, today , we hear so much about the New World Order , Novus Ordo Seculonm,this has often very little to do with these words which stand as a milestone on the road to the liberation of the human spirit just in this early period of the Fifth Cultiural Epoch. The second event which was to prove of decisive importance over in North America but also had a representative value for the whole world, was the abolition of slavery . Not merely in the narrow sense that it was declared that people may no longer have slaves but in the wider sense of its recognition of the individuality of each human being. This brings us into thedimension of good overcoming evil, evil being transformed by the good. This can only take place through the efforts of individuals. Individualities who come together as free individualities in free association and who must remain free in order to be able to carry out such a task. Thus the Civil War was fought, a bloody war as every civil war is (we can see in recent events just how bloody and inhuman) and as a last step in this war came the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln. Of course things did not change from one day to the next, but it was a powerful statement for its own time and for all time to come. Abraham Lincoln stood there as a link in a golden chain, a golden chain which has invisibly linked the spiritual life of Europe with that of America ever since America's beginnings. 1 should like to say a few words about this chain. We heard in Manfred Schmidt-Brabant's lecture how Rosicrucianism14 THE GOLDEN BLADE 1992 THE SPIRITUAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE WEST 15 and its impulse were almost wiped out by the 30 Years' War. It was not totally extinguished for it was carried by the Being of Christian Rosenkreutz, as he has been known since the 14th century. Only outwardly was it extinguished. We then see how this inspiration is taken up by Jacob Bdhme in the 17th century, how indeed he was visited by the individuality of Christian Rosenkreutz. He heard words saying that he should leave his house in order to speak with this visitor. They are almost the same words as those which give us a glimpse of the Lazarus experience: \"Lazarus come forth\". Uien he received an inspiration. Gradually others found their way to Jacob Bdhme, despite his outward insignicance, and a network of people grew up throughout Europe who had received inspirations from Christian Rosenkreutz through Jacob Bdhme. Among these was an Englishwoman. There was a small group of pietists who wanted to emigrate to America from Germany . They had a leader , a young man of 21 named Johannes Kelpius, They travelled via England where they intended to take a ship to America. They waited for a while in England and whilst there they met Jane Leade^ and received fully into themselves the inspirations of Jacob Bdhme, i.e., the Rosicrucian inspirations. Then they came to America \u2014 a hidden line of emigres, as it were \u2014 and settled on the banks of a particular river named Wissahickon, not far from Philadelphia. That was in 1694 and it was from there that their influence radiated forth. It was in this very area, near Philadelphia about 80 years later (an area that had been fructied by Rosicrucian impulses), that the Declaration of Independence came about. We have often pointed out in recent years how the whole of this Declaration and the Constitution of the United States, are very much founded on Masonic impulses, principles which take up the threefold aspect of the Rosicrucian impulse. Things progressed from there and Abraham Lincoln did his great deedbut had not yet completed his mission. His mission was concerned with the individuality of each human being and with the freedom from a spiritual point of view of each individual. As you know, he was assassinated. One could compare his end, as a destiny , with that of Caspar Hauser . He had an important spiritual task and was prevented from carrying it out, from completing it. This line which we have been following and which had its origin in Europe, having been brought over to America by this group of pietists, then nds its way in a remarkable manner into our movement. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was investigated at the request of the government of the United States. The person who carried out this investi gation was Colonel Henry Steele Olcott. He was a lawyer and will no doubt 5 Cf. Manley P . Hall, The Rosicrucians and Magister Christoph Schlegel, 1986be familiar to you as the man who founded the Theosophical Society ten years later, in New York City, with Madame Helene Blavatsky. This founding of the Theosophical Society also reveals a connection between America and Russia by means of its founders and it is indeed always through individuals that such connections between nations, ethnic groups, as well as races, come about. Rudolf Steiner describes how, in the early years of the Theosophical Society, whilst Helene Blavatsky was writing Isis Unveiled, Christian Rosenkreutz was present as an inspirer.\u00ae Thus we have a direct link between the inspiration of Christian Rosenkreutz and the destiny of America inas much as this destiny also includes the founding of the Theosophical Society. This then became the ground on which Rudolf Steiner was rst able to begin his own work and to start out on his mission. In the next cultural epoch there will be a particular situation connected with human speech. Rudolf Steiner links this new development very intimately with the English language. He describes how the English lan guage is now the major world language and if that were true in his time, how much more so is it now.^ When we think of the English language our rst reaction is that it is the language of practicalities, the language of material ism. In so many other languages words like manager, marketing and software have simply been adopted rather than translated. Y et the English language has a quite other task. It has the task of falling into rapid decay. It has the task of quickly drying up, the task of showing how soon one will no longer be in a position to use language to communicate at a deeper level. Now this is not something which is going to happen overnight. As we have heard from Sergei Prokoeff, there are still 1500 years to go in our Fifth Post-Atlantean Cultural Epoch, but eventually the English language will show, and other languages will follow suit, that language must become insubstantial and that human beings must become clairvoyant. The human being must acquire the faculty of being able to read the thoughts of other people, as it were, without the use of language. A true reading of minds must come about so that people are in direct contact with one another, ether body to ether body, thought to thought, with language acting only as a kind of ringing bell. Thus in the far future, when one hears another begin to speak one will know: now I must pay attention, and understanding will come about in a spiritual way.

We should concern ourselves intensely with the sounds of language and their spiritual, supersensible tasks. This is the reason we have Eurythmy and Speech Formation in our epoch. But in the Sixth Epoch this other situationwill arise which is already being presaged in the English language, for the Sixth Epoch is the Epoch of the Word, of the Logos, and the Spirits of Language will then have to take up other tasks. They will, for instance, have the task of popularising among hiunan beings* all occult wisdom, from the wisdom of the earliest times right up to the present. Such a task in the Sixth Epoch, the Epoch of the Mystery of the Word, will have the effect of bringing people much closer to each other for they will have to commumcatedif ferently . They will be much more able to exj^rience the Logos in theetheric than is presently the case. The Epoch which lies still further , in the f ut ur e, t he S ev ent h E poc h, is ac t ually t he A m er ic an, or t he Nor t h A m er ic an Epoch as Rudolf Steiner describes it. This Epoch is characterised by quitea different mystery , a mystery described in occult language as the mystery of piety . It is almost impossible to conceive of it now . Perhaps one could have a presentiment that it will be the time of the deepest brotherhood amongst mankind.W e h a v e , a t v a r i o u s p o i n t s i n t h i s C o n f e r e n c e , m a d e r e f e r e n c e t o t h e three stages of development.

OA 99, 5 June 1907 9 Cf. OA 190, 23 March 1919all the processes which have to do with the economic life appear there somewhat too early, like a premature birth. Every premature birth of course has its abnormalities and this has to be taken into account when one considers the whole picture. I can only indicate this now but I am sure you can come to your own conclusions about it. This premature tendency also involves a tendency towards hardening. This hardening, which is also a product of the natural spirituality of the country, of its earth forces, leads quite simply to materialism. I may perhaps be permitted a personal remark. As a yery young anthroposophist in America, I was perhaps 20 years old then, I was amazed to hear in a lecture the statement that in Europe anthroposophy is spiritual and in America it is like a wooden doll. You have perhaps also heard this, and at the time I thought, \"Well now, that's interesting\", but nothing further was added. You may know that Rudolf Steiner gave this image when he was speaking to the workers at the rst Goetheanum and I should like to read you a few lines verbatim because they really throw a great deal of light on the aspects we have pointed out today\" \"We in Europe develop anthroposophy from out of the spirit. Over there they fashion something rather like a wooden doll but of anthroposophy. But for anyone who is not a fanatic, American culture has some similarities with anthroposophical science in Europe. Only there everything is made of wood. It is not yet alive. We can make it alive in Eiu\"ope out of the spirit. Over there they get it instinctively.\"'\u00ae Here I should like to refer to an experience I had which seems to me to illustrate the nature of this instinct \u2014 an instinct for the spiritual. I heard an evangelical preacher on the T .V . in America this spring and he was speaking to a large congregation, which was then broadcast, as follows; \"Don't let yourselves be confused, there is no New World Order , there is only one World Order. That is the World Order of Jesus Christ. He controls what should go on amongst people. He is the New W orld Order and every nation which is in harmony with this world order will nd the right way whatever any politician says about a New World Order.\" Thus he spoke out of his instinct and very simply and naively, but an example like tWs can make it easier to understand what Rudolf Steiner means when he goes on to say in these lectures to the workers: \"Thus is it 10 OA 349, 3 March 1923THE GOLDEN BLADE 1992 exactly fte crass materialism of the Americans which will grow into a spirimality . And he adds, later on: \"What is truly American is that whichwill in fact one day unite with what is European and which comes into its own in a more spiritual way\". This means that what can develop out of Mthroposophy in America has the possibility of forming this quality , whichis there in embryo, of enlivening this instinctive spirituality (note the contradiction). There are deep mysteries connected with where the Americans come from, what previous incarnations they have had. If it should h a p p e n n o w , a n d i t m a y w e l l b e t h e c a s e , t h a t a n t h r o p o s o p h y b e c o m e s m u c hmore widespread in America (we have a good deal of evidence of this in the form not only of increasing membership in the Anthroposophical Societybut al^ of the spread of Waldorf schools, the spread of anthroposophical medicine, and above all of the enormous increase in the distribution ofRudolf Steiner's books \u2014 one has the feeling that it is now really flowing into our culture) then we may truly hope that America will stand by Europe strongly, will stand by Europe's cultural mission, not necessarily with millions of people but with enough people to make a strong impact. We can count on that and, as Rudolf Steiner always stresses, thoughts are realities so it is important for that reason, from the American point of view, to understand the spiritual mission of this new conguration in Europe and to go with it inwardly , just as it is important from Europe's point of view that one gets a true perspective of the spiritual striving of America. When these two stand beside one another like loving brothers, then what Rudolf Steiner so emphasises can come about and the two together can take Japan with them, which should not be overlooked in these considerations for it belongsto this picture of the world as a totality: Japan, America and especially Europe.19 L A N G U A G E A N D N A T I O N H O O D W i U i a m F o r w a r d The story is told of a railway-carriage conversation between the various delegates to one or other Euro-function in which each begins to sing the praises of his own language. The Englishman choses the evocative word \"butterfly\", to which the Frenchman counters that \"papillon\" much better suggests the delicate flutter of wings; the Italian then chimes in with \"farfalla\" which, in turn, the Spaniard feels is nothing like \"mariposa\". There follows a short, tense silence, after which a red-faced German blurts out \"Vot's wrong viz Schmetterling?\". Language, by means of which we communicate with one another, which so intimately shapes, reflects and expresses our thinking, can also be divisive. Rarely are we more self- conscious than when we have to make ourselves understood in a language not our own. Between one country and another, or one ethnic group and another, language can become symbolic of their differences. It is a potent weapon in the hands of separatists and rarely can it have been in greater use than in recent years with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the process of ssion going on in Yugoslavia. Given that there are over 180 different ethnic groups in the former Soviet Union and 147 distinct languages, according to some estimates, the potential for social ssion is enormous. On the other hand, we nd, in Switzerland, that three languages are spoken quite widely within a confederation of states where perhaps the term \"nation\" is less frequently or more cautiously used. The implicit recognition and acceptance of differences in practical terms has undoubtedly helped the Swiss to play an effective mediating role in many situations of conflict. A third example of the relationship between language and nation hood is different again: English, during its flowering in Shakespeare's time, spoken by only five \u2014 seven million Englishmen, is now a global language, spoken by nearly a fth of humanity of whom about half speak it as a mother tongue, comprising a remarkable number of distinct nations. Thus, however much language is felt to be part of nationhood (to the extent even that some nations have tried\u2014unsuccessfully \u2014 to create their own language in support, or conrmation, of their nationhood) it is by no means necessarily so. For a different perspective one could look at how the relationship of language to mankind is portrayed in the Bible. With Adam in Paradise it is an expression of his status as a co-creator or partner with God:\"... the Lord God formed every beast of the eld and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them\" (Genesis 2 : 19). The20 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 L A N G U A G E A N D N A T I O N H O O D 21 naming of creations is left to mankind as a faint echo perhaps of the creation word to which St. John refers (\"In the beginning was the word\"). At this stage there is still unity between man and man, indeed, between man and God. TTie second image is to be found in Chapter 11 of Genesis: \"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech... And they said. Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name [my italics], lest we be scattered abroad upon the fact of the whole earth... And the Lord said. Behold, the people is one and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained rom them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech\". In a second act of wilfulness mankind turned their name- giving power to themselves \"let us make us a name\" and in consequence were now not only cut off from Paradise, but also from each other. A future overcoming of this is perhaps heralded in the image of Pentecost where the disciples who gathered together \"were all lled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven... and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language\". Peter then attributes this to a pouring out of the Spirit. A reunion has taken place with the Creator Spirit, but the last image is different rom the rst since there are now many languages but they present no barrier to mutual understanding. The question for us is \u2014 how do we arrive at such a transcendent understanding? In the New Testament picture the outpouring of the Spirit is an act of grace but it is also preceded by the disciples being \"together with one accord in one place\". In a series of lectures given in Christiania (now Oslo) in 1910 entitled The Mission of Folk-Souls, Rudolf Steiner speaks all too propheticall y of the need for a deeper understanding of individual national characteristics, \"because the fate of humanity in the near future will bring together much more than has hitherto been the case, to full a common mission for humanity. But the individuals belonging to the several peoples will only be able to bring their free, concrete contributions to this joint mission if they have, first of all, an understanding of what we might call \u2014 the Self- knowledge of the Folk\". (Lecture 3). Just as the increasing rate at which outer supports and guidelines socially and morally are falling away demands of each individual that he strive to understand the driving forces in his biography , understand his own nature as a spiritual being, so we must also begin to recognise that there is a guiding principle, which also has a biography, at work in the people to which we belong. Failure to do so will lead to the same kind of traumatic shocks which in the individual person's biography urge him to poseexistential questions. Such a process is described by Rudolf Steiner in his lecture \"The work of the Angels in Man's astral body\". As Athys Floride pointed out in these pages last year, the way to a perception of the common aims of humanity lies through self-knowledge as an individual spiritual being, as a partner of the folk spirit in the folk soul and as a participant in the events of this particular moment in the Earth's evolution. How, then, can one arrive at such an understanding in any objective sense? As Floride pointed out, one begins to do this each time one leaves one's own country\u2014the different ways of doing so many things make one aware of what is peculiar to one's own country . The change is refreshing, as most tourists will conrm, but can also provide a rich opportunity for gaining a more objective relationship to one's \"peculiarity\". It is helpil to approach this from an understanding of the human being as differentiated into four bodies \u2014 the physical, the etheric, the astral and the ego. Looking at the physical body one can observe racial characteristics, butalso foods and the ways in which the local geography affects the physique, through climate, vegetation, etc. For the etheric body one can observe habits, customs, signs of one of the four temperaments being i^edominant, the people's relationship to time. At the level of the astral or feeling body one can observe the art and Ae language, and nally , for the ego quality one might try to study the people's history jfrom the point of view of akind of group biography . T i s t o e n p l a c e s o n e i n a p o s i t i o n t o g a i n m u c h m o r e f r o m a r e a ^ n g of The Mission of the Folk-Souls which can set one's observations in a spiritual context. There are also dangers in such a process of observation and study \u2014 one can all too easily fall into the trap of making facile generalisations, and few things can be more irritating at a time when the tendency is for people to wish to liberate themselves from the constraints of family, race and creed. This can be mitigated by a Goetheanistic approach \u2014 allowing the phenomena to speak for themselves. In the case of the British, much interesting work has already been done. A study through the medium of literature. The English Spirit by D. E. Faulkner-Jones, which came out in 1935,' is well worth reading, though much has changed outwardly since then. A short posthumous work of Walter Johannes Stein, The British, their psychology and destiny, published in 1958,^ contains diverse valuable insights which warrant further research. Then, in 1963, Herbert Hahn published his remarkable study of twelve European nations under the title Vorn Genius Europas, as yet, unfortunately, not available in English. 1 Reprinted by Rudolf Steiner Press, 1982 2 Reprinted by Temple Lodge Press, 199022 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 L A N G U A G E A N D N A T I O N H O O D 23 Haying acknowledged the work of these we shall here record a fewobservations in the suggested sequence, with prime emphasis on language. Physically the fact of being an island is important\u2014everywhere else is overseas. Yet at the same time, as Stein has shown, there is a variety of geography in the British Isles that can, and does, link with most other European cenfres: Cornwall \u2014 Italy, Wales \u2014 France, Fens \u2014 Holland, Scotland \u2014 Alpine Central Europe, etc. In some ways the British Isles are a microcosm of Europe. There seems to be a down-to-earthness about race\u2014the widest variety of physiques can be observed and for centuries it was sufcient to be bom on B r i t i s h s o i l t o a t ^ u i r e n a t i o n a l i t y . T h e f o o d h a s a b a d r e p u t a t i o n ( n o t a l w a y s deservedly) but it is interesting how there is a high consumption of crystalline forms, sale, sugar , even the bread is toasted. Stein links this with a certain acuity of sense-perception. The emphasis on sport and gardening in leisure also suggests a certain physical orientation. Where habits are concemed one observes a great attachment to them \u2014 the Englishman abroad is notoriously loath to adapt, the extraordinaty longev ity of traditions, the weight attached to customs inlaw , indeed a judicial system based on precedent rather than the interpretation of a written constitution. With regard to temperament, Drake and his game of bowls to be nished before dealing with the Armada are often seen as a typically phlegmatic response, and the love of imderstatement tallies with this, as does the legendary British workman. Perhaps also the pragmatism that characterised British economic management for so long has a connection with this aspect of the group character. At the level of the astral body , curiously , we nd a passionate interest in drama and acting. Even today more people in the UK take part in amateur dramatics than play football. There seems to be a great predilection for \"taking on a role\", which is echoed also in the spy-story game which is perhaps best represented in English. The language itself has, it seems, an almost innite capacity of \"taking on roles\" and through not only regional influence in the UK but also through that of the US, India, Africa, Australia, etc., then also that of the science, technology and business for which it has become a medium, has now a vocabulary estimated at around 500,000 words compared with around 185,0(X) for German and fewer than 1(X),(X)0 for French. Part of its attraction has undoubtedly been the flexibility with which nouns can become verbs (one can chair a meeting at which motions are tabled) and the reverse (one can choose between a walk, a run or a drive). Then there is the blessed simplicity of the articles which are unaffected by gender or case and the genders themselves which are deter mined by meaning rather than the obscure logic which distinguishes \"der Stuhl\" from \"die Lampe\" and \"das Buch\". The however, unrepentantly endish.The language has spread with colonisation and commerce but has not likewise contracted, despite the vigorous efforts of politicians in, say, India or Afnca. The impetus was sustained by American \"coco-colonisation\" and the world-wide impact of \"the movies\", not to mention pop music. But, having spread from the centre outwards, the language is now being recreated constantly from the periphery. As Salman Rushdie has put it, \"English, no longer an English language, now grows from many roots; and those whom it once colonised are carving out large territories within the language for themselves. The Empire is striking back\". This initselfcan be a rich source of material for the student of the influence of the Folk-Soul through the medium of language. One may get a feeling for the different flavour of the \"elevator\", \"faucet\" and \"pants\" used in the US, compared with the \"lift\", \"tap\" and \"trousers\" in use in England. The huge influx of immigrants into US enriched American English with words like delicatessen, pizza, schlep, from German, Italian and Yiddish, but new vocabu lary came in with new industries and still is \u2014 \"interface\" and \"networking\" are among many that are in common use outside their technical elds. Ttiming to Australia one gets an altogether different feeling where swimming costume, present or a hysterectomy in the hospital become \"cozzie\", \"prezzie\" and \"a hizzie in the hozzie\". Even more expressive are phrases such as \"scarce as rocking-horse manure\". A New Zealand leave-taking could take the form of \"Well, I suppose I'd better rattle my legs and be off'. South Aican is redolent of the Afrikaans influence in \"feld\", \"trek\" and \"apartheid\" and in Jamaica the nation language, as it is called, a mixture of Creole and Standard English, might gain sufcient ascendency to have street signs changed from \"No right turn\" to \"No ton rait\", or rom \"Keep left\" to \"Kip lef'. In India one may wish to buy a magazine from a \"newspaper-wallah\" only to nd that he is a \"crocodile in a loin-cloth\". Looking back to the Folk-Soul of the English, and this time its ego- aspect or biography , one can see that, having been isolated effectively from involvement on the Continent for a period after Joan of Arc, its attention has been directed much more outward to the other continents. The result has been the establishment and dismantling of a military, but above all commer cial, world empire, leaving among other legacies a world language. Another fruit of the detachment observed in the English is the scientic thinking which is likewise world-embracing, and likewise now no longer particularly connected with England. What then may be its future connection with Europe. Perhi^s to be a vehicle into the wider world for the fhiits of a common European development which, as argued elsewhere in this issue, must be to make visible the aims common to all mankind.24 A R E W E D E T A C H E D ? 25 A R E W E D E TA C H E D ? Andrew Wolpert When the Logos imprints itself into the multitude of different languages two phenomena become visible; the universality of the Logos, and the indi vidual peculiarities of the various folk souls. The fact that all languages have, for example, concepts of nouns, verbs, past and future, attests to something fundamental in language that nds its way into all languages; and the fact that these common features manifest and function so diversely points to essentially different aspects of the different peoples.There are several striking examples of what is peculiarly English. \"Hie fact tat we now have only one form of \"you\" must be seen in connection with the less immediately obvious ways in which we make the distinction between formal and familiar. The various particularly English functional uses of the passive voice, and the strong inclination to use verb forms which allow almost any noun to function as a verb, both exemplify how the language expresses (and forms!) the national character.All such linguistic features are of additional interest in their effect on the non-native speaker . In the context of English as a world language, at h o w e v e r r u d i m e n t a r y a l e v e l o f s o p h i s t i c a t i o n , t h e q u e s t i o n a r i s e s a b o u t t h e influence of certain unwittingly acquired aspects of the English character through the use of English. Such considerations are the exoteric counterpartto the spiritual consequences of how an idea lives in one linguistically formed consciousness or in another. In this article I would like to consider t h r e e f e a t u r e s o f E n g l i s h g r a m m a r ; t h e r s t t w o o f w h i c h c a n n o t f a i l t o m a k e themselves known at an early stage to foreigners who struggle to acquire prociency in our idiom, and which also have an esoteric, Logos-related, c o n s e q u e n c e i n t h e c o n t e x t o f E n g l i s h b e y o n d t h e s h o r e s o f t h i s i s l a n d .I t h a s b e e n s u g g e s t e d t h a t t h e u s e i n m a n y l a n g u a g e s o f t h e a u x i l i a r y v e r b \"to have\" in forming compound verb structures (\"I've painted the door ) e x p r e s s e s a s u b c o n s c i o u s a t t i t u d e o f p o s s e s s i v e n e s s t o w a r d s o n e ' s c o m p l e t e da c t s , a n a t t e m p t t o c l a i m o n e ' s d e e d s a s o n e ' s b e l o n g i n g s .

For the purposes of this article the linguistic phenomena will be treated in general terms with some typical examples; a more exhaustive examination with a comprehen sive survey of instances and exceptions would be inappropriate here. Modem English uses the verb \"to have\" for all active verbs, whereas various other languages also use the verb \"to be\", depending on whether the verb expresses, for example, motion:He has gone Er ist gegangen II est alii E andato or whether the verb expresses, for example, a fundamental change of state: He has died Er ist gestorben II est mart E morto It would seem that where the Germans, French, and Italians express certain completed actions as if they formed part of themselves (using the verb \"to be\"), the English retain an attitude of ownership regardless of whether the verb expresses motion or anything else. One could speculate whether this pervasive possessiveness in English indicates a predisposition to material ism, to reication rather than identication. There are certainly many other examples of how our language provides means of protecting our identityfrom unwanted intrusion and change. However, this use of the verb \"to have\" to describe completed actions has another surprise for the foreign learner. The Germans, French, and Italians can retain ownership of their actions (using the verb \"to have\") in any past period of time. In German, for example, all these are possible: Ich habe den heute In corresponding structure of \"I have written the letter\" can only be used when the expressed or implied time is linked to the moment of speaking, a uniquely important concept in English tense structure, thus: / have written the letter today this week since I came home If the time period referred to is unconnected to the moment of speaking we cannot use the so-called present perfect tense. Hms \"I have written the letter yesterday\" is impossible, we must use \"wrote\". This lack of structural corre spondence can cause foreign learners much confusion, but also raises the question whether that previously identied possessiveness really exists other than in a present sense. The English grammar will not allow you to retain that form of sub-conscious ownership of an act urdess it is expressly or implicitly linked to the moment of speaking, or the moment of ego consciousness, as it may also be called. What is past must be let go of in a way that so strikingly differs from other languages that allow you to hang on to past achievements. The second feature to be considered belongs to the future. Thae is a popular notion (even among native speakers) that in English the future is expressed with \"will\" or \"shall\". It is perfectly correct that several aspects of the future are expressed by these modal verbs, and the connection between \"will\"2 6 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 as a veib and as a noun has obvious implications for the whole realm of \"willing\" into the future. However, it is often a surprise that the most conunon form of future tense in English is the \"going to\" structure. This is used primarily to er^ess intention (rather tlian a plarmed event, a conditional possibility , or a spontaneous commitment), and though it does not have the lexical coincidence with \"will\" as a norm meaning determination or intention, its metaphorical aspect places it rmly in the lower limbs, which so often express our deepestwill impulses. It is the only structure for expressing the future that ^s not idiomatically combine with conditional clauses and so does not admit to any speculative mood. The \"going to\" structure expresses a combinatrori ofconscious intention for the future and present will activity , and as such might b e s e e n n o t j u s t a s a f o r m i n w h i c h i n t e n t i o n s f o r t h e f u t u r e a r e c o n s i g n e d t o t h e will, but also in which present will forces are raised to consciousness through intentionality . One could well imagine that the genius of the language here irK;lines us to a structure that schools the process of bringing greater awareness into our largely unconscious realm of willing. It also provides for the irony of b e i n g a b l e t o s a y ' T ' m g o i n g t o d o t h a t \" w h i l e r e m a i n i n g r m l y s e a t e d .T h e t h i r d a s p e c t o f E n g l i s h t h a t c o n c e r n s u s h e r e h a s t o d o w i t h t w o t r e n d s common to all languages, but most particularly manifest in English: the s i m p l i c a t i o n o f g r a m m a r a n d t h e e n r i c h m e n t o f v o c a b u l a r y .

This is a trend that continues today with the decreasing importance given, for example, to the difference between \"who\" and \"whom\".

If English can provide a particularly strong experience of how individu ally responsible an ego needs to be, the question arises whether that linguistic (ffocess of emancipation might be considered as a schooling for spiritual independence in other sirtieres. The processes of linguistic individualisation and objectication in English exemplify quite particularly processes of con sciousness that all people go through. Does the learning and use of a language that particularly em{diasises these processes serve goals beyond int^national communication, and even beyond the dissemination of literature? Does such a language provide the ego with a very direct opportunity to begin to emancipateitself om the culture and language into which it was bom? If this is so, then an ego that is thirs strengthened can also participate in the weaning process that every great work of art yearns to be taken through, so that its signMcance can rise above the culture and idiom of its birth (and even the medium of its incarnation) to be ai^henrted in the realm of the universally humaa It is this universal origin of the Logos ttiat language enables us to rise to consciously, and in this {nxxess the s[wtual treasures of different peoples lose their attachment to this or that particular language.

He was a childin the shape of a young man whose development had been articially held back so that the childlike qualities of ingenuousness and innocence were prominent in him to the great astonishment of all those who experienced him. The origin of this foundling was at rst obscure, mysterious. And yet, however fatherless, motherless and homeless, he must still come from somewhere. Who could make sense of this riddle? The destiny that lay before Caspar Hauser took its rst positive turn when from his surround ings there came as it were an answer to the riddle of his existence: The Child of Europe. In the middle of Europe \u2014 Niirnberg might be seen as such a place \u2014 there appears a figure towards which, so to speak, the whole of Europe directs its gaze. This description whose originator is not known to history points to the being of Caspar Hauser, it is the epithet that belongs to him. These words express what in the appearance of Caspar Hauser went beyond the everyday and the factual, and yet which for that very reason was most essential. All those who were able to experience Caspar Hauser in the period just after he turned up, sawa unique, childlike quality as the core of his being. Georg Friedrich Daumer, his rst teacher and close friend, described him as \"A paradisal human archetype\". His subsequent guardian Freiherr von T ucher found in him \"The image of the rst human being in Paradise before the fall\" and the famous criminologist Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach even spoke of \"A living refutation of the doctrine of original sin\". These experiences with Caspar Hauser were deeply felt, and anyone who had received such impressions could never thereafter doubt their truth. But the question how anything like this could come about has never been pursued. We shall attempt to throw light on it here. All the accounts of the impression created by Caspar Hauser suggest that people experienced sometldng original pure and innocent in him. This childlike quality was somehow felt to be the original condition of the human being comparable with Adam before the fall. In Caspar Hauser this layer of his being was no doubt exposed as a result of the treatment meted out to him in his childhood spent in prison and isolation. But what came out in this way was also something highly individual, belonging to Caspar Hauser's own being. It should not be assumed that anyone treated in thesame way would exhibit the same characteristics, quite apart from the fact that very few human beings would have survived such treatment for so long. Whilst it is true that during the course of mankind's evolution all human beings have lived through such a condition, they are now far removed from it. In as much as they have all taken steps in their own development as egos through the course of several earth lives their being has so changed that it cannot without further ado reveal this original condition. Pursuing this thought one can see that Caspar Hauser had perhaps participated much less in the incarnation process than other human beings, that in this sense he was a young soul who was quite genuinely closer to man's original state. However whilst this peculiarity of Caspar Hauser's being was the basis for the childlike quality that rayed out from him, it is by no means sufcient in itself to explain the phenomenon. For humanity has moved on so far from that rst Adam that he can no longer be glimpsed without some mediator. The powers behind the developmental process that led away from man's original condition were so strong that nothing could resist them. Thus it was necessary for the original vigour of humanity to be renewed by a being which possessed the same creative powers as at humanity's origin to renew the whole of humanity on earth. This points to the Christ event, and in particular to the resurrection as a renewal of the original vitality of mankind. By means of the resurrection, the gap is bridged between mankind's pre- material condition and earthly development, and without this happening the phenomenon of Caspar Hauser could not have taken place. As St. Paul puts it, mankind can only enter into a relationship with the rst Adam through the mediation of the second, the risen Christ. Thus there is a relationship to man's primal condition which is peculiar to the individuality of Caspar Hauser but also one which is common to all mankind and is made possible by the resurrection of Christ. * How Caspar related to the Christ Being could perhaps not immediately be seen in his childlike utterances. It is an imaginative step one can take in order to gain understanding of how this unique phenomenon came to be. In his later life however the closeness of Caspar Hauser to the Christ Being became quite clear in, for instance, the spontaneous compassion he expressed when he heard the story of the passion. He was shaken to the core by this story , shed many tears and could only with difculty be calmed down. The Christ impulse was alive in Caspar Hauser more as an experience than as a thought. This often ignored aspect of his being was particularly evident at his death; it was with the words of Christ on his lips that he crossed the threshold and it was an expression of a Christian attitude that he prayed for his murderer. * See in particular: Rudolf Steiner, From Jesus to Christ. Karlsruhe, 1911 (GA 131)30 the golden blade 1992 If one can begin to understand the remarkable phenomenon of the Child of Europe in this way tlwn it becomes clear how Caspar Hauser evinced enthusiasm and admiration but also envy and hostility, indeed persecution to the point of murdo:. For anyone who is not able to respond to this Child of Europe with a cotain heartfelt vigour is easily provoked to inward ORiosition. Tte diild radiates a generally enlivening and uplifting power, it wishes to be there for evayone, it knows neither purpose nor utility. Thus it must necessarily disturb all those who have their own particular intentions, who wish to guide world Mstory in accordance with their own aims and who therefore carmot tolerate somediing that is entirely new. Lord Stanhope enters into Caspar Hauser's life as a representative of thiss t r e a m w h i c h w i s h ^ t o i \u00bb e s e r v e t h e o l d . H e i s q u i t e r i g h t l y d e s c r i b e d i n t h e t i t l e of the Johannes Mayer biography as \"Caspar Hauser's opponent\". i Indeed one could say without exaggeration that he is the opponent of Caspar Hauser . For it has been shown that he was in contact with Caspar Hauser's contemporary (^rponents (htoker , Meyra\") and that he as it were co-ordinated die opposition from a central position. Moreover, almost all the assertions which disfnite Caspar Hauser's trnthilness, which would brand him as a liar, a fraud and a suicide, can be traced back to Lord Stanhope. Anyone who is familiar with the history of Caspar Hauser will be aware how since that time the arguments have only been rqteated with occasional variations. Caspar Haus^'s friend and teacher Georg Friedrich Daumer was speak ing from his own experience when he wrote in his book which was in a certain sensehisl^acy: \"Caspar Hauser , sein Dornach 1984) \"Der englische Graf incomiwehen- sible metamoridiosis).^ After Caspar Hauser's death Lord Stanhope proceeded for reasons best known to himself to try to nd \"the proof that his ers^hile dailing fosto* son and was nottung other than a wretched, despicable J(duuiy-come-lately , full of lies and deceit, cunning and dissembling, whoended his worthless life ignominiously as a suicide\".3 This change of attitude i n L o r d S t a n h o p e i s s o a b r u p t a n d u n r e a s o n i n g t h a t t h e s u s p i c i o n a r i s e s a t o n c e that the suf^sed diange of mind was in fact part of a plan to destroy Caspar Hauser. Daumo- writes as follows ofhis last meeting with Lord Stanhope: \"The laxtesr honoured my humble abode with several visits after Hauser's death, during the course of his extraordinarily active attempts to vilify the murder victim, awl to my great astonishment (since 1 was far from seeing an enemy of 1 Jcdianoes Mayer , Der Gegenspieler Caspar Mausers (Philip Henry Lard Stanhope) Urachhaus, Stuttgart 1988 2 Reprinted 1984, p. 285 3 Ibid, p. 286AN INTERFERING INTEREST 31 Hauser's cause in him) sought to induce me to bear witness against him. In doing so he paid no attention to anything that could be said in favour of the fbimdling by me or my mother from our own sure perception and observation, although one would imagine that he should wish to hear that his former darling was no such totally bad and worthless person and that thus the Earl himself had not been so ignominiously betrayed. My mother, seeing what he was about, begged and pleaded with him from the dqiis of her heart not to heap shame and abuse on the ashes of the unfortunate young man who had once trusted him in such a childlike manner as his fathedy fnend and bene&ctor and of whom she knew quite certainly that he was no impostor or scoundrel. \"Nothing can harm him any more\" he replied, went red in the face, abruptly cut short his visit, ran down the steps and was never seen again in my flat. \"What my mother felt and expressed at that meeting 1 shall not repeat; appearances can be deceptive and she may have been deceived. 1 am only reporting what actually ht^ipened which 1 can testify to under oath and which seems to me to belong to this dark and horrible story without in any way accusing the Earl of any crime nor of being an accessory to any crime. With regard to my own opinion 1 will only say that the actions of the Earl suggest that he was not concerned with the truth; but fliat he must have had hidden motives and that for this reason he carmot stand up to a careil scrutiny as the honest character and credible witness as he is portrayed by the opponents of the unfortimate victim, for whom indeed everything hostile to Hauser counts as excellent, noble, above suspicion and authoritative\".^ T o uncover the \"hidrten motives\" and to throw light on the background to them has been tried repeatedly since theiL At the level ofhistorical documents these attempts have failed, probably for the simple reason that the \"hidden motives\" are rmt to be foimd at that level, a possibility to which the author has drawn attention elsewhere. 5 This remains unchanged by the recent work of Joharmes Mayer \u00a3dthough it becomes clear there that Stanhope's biography is very much linked up with that of Caspar Hauser. He is marked out as Caspar Hauser's enemy, destroyer and calumniator but his motives remain obscure, not least because \"he made it a rule never to put anything in writing which might have been prejudicial to the unravelling of the story\".6 Lord Stanhope became involved with Caspar Hauser three times: twice from the periphery in an obscure, highly suspect manner and once in complete contrast as his friend and benefactor. When on 17th October 1829 a masked man attempted to murder Hauser in Daumer's house. Lord Stanhope was to be found at an Inn called \"Wildemann\" in Niimberg. On 4 Ibid, p. 292f p.286 6 Johannes Mayer, p.9f32 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2AN INTERFERING INTEREST 33 the occasion of this visit to Niirnberg, Lord Stanhope goes out of his way to avoid contact with the famous foundling whereas normally any re spected guest of Nurnberg would be most keen to see him. His intention is all the more unmistakable by virtue of the fact that Lord Stanhope already had connections at this time with the circles from which Caspar Hauser came and would certainly have known of Caspar Hauser's existence. In the context of his later conduct and actions the dreadful suspicion arises that he was involved in the murder attempt on Caspar Hauser, that his rst appearance in relation to Caspar Hauser was connected with the attempt to destroy him. Even if this is only a grave suspicion which cannot be documented, it is equally clear on the other hand that nothing has been found which might clear Lord Stanhope's name in this connection. He appears at the moment when the attempt is made on Caspar Hauser's life, probably because there were fears that in the autobiography (which according to contemporary press reports Caspar Hauser was intending to write) there might be something compromising to the criminals who were behind what was done to him. In reality however Caspar Hauser was not in a position to write down any such thing. In May 1831 Lord Stanhope appeared in Niirnberg again, this time at once concerned to make Caspar Hauser's acquaintance, which naturally enough presented no difficulties to him as an English peer. He \u00a35)peared to be quite delighted with Caspar Hauser , he heaped favours upon him, placed money in tmst for him and arranged a journey to Himgary , ostensibly to help solve the mystery of Caspar Hauser's origins, in reality however only laying a false trail. In November 1831 Lord Stanhope returned to Niirnberg to pursue his aim which was to take over care and control (not guardianship) of Caspar Hauser and thus to be able to decide on his education and where he should live. By behaving himself accordingly , showering him with presents and promising to take him to England the following year . Lord Stanhope succeeded in winning over Caspar Hauser and in disturbing his relationship to his guardianof the time, Freiherr von Tucher, so that Caspar Hauser eventually himself asked to be placed in the care of Lord Stanhope. This was eventually agreed, so that Lord Stanhope was able to bring Caspar Hauser to Ansbach, rst of all to the homeof Feuetbach, then to Ihe teacher Meyer with whom he was then to spend the last two years of his life. Lord Stanhope left his \"dearly beloved foster son\" and was never seenbyhimagaimlnhis letters the foster father promised repeatedly that he would fetch him to England. T oo late Caspar Hauser noticed that he had found a false friend. \"It annoys me when someone promises something and doesn't keep his word\" he noted?. In December 1833 at the time of the murder 7 Johannes Mayer and Peter Tradowsky, Caspar Hauser. Das Kind von Europa Stuttgart 1984, p. 142of Caspar Hauser, Lord Stanhope put on a horrically macabre show. Lord Stanhope was on a journey from Vieima to Munich. On the very day on which Caspar Hauser died (17 December) Stanhope wrote him a letter in Vienna in which he spoke of a meeting \"before the end of the next month\". The letter closed with the words \"You may have the satisfaction of knowing that you are in the same country as your loving foster father Earl Stanhope\".8 One day later he left Vienna and was scheduled to arrive in Munich on the 21st. Strangely enough however, he did not arrive in Munich until the 25th December which is corroborated by his registration and by the fact that he did not actually post the letter which he wroteonthe ITthDecemberuntil then; the letterpostmarked 25th December arrived in Ansbach on 30th December. It must be assumed that Lord Stanhope knew of Caspar Hauser's death when he posted the letter; rstly because his daughter reported that \"He received the news of his death on Christmas eve at the rst station between Vienna and Munich\",^ and secondly because the death of Caspar Hauser was on everybody's lips and Stanhope would certainly heard of this during the course of his journey. The climax of this, by normal standards simply inexplicable, conduct of Stanhope is the fact that on the 26th December he went to the Bavarian Interior Minister Prince Oettingen-Wallerstein and to the latter's surprise began his agitation against Caspar Hauser. From this day on until his own death he was a public and embittered enemy of Caspar Hauser. Whatever particular grounds Lord Stanhope may have had for this conduct, which totally compromised him, only \"Wdden\" overriding motives would seem to explain his bizarre behaviour . In the interests of the struggle against Caspar Hauser he was clearly willing to sacrice any personal credit. One might also say , as Tucher did later , that Stanhope's whole conduct \"indicates the agency of an unknown hand as its ultimate cause\". 10 Developing this image a little further: it must remain an open question to whom this hand belongs. There can, however, be no doubt about the aim of the actions: the issue from the outset was nothing less than destruction, both inward and outward. And no means are eschewed in the achieving of this aim. This poses the question: what was it in Caspar Hauser's being that could provoke such a degree of opposition? His appearance and utterances were certainly extraordinary; they were felt to be sensational or wonderful but over a period of time they became less so and certainly gave no cause for such a violent hostility. Much greater importance was undoubtedly attached to the possible discov ery of dynastic crime\u2014which in 1833 was certainly possible and therefore to be feared \u2014 and which would without question have meant a state 8 Ibid p. 271 9 Ibid p. 273 10 Ibid p. 27934 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 AN INTERFERING INTEREST35 catastrophe for the Grand Duchy of Baden with untold consequences. But a sober consideration of the facts suggests that this d^ger was no longer present once Caspar Hauser had been murdered. Playing this downand maintaining a wall of silence subsequently would probably have been the best course of action. How then could one explain the subsequent persecution of Caspar Hauser? This is only comprehensible when one recognises that it was directed not only at the heir to the throne of Baden but also at the Child of Europe. The question of succession was only of importance as long as Caspar Hauser was alive, it belonged exclusively to the present and lost all its importance with his death. It was in the summer of 1828 that the world rstheard of the child of Europe. The dynasties were age-old but this child was something new and of the future. This impulse of the future is the immortalessential element of Caspar Hauser which raises hina above what is possible between birth and death, however important this may have beenin his case. Lord Stanhope's fatal campaign after Caspar Hauser's death had the primary aim of totally discrediting him for posterity in order thereby to deprive him of any future spiritual influence. However oncemore it is clear that the power \"that would alone work evil\" in fact \"engenders good\" (Goethe: Faust), for whilst the defenceless Child of Europe had calumnies heaped upon him, and criminal acts, the suf fering imposed on him by hardness of heart would only increase his value and i m p o r t a n c e i n t h e e y e s o f t h o s e w h o c o u l d s e e w h a t w a s g o i n g o n .

Daumer's notable prophetic words, whose full import has scarcely yet been understood or jppreciated, are as follows: \"Dr. Meyer makes the following remark at the end of his work: 'In his history of the 18lh and 19th century Schlosser mentions the story of CasparHauser as a fairy tale which was believed by the German people'. Meyer underlines the words 'fairy tale', not of course the words we have under lined; these however are the ones we consider valuable. The belief in that story is one which is peculiar and natural to the German people; the nation need not be ashamed of this, for it is founded on the nation's sense and feeling for truth and justice from which it will scarcely allow itself to be parted. Anyone who seeks to do this does not stand on German soil; we however who defend this belief do, and may hope to have the sympathy of the people with us. We are here representing not only the victim and oiu^elves (who for his sake were pursued and humiliated and injured) but also our nation and our national character. If a book such as Meyer s were to have a decisive influence; if the people were to allow itself to be converted to the heartless criticism, devoid of spirit, which makes this story a fable and in doing so employs such hardness, deceit, falsication and malice then it would no longer be truly German; and we for our part would not benet much from being Germans\".!i One can now scarcely imagine what it would have meant for the German people if as Daumer put it \"The belief in that story really had remained \"Peculiar and natural to it\". \"The sense and feeling for truth and justice\" in the case of Caspar Hauser as the Child of Europe could not inthe end, despite many ef forts, be preserved to any great extent, let alone deepened. The belief that the relationship of the German people to CasparH a u s e r c o r r e s p o n d e d t o i t s r e l a t i o n s h i p t o t h e g e n i u s o f c e n h a l E u r o p e w a s unable to take root and is now only cultivated by a small circle of people. The consequences which Daumer could only dimly perceive have sintre become tragic reality . The Child of Europe is in a state of becoming, it is incomplete, as is natural for any child. For its development it needs to takethe spirit of the future into itself, it exercises no power, but entrusts itself f K J w e r l e s s l y t o a f r e e p r o c e s s o f b e c o m i n g , i t b e c o m e s t h e v i c t i m o f a g e o l dhostile powers but lives on as a hope for the future. In thus sense Casp^ Hauser as the Child of Europe can be seen as a gure which expresses in the present and the future the true spirit of the German people which has its home in the spiritual world. It is of deep importance also that the vessel for this German spirit is brought forth from the whole periphery , from Europe as a whole and that there is no restrictive tie to any particular place.The true German spirit, which is cosmopolitan, and aims at what is common to all humanity , nds its expression in the Child of Europe. The gure of Caspar Hauser will in future gain in stature to the degree that it is possible to bring to expression the true spirituality of middle Europe. When the positive relationship of the German people to Caspar Hauser has 11 Daumer 1873, reprint 1984, p. 3336 THE GOLDEN BLADE 1992 37 been forged, then what Daumer said about its relationship to its own spirit will come become apparent. * The historical realities of the 20th century however reflect the very opposite in the strongest terms. Henriette von Feuerbach, one of Feuerbach's daughters-in-law wrote in a letter in 1884that she wanted to lock what she knewa b o u t C a s p a r H a u s e r i n a n i r o n c h e s t o n w h i c h w a s t o b e w r i t t e n ' T o b e o ^ n e d on the 17th December 1933\". 12 Henriette von Feuerbach had a presentiment that the mystery ofCaspar Hauser would only become clear over a longer period of time. No such chest has been found and it is questionable whether one ever existed; but in the year 1933on the stage of world history , processes were taking place in Germany which were to shake the world, and which were an expression of the deliberate denial of the German spirit. The murder of Caspar Hauser during the advent of 1833 found its world historic echo in Adolf Hitler taking powa: on the 30th January 1933, with all its consequences. Hitler was the negative image of Caspar Hauser: his power marked the loss of the spirit with its place taken by a destructive demon. Opposite the Child of Europe stood Europe's Usurper . The way of Caspar Hauser was without power . Hitler's had ^ use of power and violence extending beyond what anyone could haveimagined. Caspar Hauser's power was the power of compassion, but now ruthlessness and mercilessness had become the dominant forces and in the place of openness to all impressions there was now a rigid blindness. One is reminded of the words of Daumer when he characterised the persecution of Caspar Hauser: hardness, deceit, falsication and malice. Certainly the emer gence of an understanding of the connection between these two events ^parated, by a hundred years, is now only in its infancy . Just as the coimteri m a g e o f t h e G e r m a n p e o p l e n d s i t s e x p r e s s i o n i n t h e H i t l e r m o v e m e n t s o a l s o the demon of the English spirit appears in Lord Stanhope. Likewise the relatiomhip between both of these denials of the spirit is unmistakable, the one is unthinkable without the other. Thus it may become clearer what is at stake in the striving for an understanding of Caspar Hauser. The fruits of this striving will be seen inAe relationship of the German people to their true folk spirit, whether it be in the near or the distant future. But Caspar Hauser would not be the Child of Europe, if this were not also true in an extended sense for all peoples in the west, the east, the north and the south of Europe. The Child of Europe belonged to humanity and the future of humanity and it must not be lost through untruthfulness and \"dullness of the heart\" (Wassermann).BREATHING AND CIRCULATION A N D T H E F O U N D AT I O N S T O N E M E D I TAT I O N by Jenny Josephson During Rudolf Steiner's illness Walther Johannes Stein, an inveterate question-asker to whom we owe much, wrote the following question to R u d o l f S t e i n e r : \"How do the events in the blood in the lungs relate to those in the heart?\".!

Let us come back to the two main organ systems of the human middle the heart and circulation and the lungs and respiration. There is always a danger that human physiology is looked at too narrowly and one only sees the trees and not the wood. All human physiology is reflected in soul processes and in the world surrounding us. Not only that, within the human being other beings in the cosmos are also reflected \u2014 the hierarchies, the T rinity , the elemental world, the opposing forces and other human beings.Each person stands on the crossing point of a lemniscate and is a potential gateway for all the above to inter-relate. Respiration, particularly, is something that is over-simplied intochemical equations.3 One should think of human respiration as not just gas exchange but rather as the exchange of intangible (not necessarily immeas urable) substance between a person and the world. In this exchange, that taken in is so worked on that it is given back to the world as new, even if related, substance. In this wider context one whole \"substance\" group becomes very relevant, i.e. the world of sense impressions. The human being reaches out through the sense organs to grasp impressions and take them in. TTiese are worked on, sometimes consciously , more often uncon sciously, and given back in a changed state \u2014 e.g., art, conversation, reactions, even mathematical theorems (Galileo, Newton). Just as taking in oxygen and transforming it to carbon dioxide in gaseous respiration is benecial to the plant world, so our impressions, if worked on, are also benecial, this time to the elemental world. Everything around us in the natural world is formed from condensed re5 within which is trapped an elemental being. These beings are dependant on the human being for their release and redemption. They wait for us to observe consciously the world around us, so that at death our perceptions release these imprisoned beings. Through the Christ-forces that live in all humanity we can, if we will, at the moment of death, provide redemption for others. \"O Light Divine, O Sun of Christ! \u2014 The Elemental Spirits hear it rom East and West and North and South: May human beings hear it!\".6 5 Rudolf Steiner, 12.04.09. Spiritual Hierarchies and their reflection in the physical world. Anthroposophic Press, New York, 1970 6 Rudolf Steiner, 31.12.23. Foundation Stone Meditation. Rudolf Steiner Press, 1977The weather is also a realm of the elemental beings and as such can be affected by human beings\u2014rain-dances, prayers for weather, etc. Have you ever noticed how the weather can be affected by sincere selfless human thought and prayer? Not always of course! The weather can also be affected adversely\u2014at the end of June this year, after a month of nearly continuous rain, I overheard the following conversation in a train: Old man, who spoke in an uninformed, uneducated way: \"Awful weather, isn't it?\". Other man, behind his newspaper gave a non-committal grunt. \"Y es, we haven't had anything like it before \u2014 rain, rain, rain\". Another grunt. \"You know what's causing it don't you?\". Sigh: \"No\". \"Well, it's the Gulf War \u2014 you can't put all that up in the atmosphere without changing things; it isn't right. Keeps on going, too, bound to have an effect\". Another very important group of elemental beings need our help and co-operation,5 the elementals of time and rhythm. In working with theseand the rst group in nature one brings the members of one s being into a living relationship with them in a way that provides help and healing forboth. Just as the plants during the day take in carbon-dioxide and in gratitude one could say give back oxygen, so also the elementals in gratitude for their release turn to the human beings with gifts. These gifts the healing forces that can stream to us through the natural world and through the rhythms of time. It is these forces that can be taken up and usedin medicines and therapies \u2014 in part the potential healing for an individual lies in the efforts of all of us! The elementals of time and rhythm fall into three main groups: circadian, lunar and annual. These three, as well as the elemental beings of the natural world, demand or need the cultivation of soul forces in order to make our consciousness of them redemptive. Each of these soul qualities has a strengthening effect on one of the members of our being. The group of elementals particularly connected with the human ego is that working in the circadian rhythm of day and night. T o support one's consciousness of these beings an attitude of industriousness, \"Fleiss\", is helpful. This is not the quality of business which all too often is empty bustle achieving little of note. Rather it is conscious, penetrated, even quiet activity, whether inner or outer. Any exercise which involves the rhythm of morning and evening can help, but what requires above all industry of the ego is the RUckschau, the review of the day. The effort of moving in thought40 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 BREATHING. CIRCULATION. FOUNDATION STONE MEDITATION 41 counter to ordinary time, as well as the opportunity for evaluation of one's deeds during the day, helps in the soul quality and also the appreciation of the night and day rhythm. One also begins to remember to take the night into one's day-time doing, giving it new direction and purpose.^ The astral body imposes its own rhythm of a week upon the natural world; it is a rhythm which marks the evolution of human development and the stages of the earth \u2014 not natural processes as such. However, it is this rhythm that we need to work with to build up the ability to continuously, consistently, work with the same exercise over a period of time. The astral body expresses itself in moods both positive and negative and to be able to repeat something regardless of these moods supports our work in learning to observe truly. It can be quite devastating to realise that one's sympathies cloud one's observation as much as, if not more than, one's antipathies. To help overcome this, observation of nature is of great value and can allow one to begin to rise above one's mood of the moment. Such a soul quality which tames or transmutes the astral body can be called a true chasteness of soul, \"Keuschheit\". It is this quality which frees one from oneself to appreciate all around us \u2014 the children's prayer begins to live: \"When I see and know God In all loving people In my father and mother In the flowers and the trees In the birds, beasts and stones Then no fear shall I feel Only love will then ll me For all that is around me\".8 The lunar rhythm of a month (four weeks) is related to the human etheric body \u2014 the rhythm of waxing and waning, of growth and decay. Cheerfulness, \"Heiterkeit\", is the soul quality that stimulates these elementals and, indeed, our own vitality. A truly wise person is not easily cast down even if worried and often has great fortitude in life. Instead of working with daily or weekly repetition, the especially helpful exercises, althoimh done daily, have a monthly rhythm \u2014 the six subsidiary exer cises.'TTiese exercises, by strengthening thinking, feeling and willing and their working together, allow one to meet destiny more freely, more humanly. They stimulate movement from the rst three verses of the 7 Rudolf Steiner, Knowledge of the Higher Worlds. Rudolf Steiner Press, 1977 8 From my head to my feet. Prayers for Mothers and Children. Rudolf Steiner Press. 1983Foundation Stone Meditation to the last verse. Rudolf Steiner described these exercises as fundamental to the hygiene of the soul of anyone on a path of inner development. At a time when humanity has unconsciously crossed the threshold\u2014and so thinking, feeling and willing are torn apart \u2014 these exercises help, through the etheric body, to bring them together as a whole. When backed up by the Riickschau, upon which Rudolf Steiner also placed great emphasis, one is ready and able to practise trying to meditate in a healthy way .9 Finally, the annual rhythm, the cycle of the year, which has to do with our physical body: this larger rhythm which has to do as well with the earth's own breathing. Working with this rhythm asks for the soul quality of piety or reverence, \"Frommsein\", particularly for the course of the year itself. This is helped by celebrating the festivals and seasons of the year in as awake a way as possible. Then one is not just alerted to Christmas by the number of shopping days left, as proclaimed by advertisements \u2014 rather one is prepared by Advent and expectant of Christmas. One can also work with the Calendar of the Soul i o verses\u2014one for each week of the year. The changing verses ask for different qualities week by week, building up soul substance over the year . As the need for global consciousness escalates and the plight of the earth intensifies \u2014 crying out for more and more consciousness \u2014 materially, as in ecology, but also spiritually, one can heighten this working by using the polar weeks together, thus taking account of the whole. In British folk-lore, stories of the elemental world and its responsive ness to the human attitude are a recurring theme. When approached correctly, and therefore redeemed, great help and healing are given, but if this is denied then the wrath and spite of the elementals are unbounded and resourceful! One needs to be careful to offer them milk and not peas if one wants one's house kept in order! In 1922 Rudolf Steiner described the relationship of the four members of the human being to the heart. 1 1 The heart is the only organ in the human being to be formedin all four members, i.e., aphysical heart, an etheric heart, an astral heart and an ego heart. These four inter-penetrate and permeate each other just as the members of our being do and are formed out of the substance of the relevant sheath. In last year's article I described the physical heart; however, to take -this further I would like to add the following. 9 Rudolf Steiner. Occidt Science.

At rst in a more general impermanent way , the actions and movements of the child begin to aj^ar in a linear form.

T h e a s t r a l h e a r t a r i ^ o u t o f movement and deeds, even minor insignicant ones, and tte (teeds weask others to cyry out for us. A sobering thought! it is from this moment on, when the astral heart and the etheric heart permeate each other and the physical, that individual karma begins \u2014 our deeds are now coimected to the cosmos. The child bears the consequences of its activity and so must begin to make its own judgements and decisions. Finally , af 21 years, the ego heart unites with other three, carrying init t he pr e- bir t h int eiit ions and t as k s laid upon ones elf f or t his lif e. T he hear t is therefore the organ where one weighs one's trae intentions with actual (teeds and the cosmos and the voice of conscience may be heard.

In the process of respiration one can see the forces of redemj^on \u20144 4 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 arrested development is freed and therefore given the possibility of new steps. The lungs as an organ show the process of trans-substantiation \u2014 physical matter is lifted above itself and becomes spiritual substance. In the heart in its fourfold being, the organ of karma evaluation and perception is revealed, while the circulation reveals the possibility of free choice in oiu\" activity on earth, freedom to change and work with one's karma. The gateways of the moon and the sun which lie between the heart and lungs are the gateways of karma. That of the moon brings one to the unresolved situation, that which is fixed \u2014 the moon gives one the possibility of freeing arrested development by making one face it again. Tlie sun helps one choose freely to change or not, to weigh up, to be mindful in a situation and move forward or to change for oneself or even for another. In the last book of the Fionavar T apestry , t2 three of the protagonists are trapped in a karmic situation which repeats itself over many lives. It demands that one of them battles with evil and, overcoming it, is killed. Once more this situation has arisen and the fatal battle is imminent, which sets the cycle off again. A fourth watcher carmot accept this and throws himself into the impossible battle and death to redeem the situatioa A tme sun hero who redeems an old situation out of total freedom even at the cost of life. The Christ, in coming to earth, took on death in order to bring new life and to save the earth evolution which was otherwise doomed. The Sun- Being came down to earth to conquer the ancient forces of the moon and give them new potential. In doing so He bound His destiny with that of the earth and brought about disarray in the cosmos. The order of things was disturbed \u2014 the Sun-Being was no longer in the cosmos but with the earth. The rules of conduct of the hierarchies have dissolved gradually and new rules are needed. These rules \u2014 or the cosmic intelligence \u2014 now live within the human beings as a potential and need to be awakened. In his comments about the Tuesday rhythms, Rudolf Steiner states that they are of the order and magnitude of conjunctions of planets with the zodiac.i^ The rhythms help one to build the Foundation Stone which was laid in the hearts of the members. Is it possible that by practising these rhythms the new rules of conduct can begin to emerge \u2014 that the cosmic intelligence can arise in human hearts and be offered to Michael who stands and waits? Through working with the Foundation Stone Meditation one can begin to reveal \"the wondrous secret that prevails as between Heart and Lung\" ^ in such a way that order is brought, not only to ourselves, but to all those beings who have their reflection in us? I think so. Then, indeed, \"the Christ Mystery is the revelation of the great wonder that takes place between the heart and lungs\". 12 Guy Gavriel Kay, The Darkest Road, Book III, Fionavar T apestry. Unwin Paper backs, 1988 13 Rudolf Steiner, 1.1.24. Foundation Stone Meditation. Rudolf Steiner Press, 197745 FIRST AID AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY Jenny Josephson As we near the end of the century and the millennium, one can feel more and more urgently what a testing and important time this is. Time itself seems to be passing ever more quickly; events are overtaken almost before one hears about them\u2014would a Russian coup have been resolved in a few days in the 1970s? Time is gathering itself, speeding us from event to event so that thoughtful penetration leading to understanding and a proper doing is almost impossible. How can we see what to do so that these trials are to the good of mankind's development? It is no longer a question of individual human beings but of humanity. When describing the dangers at the end of this century, due to the emissaries of Ahriman preparing his incarnation, Rudolf Steiner uses the term \"the war of all-against-all\". Can one see signs of this, where will it be waged and how? I think it will be fought in and around the human being. It will probably not be a purely physical battle, although that may well happen too; it will take place in the soul and spirit as well, necessitating response on these levels also. In the world today, physical violence abounds internationally as well as locally and in the home. Although in past times there has been child neglect, directed conscious violence against children was rarer. T oday it is a growing evil, spread throughout all layers of society and not conned to strangers but present in parents, family, friends and professional carers. Taking this together with the increasing vandalism and love of destruction as shown by the recent joy-riders, one can point to forms of all-against-all on a physical level. Unchecked, these could well lead to a state where no one is safe, trust is foolish and fear reigns. In the soul realm one only needs to look at any gathering of people trying to foster an initiative over a period of time. Meetings all too often degenerate into battleelds where no one wins and everyone loses. Goals are lost sight of, common aims go unfullled, as the soul forces rend one and all. Like physical abuse and violence, soul abuse and violence are on the increase. Again mistrust is bred, this time leading to strong, antipathies and even hatred. Spiritually also war holds sway, the opposing forces are working in many ways to undermine human striving. Just recently in East Grinstead a man applying to open an occult shop was quoted as saying: \"This will stick a dagger through the hearts of religious leaders in the town\".... \"A lot of people come into the occult from other religions because we don't preach, we can prove Christianity has nothing but a Bible\". Rudolf Steiner expected us to seek out the46 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 F I R S T A I D AT T H E T U R N O F T H E C E N T U RY 47 \"othar Michaelites\". Are we active enough in this or have we become dogmatic and foil to recognise them sufciently? Unrecognised and imsupported such Michaelites are open to other forces and may in turn contribute to setting all- against-all. Many negative forces in many different guises are striving to turnhuman beings ftomthe mi(kllepath ofbalance. Their ef forts are becoming more and more forceful, leading once more to mistrust and doubt It is not the rst time war on many levels and chaos descend upon this century sweeping away old order , causing suffering and misery . They bring new opportunities too. Can we manage to grasp even one or two of them? Are we prepared enough to bring about the Threefold Social Order should the possibility to do so arise again? When war broke out in 1914 many nations were represented among the people working on the rst Goetheanum. While the men were called up totheir respective countries' armies to ght against each other , the women w e r e l e f t b e h i n d . T h e y w e r e , o f c o u r s e , w o r r i e d a n d f e a r f u l f o r t h e i r m e n a n d at times highly emotional. Rudolf Steiner reorganised the work so that all were occupied and also gave what is known as the First Aid or \"Samaritan Course. In it, all were taught various First Aid techniques but before these p r a c t i c a l s e s s i o n s t o o k p l a c e , R u d o l f S t e i n e r a l w a y s g a v e a l e c t u r e \" t o p l a c ethe spiritual understanding of the issue in the foreground\".* In these l^toes three verses, or meditations, were given which, although quite distinct, a u g m e n t e a c h o t h e r , i n t e r w e a v i n g t o r e a c h o u t f a r f u r t h e r t h a n w h e n u s e d individually , being then for the good of humanity , not one or a few alone.

The break allows the world etheric forces to work in \u2014 these would be destructive if not organised.

These are not in print, but may appear in German, Easter 1992In the soul realm we move rom the past into the present from the individual to the group or community which, if \"gathering\" well, may connect to the Christ. The second verse has to do with pain. If one asks people about their worst pain, most will describe soul pain \u2014 {rfiysical pain is more easily overcome. Illness and death have come to take their place in life for many people who are prepared to work actively with them. However, pain is all too often considered to be negative; most people are frightened of itand yet most of us experience it at some time. This fear of pain for oneself makes one want to suppress it in others, so as to treat one's fear and in^ility to accompany someone else through pain. Fear exacerbates pain; it causesone to withdraw , worsening it Pain, like fear , needs to be met face-to-face; then it can be transformed into a cleansing and awakening con^iou^ss. Pain requires empathy, not sympathy or antipathy \u2014 a willing, joyful sharing. All too often, only pain can teach us what we need to learm Just as Simon of Gyrene could take up the Cross and nd blessing and joy in that burden so, too, we in our times need to take up the Cross of pain and learn to nd the joy and blessings in it So lange du den As long as thou dost S c h m e r z e r f u h l e s t f e e l t h e p a i n D e r m i c h m e i d e t T h a t a v o i d s m e , 1st Christus unerkannt Unrecognised is the the World-Being. Denn schwach nur bleibet For weak remains d e r G e i s t t h e S p i r i t Wenn er allein im eignen Leibe When, only in its own body Des Leidenftihlens machtig ist. Does it have the power to feel pain. In the last verse the spirit is addressed, leading to the future and the evolution of humanity . It is our spirit that, through eternity , allows us to unite with other beings. On earth we are only separate bein^ by day . At night we join with the hierarchies bringing them our day activity . Amongthese beings is the Folk-Spirit of the country to which one belongs. The Folk-Spirits form a choir around the Christ but are dependent, for their proper working into a country's destiny, on the human beings of that country . T o help rather than hinder our Folk-Spirit we need to be aware of its maturity and its mission\u2014is it a future one, active now^-or just ending? What qualities does it need from us \u2014 vigour, enthusiasm, or quiet deep thought? If we can help our Folk-Spirit full its mission we enable the choir round the Christ to sound harmoniously, giving peace to earth. New order can enter, resolving discords and building accord.4 8 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 Du meines Erdenraumes Geist!

Christ. In the first verse the physical body \u2014 the temple \u2014 is made whole through the healing breath. In the second, taking on another's pain allows the Christ to work visibly in the world. In the third, the Folk-Spirit is revealed through the help of human beings in new order and peace. Healing, Christ's working and cosmic order are given in Aese verses \u2014the Christ between spring and autumn: Raphael and Michael. The sword of Michael and the staff of Raphael overcome and tend the opposing forces \u2014 a revelation of the Christ's working \u2014 leading to a new balance which can carry us into the 21st century.49 S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L A Y From Politics to Mystery in Prometheus Unbound Andrew Welburn When Percy Bysshe Shelley left England in 1818 for the \"divinest climate\" and the \"bright blue sky\" of Italy, accompanied by his wife Mary and her intriguing half-sister, Qaire Clairmont, he was saying good-bye not only to the English drizzle, but to an intractable situation in English and European politics. It was a situation remarkably unlike our present one, as we contem plate closer cultural and economic links with a Europe that has itself recently witnessed the collapse of the hideous barriers which for so long divided it Indeed in most ways it was the polar opposite of otor world. For it was engaged in resolutely re-erecting the old divisions after the shock of revolution, and the destructive cycle which revolution had inaugurated. A whole generation felt its hopes blighted by the failiure of the French Revolution to bring in the new order they had dreamed of, and the alarming swiftness with which idealism turned into bloodbath: Names are there. Nature's sacred watchwords, they Were borne aloft in bright emblazonry; The nations thronged around, and cried aloud. As with one voice. Truth, liberty, and love! Suddenly erce confusion fell from heaven Among them: there was strife, deceit and fear.... Those events form the background of Shelley's great poetic drama Prometheus Unbound, from which the lines are taken: it is a vision of human potentiality, both for endurance and suffering and for joyous renewal. The nightmare events in France and their repressive repercussions across Europe convinced Shelley of the need for a profounder understanding of human nature. He himself was among those who wished to advance what he termed \"a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society\" \u2014 a kind of charter for the new Europe. But he was all too \"aware that until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the harvest of his happiness\". It is obvious that for all the surface difference between that age and50 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L AY51 ours, the lessons to be learned are enormously relevant. Shelley was not among those who advocated \"the wisdom of a high despair\": his drama is a vision of change, and change on an apocalyptic scale. But much more than his predecessors he sees that change must come from what he called in a later poem \"the mystery within\". The key to the modem predicament of man does notlie directly in tampering with the structures of society and economic life. Such attempts fail because they cannot create the people suited to inhabit the post-revolutionary world: the old scars remain, the old struggles re-emerge. Efforts then to control the spiritual life by extemal authority become more repressive than the old regime the revolution was supposed to supersede. And they do not work. We have learned all over again that even the subtle attempt to convince people that their thinking is only 'ideology', a product of the social system and not a creative force within it, did not work. So Shelley proposes something different: a change from within. His solution, in the simplest terms, is to create new people rst and let the social aiid political changes flow organically from their needs. He asks for a change in awareness. And he asks those who awaken to the new possibilities but are bom ahead of their time \u2014 \"the children of a diviner day\" \u2014 to endure the Promethean sufferings which life in the unregenerate world entails, in the knowledge that change must and will come. They after all are equipped to meetthose sufferings in a way that the unawakened, suddenly precipitated by disturbing changes into a demanding and confusing post-revolutionary situat i o n , c a n n o t b e a s k e d t o c o p e w i t h t h e i r s . T h e r e s u l t s o f a S h e l l e y a n \" r e v o l u t i o n in consciousness\" are, he admits, less outwardly spectacular tihan the revolu t i o n a r y c o n v u l s i o n o f E u r o p e . B u t i t s e f f e c t s , t h o u g h m i l d , a r e m o r e c e r t a i n a n d ultimately more far-reaching. Indeed, when the Spirit of the Hour flies throughthe world in Act HI blowing on its oracular shell \"A long, long sound, as it would never end\", we recognise a beautifully imagined though novel version of the Last Trumpet. And all things are made new \u2014 or , as Shelley puts it in quintessentially E n g l i s h f o r m \" a l l / W e r e s o m e w h a t c h a n g e d \" . W h a t h a s c h a n g e d i s t h e q u a l i t yof awareness. Everything is the same, yet subtly different. Reptiles and newts and creatures often regarded as ugly are still there, but now even they seem beautiful, \"And that with little change of shape or hue\". Human reptiles too put off their \"foul disguise\" because they are seen with different eyes. Human s o e i e t y i s d i f f e r e n t , b e c a u s e t h e s p i r i t i n w h i c h p e o p l e m e e t i t s d e m a n d s h a s a l s o subtly altered, though there has been no violent upheaval. A 'Last Judgment'has b^n passed, but without any of the lurid disasters attending upon it in the popular religious imagination, to be awaited in fear and trembling. With gentle humour , Shelley makes the reality of inner change humanly accessible, when a startled and bleary-eyed humanity turns out of its bed at the Last Trumpet. There is no miraculous and sudden overturning of the limits of human nature:all Were somewhat changed, and after brief surprise And greetings of delighted wonder, all Went to their sleep again. The new world, after all, will be there in the morning. We shall be changed: but the twinkling is mostly in Shelley's eye. Shelley makes the point that the new world, when it comes, must be habitable, not a world of Sunday-best behaviour. Yet the effects of the transformation are genuinely far-reaching as we see above all in Act IV: there the changes that have begun in man, by a kind of avalanche-effect spread through the cosmos. In the awakened cosntic consciousness of man, the universe itself rises to a new level of existence, and acquires a human meaning from the renewed harmony between man and nature to which such a consciousness leads. The transformation is only attained, moreover, through enormous spiritual effort \u2014 the tragic intensities of Act I, the fantastic journey of Act II braving the dangers of the dark unknown, the unfathomable Ahrimanic gloom of Demogorgon's cave. Shelley's ex traordinary presentation of inner processes through imagery \"drawn from the operations of the human mind\" has alternately thrilled and baffled generations of readers. On the whole it is the tragically enduring gure of Prometheus, the god who was punished for \"too much love of humankind\", interpreted by the poet as a symbol of suffering man himself, who has attracted the most admiration. The 'mystery' scenes of the later Acts have been treated with some suspicion, or dismissed as fantasy outright. Y et those who do so not only fail to understand the whole spirit of Shelley's lyrical drama by calling it a 'retreat' from political reality. They fail to see that the deeper analysis of retreat is precisely the poet's starting-point, the problem to which he offers a brilliant and spiritually coherent solution. The events of the Revolution and its aftermath had led to a cul-de-sac, a retreat from which there is no way out except a step forward in consciousness. When he began to compose the drama in the autumn of 1818, amid the \"mountainous ruins\" of Roman antiquity, Shelley already had behind him a brief but important career as a political activist. He had written pamphlets; he had given speeches in Ireland; he had worked at a model community in Wales; he had launched messages urging reform in balloons and in bottles, harangued bishops and been put under observation by government agents. His early poetry too is a passionate denunciation of tyranny in all its forms, including those forms which hide under the name of religion. But all these efforts had been failures. He and the handfril of radical friends who supported his ideas could not single-handedly undo the reactionary measures of a shaken Establishment after the events in France.52 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L AY 53 Shelley was ever more isolated, and eventually left England for Italy. The 'Earth-born\" god Prometheus, shackled alone on the edge of the world for trying to improve the condition of mankind but still hurling up deance at the apparently all-powerful \"tyrant of the world\", thus presents himself on one level as the vehement young poet himself. His spirit is unbroken, but he bums with resentment against his chains. In an early prose romance called The Assassins, Shelley had explored one imaginative projection of this dilemma. The story introduces into corrupt society a stranger from a lost world, from an oriental 'happy valley' where remote isolation has preserved a fragment of the unfallen world. The youthful idealist is appalled by what he sees, and has no alternative but to \"wage unremitting hostility from principle\" against its institutions. But he is understood neither by the oppressors nor the oppressed whom he is trying to save. Shelley never nished the story , but the way in which he hints at the course it would take shows a disquieting possibility: He would nd himself compelled to adopt means which they would abhor, for the sake of an object which they could not conceive that he should propose to himself. Secure and self-enshrined in the magni cence and pre-eminence of his conceptions, spotless as the light of heaven, he would be the victim among men of calumny and persecu tion. Incapable of distinguishing his motives, they would rank him among the vilest and most atrocious criminals. TTie twentieth century has made such gures all too familiar. The self- enshrined representative of 'the people' becomes the terrorist ghting for those who condemn him. Shelley never afrmed such a role. Describing his reasons for choosing the Promethean myth for his mature poetic statement, he explicitly contrasts with it the Satanic gures of modern literature, who engender in the mind a \"pernicious casuistry\". \"But Prometheus is, as it were, the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.\" The opening passages of Prometheus Unbound \u2014 the great dramatic speeches of the bound Titan\u2014pose the alternatives. Prometheus could still go either way. As we rst meet him, he is still the solitary idealist raging atthe world because it does not live up to his ideals, hurling curses at the \"all- prevailing\" tyrant of the world, dramatised as Jupiter. The treatment is genuinely dramatic, and we must not naively take Prometheus as a calm spokesman of Shelley's philosophy. Prometheus claims that his solitary resistance to tyranny has taught him to \"reign and triumph\" over the scorn of his fellow men and his own despair:torture and solitude. Scorn and despair, \u2014 these are mine empire: \u2014 More glorious far than that which thou surveyest From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God! The tone is hollow. Prometheus claims to be free from personal desire for vengeance and to be waiting philosophically for the inevitable hour \u2014 the h o u r w h i c h : As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood From these pale feet, which then might trample thee If they disdained not such a prostrate slave. Disdain! Ah no! I pity thee. The language of hysterical fantasy undoes the claim as he makes it. \"Hirough the events of the play , Prometheus will indeed become \"king over himself; he will indeed make the Earth the \"calm empire of a happy soul\". But the reality behind the words has to be won in the course of the drama. Even by the end of Act I, Prometheus must still say \"I would fain /Be what it is my destiny to be\". What Shelley offers us is not a stiff allegory , but a dramatic presentation of profound inner development, achieved by convincingly human sufferings and gradual self-knowledge. As he speaks, Prometheus stands on the verge of an inner break through. Those readers who have regretted the 'inward' turning of the play may consider , however , where continued deance would have led. And the fact that in modern history Shelley's call for a revolution in consciousness has met so little understanding may lead them to reflect on his remarkably prophetic words in The Assassins for our age of terrorism. Shelley's 'lyrical drama', however, exposes the situation to much deeper consideration. For it emerges that Prometheus' chains are not so much literal fetters as what Blake termed \"the mind-forged manacles\", the limits we unwittingly place upon our own vision. Despite his heroic stance, Prometheus is entangled in a web of illusions. It seems to him that his resentment is directed ultimately against the nature of things. For Jupiter is the \"tyrant of the world\" in far more than a political sense alone. Shelley's tremendous image of the Titan bound to the rock is a symbol not only of the idealist's social isolation, but much more widely of the estrangement of modern man in the material universe. Jupiter's tyranny is that of a state of consciousness: the vision of the world as cold and inhuman, where man is always an outsider and onlooker, always an alien. Repeatedly in Act I the struggle between Jupiter and Prometheus is characterised as a struggle54 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L AY 55 between two intense consciousnesses; they alone of living things are unsleeping. Shelley dramatises the modern, highly conscious position of the individual, and the cruel fact that the more he develops his consciousness, the more he is faced by the otherness, the alienness of the world. Many are unwilling to face that fact, and so draw back from fully unfolding then- individuality. It is their fears which play into the hands of earthly tyrants, for they wish to shelter behind the 'strong man' who will make their decisions and face the modem dilemma for them \u2014 or at least claim to. The rst turning-point in the play is reached when Prometheus breaks the deadlock in what has become an unreal stmggle against 'absolute' tyranny\u2014a struggle which simply has the effect of prolonging man's state of alienation. He realises diml y that he is a prisoner of his own way of seeing, of a Luciferic illusion. Hitherto it seemed that he was condemned to his lonely estrangement by a power 'out there', external to himself. Now it begins to emerge that the key to his situation and its transformation lies within himself. Recalling the events which brought him to his present position of ultimate retreat, and the curse of endless deance in which he vented his frustration and sense of neglect, he decides at last to change things from within. He decides to withdraw the curse. All the extraordinary and seemingly fantastic events of the drama are really consequences of that moment of inner transformation. It affects not only Prometheus himself but the world he experiences around him. The Earth, his mother, and the elements of nature share in his fears, and in a shange and moving scene they struggle, only half-successfully, to commu nicate with him. But the achievement of that communion with an imagina tively apprehended nature cannot yet be brought about: it will constitute the dazzling 'operatic' nale of Act IV. Nor is Prometheus' suffering instantly relieved \u2014 if anything it is intensied. He sees clearly the inner hopes and fears of human nature which are the real objects of any genuine struggle to alter man's condition. The fawning messenger-god Mercury comes to offer him a retreat from reality into a dre^- world \"laf^jed in voluptuous Joy\", or otherwise to threaten him with the Furies, the powCT s of despair and disillusionment which eat into man's heart. But Prometheus yields neither to temptation nor threat, which would mean aban doning his essential humanity . The Furies tear asunder the veil which protectst h e m i n d f r o m i t s o w n d e e p e s t h o r r o r s , s h o w i n g h i m e v e r y t h i n g t h a t r e m a i n s unt(wch^by the surface 'enlightenment' which does no more than paper overor ^sguise. That, as they explain, is why \"all best tilings are thus confused to ill\": they send two visions as 'emblems' \u2014 the one of the French Revolution, whose idealism was swallowed up in blood; the other, which Shelley symboli cally places beside it, of Christ crucied and his act of loving sacrice perverted to the tortures of the Inquisition by his followers.The perspective of the Titan has profoundly changed, however. He is not driven to despair by the one; and the other becomes an emblem of his own \"unrepentant pains\". The vision of the \"youth /With patient looks nailed to a cmcix\" is subtly superimposed for us upon the image of Prometheus chained to the rock. When the Furies say they will spread \"a pillow of thorns for thy slumberless head\", and add that: Drops of bloody agony flow From his white and quivering brow it is not to the visionary 'emblem' that they are referring but to the Titan himself. It is a sign that his sufferings are no longer those of the outsider denouncing a world that has proved inadequate to his dream, but spring from a Christ-like acceptance of human nature in all its imperfections as a starting-point for renewal. At that moment for Prometheus, the agonies of Christ are also his own. Rudolf Steiner has pointed to the link between the archaic myth of Prometheus bound to the material 'rock' of earth and the Christ-event \u2014 a redeeming act which also has its essential meaning in earthly as much as heavenly terms. Shelley was never to number himself among the followersof Christ, whom he imagined \"Wailing for the faith he kindled\" when he saw its historical degradation to a system of oppression. But he was guided by the sureness of his imagination to a perception of the inner meaning of Christianity not as a faith but as a 'mystery' \u2014 a truth of man's spiritual nature rising from within. It led him to deepen the dramatic 'turning-point' of Prometheus' self-regeneration into a vision of the event which formed the 'turning-point of time', and to connect it with the possibility of renewal for the Europe of his own age and ours. The Cycle of the Mysteries and the Breathing Earth Act I of Prometheus Unbound is an Easter mystery more profound than many professions of Christian faith. The dark mood is relieved, too, by the Spirits of Human Mind who end the Act with their hopeful prophecies. Their mingled sadness and sweetness signals a new and again essentially Christian condence. Human beings may have vast capability for causing pain and desolation: but against that must be set their acts of unpredictable selflessness, fellow-feeling and creativity, their capacity for understand ing others and for love. Shelley arrives at his vision, however, not by religious afrmation but by his own imaginative probing of man's situa tion on earth. And it is part of his whole plan of the drama to show the spiritual relationship of man to the cycle of earthly life through the year \u201456 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L AY 57 the festival year of the Mysteries which as Rudolf Steiner describes arose out of the very constitution of the earth and its movement in cosmic space. Though it begins by turning inward to the sources of regeneration, the drama will nally include the amazing vision of the macrocosm and the transformed body of the Earth and Moon, united through human love. A key to the human and cosmic transformations which ensue is the mention of \"the breathing earth\". In Act U we witness the journey of Asia, Prometheus' beloved sea-nymph and perhaps on a deeper level a symbol of his higher self, to the depths of the earth. With her sister Panthea she travels through strange elemental worlds, inhabited by fauns, spirits, dreams and echoes. Everything there is in constant movement \u2014 beautifully contrasting with the statuesque and tragic rst Act. Everything is dimly lit, and in the \"gloom divine\" there are fitful glimpses oflights and flashes of phosphorescence\u2014contrasting with the intense consciousness of the unsleeping Utan in Act I. They are not alone in travelling on that \"secret way\". \"All spirits\" must be borne along by theenchantededdiesof mysterious force, \"As inland boats are driven to Ocean\" by the irresistible current of a river . So gentle yet inevitable is the force that they do not even know they are being transported. What is this force? Those who saw Say from the breathing earth behind There steams a plume-uplifting wind Which drives them on their path, while they Believe their own swift wings and feet The sweet desires within obey: And so they float upon their way. Until, still sweet, but loud and strong, TTie storm of sound is driven along.... It leads them, \"Like clouds amid the yielding air\", from mountain heights down into the dark centre of the living and breathing earth, into the depths of matter: Demogorgon's cave. Shelley is representing imaginatively the in-breathing of the earlft, though of course he does not intend us to think literally of an intake of air .'Rie \"plume-uplifting wind\" is spiritual and metaphorical, being at the same time a flow of sound, a magnetic power , an impelling emotion. W e are in the world of souls, the realm of dream and the half-light behind the veil of consciousness. But Shelley evidently knew from his studies of Mystery- teachings, alchemical and Rosicrucian authors, that the secret of the festival cycle was to be understood as a breathing-process of the planet itself. Perhaps he also knew of Goethe's contemporary experiments with the barometer, measuring the rise and fall of the air-pressure in the course of theyear. Charting the fall and rise of the mercury in the tube, Goethe was able to give the idea a scientic exactitude while still relating to the 'primary phenomenon' of breathing the cycle of atmospheric changes. The \"enchanted eddies\" bring Asia \"Down, down\": yet by Scene iii she and Panthea have only reached \"A Pinnacle of Rock\" high in the mountains, from which they survey in wonder the surface of the earthly world. Looking down they marvel at the tremendous forces \u2014 vulcanism, glaciers \u2014 which shape the natural landscape. The in-breathing process is thus a force bringing them toward incarnation, toward material embodiment in \"the realm of Demogorgon\" on whose verge they now stand. And it must take them ftirther still, into the very depths, into actual material existence. In Demogorgon's cave they can ask the Lord of earthly power then- questions about the nature of life. Does physical existence have only the meaning it had for the chained Prometheus? This 'questioning' of the Ahrimanic power is Shelley's symbol, then, for incarnation. Our lives here are \u2014 or ought to be \u2014 an exploration and a questioning of the meaning of the earth. The imagery of entering into a dark cave after their descent through elemental worlds has obvious connotations of entering into the darkness of the womb. And the nature of the power which rules there: Ungazed upon and shapeless; neither limb. Nor form nor outline; yet we feel it is A living Spirit suggests the chaos rom which form and outline will indeed take shape. (Thereis a hint too of the Spirit brooding upon the watery \"waste and void\" x)m the Book of Genesis.) But whereas for most of those Irome upon that \"secret way\" the process remains unconscious\u2014hence dttrkness\" and the \"rays of gloom\" emanating ftom the cave \u2014 for Asia and Panthea it has become a conscious quest. The answers to the questions of life do not in fact come -om the enigmatic Demogorgon, but from Asia herself. It is her own soul which provides them: \"and of such truths /Each to itself must be the oracle\". They can only be awakened, however, in the encounter with life's experience, witti the conditions of material life. A light then begins to shine in the depths of the dark cave \u2014 a light shining from Asia herself! In the following scenes the light is revealed as the spiritual \"lamp of earth\", which gives meaning and beauty to the \"dim shapes\" of things tere below. It is the light of higher consciousness, shining in the djffkness. Shelley all but tells us that it is his version of the Christ-light, bom in us at the point in the seasonal cycle when the earth is most deeply in-breathed, at the winter solstice. Then the initiates of the ancient Mysteries had58 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 S H E L L E Y ' S M Y S T E R Y P L AY 59 celebrated the birth of the light, symbolically lighting a lamp in the darkness of a cave at dead of night. The early Christians still understood the Mystery signicance of the birth of the Christ at that same time of the year. Shelley gives us a new \"mystery of birth\" in the imagination he creates of Asia's descent and the coming of \"the hour\"\u2014the hour of man's liberation. Yet something very strange has happened. Act II began in spring, and followed on the \"Easter mystery\" of Act I. No w, however, it has turned out that time has not gone forward but backward to Christmas. This will only surprise us if we forget that Shelley is imagining all this from the standpoint of the spiritual, not the physical world. Because it is raised into consciousness, moreover, the birth that he describes is not \"a sleep and a forgetting\", but a reawakening to our spiritual origins and a reversal of the earthly perspective. Asia sings: We have passed Age's icy caves. And Manhood's dark and tossing waves. And Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray: Beyond the glassy gulfs we flee Of shadow-peopled Infancy, Through Death and Birth, to a diviner day .... A^^t has taken place is not just natural birth; it is also a spiritual 'Death and Birth', an initiation. The time-cycle continues to run backward, and in Act III brings us to Michaelmas \u2014 though again, Shelley has re-imagined everything in his own unique terms rather than borrowing older forms. We have seen, however, that Act III is a kind of gentle apocalypse, with the Spirit of theHour blowing the Last Trumpet over the sleeping world. After the turning inward necessary to nd the sources of renewal, Shelley's drama looks outward again. History , which had reached an impasse, moves forward once more. Ihe Act can best be seen as a kind of historical pageant of the new age, 1^ by the Spirit of the Hour . But its events also belong in their timelesssignicance to one of the four great Mystery-festivals of the spiritual year , namely the Michael festival of the autumnal turning-point when the ancientinitiates celebrated the day of Mithra. And once more Shelley has re-created the Mystery-images in modem form. The Qiristian form of the festival centres on the great symbol of Nchael ghting the dragon. The symbol has roots in much older mytholo gies, where sometimes the 'beast' is a dragon, or a powerful animal like a bull, or a monster from the sea. In each case the animal-nature is mastered by the forces of the spirit, the angel, or the god of light. The Mysteries of Mithra especially prepared the way for the Christian vision in this respect.and there we nd all this symbolism richly developed. Even at his birth, the light-god Mithra calmed the heaving ocean\u2014the image of the dark depths in man's passionate nature, from which monsters may indeed rise. Reliefs found in the Mithraic sanctuaries often show the child-god and the gure of Oceanus standing calmly before him. It is this mystery-image which Shelley chooses in Act III, Scene ii. In accordance with the classical mythology he calls the Sun-god not Mithra, but Apollo. However, we know from the studies of myth that had been undertaken by Shelley's friend, the occultist John Frank Newton, that he identied Apollo and Mithra in a scheme designed to bring out the deeper unity of all mythologies. The Ocean and Apollo in Act III reproduce an emblem from the Mysteries. The sea itself is still called a \"monster\"; but now it is \"hungering for calm\" and henceforth it will \"heave, unstained with blood\". The modern mystery is not one of violent dragon-slaying so much as an inner victory, exactly as Shelley's drama portrays, and as Rudolf Steiner insisted when he spoke of the need for a new Michael festival. The macrocosmic Act IV is so full of mysteries that we cannot begin to go into details here. It corresponds to the Mystery of midsummer , the fullest out- breathing of the earth, when the soul of man too is opened to cosmic secrets ina mood of reverent expansiveness, freed from too close a dependence on the things of material existence and the body . On the vast scale of man's spiritual destiny , imagined by Shelley as the transformation of the earth. Act IV offers us a glimpse of the cosmic bodies of Earth and Moon united in one living whole; but more immediately, something of that future transformation can be felt in the foiuth Mystery festival. It is the polar opposite of Act n. There we saw the in breathing, incarnating phase of the life of the earth: now it is breathing out, far out into the void of \"hungry space\" where the cold Moon, that \"little world of death\", circles in its orbit. The future union of the two planets and the awakening to life of the frozen Moon is unforgettably presented by Shelley in the wonderful lyrical poetry of his last Act. But it is simply the fullment of the breathing rhythm of the earth, a further extension of the present out-breathing, which will nally enfold and shelter the Moon, bringing it back into the life-cycle of our world. Shelley hints at the process thus: T h e M o o n : The shadow of white death has passed From my path in heaven at last, A clinging shroud of solid frost and sleep; And through my newly woven bowers. Wander happy paramours. Less mighty, but as mild as those who keep Thy vales more deep.60 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 61 T h e E a r t h : As the dissolving warmth of dawn may fold A half unfrozen dew-globe, green and gold, And crystalline, till it becomes a winged mist. And wanders up the vault of the blue day. Outlives the noon, and on the sun's last ray Hangs o'er the sea, a fleece of re and amethyst. The Moon tells the Earth that now it will be \"Sheltered by the warm embrace /Of thy soul from hungry space\". But in all this, we must remember that in Shelley's vision it is man himself who plays the crucial transforming role. Though it includes images of social and political transformation, Shelley's drama makes it clear that the answers to humanity's problems cannot be tackled productively within any but the broadest perspective. The failure of violent revolution was a symptom of the need for much deeper and more far- reaching answers to man's predicament\u2014answers which Shelley found orcreated for his poetic presentation of the new Mystery-cycle. Ttu'ough ite symbols, we can explore a much more profound vision of human possibili ties, where man is not an outsider or onlooker but a loving and beloved childof earth. Already in Act III, the earth begins to be rejuvenated by the kiss of Prometheus, the \"earth-bom\"\u2014one could say, the human\u2014god. The crisisof the whole earthly environment today shows that if we do not give oiu p l w e t t h e k i s s o f l o v e a n d l i f e , w e w i l l g i v e i t t h e k i s s o f d e a t h .

Paperback \u00a35.95 It is somehow very tting that in the year of his death, this concise and very practical work on meditation by JOrgen Smit should become available in English. Where the life of the spirit is concemed, the English do not seem to have the appetite, even the stom ach, for lengthy and detailed exegesis in the way that some other cultures nd acceptable. Those who have had the privi lege of working with or hearing Jorgen Smit on the subject of the inner life will inevitably have heen impressed, not only by his intensity and dynamism, but also by his clarity and simplicity. Nowhere is this more striking than in his treatment of themes that seem to invite the opposite: \"Medita tion \u2014 Transforming our Lives for the Encounter with Christ\". What is an encounter with Christ? The issue is treated soberly as a phenomenon thatis coming into the lives of more and more people, by no means necessarily remarkable individuals, often at a moment of crisis. \"When we have come to the limit of despair and of total impotence, a point where we'd simply like to give up and put an end to our own life\u2014if we are able to bear this and try to penetrate beyond it, then it may happen that Christ is sud denly there, as a friend, immediately perceptible at the moment\". Inner and outer pressures to day make it ever more likely that individuals will nd themselves in such a situation of crisis. The description of work with meditation and preparatory exercises which Jorgen Smit gives here, places the reader in a position to prepare for such a moment on the one hand and to undertake a fruitful development of inner experiences on the other . Y et at no time is one asked to relinquish the waking, questioning consciousness that is the hallmark of our age. On the contrary , the \"inner observer\", as Smit describes the voice in us which con tinually asks, \"What are you doing? What is going on?\", is the starling point for work at meditation and at the strengthening of the soul faculties of thinking, feeling and willing. This slim volume admirably meets the needs both of those who have a vague interest in the subject of62 T H E G O L D E N B L A D E 1 9 9 2 b o o k r e v i e w s 63 meditation and what it really involves, and of those who wish to do it and need practical guidance in what steps to take and how to deal with what follows from taking them. It seems designed for carrying on one's person. The translation successfully renders the lucidity and rmness of JOrgen Smit's style and leaves the con tent as accessible in English as it was in German. \"THE MYSTERY OF ARTHUR AT TINTAGEL\" by Richard Seddon Rudolf Steiner Press, 1990. 190 pages. Paperback It is a source of continued wonder that the theme of King Arthur and the Round T able, together with the re lated theme of the Holy Grail, should perennially excite interest, interpretation and research in the way that they do. Particularly in the last few decades since the second World War there has been a resurgence of interest in the \"once and future king\". Look i n g i n t o t h e r e s e a r c h d o n e b y G e o f f r e y Ashe and others there seems little to indicate that there was a historical personage of such stature that he should continue to be a cult gure worldwide 1400 years after his pre sumed death. Nor indeed is the early literature in which the adventures of King Arthur and his knights feature.of such artistic merit as to account on its own for the spread of Arthur's fame. In this book, which is evidently the fruit of years of patient study and enthusiastic research, Richard Seddon puts forward the case that there is a corpus of Arthurian mysteries going back to around 1100 EC, in which Arthur is a title, like pharaoh, rather than a proper name and of which now there remains only a legendary echo. A sequence of 12 battles described in various early sources can thus be seen, not as physical or histori cal events, nor indeed as the products of a poetic imagination, but rather as distinct stages in the process of initiation which belonged to a kingly calling. Those are described and documented in detail in the chapters entitled 'Battles of the Soul' and 'Bat tles of the Spirit'. This at once links the legend with an archetypal human experience which we nd is referred to in such discrete works as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Epic of Gilgamesh, Dante's Divine Comedy or the Dreamsong of Olav Asteson. This then vests in it the power to stir the deepest parts of the human being, the more so today since increasingly each indi vidual is feeling a kingly calling in the domains of his own soul and spirit. In the words of Christopher Fry , \"Affairs are now soul-size\". Anyone who, in response to this, wishes to look into the Arthurian legends in more depth will nd, in Richard Seddon's well-researched book, an invaluable guide not only tothe geographical and historical back ground but also to the literary sources, all illumined by the many references to this theme in the work of Rudolf Steiner. By no means always easy reading, it is however very well organised and remarkably rewarding, combining as it does the fruits of a meditative approach with those of scholarship. \" T H E M A G I C A L W O R L D O F T H E I N K L I N G S \" by Gareth Knight Element Books, 1990. 258 pages. Paperback, \u00a39.99 It was Schiller who saw that the human being is most truly human when at play, and linking this with St. John the Evangelist's perception of the creative godhead as the Word, or Logos, we may perhaps say that in play with words, with the medium of language, the human being can experience a faint echo of the creative act that brought forth the universe. Certainly many whose child hoods have been enriched by the worlds of the imagination created by C. S. Lewis in his \"Tales of Namia\" and J. R. Tolkien in \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" will carry with them into adulthood a lasting wonder at the fecundity of language in the hands of a poet or of a child. Those who pursued this in more depth will then undoubtedly have come acrossthe other two, perhaps slightly less well known, members of the group of O x f o r d w r i t e r s k n o w n a s t h e \" I n k lings\" \u2014 Charles Williams and Owen Bareld. It is the latter who writes of language in his \"Romanticism Comes of Age\": \"It seemed there was some magic in it, and a magic which not only gave me pleasure but also reacted on and expanded the meanings of the individual words concerned\". Gareth Knight's recently-pub lished book on the Inklings gives the reader an insight into the life and work of each of the authors mentioned which is remarkable both for its dispassion ate scholarship and the understanding it brings to bear on the subject. Many will feel that they have gained a more conscious appreciation of a phenomenon of our time \u2014 and the extraordinary impact these writers have had certainly is one, and indeed a phenomenon in their own lives. The book is attractively laid out and illustrated and contains a wealth of interesting biographical material along side the sympathetic analysis of the major themes of each author's work. W. B.

Myths and esoteric tractions have always contained the idea that the earth is one ^eat living entity, with which mankind has a constantly changing relationship. Gaia-Sophia bridges the gap between the natural and spiritual sciences. It presents a new way of looking at the anatomy and I^y^logy of our planet, based on the ideas of Plato, Kepler, Goethe, Rudolf Steiner and many others, showing the spiri tual influence on the evolution of life on earth. The planetary orgartism is described as a complex of eco systems with ve levels. All life processes are organized accor- cSng to similar principles, includ ing the organization of the hu man body. This vefold model of the living Earth is a valuable tool in guiding \u00abivironmental policy. It provides basic principles for land use, community g-owth and a balanced lifestyle. It shows that environmental protection requires development to be sus tainable. The model also dem onstrates the disruptive nature of many modem industrial activities and gives guidelines for a more harmonious relationship between the human race and Gaia.

Jewish tradition arKf the ancient pagan mysteries start to fade in the light of mod em archaeological nds at Qumran and Nag Hammadi and of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual investigations. The Gnostic gos pels dearly reveal that early Christianity had a powerful eso t e r i c c u r r e n t T h i s i s a l s o r e flected in the New Testament writings of Mark, Paul and above all John. During the early centuries after Christ, Gnostic Christians tried to preserve this tradition, using the archaic mysteries as a way to knowledge (gnosis) of higher cosmic truths. In describing the pre-Chris tian roots and subsequent dev elopment of esoteric Christianity, t h e a u t h o r r e - e x a m i n e s t h e canonical texts and the perplex ing gures of Paul and John, both, in their own way, initiates into higher awareness. The Gnostic sects were nally suppressed by an orthodoxy which had lost sight of the dyn amic of the self,' the author c o n d u d e s .
