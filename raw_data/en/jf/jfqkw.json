Chiropractic [Read More](1-description) A person's spine is made of twenty-four bones called vertebrae. Throughout our lives our bodies suffer from micro traumas that cause our vertebrae to misalign. This is called a subluxation. Subluxations put pressure on nerves resulting in pain, numbness and tingling. Chiropractic care provides people with a natural and non-invasive way to relieve pain through realigning the vertebrae through a series of gentle adjustments, allowing 100% of the nerve energy to reach the tissues it serves. With regular chiropractic care, patients can decrease discomfort and increase their mobility. Chiropractic care is suitable for people of all ages who are looking to move and feel better. Massage Therapy [Read More](2-description) Massage therapy helps support overall health and goes beyond simply having your muscles relaxed. Massage therapy is widely recommended and beneficial for a broad range of medical conditions such as anxiety, digestive disorders, jaw pain (TMJD), headaches, soft tissue injuries, sports injuries, fibromyalgia, chronic pain and more. Massage therapy consists of hands-on manipulation of the soft tissues of the body such as muscles, fascia, connective tissues, ligaments, joints, and so on in order to enhance health, increase mobility, and reduce pain. Within massage therapy is Cranial Sacral Therapy which requires attention to detail when working with the cranium (skull), spine, and sacrum (tail bone).
