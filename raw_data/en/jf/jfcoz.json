Host Defense Mushrooms One of the two following: Reishi capsules 2 capsules daily Reishi is a highly valued mushroom when it comes to cardiovascular health. As an excellent immune modulator, it balances the immune response in the blood and in the vascular endothelium, it supports healthy lipid and blood sugar profiles and improves ATP production to fuel the heart muscle cells. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Reishi is well known to augment Heart Qi. Overall, Reishi supports energy and stamina. Key features: Reishi has demonstrated its ability to reduce LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, reduce atherogenic index, and increase protective HDL cholesterol. (1) As a powerful antioxidant, it has also been show to reduce LDL oxidation. (2) But lipids are not the only way that Reishi is cardioprotective. Reishi can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, likely by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system. (3) Reishi's adaptogenic effect shines through here. And finally, Reishi mycelium was shown to support reduced plasma glucose and increased plasma insulin levels. (4)(5) Cordychi capsules 2 capsules daily Cordychi is a blend of equal parts Reishi and Cordyceps, two mushrooms that pair beautifully together. This formula enhances energy and oxygen uptake with cellular nutrients. Supports healthy immune response in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, as well as cardiovascular health. Choose over Resihi alone if seeking additional respiratory support. Key features: Reishi is a highly valued mushroom when it comes to cardiovascular health. As an excellent immune modulator it balances the immune response in the blood and in the vascular endothelium, it supports healthy lipid and blood sugar profiles, and improves ATP production to fuel the heart muscle cells. Cordyceps is being increasingly researched for the valuable support it may lend to balancing the upper respiratory system and lungs, in particular with regards to supporting improved oxygen intake and tolerance to hypoxia. (6) Possible add-ons: Chaga capsules 2 capsules daily Chaga's rich source of antioxidants against daily free-radical damage has a potential role in lowering blood pressure and preventing poor cardiovascular health. Chaga has an affinity for epithelial tissue in the skin, respiratory tract, digestive tract, and cardiovascular system and it exerts a balancing impact on immune function in these epithelial tissues. Key features: Chaga has shown a noticeable inhibition against lipid oxidation, (25) has demonstrated its potential capacity to reduce platelet aggregation, (26) and can reduce blood glucose levels while concurrently acting as a strong antioxidant and reduce other blood parameters such as cholesterol and triglycerides. (27) One of the two following: MycoBotanicals Blood Sugar capsules 2 capsules daily Blend of medicinal mushrooms and botanicals to help maintain healthy blood sugar levels, support pancreatic function, promote healthy glycemic response, and support insulin sensitivity. Key features: Maitake mycelia has been identified as support for reduced blood glucose levels in the blood after meals while supporting other blood parameters including triglycerides. (31) Reishi has been shown to support reduced plasma glucose and increased plasma insulin levels while simultaneously supporting other blood parameters such as cholesterol and triglycerides. (32) Chaga has also demonstrated a potential ability to reduce blood glucose levels while concurrently acting as a strong antioxidant and reducing other blood parameters such as cholesterol and triglycerides. (33) Maitake capsules 2 capsules daily Enhances a healthy glycemic balance by promoting normal blood sugar metabolism. Rich in 1-3, 1-4, and 1-6 Beta-glucans, well-known for promoting immune health. Key features: Maitake has been shown in research to support blood glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity. The mycelia have been identified as support for reduced blood glucose levels in the blood after meals while supporting other blood parameters including triglycerides. (34) Can choose over MycoBotanicals Blood Sugar if need to avoid potential contraindications with botanicals. Botanica [Click to view Botanica protocols ](https://fullscript.com/protocols?prototype=brand-protocols&n=Botanica&b=botanica) Hawthorn Liquid Herb 70 gtts (3.5 mL), two times daily Organic Hawthorn berry, leaf, and flower contain phytonutrients and antioxidants that have been researched to support several different aspects of cardiovascular health. Botanica's Hawthorn Liquid extract is a dilution of 1:3 and contains 330mg of dry herb equivalent per ml. Choose over Hawthorn liquid capsules if needing to dose more gently. Key features: Research suggests that hawthorn may potentially represent a safe, effective, nontoxic agent in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease. (9) traditional Chinese medicine, hawthorn berry is one of the most commonly recommended foods to help address elevated blood pressure. In a small randomized clinical trial, Hawthorn was shown to have a hypotensive effect in patients with diabetes taking medication. (10) Olive Leaf Liquid Capsules 1 capsule, two times daily Convenient capsules with the concentration of a liquid botanical to provide a potent, concentrated extract to offer cardioprotective, hypotensive and hypoglycemic support. Each of Botanica's liquid capsules contain 75 drops of a 1:1 fluid extract. The average tinctures on the market are generally a dilution of 1:3 to 1:6. One Botanica capsule is roughly equivalent to 350 drops of an average tincture (will vary with which dilution it is being compared to). Olive leaf is a powerful antioxidant and also offers immune support. Key features: Olive leaf has demonstrated great potential in cardiovascular disease. In a 2019 study, it was shown to decrease the Serum Amyloid (SAA)-induced release of IL-6 and attenuate the and pro-adhesive E-selectin in human coronary artery endothelial cells. (11) This ultimately leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects. Olive leaf has also long been used and more recently been studied for its hypotensive and lipid-lowering effects. (12) [Olive Leaf Liquid Capsules Product Sheet](https://fullscript.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-Leaf-Liquid-Capsules-Product-Sheet.pdf) Turmeric Liquid Capsules 1-3 capsules daily Convenient capsules with the concentration of a liquid botanical to provide a potent, concentrated extract to offer potent anti-inflammatory support. Rather than isolating curcumin, we use the whole plant with its complete range of compounds to maximize absorption into our digestive tract so it can be used by your body's cells. CO2 Supercritical extraction allows for a high concentration of lipid compounds such as curcuminoids and turmerones without the use of solvents. Helps modulate inflammatory pathways that affect the heart, joints, liver, and cellular health. Key features: Turmeric is well recognized for its powerful anti-inflammatory activity. Whole turmeric root delivers curcumin & full spectrum compounds, (19) plus bioperine for increased absorption. The cardiovascular protective properties of curcumin in cardiovascular diseases have been fully illustrated in numerous studies. Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties have been reported to be effective in improving cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetic cardiovascular complications, and cardiotoxicity. (20) Renew Life [Click to view Renew Life protocols ](https://fullscript.com/protocols?prototype=brand-protocols&n=Renew%20Life&b=renew-life) One of the two following: Super Critical Omega 1 softgel daily A potent, super-concentrated fish oil supplement with 790 mg of EPA and 140 mg of DHA per capsule, to help support nerve and cardiovascular health. Enteric-coated capsules made from fish gelatin. Added lipase and 1000 IU Vitamin D. Friend of the Sea\u00ae and International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) certifications. Choose over Ultra EPA if seeking additional DHA and Vitamin D. Key features: A systematic review of 21 research papers showed that \"marine omega-3 fatty acids are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, cardiac death, and coronary events, especially in persons with high cardiovascular risk\". (15) EPA works to decrease arterial stiffness, which may contribute to the antiarterial plaque effect seen in dyslipidemic patients taking EPA supplements. (16) Ultra EPA 1 softgel daily 1000mg EPA in each capsule to help maintain good overall health and support cardiovascular health, and to help reduce serum triglycerides. Enteric-coated capsules made from fish gelatin. Added lipase. Friend of the Sea\u00ae and International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) certifications. Key features: Patients with a history of coronary artery disease taking EPA, had a 19% reduction in major coronary events. In patients with no history of coronary artery disease, EPA reduced major coronary events by 18%. Unstable angina and non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced by EPA intake. (17) EPA works to decrease arterial stiffness, which may contribute to the antiarterial plaque effect seen in dyslipidemic patients taking EPA supplements. (18) Ultimate Flora Daily Balance Probiotics + Organic Prebiotics 1 softgel daily Gut microbial balance is increasingly being recognized as a possible risk factor in cardiovascular illness. This formula offers 20 billion live cultures and 11 probiotic strains to support the gut's natural diversity. Made with organic prebiotics, which stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut, these daily-use, vegetarian capsules help to promote healthy colon function and reduce the frequency of gas, constipation, irregularity, and digestion. Key features: Accumulating evidence shows probiotics to lower low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol and improve the LDL/high density lipoproteins (HDL) ratio, as well as lower blood pressure, inflammatory mediators, blood glucose levels, and body mass index. (21)(22)(23) Furthermore, prebiotics are showing promise in shifting lipid parameters and providing cardiovascular protection. Xylooligosaccharides found in Renew Life's Daily Balance Probiotics may improve blood lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense system. (24) MegaFood [Click to view MegaFood protocols](https://fullscript.com/protocols?prototype=brand-protocols&n=MegaFood&b=megafood) Possible add-ons: Magnesium 2 tablets daily Magnesium plays an important role in cardiovascular health. Magnesium deficiency increases the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. (28) This is a highly absorbable FoodState magnesium synergistically paired with organic whole food spinach. Key features: Magnesium deficiency has been proposed as a factor in arrhythmias, is an important cofactor for the functioning of the enzymes in cardiac mitochondria, and helps prevent potassium loss. (29) Magnesium also tends to decline in people with diabetes and may fall to dangerously low levels amongst those suffering from severe diabetic retinopathy. Deficiency has been shown to directly influence the blood sugar control of type 2 diabetics and may interrupt the insulin secretion process and increase insulin resistance. Vitamin D3 1 tablet daily 1000 IU of ethically sourced FoodState Vitamin D3 is delivered with organic whole foods, including brown rice, parsley leaf, broccoli, carrot, and beet root that provide synergistic cofactors for improved assimilation and activation of the vitamin. Key features: Several epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with low blood levels of vitamin D have increased risks of heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes.
