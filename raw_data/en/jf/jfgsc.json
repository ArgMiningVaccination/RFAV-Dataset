Whether you need to shed a few pounds quickly after the holidays or are striving to overcome a plateau, [Dr. Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz)'s 3-day juice cleanse can help you achieve your goals. Unlike other juice diets, you make your juices by blending them at home and not straining them afterward. They are as thick as a smoothie! Blending preserves the fiber content of plants! In addition, this juice cleanse includes flax seeds as a source of protein. They are loaded with fresh fruits and vegetables that have detox and anti-inflammatory properties, and are also great for acne and other skin conditions. What that means is, this is a diet rich in whole foods. Processed ingredients and artificial flavors are left out, resetting your body to live a healthier lifestyle. Although some liquid-based diets last a week or even longer, which experts say may be dangerous, there are shorter three-day juice cleanses that you might consider. In fact, according to [Dr. Robynne Chutkan](https://robynnechutkan.com/), M.D., an integrative gastroenterologist and author of Gutbliss: Feel Light, Tight, and Bright-the Healthy Way, \" a three-day juice cleanse is not a harmful thing\"... because \"It's not going to dramatically change your health.\" However, as for any diet, consult your doctor first and foremost before doing this 3-day cleanse (especially if you already have any health issues)! I lost 4 pounds in 3 days on this 3-day detox cleanse. Then I started a wholesome diet prescribed by a registered dietitian. My goal is 'new year, a healthier me!' (and hopefully you, too) What Is a Juice Cleanse? A juice cleanses, also known as a juice fast, is a detox diet that consists of drinking vegetable and fruit juices for a short period of time (1-3 days). No solid foods are consumed, only liquids (raw juices and water). It's believed that blended raw fruits and vegetables nourish the body while also flushing out toxins and waste. It clears away sugar, caffeine, refined foods, and other substances that can deplete energy. However, for lasting effects, your eating habits may need to change as well. You must adopt a healthy lifestyle in order to not regain the pounds shed. What is Detox Juice? Detox juice is the nutritious, fresh juice extracted from fruits and vegetables using various methods, including by hand, using an electric juicer, or by blending in the blender. With this 3-day detox juice cleanse, you drink only blended juices and water for 3 days. This will give your liver and digestive system time to detox. Unlike other juice cleanse diets out there, this 3-day detox cleanse is not a squeezed juice cleanse that removes fiber from the equation. 3-Day Juice Cleanse (Diet Plan) All 3 days follow the same routine in this specific order: - MORNING DETOX TEA: Start the day by drinking a cup of green tea (herbal tea) mixed with 1 teaspoon of Stevia and a slice of lemon. - BREAKFAST DRINK: Then, make your breakfast drink by blending water, raspberries, flax seeds, banana, spinach, almond butter, and lemon in a blender until smooth. Do NOT strain! This will help you ingest all the fiber. - SUPPLEMENTS: Take \u00bd multivitamin plus a probiotic supplement. - LUNCH DRINK: Blend celery stalks, cucumber, kale leaves, green apple, lime, coconut oil, almond milk (nut milk), and pineapple in a blender until smooth. Do NOT strain! - SUPPLEMENTS: Take \u00bd multivitamin plus an Omega 3 supplement. - SNACK DRINK: Repeat your favorite drink of the three! - DRINK DINNER: Blend mango, blueberries, coconut water, kale, lemon, avocado, cayenne pepper, and flax seeds in a blender until smooth. Again, do NOT strain! - DETOX ULTRA BATH: Take a bath with 2.5 cups of Epsom salt and 10 drops of lavender oil. During these 3 days, make sure to drink lots of water (at least 8 cups), plenty of rest, and preferably do NOT exercise (or do onlygentle exercise). Weight loss may vary, but many people reported shedding around 3 to 4 pounds in 3 days. Benefits of Juice Cleanse The best juice cleanse provides extra nutrition and a good amount of fiber, if you're lacking it in your diet. Among its many positive effects or health benefits are: - Has anti-inflammatory properties - Helps you lose weight quickly - Improves nutrient absorption - Feeds good bacteria in your gut - Helps lower cholesterol - Boosts the immune system and energy levels - Helps detox your liver from harmful toxins - Lowers blood sugar levels - Improves your skin and mental clarity - Reduces dehydration (you have to drink plenty of water too) - Broadens the range of fruits and vegetables that you eat. Is a Juice Cleanse a Healthy Choice for You? It can provide a short-term boost for starting a new healthy eating program, but it is not recommended as a long-term weight loss program. Moreover, following a juice diet for three days may provide short-term weight loss, but it doesn't fulfill all your nutritional needs. Also, it doesn't teach you how to plan, prep, and eat healthy meals for more sustained, longer term weight loss. The [U.S. Department of Agriculture 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/) recommends consuming a variety of vegetables, fruits, leafy greens, grains, lean meats, beans and legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy, and oil each day for a healthy, balanced diet. Some have experienced various side effects on other juice cleanse diets, like brain fog (mostly on the first day), digestive problems, and low energy levels.

Storage You can make all your 3 different drinks ahead for the day and keep them each in a mason jar in the fridge. But it's recommended to drink them fresh or right after making each one of them. To preserve the nutrients completely, do not make each any more than 24 hours ahead. Moreover, each contains fruits that oxidize quickly such as banana, apple, and avocado. They won't taste as fresh when kept longer.
