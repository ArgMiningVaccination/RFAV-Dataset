Our program is an intensive 24-month program which prepares graduates to practice patient-centered, evidence-based medicine in the rapidly changing healthcare environment of the 21st century. The USF PA program is an integral part of USF Health, an interprofessional health education center where PA students, and other students in the colleges of Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy learn to succeed as part of interdisciplinary health care teams.
