57 Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (Rev. 2-2007) 1 IMMUNIZATION PROCEDURES: INTRODUCTION: This immunization guide is a compilation of the generally accepted recommendations of the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice s (ACIP) and of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The recommendations put fo rth in this publication are to be used as guidelines and not absolute standards. ACIP , AAP, and AAFP currently issue joint guidelines on childhood immunizations annually, the Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, United States. GENERAL INFORMATION: Routine immunizations s hould not be given to persons moderately or severely ill or with marked feve r during the previous 24 hours. However, the presence of mild illness with or without fe ver is not usually a contraindication to immunization. The product description and direct ions provided by the manufacturer in the package insert should be read carefully. No product may be used beyond its expiration date, nor contrary to recommendations in the package insert. VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENTS (VIS) : As required under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (42 U.S.C. section 300 a.a. 26), all health care providers in the United States who administer to any child or adul t any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), trivalent influenza, pneumococca l conjugate, or varicella (chickenpox) vaccine shall, prior to administration of each dose of the vaccine, provide a copy to keep of the relevant current edition vaccine informati on materials that have been produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the parent or legal representative of any child to whom the provider intends to administer such vaccine, and to any adult to whom the provider intends to administer such vaccine. (In the case of an incompetent adult, relevant VISs shall be provided to the individual's legal repr esentative. If the incompetent adult is living in a long-term care facility, all relevant VISs may be provided at the time of admission, or at the time of consent if later than admission, rather than prior to each immunization.) If there is not a single VI S. for a combination vaccine, use the VISs for all component vaccines. The materials shall be supplemented with visual presentations or oral explanations, as appropriate. Other VISs that are available are, Pneumoc occal Human Vaccine (HPV)* and the Zoster (shi ngles) vaccine. Thei r use is not required by the National Childhood Injury Act, but is strongly encouraged - and they must be used when giving vaccines purchas ed through a CDC contract. *Use of VISs for HPV, meningococcal, and rotavirus vaccines will become mandatory at a later date. RECORD KEEPING : Health care providers shall make a notation in each patient's permanent medical record at the time vaccine in formation materials are provided indicating: (1) the edition date of the VIS distributed, and (2) the date the VIS was provided. This record-keeping requirement supplements the requirement of 42 U.S.C. section 300 a.a. 25 that all health care providers administering t hese vaccines must record in the patient's permanent medical record (or in a permanent office log): (3) the name, address and title of the individual who administers the vaccine (The address should be the address where the record is kept. For example, if immuniza tions are given at a shopping mall, the address would be the clinic where the permanent record will reside after the provider returns it to the clinic.), (4) the date of administration and (5 ) the vaccine manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine used. VACCINES FOR CHILDREN (VFC) ELIGIBILITY SCREENING : The Vaccines for Children Program is a federally funded state-operated vaccine distribution program. The Los Angeles County Immunization Program (LACIP) pa rticipates in this program and receives VFC-purchased vaccines from the state in addition to other federal and state purchased vaccines. Under the VFC Program each child 18 years of age and younger is required to be screened for VFC eligibility before immuniza tion. VFC eligibility criteria are: 1. Medi-Cal or Child Health Dis ability Program (CHDP) eligible; or 2. No health insurance; or 3. American Indian or Native Alaskan; or 4. Insurance that does not cover vaccines. VFC eligibility requirements are incorporated in the LACDHS Immunization Record Card (H-519) and in the County's immunization registry (LINK). Check only one eligibility criterion; if a child meets two or more of the eligibility criteria, check the first one that applies. The child does not need to be rescr eened at subsequent vi sits unless his/her eligibility status has changed. Even if a child is not VFC eligible, LACIP-supplied vaccine may still be used if the LACIP vaccine use guidelines are followed. STORAGE OF IMMUNOBIOLOGICS: Vaccines, especially live virus vaccines, are fragile substances. To insure potency, vaccines are to be stored and handled as recommended by the manufacturer in the package insert. All refrigerators should have separate thermometers in both the refrigerator and freezer compartments. Check the temperature of both the refrigerator and freezer at least twice daily and record temperatures on a temperature log posted on the refrigerator/freezer . Do not store vaccine in the refrigerator door. (See section in this guide on Stor age and Handling of Common Immunobiologics.) VACCINE ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING SYSTEM (VAERS): VAERS is the national program that monitors the safety of vaccines after they are licensed and is jointly administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA and CDC analyze VAERS data to identify potential new vaccine safety concerns that may need further study. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 mandates that health care providers report specific adverse events that occur after vaccination. The events that requi re reporting to VAERS are listed in the Table of Reportable Events and can be found at http://www.vaers.org/reportable.htm or contact LACIP for a copy of the table. Providers ar e also encouraged to report adverse events that are not listed in the Table of Reportable Events. Report all significant adverse events that occur after vaccination of adults and children, even if you are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. There are three ways to report to VAERS: 1) Online via a secure website at https://secure.vaers.org/Va ersDataEntryintro.htm, 2) Fax a completed VAERS form to 877-721-0366, or 3) Mail a co mpleted VAERS form to VAERS, P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849-1100. A VAERS form may be downloaded from the VAERS web site at http://www.vaers.org/pdf/vaers_form.pdf. Alternatively, you may request a VAERS form by sending an email to info@vaer s.org, by calling toll-free 800-822-7967, or by sending a faxed request to 877-721-0366. For additional information on VAERS or vaccine safety, visit the VAERS website at http://www.vaers.org or call 800-822-7967. Providers receiving vaccines from LACIP are requested to send a copy of all VAERS reports to LACIP at 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 700, Los Angeles, CA 90010 or fax a copy to LACIP at (213) 351-2782. If additional information is needed, contact LACIP at (213) 351-7800, or visit the Immunization Program Website at http://www.lapublichealth.org/ip/ . TUBERCULIN SKIN TESTING AND IMMUNIZATION (MANTOUX): Measles illness, severe acute or chronic infections, HIV infe ction, and malnutrition can create a relatively anergic state during which the tuberculin skin te st (TST) (previously referred to as purified protein derivative [PPD] skin test) might gi ve a false negative reaction. Although any live Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (Rev. 2-2007) 2 attenuated measles vaccine can theoretically suppress TST reactivity, the degree of suppression is probably less than that occurri ng from acute infection from wild-type measles virus. TST and measles-containing vaccine can be administered at the same visit. Simultaneously administering TST and measles- containing vaccine does not interfere with reading the TST result at 48-72 hours and ens ures that the person has received measles vaccine. If the measles-containing vaccine has been administered recently, TST screening should be delayed for at least 4 weeks after va ccination. A delay in performing TST will remove the concern of any theoretical but trans ient suppression of TST reactivity from the vaccine. No data exist for the potential degree of TST suppression that might be associated with other injectable, live-attenuated virus vaccines (e.g., varicella and yellow fever). However, in the absence of data, following guideli nes for measles-containing vaccine when scheduling TST screening and administering other live-attenuated virus vaccines is prudent. If the opportunity to vaccinate might be missed, vaccination should not be delayed only because of these theoretic al considerations. Becaus e of similar concerns about smallpox vaccine and TST suppression, a TST should not be performed until four weeks after smallpox vaccination. TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN DOSES: A vailable data indicate that intervals between doses longer than those routinely recommended do not affect seroconversion rate or titer when the schedule was completed. Consequently, it is not necessary to restart the series or add doses of any vaccine because of an extended in terval between doses. The only exception to this rule is oral typhoid vaccine in some circ umstances. In the case of oral typhoid, some experts recommend repeating the series if the four-dose series is extended to more than 3 weeks. Vaccine doses should not be administered at intervals less than the recommended minimal intervals or earlier than the minimal ages. Two ex ceptions to this may occur. The first is for measles vaccine during a measles outbr eak, when the vaccine may be administered at an age younger than 12 months (this dose would not be counted, and would be repeated at 12 months of age or older). The second cons ideration involves administering a dose a few days earlier than the minimum interval or age, which is unlikely to have a substantially negative effect on the immune response to that dose. Vaccine doses administered up to 4 days before the minimum interval or age can be counted as valid. This 4-day recommendation does not apply to rabies va ccine because of the unique schedule for this vaccine. Doses administered 5 days or earlier th an the minimum interval or age should not be counted as valid doses and should be repeat ed as age appropriate. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by a time greater than the recommended minimum interval shown in Table 1.

Use of licensed combination vaccines is preferred over separate injections of their equi valent component vaccines (Source: CDC. Combination vaccines for childhood immunizati on: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). MMWR1999; 48[No. RR-5];5). When administering combination vaccines, the mi nimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the individual components; the mi nimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individual components. Combination vaccines containing the Hepat itis B component are available (HepB-Hib, DTaP-HepB-IPV, and HepA-HepB). These vaccine s should not be administered to infants aged <6 weeks because of the other components (i.e., Hib, DTaP, HepA, and IPV). \u00a7 HepB-3 should be administered at least 8 wee ks after HepB-2 and at least 16 weeks after HepB-1 and should not be administered before age 24 weeks. \u00b6 Calendar months. ** The minimum recommended interval betwe en DTaP-3 and DTaP-4 is 6 months. However, DTaP-4 need not be repeated if administered at least 4 months after DTaP-3. For Hib and PCV, children receiving the firs t dose of vaccine at age >7 months require fewer doses to complete the series (CDC. Recommended childhood and adolescent immunization schedule\u2014United States, 2006. MMWR 2005; 54 [Nos. 51 & 52]:Q1-Q4). \u00a7\u00a7 If PRP-OMP (Pedvax-Hib\u00ae, Merck Vaccine Di vision) was administered at age 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. \u00b6\u00b6 Combination measles-mumps-rubella-varice lla (MMRV) vaccine can be used for children aged 12 months-12 years. *** The minimum interval from VAR-1 to VAR-2 for persons beginning the series at age >13 years is 4 weeks. Two doses of influenza vaccine are recommended for children aged <9 years who are receiving the vaccine for the first time. Children aged <9 years who have previously received influenza vaccine, and persons aged >9 y ears require only 1 dose per influenza season. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 The minimum age for inactivated influenz a vaccine varies by vaccine manufacturer. Only Fluzone (manufactured by sanofi past eur) is approved for children aged 6-35 months. The minimum age for Fluvirin (manufactured by Novartis) is 4 years. For Fluarix and FluLeval (manufactured by GlaxoSmithK line), the minimum age is 18 years. \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Certain experts recommend a second dose of MPSV 3 years after the first dose for persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease. **** A second dose of meningococcal vaccine is recommended for persons previously vaccinated with MPSV who remain at high risk for meningococcal disease. MCV4 is preferred when revaccinating persons aged 11-55 years, but a second dose of MPSV is acceptable. (Source: CDC. Prevention and control of meningococcal disease: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2005;54[No. RR-7]). Only 1 dose of Tdap is recommended. S ubsequent doses should be administered as Td. If vaccination to prevent tetanus and/or dipht heria disease is required for children aged 7-9 years, Td should be administered (minimum age for Td is 7 years). For one brand of Tdap, the minimum age is 11 years. The pr eferred interval between Tdap and a previous dose of Td is 5 years. In persons who have received a primary series of tetanus-toxoid- containing vaccine, for management of a tet anus-prone wound, the minimum interval after a previous dose of any tetanus-c ontaining vaccine is 5 years. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 A second dose of PPV is recommended fo r persons at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection and those who are likel y to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal antibody concentration. Revaccination 3 years after the previous dose can be considered for children at highest risk for severe pneumococcal infection who would be aged <10 years of age at the time of revaccination. (Source : CDC. Prevention of pneumococcal disease: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR-8]). \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 HPV is approved only for females aged 9-26 years. ***** The first dose of RV must be administered at age 6-12 weeks. The vaccine series should not be started at age >13 weeks. RV should not be administered to children aged >33 weeks regardless of the number of doses received at age 6-32 weeks. Herpes zoster vaccine is approved as a single dose for persons who are aged >60 years with a history of varicella. Adapted from Table 1, ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization: MMWR 2006;55(No. RR-15) IMMUNIZATION FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL: The only vaccine required by International Health Regulations is yellow fever vaccination fo r travel to certain c ountries in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Mening ococcal vaccination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for annual travel during the Hajj. Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (Rev. 2-2007) 4 Some immunizations are not required under th e international health regulations but are recommended to protect the health of the tr aveler. For some diseases there are no vaccines available, therefore, prevention requi res specific behaviors or chemoprophylactic medications. Vaccinations against diphtheria, te tanus, pertussis, varicella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae , routinely are administered in the United States, usually in childhood. If persons do not have a history of adequate protection agai nst these diseases, immunizations appropriate to their age and previous immunizati on status should be obtained. For certain types of travel, yellow fever vaccine, Japanese encephalitis vaccine, typhoid vaccine, poliomyelitis vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin, and malaria prophylaxis are recommended. Information on travel immunization recommendations is contained in CDC's publication Health Information for International Travel (The Yellow Book). The current edition of this publication can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/travel/yb/ , or information about ordering the Yellow Book and International Certificates of Vaccination and recorded messages on travel-related health topics can be obtained by calling Travelers' Heal th Automated Information Line at: 877-FYI- TRIP toll free. Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 5 SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF CERTAIN IMMUNOBIOLOGICS: 1. Simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines does not result in decreased antibody res ponses or increased rates of adverse reactions. 2. Simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a child is eligible can be very important in childhood vaccination programs bec ause it increases the probability that a child will be fully immunized at the appropriate age. 3. Individual vaccines should not be mixed in the same syringe unless they are licensed for mixing by the Food and Drug Administ ration. Only the sanofi-pasteur Hib/DTaP (TriHIBit) vaccine is licensed fo r mixing in the same syringe. 4. Live parenteral (injected) vaccines ( MMR, MMRV, varicella, and yellow fever) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that are not administered simultaneously should be separated by at least 4 weeks. This pr ecaution is intended to reduce or eliminate interference from the vaccine given first on the vaccine given later. If two live parenteral vaccines or LAIV are not admin istered simultaneously but are separated by less than 4 weeks, the vaccine given second should be repeated in 4 weeks or confirmed to be effective by serologic testi ng of the recipient (serologic testing is not recommended for LAIV). An exception to this recommendation is yellow fever vaccine administered less than 4 weeks after singl e-antigen measles vaccine. A 1999 study demonstrated that yellow fever vaccine is not affected by measles vaccine given 1-27 days earlier. The effect of nonsimultaneously administered rubella, mumps, varicella, and yellow fever vaccines is not known. 5. Live vaccines administered by the oral route (oral polio vaccine [OPV], oral typhoid) are not believed to interfere with each other if not given simultaneously. These vaccines may be given at any time before or after each other. Oral typhoid is not licensed for children younger than 6 years of age, and OPV is no longer available in the United States, so these vaccines are not likely to be given to the same child. 6. Parenteral live vaccines (MMR, MMRV, varicella, and yellow fever) and LAIV are not believed to have an effect on live vaccines giv en by the oral route (OPV, oral typhoid). Live oral vaccines may be given at any time before or after live parenteral vaccines or LAIV. 7. All other combinations of two inactivat ed vaccines, or live and inactivated vaccines, may be given at any time before or after each other. 8. Inactivated antigens are generally not subst antially affected by circulating antibody, so they can be administered before, after, or at the same time as the antibody. Simultaneous administration of antibody (in the form of immune globulin) and vaccine is recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of certain diseases, such as hepatitis B, rabies, and tetanus. 9. If a live parenteral vaccine (measles-mump s-rubella [MMR], MMRV, or varicella) must be given around the time that antibody is gi ven, the two must be separated by enough time so that the antibody does not interfere wi th viral replication. If the live vaccine is given first, it is necessary to wait at l east 2 weeks (i.e., an incubation period) before giving the antibody. If the interval between the vaccine and antibody is less than 2 weeks, the recipient should be tested for immunity or the vaccine dose should be repeated. 10. If the antibody is given before a dose of MMR or varicella vaccine, it is necessary to wait until the antibody has waned (degraded) before giving the vaccine to reduce the chance of interference by the antibody. Th e necessary interval between an antibody- containing product and MMR or varicella vaccine depends on the concentration of antibody in the product. A table listing the recommended intervals between administration of antibody products and live vaccines (MMR and varicella) can be found below (Table 2). 11. Although passively acquired antibodies can interfere with the response to rubella vaccine, the low dose of anti-Rho(D) globu lin administered to postpartum women has not been demonstrated to reduce the response to the RA27/3 strain rubella vaccine. Because of the importance of rubella immunity among childbearing age women, postpartum vaccination of rubella-susceptib le women with rubella or MMR vaccine should not be delayed because of receipt of anti-Rho(D) globulin or any other blood product during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women should be vaccinated immediately after delivery and, if possible, tested 3 months later to ensure immunity to rubella and, if necessary, to measles. 12. Oral typhoid, and yellow fever vaccines are not affected by the administration of immune globulin or blood products. They may be given simultaneously with blood products, or separated by any interval. 13. Two antibody products are available for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infants and young children. RSV-IG (RespiGam) is an intravenous human immune globulin product. RSV-IG cont ains other human antibodies in addition to antibody to RSV, and may interfere with live parenteral vaccines for as long as 9 months. Palivizumab (Synagis) contains only monoclonal antibody to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It does not interfere with the response to live virus vaccines.

Unvaccinated pers ons might not be fully protected against measles during the entire recommended interv al, and additional doses of immune globulin or measles vaccine might be indicated after m easles exposure. Concentrations of measles antibody in an immune globulin preparation can vary by manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody clearance after receipt of an immune globulin preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are extrapolated from an es timated halflife of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interferen ce with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg. Contains antibody only to respiratory syncytial virus \u00a7 Assumes a serum \u00b6 and varicella vaccinations are recommended for children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic human immunodeficiency viru s (HIV) infection but are contraindicated for persons with severe immunosuppression from HIV or any other immunosuppressive disorder. ** The investigational product VariZIG, similar to licensed VZIG, is a purified human immune globulin preparation made from pl asma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies (immunoglobulin class G [IgG]). When indicated, health-care providers should make every effort to obtain and administer VariZIG. In si tuations in which administration of VariZIG does not appear possible within 96 hours of ex posure, administration of immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) should be considered as an alternativ e. IGIV also should be administered within 96 hours of exposure. Although licensed IGIV preparations are known to contain anti-varicella antibody titers, the tite r of any specific lot of IGIV that might be available is uncertain because IG IV is not routinely tested fo r antivaricella antibodies. The recommended IGIV dose for postexposure proph ylaxis of varicella is 400 mg/kg, administered once. For pregnant women who cannot receive VariZIG within 96 hours of exposure, clinicians can choose either to administer IGIV or closely monitor the women for signs and symptoms of varicella and institute treatment with acyclovir if illness occurs.

Routine pre-exposure vaccination is only recommended for persons who come in contact in the workplace with imported animal hides, furs, bone meal, wool, animal hair, or br istles for whom industry standards and import restrictions are insufficient to prevent exposure to anthrax spores. Vaccination might be indicated for ve terinarians and other persons handling potentially infected animals in areas with a high incidence of anthrax cases. Preexposure vaccination may be indicated for certain military personnel and other select groups who may be exposed to an intentional release of B. anthracis. Preexposure vaccination is not currently recommended for emergency first responders, federal res ponders, medical practitioners, or private citizens. Postexposure: FDA approves AVA only for preexposure vaccination. Postexposure prophylaxis against B. anthracis with antibiotics is recommended following an aerosol exposure to B. anthracis spores. Because of the potential persistence of spores following an aerosol exposure, antibiotic therapy should be c ontinued for at least 60 days if used alone. If AVA vaccine is available, anti biotics can be discontinued after three doses of vaccine have been administered according to the standard schedule (0, 2, and 4 weeks). Although the shortened (3-dose) vaccine regimen has been effective when used in a postexposure regimen that includes antibiotics, the duration of prot ection after vaccination is not known. Therefore, if subsequent exposures occur, additional vaccinations might be required. Adverse Reactions: minor local reactions occur in 20% of vaccinations, moderate local reactions occur in 3% of vaccinations, and severe local reactions occur in 1% of vaccinations . Subcutaneous nodules occur at the injection site in 30%-50% of recipients and persist for several weeks. Systemic reactions (i.e., chills, muscl e aches, malaise, or nausea) occur in 5%-35% of vaccine recipients. Severe (e.g., allergic) reactions are rare. Precautions: A moderate or severe acute illness until recovery Pregnancy History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) Contraindications: History of a severe allergic (anaphylactic) reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose History of anthrax because of obser vations of more severe adverse reactions among recipients with a history of anthrax disease. IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 8 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids (DT) Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids (Pediatric DT) Sanofi Pasteur Children 6 weeks through 6 years for whom pertussis vaccine is specif ically contraindicated: Children 1 year when beginning series: First: 0.5 mL IM Second: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Third: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Fourth: 0.5 mL IM 6-12 mos. later Children 1 year when beginning series: First: 0.5 mL IM Second: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Third: 0.5 mL IM 6-12 mos. later Fifth: 0.5 mL IM at 4- 6 years of age Fifth dose not needed if the fourth dose was given on or after the fourth birthday Fourth: 0.5 mL IM at 4-6 years of age Fourth dose not needed if the third dose was given on or after the fourth birthday Under 1 year of age, preferred site of vaccine administration is the anterolateral thigh Diphtheria vaccination for contacts to a diphtheria case: See Td section Adverse Reactions: A small area of erythema and induration with or without tenderness surrounding the injection site, persisting for a few days, is not unusual. Fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur but are less common following DT that with pertussis-containing vaccines. Severe local reaction may occur, particularly in persons who have had multiple prior boosters. Severe sy stemic reactions such as generalized urticaria (hives), anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have been reported. A few cases of Guilla in-Barr\u00e9 Syndrom e (GBS) have been reported following tetanus toxoid admin istration. Brachial neuritis has rarely been observed. Precautions: History of GBS within 6 weeks of a prior dose of a tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine. Tetanus vaccination has been very rarely associated with occurrence of GBS. Vaccination is usually justified for children who have had fewer than 3 doses of a tetanus- toxoid-containing vaccine. Contraindications: History of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of the vaccine. Moderate to severe acute illness until improved. IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 9 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphtheria and Tetanus First: 0.5 mL IM Second: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Third: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Fourth: 0.5 mL IM 6-12 mos. later (See comments) Under 1 year of age, preferred site of administration is anterolateral thigh. Whenever possible the same brand of DTaP vaccine should be used for all doses of the vaccination series. However, vaccination should not be deferred because the brand of DTaP used earlier is not known or is not in stock. Fifth: 0.5 mL IM at 4- 6 years of age Fifth dose not needed if the fourth dose was given on or after the fourth birthday. The fourth DTaP dose is recommended be administered at 15-18 months of age (17-20 months for Daptacel); it may be administered as early as 12 months of age, provided 6 months hav e elapsed since the third dose and if the child is unlikely to return at 15-18 months of age. Whether and when to administer DTaP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided individually. Generally, infants and children with stable neurologic conditions, including well- controlled seizures, may be vaccinat ed (See \"Guidelines for Diphtheria- Tetanus-Pertussis Immunization of Young Children with Histories of Convulsions,\" in this document. Ac etaminophen or ibuprofen, administered at the appropriate dose at the time of vaccination and every 4 hours for 24 hours as directed or needed thereafter, reduces the possibility of post- vaccination fever. Diphtheria vaccination for contacts to a diphtheria case: See Td section Adverse Reactions: Erythema and induration with or without tenderness at the injection site, persisting for a few days, are not unusual. Fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur but are less common in children who receive DTaP than with DTP. Severe local reaction may occur, particularly in persons who have had mult iple doses. There are reports of increased local reaction with the fourth and fifth doses. See DT regarding other rare adverse reactions. Moderate to severe systemic events (such as fever 105\u00b0F, febrile seizures, persistent crying lasting 3 hours, and hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes) hav e been reported rarely after administration of DTaP. Anaphylaxis occurs rarely. Swelling involving the entire thigh or upper arm has been reported after booster doses of certain acellular per tussis vaccines. The limb swelling may be accompanied by erythema, pain and fever. Although the swelling may interfere with walking, most children have no limitation of activity. Precautions: History of one of the following occurring after a prior dose: Temperature of 105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C) or higher within 48 hours that is not due to another identifiable cause; collaps e or shock-like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hou rs; persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or longer, occurring within 48 hours; and convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days. GBS within 6 weeks (See DT precaution section). If a precautionary event occurs, weigh the risks and benefits of further doses of DTaP. Use DT if risks outweigh benefits. Contraindications: Severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following prior dose of vaccine, and encephalopathy not due to another identifiable cause occurring within 7 days after vaccination. Moderate or severe acute illness until condition improves. IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 10 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed Tripedia\u00ae) Sanofi pasteur Not licensed for use fo r the first 3 doses Children needing the fourth dose of DTaP and Hib: Fourth: 0.5 mL IM 6-12 months after the third dose of DTaP and at least 2 months after the last Hib dose and no earlier than 15 months of age Because of evidence of reduced imm unogenicity of the Hib component when used as a combination, TriHIBit is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as the primary series at 2, 4, or 6 months of age. It is approved only for the fourth dose of the DT aP and Hib series. If TriHIBit is administered as one or more doses of the primary series at 2, 4, or 6 months of age, the Hib doses should not be counted, and the child should be revaccinated as age appropriate for Hib. The DTaP doses may be counted as valid and do not need to be repeated. Although TriHIBit cannot be used in the primary series at 2, 4, or 6 months of age, it may be used as the booster (final ) dose following a series of single- antigen Hib vaccine or combination hepatitis B-Hib vaccine (Comvax). Therefore, TriHIBit can be used if the child is 12 months of age or younger, has received at least one prior dose of Hib vaccine 2 or more months earlier, and TriHIBit will be the last dose in the Hib series. For example, TriHIBit can be used for the booster dose at 12-15 months of age in a child who has received Comvax or PedvaxHib at 2 and 4 months of age, or three prior doses of HibTiter or ActHib. TriHIBit can also be used at 15-59 months of age in a child who has received at leas t one prior dose of any Hib-containing vaccine. TriHIBit should not be used if the child has received no prior Hib doses. Adverse Reactions: Refer to Adverse Reaction sections for DTaP and Hib conjugate vaccines. Precautions: See Precaution section for DTaP Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to any vaccine component. See Contraindications sections for DTaP and Hib vaccines IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 11 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis (DTaP- through 6 First: 0.5 mL IM Second: 0.5 mL IM 4-8 weeks later Third: 0.5 mL IM at least 16 weeks after the first dose and at least 8 weeks after the second dose, but not before 6 months of age. Not approved for fourth dose of the DTaP or IPV series Not approved for the fifth (booster) dose of the DTaP or IPV series The minimum age for the first dose of P ediarix is 6 weeks, so it cannot be used for the birth dose of the hepatitis B series. Pediarix is approved for the first three doses of the DTaP and i nactivated polio vaccine (IPV) series, which are usually given at about 2, 4, and 6 months of age; it is not approved for fourth or fifth (booster) doses of the DTaP or IPV series. However, Pediarix is approved for use through 6 years of age. A child who is behind schedule can still receive Pediar ix as long as it is given for doses 1, 2, or 3 of the series, and the child is younger than 7 years of age. A dose of Pediarix inadvertently adminis tered as the fourth or fifth dose of the DTaP or IPV series does not need to be repeated. Pediarix may be used interchangeably with other pertussis containing vaccines if necessary (although ACIP pr efers the use of the same brand of DTaP for all doses of the series, if possible). It can be given at 2, 4, and 6 months to infants who received a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (total of four doses of hepatitis B vaccine). Al though not labeled for this indication by FDA, Pediarix may be used in infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whose HBsAg status is not known. Adverse Reactions: The adverse reactions are expected to be the same as those of the individual component va ccines. See component vaccines for possible adverse reactions. DTaP-Hep B-IPV vaccine was associated with higher rates of fever, compared to separately administered component vaccines (DTaP, Hepatitis B, and IPV). Precautions: The precautions are the same as they are for the individual component vaccines. Contraindications: The contraindications are the same as they are for the individual component vaccines.

A dose given before 6 weeks of age may reduce the response to subsequent doses. As a result, Hib vaccine should never be given to a child younger than 6 weeks of age . All 3 conjugate Hib vaccines are inte rchangeable. If it is necessary to change vaccine type (or if type of vacci ne previously used is unknown), 3 doses of any combination constitute the primary series. Any licensed conjugate vaccine may be used for th e booster dose regardless of which vaccine was administered in the primary series Hib vaccine is recommended for persons of any age who are at increased risk for invasive Hib disease including persons with functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease, post-splenectomy), immunodeficiency (particularly persons with IgG2 s ubclass deficiency), immunosuppression from cancer chemotherapy, or infecti on with HIV). Previously unvaccinated persons >59 months of age at increased risk for invasive Hib disease should receive at least one pediatric dos e of any Hib conjugate vaccine. Children <24 months of age who have had invasive Hib disease should still receive Hib vaccine, since many children of that age fail to develop immunity following natural disease. The vaccine se ries can be initiated (or continued) at the time of hospital discharge. Adverse Reactions: Injection site erythema, induration, and/or pain occur in 5-30% of recipients and usually reso lves within 12-24 hours. Systemic reactions such as fever and irritability are infrequent. Contraindications: Anaphylaxis following a prior dose of Hib vaccine; delay vaccination in children with moderate or severe acute illness until improved; Hib vaccines contraindicated in children <6 weeks of age.

Children NOT vaccinated according to recommended schedule (i.e., beginning the series late): The number of doses of PRP-OMPC (i.e., COMVAX or PedvaxHIB) needed to vaccinate against Hib disease varies with age of the infant or child at the first dose. Age at First Dose: Number of Doses N e e d e d * 12-14 months: 2 15-59 months 1 * Three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are required regardless of the child's age when the series was started (See Hepatitis B section for schedule). Therefore, complete the hepatitis B series with a single antigen hepatitis B vaccine or an appropriate combination hepatitis B vaccine. Not applicable Each dose of Comvax contains 7.5 mcg of PRP-OMP Hib vaccine (PedvaxHIB), and 5 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen. The immunogenicity of the combination vaccine is equivalent to that of the individual antigens administered at separate sites. Comvax is licensed for use at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. It may be used whenever either antigen is indi cated and the other antigen is not contraindicated. However, the vaccine must not be administered to infants younger than 6 weeks of age because of potential suppression of the immune response to the Hib component (see Haemophilus influenzae type b, for more details). Comvax must not be used for doses at birth or 1 month of age for a child on a 0, 1, 6-month hepatitis B vaccine schedule. Although it is not labeled for this indi cation by FDA, ACIP recommends that Comvax may be used in infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown.

Completion of the se ries with the same product is preferable. However, if the originally used product is not available or not known, vaccination with either product is acceptable. The dose given should be based on the person's age at the time of the dose. For example, if a person re ceived the first dose of the pediatric formulation of hepatitis A vaccine at 18 years of age, and returns for the second dose at age 19 years, the second dose should be the adult formulation, not the pediatric formulation. All children should receive hepatitis A vaccine at 12-23 months of age. Children who are not vaccinated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. States, counties, and communities with existing Hep A vaccination programs for children 2-18 years of age are encouraged to maintain these programs. California is a state with an existing Hep A vaccination Program. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for persons 1 year of age and older who are traveling to or working in c ountries where they would have a high or intermediate risk of hepatitis A viru s infection. These areas include all areas of the world except Canada, Western Europe and Scandinavia, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. Vaccinated persons can be assumed to be protected by 4 weeks after receiving the first dose, although the second dose 6 to 12 months later is necessary for long-term protection. Other groups which should be offered vaccine include men who have sex with other men, persons who use illegal drugs, persons who have clotting factor disorders, and persons with occupational risk of infection . Persons with occupational risk include only those who work with hepatitis A-infected primates or with hepatitis A virus in a laboratory setting. No other groups have been shown to be at increased risk of hepatitis A infection due to occupational exposure. Persons with chronic liver disease should be vaccinated . Susceptible persons who either are awaiting or have received liver transplants should be vaccinated. Adverse Reactions: Injection site pain, eryt hema, or swelling is reported by 20% to 50% of recipients. These symptoms are generally mild and self- limited. Mild systemic complaints (e .g., malaise, fatigue, low-grade fever) are reported by fewer than 10% of recipients. No serious adverse reactions have been reported. Contraindications: History of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of hepatitis A vaccine, hypersensitivity to al. Vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illnesses should be deferred until the person's condition has improved. The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because it is an inactivated vaccine, the theoretical risk to the fetus is low.

U. of hepatitis A vaccine (equivalent to a pediatric dose of Havrix), and 20 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen protein (equivalent to an adult dose of Engerix-B). The vaccine is administered in a 3 dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months. Appropriate spacing of the doses must be maintained to assure long-term protection from both vaccines. The firs t and third doses should be separated by at least 6 months. The first a nd second doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks, and the second and thir d doses should be separated by at least 5 months. It is not necessary to restart the series or add doses if the interval between doses is longer than the recommended interval. Twinrix is approved for persons aged 18 years and ol der and can be used in persons in this age group with indications for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines. Because the hepatitis B component of Twinrix is equivalent to a standard dose of hepatitis B vaccine, the schedule is the same whether Twinrix or single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine is used. Single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine may be used to complete a series begun with Twinrix and vice versa. A person who receives one dose of Twinrix may complete the hepatitis A series with two doses of adult formulation hepatitis A vaccine separated by at least 5 mont hs. A person who receives two doses of Twinrix may complete the hepatitis A series with one dose of adult formulation hepatitis A vaccine or Twinri x 5 months after the second dose. A person who begins the hepatitis A se ries with single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine may complete the series with two doses of Twinrix or one dose of adult formulation hepatitis A vaccine.

For hemodialysis patients, assess the need for booster doses by annual antibody testing, and administer booster doses when antibody levels decline below 10 mIU/mL. Test infants born to HBsAg-+ mothers for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg 3-12 months after final HB vaccine dose. Test for antibody 1-2 months after final HB vaccine dose healthcare workers who have contact with patients or blood and are at risk for injuries with sharp instruments or needlesticks, other persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status, e.g., dialysis patients and staff, and persons for whom a sub-optimal antibody response may be anticipated. Give non-responders 1-3 more HB vaccine doses and then re-test. H B vaccination is recommended for all infants, children, and adolescents through age 18 years. Adults at increased risk of HBV infection and therefore vaccine candidates include: Men who have sex with other men, heterosexuals with multiple sex partners, persons diagnosed with a recently acquired sexually transmitt ed disease, and prostitutes; injection-drug users who share needles; inmates of long-term correctional faci lities; persons undergoing hemodialysis; healthcare workers. Others who may be candidates for vaccination: International travelers to areas with high rates of HBV infection; recipients of clotting factor concentrates; clients and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled; Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and immigrants and refugees from HBV-endemic areas; screen adoptees/orphans from countries of high or intermediate HBV endemicity for HBsAg, and if positive, vaccinate household members; test household members and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection, and vaccinate if susceptible. Adverse Reactions: Injection site pain; mild systemic complaints, such as fatigue, headache, irritability, and fever. Contraindications: A severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose; moderate or severe acute illness until improved.

The vaccine also is recommended for 13-26 year-old females who have not yet received or completed the vaccine series. Ideally, the vaccine should be administ ered before onset of sexual activity. However, females who are sexually active also may benefit from vaccination. Females who have not been infected with any vaccine HPV type would receive the full benefit of vaccination. Females who already have been infected with one or more HPV type would still get protection from the vaccine types they have not acquired. Few young women are infected with all four HPV types in the vaccine. Cu rrently, there is no test available for clinical use to determine whether a female has had any or all of the four HPV types in the vaccine. Adverse Reactions: Pain at the injection site (about 8 people in 10) Redness or swelling at the injection site (about 1 person in 4) Mild fever (100\u00b0F) (about 1 person in 10) Itching at the injection site (about 1 person in 30) Moderate fever (102\u00b0F) (about 1 person in 65) Precautions: Pregnancy (The vaccine appears to be safe for both the mother and the unborn baby, but it is still being studied.

Depending on the epidemic circumstances, vaccine should be cons idered for persons spending less than 30 days whose activities, such as ext ensive outdoor activiti es in rural areas, place them at particularly high risk for exposure. Current CDC advisories should be consulted with regard to JE epidemicity in specific locales. Advise travelers to take personal precautions to reduce exposure to mosquito bites. Personal precautions include, the use of insect repellents, and protective clothing. Avoiding outdoor activity, especially during twilight periods and in the evening, will reduce risk even further. Adverse Reactions: Moderate frequency of local and mild systemic side effects. Injection site tenderness, r edness, swelling and other local effects have been reported in about 20% of vaccinees (< 1% to 31%). Systemic side effects, principally fever, headache, ma laise, rash, and other reactions, such as chills, dizziness, myalgia, naus ea, vomiting, and abdominal pain have been reported in approximately 10% of vaccinees. However, more severe systemic side effects which can include a ngioedema of the extremities, face, and oropharynx, especially of the lips, and hypertension, can occur up to 17 days (usually within 10 days) of receipt of vaccine (About 60 per 10,000 people vaccinated have had allergic reactions to JE vaccine.). Other severe problems, such as seizures or ne rvous system problems, have been reported; these are rare (probably less than 1 per 50,000 people vaccinated). Contraindications: Anaphylactic reaction to previous dose of vaccine, or severe hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, especially proteins of rodent or neural origin.

Persons va ccinated with measles vaccine before the first birthday or who were vacci nated before 1968 should be considered unvaccinated. See individual component vaccines for recommendations for who should be vaccinated. Tuberculin tests: Measles-containing vaccines can interfere with the response to a tuberculin test. Tuberculin testing, if otherwise indicated, can be done on either the same day that a measles-containing vaccine is administered or 4-6 weeks later. Adverse Reactions: Fever of 103 \u00b0 F (39 \u00b0 C) beginning 5-12 days after vaccination (5% to 15%) and/or transient rashes (5%). Clinically apparent thrombocytopenia occurs rarely within 2 months after vaccination. Transient lymphadenopathy sometimes occurs and parotitis has been reported after receipt of MMR. Arthralgias and other joint symptoms are reported in up to 25% of susceptible adult women given MMR vaccine (related to the rubella component of the vaccine). Allergic reactions are rare after MMR. Contraindications: Persons who have experience a severe allergic reaction (i.e., hives, swelling of the mouth or throat, diffi culty breathing, hypotension, shock) following a prior dose or to a vaccine component (e.g., gelatin, neomycin) Women known to be pregnant (Pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks following MMR vaccine.)

No vaccine is available for the prev ention of serogroup B disease which accounts for one-third of meningococcal cases. Adverse Reactions: The most commonly reported adverse reactions are local pain, headache, and fatigue. Other adverse reactions include local redness, swelling and induration, malais e, arthralgia. A few cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) have been reported among people who got MCV4. There is not enough evidence yet to tell whether the vaccine caused them. Contraindications: Known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine including diphtheria toxoid, or a life-threatening reaction after previous administration of a vacci ne containing similar components are contraindications to vaccine administr ation. Acute moderate or severe illness contraindicates vacci nation until illness improves. No data are available on the safety of MCV during pregnancy. However, pregnancy is not considered to be a contraindication to MCV4. Persons with a history of GBS should not be vaccinated with MCV4 unless they are at elevated risk for meningococcal disease.

No vaccine is available for the prev ention of serogroup B disease which accounts for one-third of meningococcal cases. Revaccination: Revaccination may be indicate d for persons previously vaccinated with MPSV who remain at increased risk for infection, particularly for children who were first vaccinated when they were younger than 4 years of age. Such children should be considered for revaccination after 2-3 years if they remain at high risk. Although the need for revaccination of older children and adults after receiving MPSV has not been determined, if indications still exist for vaccinati on, revaccination ma y be considered 5 years after receipt of the first dose. Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) is recommended for revaccination of persons 11-55 years of age. However, use of MPSV is acceptable. Vaccine is routinely indicated for high -risk groups such as individuals with terminal complement component defici encies, those with functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV infected pers ons, and travelers to areas where meningococcal disease is endemic, particu larly if contact with the local population will be prolonged. The vaccine ma y be indicated for those at high risk for exposure, for example, during epidemics disease or in military encampments. ACIP recommends vaccination of college freshmen living in dormitories. Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory workers who are routinely exposed to N meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized also should consider vaccination. Adverse Reactions: Localized pain and erythema at injection site. Up to 3% of recipients, develop transient fe ver. Systemic reactions such as headache and malaise are reported in 2-5% of recipients. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to any vaccine component contraindicates vaccination. M oderate or severe acute illness contraindicates vaccination until illness improved.

Inject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe and inject the total volume of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously (SC). Not established Acceptable Presumptive Evidence of Mumps Immunity Through Documentation of Adequate Vaccination: Documentation of adequate vaccination is now (as of June 2006) defined as 1 dose of a live mumps virus vaccine for preschool-aged children and a dults not at high risk and 2 doses for school-aged children (i.e., grades K--12) and for adults at high risk (i.e., health-care workers, international travelers, and students at post--high school educational institutions). Routine Vaccination for Health-Care Workers: Persons born during or after 1957 without other evidence of immunity: 2 doses of a live mumps virus-containing vaccine. Persons bor n before 1957 without other evidence of immunity: consider recommending 1 dose of a live mumps virus- containing vaccine. For Outbreak Settings: Children aged 1-4 years and adults at low risk: if affected by the outbreak, consider a second dose of live mumps virus-containing vaccine. Health-care workers born before 1957 without other evidence of immunity: strongly cons ider recommending 2 doses of live mumps virus-containing vaccine. The first dose of mumps-containing vaccine should be administered on or after the first birthday; the second dose should be administered no earlier than 1 month (i.e., at a minimum of 28 days) after the first dose. MMR vaccine generally should be used whenever any of its component vaccines are indicated. For children aged 12 months-12 years, combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) va ccine can be considered if varicella vaccination is also indicated. Post Exposure Vaccination: There is no conclusive evidence that vaccination of individuals recently exposed to natural mumps will provide protection. Adverse Reactions: Parotitis and fever have been reported rarely. Although rare cases of CNS dysfunction, including deafness, have been reported within 2 months of mumps vaccination, there is inadequate evidence to prove a causal relationship. Allergic reactions, including rash, pruritus, and purpura, have been temporally associated with vaccination, but these are transient and generally mild. Contraindications: Persons with a history of anaphylaxis following exposure to neomycin or to gelatin; pregnancy; persons with impaired immune systems such as leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency disease, or immunosuppr essive therapy. Treatment with low dose (<2 mg/kg/day) or alternate day prednisone, or topical or aerosolized steroid preparations is not a contraindication to mumps vaccination. Mumps vaccine should be given two weeks before, or deferred for at least 3 months following admini stration of an antibody-containing blood product if administered as MMR or MM RRV (see Table 2, page 3).

PPV23 is recommended for the following groups: Immunocompetent persons: Persons aged 65 years and older; persons aged 2-64 years with chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes mellitus; persons 2-64 with alcoholism, chronic liver disease, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks; person 2-64 with a cochlear implant, persons 2-64 with functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease and splenectomy: persons 2-64 years living in special environments or social settings (including Alask an Natives and certain American Indian populations [Arizona, New Mexico, and Na vajo populations in Colorado and Utah]). Immunocompromised persons: Persons age 2 years and over, including those with HIV infection, leukemia, ly mphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, or nephritic syndrome, those receiving immunos uppressive chemotherapy (including corticosteroids); and those who have received an organ or bone marrow transplant. Revaccination: Revaccination is recommended for persons 2 years of age and older who are at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection and for those who are likely to have a rapid dec line in pneumococcal antibody levels. Only one PPV23 revaccination dose is recommended for high-risk persons. The second dose should be administered 5 or more years after the first dose. Revaccination 3 years after the previous dose may be considered for children at highest risk for severe pneumococcal infection who would be 10 years of age or less at the time of revaccination, including children who received PCV7. Persons at highest risk include all persons 2 years of age and older with functional or anatomic asplenia (e .g., from sickle cell disease or splenectomy), HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or other conditions associated with immunosuppression (e.g., organ or bone marrow transplantation) and thos e receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, including long-term co rticosteroids. Persons aged 65 years and older should be administered a second dose of pneumococcal vaccine if they received the vaccine more than 5 years previously, and were younger than 65 years of age at the time of the first dose. Adverse Reactions: Pain, swelling or erythema at the injection site; moderate systemic reactions (such as fever and myalgia) are not common (<1%), and more severe systemic adverse reactions are rare. Contraindications: Pregnancy, unless high-risk. History of severe hypersensitivity to a prior dose or to thimersol. Moderate or severe illness until condition improved.

Persons 18 years of age and older**: (See comments) First: 0.5 mL SC or IM Second: 0.5 mL SC or IM 1-2 months after first dose Third: 0.5 mL SC or IM 6-12 months after second dose ** Accelerated schedule: 8 or more weeks before protection is needed: Three doses of IPV should be given at least 4 weeks apart. 4-8 weeks before protection is needed: Two doses of IPV should be given at least 4 weeks apsrt. Less than 4 weeks before protection is needed: One dose of IPV. Give remaining doses of vaccine at the recommended intervals if the person remains at risk. Fourth 0.5 mL SC or IM at 4-6 years of age (school entry) \u00a7 \u00a7 The minimum age for the fourth dose is 18 weeks. The fourth dose is not needed if the third dose is given on or after the fourth birthday. If all four IPV doses are administered after 6 weeks of age and are all separated by at least 4 weeks, a fifth dose is not needed, even if the fourth dose was administered before 4 years of age None \u00b6 \u00b6 Adults who have had the primary series of OPV or IPV and who are at increased risk can receive another dose of IPV (0.5 mL SC or IM). Additional booster doses are not indicated. Only IPV is available for routine po lio vaccination of children in the United States. A polio vaccination schedule begun with OPV should be completed with IPV. If a child receives both types of vaccine, four doses of any combination of IPV or OPV by 4-6 years of age is considered a complete poliovirus vaccination series . A minimum interval of 4 weeks should separate all doses of the series. Adults: Routine polio vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in the United States is not indica ted. Unvaccinated adults (including adults without a written record of prior polio vaccination) at special risk of exposure to wild polio virus, in cluding travelers to endemic areas (currently limited to South Asia, the eastern Mediterranean, and Africa) or communities experi encing disease (e.g., an outbreak), laboratory workers handling polio virus, and heal th-care workers in close contact with patients excreting polio virus should be immunized with IPV. Adverse Reactions: Minor local reactions (pain, redness) may occur following IPV. No serious side effects to e-IPV have been documented. Because IPV contains trace amounts of streptomycin, polymyxin B and neomycin, hypersensitivity reactions ma y occur in persons sensitive to these antibiotics. Contraindications: History of an anaphylacti c reaction to a previous dose of IPV or to a component of the vaccine, including streptomycin, polymyxin B, or neomycin. Moderate of severe acute illness is a precaution for IPV until condition improves. IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 30 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Vaccine, Live, Oral, Trivalent (Sabin Vaccine, OPV) ORIMUNE\u00ae Wyeth Consult Immunization Program or CDC for dose, interval and frequency recommendations during outbreak control. Dose: 0.5 ml SC or IM when recommended as part of outbreak control OPV is no longer routinely availabl e in the United States; however, CDC maintains an emergency stockpile of OPV for polio outbreak control. The preference for OPV for outbreak control is supported by (a) higher seroconversion rate after a single dose of OPV compared to a single dose of IPV; (b) greater degree of intestinal immunity, which limits the community spread of wild poliovirus; and (c) beneficial secondary spread (intestinal shedding) of vaccine virus, which im proves overall protection in the community. Also OPV replicates in the intestinal tract and induces antibodies in more recipients after a si ngle dose. Boosting or immunity with a single dose of OPV or IPV is likely to reduce both pharyngeal and intestinal excretion of poliovirus, effectiv ely stopping epidemic transmission of poliovirus. The ACIP supports the global polio eradication initiative and the use of OPV as the only vaccine recommended to eradicate polio from the remaining countries where polio is endemic. Adverse Reactions: Rarely causes vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). The risk of VAPP is 1 case to 750,000 first doses of OPV distributed or an overall risk of 1 ca se per 2.4 million doses distributed. From 1980 through 1998, 152 cases of paralytic polio were reported in the United States; 144 (95%) of these cases were VAPP, and the remaining eight were in persons who acquired documented or presumed wild-virus polio outside the United States. Of the 144 VAPP cases, 59 (41%) occurred in healthy vaccine recipients (average age 3 months). Forty-four (31%) occurred in healthy contacts of vacci ne recipients (average age 26 years), and 7 (5%) were community acquired (i.e., vaccine virus was recovered but there was no known contact with a vaccine recipient). Thirty-four (24%) of VAPP cases occurred in persons with immunologic abnormalities (27 in vaccine recipients and 7 in contacts of vaccine recipients). None of the vaccine recipients were known to be immunologically abnormal prior to vaccination. Immunodeficient per sons, particularly those with agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, are at greatest risk for VAPP. Contraindications: Immunodeficiency diseases, including HIV infection, agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobu linemia; altered immune states such as the above-described individuals; pregnancy (theoretical risk) unless immediate protection is needed, e.g., outbreak situation.

Dose: 1.0 mL IM Continuous risk (see comments) : Check serologic titers to rabies every 6 months and give booster when antibody titer drops below acceptable level. Acceptable antibody level > 1:5 titer on the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Frequent risk (see comments) : Check serology or give booster every two years. Infrequent risk (see comments) : None Pre-exposure vaccination dose not elim inate the need for additional therapy after a rabies exposure but simplifies post-exposure treatment by eliminating the need for rabies immune globulin and decreasing the number of doses of vaccine required. Pre-exposure vaccination recommended for persons at high risk of exposure including, veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologist, spelunkers and certain laboratory workers. Vaccination of persons at moderate ri sk of exposure including international travelers visiting for extended period s in foreign countries where canine rabies is endemic (includi ng areas of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, India, Nepal, Phili ppines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, and some parts of Africa and Asia s hould be considered. Also, vaccination recommended for persons at high risk of exposure in countries where required therapy may be delayed. Continuous risk: Persons who work with live rabies virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities. Frequent risk: Other laboratory workers such as those doing rabies diagnostic testing, spelunkers, veteri narians and staff, animal-control and wildlife officers working in areas where rabies is epizootic, and international travelers living or visiting (for >30 da ys) in areas where canine rabies is endemic. Infrequent risk: Veterinarians and animal-control and wildlife officers working in areas of low rabies enzoot icity do not require routine boosters after completion of the full pre-exposure vaccine series. Adverse Reactions: Local reactions such as pain, erythema, swelling or itching at the injection site. System ic reactions include malaise, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches and dizziness. Approximately 6% of persons receiving booster doses have a delayed hype rsensitivity reactions. Contraindications: For post-exposure prophylaxis, there are no contraindications. For pre-exposure vaccination, anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components (see package insert for individual vaccine), or after a prior dose. Usually, one of the other rabies vaccines can be used to complete the series. Patients who are immunosuppressed by disease or medication should postpone pre-exposure vaccination and consi der avoiding activities for which pre-exposure vaccination is indicate d. If this is not possible, immunosuppressed persons who are at risk for rabies should be vaccinated and their antibody titers checked.

Do not initiate vaccine if infant is 13 weeks of age or older. ** The last dose of rotavirus vaccine should be administered by 32 weeks of age. Do not administer a second or third dose if the infant is over 32 weeks of age. Not established RotaTeq is the only vaccine approved in the United States that can help protect against rotavirus, a viral infect ion that may cause diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration. The vaccine should normally be administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Adverse Reactions: The following were reported more often in infants who received rotavirus vaccine when compared to infants who received placebo; diarrhea (24.1 percent in vaccine re cipients vs 21.3 percent in those receiving placebo), vomiting (15.2 per cent in vaccine recipients vs 13.6 percent in those receiving placebo), ea r infection (14.5 percent in vaccine recipients vs 13.0 percent in those rece iving placebo), runny nose and sore throat (6.9 percent in vaccine recipients vs 5.8 percent in those receiving placebo), wheezing and coughing (1.1 per cent in vaccine recipients vs 0.7 percent in those receiving placebo). Precautions: Acute gastroenteritis: Rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to infants with acute, moderate to severe gastroenteritis until the condition improves. However, infants with mild acute gastroenteritis can be vaccinated, particularly if the delay in vaccination may be substantial and might make the child ineligible to receive vaccine (e.g., older than 12 weeks of age before vaccination is initiated). Moderate to severe Illness until recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Preexisting chronic gastrointest disease, short-gut syndrome, or persistent vomiting of unknown cause) Infants with a previous episode of intussusception. Altered immunocompetence: Infants with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system. Infants on immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dos e systemic corticosteroids). Infants with primary and acquired immunodeficiency states, including HIV/AIDS or other clinical manifestations of infection with human immunodeficiency viruses; cellular immune deficiencies, and hypogammaglobulinemic and dysgammaglobulinemic states. Ther e is insufficient data from the clinical trials to support administrat ion of rotavirus vaccine to infants with indeterminant HIV status who are born to mothers with HIV/AIDS. Infants who have received a blood transfusion or blood products, including immunoglobulins within 42 days. Contraindication: Severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine or a constituent of the vaccine or after receiving a previous dose of rotavirus vaccine .

Inject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe and inject the total volume of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously. Not established MMR vaccine generally should be used whenever any of its component vaccines are indicated. For children aged 12 months-12 years, combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine can be considered if varicella vaccination is also indicated. Consider immune to rubella only if t here is documentation of laboratory evidence of rubella immunity or imm unization with at least one dose of rubella vaccine on or after the first bi rthday. Birth before 1957 provides only presumptive evidence of rubella immunity ; therefore birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella imm unity for women who might become pregnant. Administer one dose of a rubella virus- containing vaccine to women whose rubella vaccination history is unreliable and counsel women to avoid becoming pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination. For women of childbearing age routinely determine rubella immunity and counsel women regarding congenital rubella syndrome. For women who are pregnant and susceptible, vaccinate early in the postpartum period. Vaccine should be administered approximately 2 weeks before or deferred for at least 3 months after receipt of blood products and IG. However, previous administration of anti-Rho (D) IG (human) does not generally interfere with an immune response and is not a contraindication to vaccination. Serologically test these women 6-8 weeks after vaccination to assure that seroconversion has occurred. Adverse Reactions: Low-grade fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Arthralgia and transient arthritis occur more frequently in susceptible adults (12%-20%) than in children (3%), and more frequently in susceptible postpubertal females (25%) than in susceptible males. Contraindications: Anaphylactic reactions to a prior dose or to neomycin or to gelatin. Pregnancy and women planning to become pregnant in the next 4 weeks (if pregnant or if becomes pregnant within 4 weeks after vaccination, counsel about the theoretic al risk for the fetus, but rubella vaccination during pregnancy ordinaril y should not be a reason to consider abortion). Immunosuppression (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or resulting from therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large dos es of corticosteroid). Patients with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may be vaccinated. Short-term (2 weeks), low- or m oderate-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroid therapy (e .g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate- day treatment with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection of corticosteroid do not contraindicate rubella vaccine administration. Postpone vaccination of persons with acute moderate or severe illness with or without fever until condition improved.

A vesicular or pustular skin lesion at the site of inoculation 6-8 days pos tvaccination indicates a successful vaccination, or \"take.\" Contact the Los Angeles County Immunization Program regarding resources for training on vaccination techniques and guidelines. *Before the eradication of smallpox, vaccinia vaccination was administered routinely during childhood. However, smallpox vaccination is no longer indicated for infants or children for routine nonemergency indications. In an emergency (postrelease) situation, there would be no age limit for vaccination of persons exposed to a person with confirmed smallpox. **No skin preparation is required. Under no circumstances should al cohol be applied to the skin prior to vaccination as it has been shown to inactivate the vaccine virus. Persons with occupational exposure to non-highly attenuated vaccinia viruses, recombinant viruses derived from non-highly viruses, or other nonvariola orthopoxviruses should be revaccinated at least every 10 years. To ensure an increased level of protection against more virulent nonvariola orthopoxviruses (e.g., monkeypox), empiric revaccination every 3 years can be considered. Dose: 15 punctures with bifurcated needle into the skin over the deltoid muscle or the posterior aspect of the arm over the triceps muscle Revaccination is considered successful if a vesicular or pustular lesion is present or an area of definite palpable induration or congestion surrounding a central lesion, which may be a scar or ulcer, is present on examination 6-8 days after revaccination. For routine nonemergency use (i.e., in the absence of smallpox disease) vaccination is recommended for laboratory workers who directly handle cultures or animals contaminated or infected with non-highly attenuated vaccinia viruses, and recombinant vaccinia viruses derived from non-highly attenuated vaccinia strains, for laboratory workers exposed to other orthopoxviruses that infect humans (e.g., monkeypox or cowpox), and consider vaccination for healthcare workers who come into contact with materials such as dressings that may be contaminated with vaccinia or recombinant vaccinia. Vaccination is also recommended for public health, hospital, and other personnel who may need to respond to a smallpox case or outbreak, and for persons who administer the vaccine to others. In the event of an intentional release of variola virus, vaccination would be recommended for those exposed to the initial release, contacts of persons with smallpox, and others at risk of exposure. Adverse Reactions: soreness at the vaccination site, swelling and tenderness of regional lymph nodes, local satellite lesions, local edema; fever, malaise, myalgia, and intense erythema ringing the vaccination erythematous fetal vaccinia, and rarely death (1-2 deaths per 1,000,000 doses) Contraindications & Precautions during nonemergency vaccine use: History of anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of vaccine or to any vaccine component, including polymyxin B, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, and neomycin Immunosuppression (or immunosuppressed household contact) from leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy; solid organ or stem cell transplantation; and cellular or humoral immunity disorders, including HIV infection.

Use Td (or Tdap, if indicated) instead of tetanus toxoid for wound management (see Wound Management in this document). Diphtheria vaccination for case contacts: For contacts to a diphtheria case who have received less than three doses of a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine, or whose immuniza tion history for diphtheria is unknown, an immediate dose of the appropriate diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine should be given and the primary series completed according to the appropriate schedule. For contacts wh o have received three or more doses but who have not received a dose within the previous five years, a booster dose of diphtheria toxoid-cont aining vaccine is recommended. Adverse Reactions: Local reactions (erythema and indurat ion with or without tenderness). A nodule at the injection site may be palpable for several weeks Sterile abscess at the injection site has been reported Exaggerated local (Arthus-like) reac tions are occasionally reported following receipt of a diphtheria- or tetanus containing vaccine Mild systemic reactions such as fever may occur Brachial neuritis in adult vaccine recipients has been associated with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines (0.5 to 1 per 100,000 recipients) Rarely, immediate anaphylactic reactions Precautions: History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a prior dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as tetanus vaccination has been rarely associated with recurrence of GBS. Vaccination is usually justified for children who have had fewer than 3 doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine. History of Arthus-type hypersensitivit y reactions or a temperature of > 103\u00baF (>39\u00baC) following of tetanus toxo id. These persons usually have high serum antitoxin levels and should not be given doses of td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. Contraindications: A severe allergic reaction (acute re spiratory distress or collapse) to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid is a contraindication to receipt of tetanu s toxoid. If a generalized reaction is suspected to represent allergy, it ma y be useful to refer an individual for appropriate skin testing before discontinuing tetanus toxoid immunization. A moderate or severe acute illness is reason to defer routine vaccination until condition improves.

Persons 11 through 18 years: Boostrix or Adacel*: Dose: 0.5 mL IM (see comments) Persons 19 through 64 years Adacel* : Dose: 0.5 mL IM (see comments) * Boostrix is approved for persons 10-18 years of age; Adacel is approved for persons 11-64 years of age. Adolescents aged 11-18 years should receive a single dose of Tdap instead of Td for booster immunization. The preferred age for the booster Tdap vaccination is at 11-12 year s, if 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of DTaP, DTP, or DT. Adolescents aged 11-18 who received Td but not Tdap are encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap. A 5-year interval between Td and Tdap is encouraged. An interval of less than 5 years can be c onsidered in situations of increased risk of pertussis, such as during a per tussis outbreak, or if protection is desired because of close contact with an infant younger than 6 months of age or a young child who has not been vaccinated against pertussis. Recommendations for vaccination of adults are for a single dose of Tdap to replace a single dose of Td for boos ter immunization if the most recent tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine was received at least 10 years earlier. Tdap may be given at an interval shorter than 10 years since receipt of the last tetanus toxoid-containing vacci ne if necessary to protect against pertussis. Adults who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant 12 months of age or younger (e.g., parents, child care providers, healthcare providers) shoul d receive a single dose of Tdap. An interval of 2 years or more since the most recent tetanus toxoid- containing vaccine is suggested for t hese adults; shorter intervals may be used. Ideally, Tdap should be given at least 1 month before beginning close contact with the infan t. Women should receive a dose of Tdap in the immediate postpartum period if they have not previously received Tdap. Any woman who might become pregnant is encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap. Healthcare personnel who work in hospitals or ambulatory care setti ngs and have direct patient contact should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap. Other health-care personnel should receive a single dose of Tdap according to the routine recommendation and interval guidance for use of Tdap among adults. However, these personnel are encouraged to receive the Tdap dose at an interval as short as 2 years following the last Td. Adverse Reactions: Erythema and induration with or without tenderness, headache, fatigue, fever may occur. Rarely Arthus reactions, encephalopathy, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) occur. Precautions: Persons with a progressive neurological disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive encephalopathy until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition stabilized; history of an exaggerated local (Arthus-like) reacti ons; do not give further routine or emergency booster doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years; a history of GBS, within 6 weeks after a previous dose of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine. Contraindications: Anaphylactic reaction after a prior dose; encephalopathy not attributable to anot her identifiable cause within 7 days of vaccination. A moderate or severe acute illness is reason to defer routine vaccination until condition improves.

Adverse Events: Parenteral vaccine : ViCPs can cause fever, malaise, headache, injection site pain and erythema. Allergic reactions , such as pruritus, rash, urticaria, difficulty breathing, hypotension, are rare. Live Oral vaccine: Side effects of live oral vaccine are rare and consist of abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild fever, rash or urticaria. Contraindications: Parenteral : A previous severe systemic or allergic reaction to a prior dose of ViCPs is a contraindication to future use of ViCPs. Live Oral: A history of hypersensitivity to a component of the vaccine or the capsule contraindicates the use of t he live oral typhoid vaccine. Typhoid vaccine capsules should not be given dur ing an acute febrile illness or during an acute GI illness (e.g., persistent diarrhea, vomiting). Do not use the live oral vaccine in immunocompromised individuals including HIV-infected individuals. Do not use live oral vaccine in persons receiving antimicrobial agents (including sulfonami des) until 24 hours or more after the antimicrobial dose. No experience reported in pregnant women for either parenteral or live oral vaccine. Consider using parenteral typhoid vaccine in pregnant women at risk of exposure to S. typhi.

Persons 13 years and older (including adults): First: 0.5 mL SC* Second: 0.5 mL SC* 4-8 weeks later * To reconstitute the vaccine: Withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial into a syringe. Inject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe and inject the total volume of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously (SC). Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30 minutes. Not established If measles, mumps, and/or rubella vaccine is also indicated, use of licensed s MMRV vaccine is preferred over separate injection of equivalent component vaccines. Post-exposure Immunization: Varicella vaccine administered to susceptible persons within three days and possibly up to five days after varicella exposure may prevent or significantly modify disease. Adverse Reactions: Fever 102\u00ba F (15%), injection site erythema or pain or swelling (20%), varicella-like rash at injection site (3%), varicella-like rash generalized (4%- 6%, average 5 lesions). Breakthrough infection (1% of vaccine recipients per year develop chickenpox, but illness is milder than what is seen in unimmunized individuals). Zoster caused by the vaccine virus has been reported, mostly among vaccinated children. Precautions: Postpone vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute illnesses until the condition has improved. Do not administer for 3-11 months after receipt of antibody containing blood products (see table 2, page5). Vaccination is not recommended for persons known to have untreated active tuberculosis. Avoid the use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination because of the association between aspirin use and Reye syndrome following chickenpox. Contraindications: History of anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of vaccine or to any vaccine component, including gelatin and neomycin. Immunosuppression due to leukemia*, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, Immune deficiency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy (note, treatment with low-dose [less than 2 mg/kg/day], alternate-day, topical, replacement, or aerosolized steroid preparations is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive therapy with steroids has been discontinued for 1 month [3 months for chemotherapy] may be vaccinated.) Varicella vaccine should not be administered to persons with cellular immunodeficiency. However, persons with isolated humoral immunodeficiency (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia) should be vaccinated. Persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodeficiency resulting from infection with HIV, including persons diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not receive varicella vaccine. However, HIV-infected children aged 12 months and older in CDC clinical class N, A, or B with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts equal to 15% or higher and without evidence of varicella immunity should receive two doses of single antigen varicella vaccine at a minimum interval of 3 months. Pregnancy (Avoid pregnancy for at least 1 month post vaccination.) There is a registry to report inadvertent vaccination of a pregnant woman or a woman who became pregnant within 3 months of vaccination (800-896-8999). * Vaccine is available from Merck under a research protocol for special use in certain patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission.

Vaccine recipients should receive a completed International Certificate of Vaccination, signed and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine was given. This certificate is valid 10 days after vaccination and for a subsequent period of 10 years. Yellow fever vaccine is indicated for persons living or traveling in endemic areas of South America and Africa, or traveling to countries that require a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever. Infants between 6 and 9 months can be considered for vaccination when risk of infection is high. Infants younger than 6 months should not be immunized because they have an increased susceptibility for vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (formerly known as postvaccinal encephalitis). Healthcare providers considering vaccinating infants less than 9 months or pregnant women should contact the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (tel.: 970-221-6400) or the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (tel.: 404- 498-1600) at CDC for advice. Laboratory personnel with occupational risk exposure should be immunized. Adverse Reactions: Mild fever, headache, myalgia 5-10 days after vaccination. Rarely vaccine-associated neurotropic disease in children and vaccine associated viscerotropic disease (formerly reported as febrile multiple organ system failure) have been reported. Since 1992, five cases of encephalitis among adult recipients of yellow fever vaccine have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Since 1996, nine cases of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, a disease clinically and pathologically resembling naturally acquired yellow fever, have been reported in the U.S.; an additional 17 cases have been identified worldwide as of October 2004. In addition, ten cases of autoimmune neurologic disease have been reported to VAERS, including patients with Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Precautions: Defer in pregnancy, especially in first trimester, unless risk of disease higher than theoretical risk to pregnancy Avoid vaccination of nursing mothers unless risk of disease high Contraindications: Anaphylactic hypersensitivity to a prior dose or to a vaccine component, including egg and chicken protein. Age less than 6 months Immunocompromised status Low-dose (i.e., 20 mg prednisone or equivalent/day), systemic tendon injections with corticosteroids and intranasal corticosteroids should not be sufficiently immunosuppressive to constitute an increased hazard to recipients of yellow fever History of thymus disease, including myasthenia gravis, thymoma, or prior thymectom y IMMUNOBIOLOGICS Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 41 IMMUNOBIOLOGIC PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE B OOSTER SCHEDULE COMMENTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Zoster Vaccine Live ZOSTAVAX \u00ae Persons aged older: First: 0.65-mL SC* * To reconstitute the vaccine: Withdraw the entire contents of the diluent vial into a syringe.

Active untreated tuberculosis Pregnancy (There is a registry to report inadvertent vaccination of a pregnant woman or a woman who became pregnant within 3 months of vaccination (800-896-8999).) Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 42 Questions for Discovering Precautions/Contraindications to Routine Immunizations (Infants, Children, Adolescents) (Adapted from the Immunization Action Coalition) 1. Is the child seriously ill today? There is no evidence that acute illness reduc es vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1,2). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respirat ory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, or any vaccine? History of anaphylactic reaction such as hives (urticaria), wheezing or difficulty breathing, or circulatory collapse or shock (not fainting) from a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindica tion for further doses. For example, if a person experiences anaphylaxis after eating eggs, do not administer influenza vaccine, or if a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer MMR or varicella vaccine. Local reactions (e.g., a red eye following instillation of ophthalmic solution) are not contraindications. For ad ditional information call the Immunization Program at (213) 351-7800. 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). History of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Pr ecautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to futu re doses. Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). (e.g., community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a seizure or a brain problem? DTaP and Tdap are contraindicated in ch ildren who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual but consider the use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to minimize fever. 5. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, AIDS, or any other immune system problem? Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varice lla, and the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV], Rotavirus) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR and varicella vaccines are recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 6. Has the child taken cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had x-ray treatments in the past 3 months? Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose ster oid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the AC IP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transpl ant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can only be given to healthy individuals ages 5-49 years. 7. Has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given a medicine called immune (gamma) globulin in the past year? Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. See table 2, page 3 or consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the 2003 Red Book, p. 423, for the most current information on intervals between immune globulin or blood product administration and MMR or varicella vaccination (1, 2). 8. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, LA IV) are contraindicated prior to and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive MMR or varicella vaccination should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of either vaccine (8, 9). Inactivated vaccines may be given to a pregnant woman whenever indicated. 9. Has the child received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? If two live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella) are not given on the same day, the doses must be separated by at least 28 days . Inactivated vaccines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval. References 1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization. MMWR 2002;51 (RR-2). 2.

Medical evaluation determines that a neurological condition is evolving YES NO May administer DTaP YES NO If greater than one year of age, complete immunization with DT* 1. If less than one year of age, defer DT or DTaP (risk of diphtheria and tetanus is remote) 2. Reconsider need for immunization with each visit. 3. At or before 1st birthday, if neurological condition is resolved, corrected or controlled? In stable neurological conditions** (such as developmental delay or cerebral palsy) or if condition is resolved, corrected, or controlled, may vaccinate with DTaP. Use of acetaminophen at the time of immunization and every four hours for the ensuing 24 hours shoul d be considered. **This includes infants and children with well- controlled seizures or those in whom a seizure is unlikely to recur. A history of convulsion within three days of a previous dose of DTP or DTaP is not a contraindication but a precaution. In such cases, the benefit versus the risks of DTaP must be carefully considered. YES NO Give DTaP Give DT* * For infants and children who received DT but who on further evaluation can be given pertussis vaccine, DTaP can be used, idea lly as a series of 3 or more doses. However, in general, children <7 years of age should not receive more than 6 doses of diphtheria and tetanus-containing vaccines. If severe local reaction occurs, further administration of DT-containing va ccines should be reconsidered.

OTHER PROPHYLACTIC AGENTS Los Angeles County Department of Health Serv ices Immunization Program (2006) 52 HUMAN IMMUNE GLOBULIN (GAMMA GLOBULIN) For passive immunization against diseases. Administered intramuscularly (IM). A. Immune globulin (IG) , prepared from plasma of unselected donors for passive immunization against infectious agents to which antibody levels in general donor populations are relatively high. 1. Established efficacy: Benefit established. a) Viral Hepatitis, type A: Travelers: All susceptible persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate hepatitis A endemicity should be vaccinated or receive IG before departure. Hepatitis A vaccination at the age appropriate dose is preferred. In the case of travel within 4 weeks of Hepatitis A vaccine administration, a dose of immune globulin (0.02 mL/kg) may be given alone or in addition to hepatitis A vaccine, at a different site, for optimal protection. Travelers wh o are <1 years of age, are allergic to a vaccine component, or otherwise elect not to receive vaccine should receive a single dose of IG (0.02 mL/k g; maximum 2.0 mL), which provides effective protection against HAV infecti on for up to 3 months. Those who do not receive vaccination and plan to travel for >3 months should receive an IG dose of 0.06 mL/kg (maximum 5 mL), which must be repeated if the duration of travel is >5 months. (For those who may require repeated IG prophylaxis, screening for anti-HAV may be useful to determine susceptibility and eliminate unnecessary IG doses for those already immune.) Post-exposure prophylaxis: Post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible at a dos e of 0.02 mL/kg; use of IG more than 2 weeks after exposure is not indicated. IG is recommended for all household and sexual contacts of cases. IG should be administered to all previously unvaccinated staff and attendees of child care centers or homes if (a) one or more cases of hepatitis A are recognized in children or employees or (b) cases are recognized in two or more households of center attendees. In centers that do not provide care to children who wear diapers, IG need be administered only to classroom contac ts of an index patient. When an outbreak occurs (i.e., hepatitis A cases in three or more families), IG also should be considered for members of households that have children (center attendees) in diapers. Hepatitis A vaccine may be administered at the same time as IG for children receiving pos texposure prophylaxis in child care centers. If a food handler receives a diagnosis of hepatitis A, IG should be administered to other food handlers at the same establishment. Because common-source transmission to patrons is unlikely, IG administration to patrons typically is not indicated but may be considered if 1) during the time when the food handler was likely to be infectious, the food handler both directly handled uncooked foods or foods after cooking and had diarrhea or poor hygienic practices, and 2) patr ons can be identified and treated <2 weeks after the exposure. In settings in which repeated exposures to HAV might have occurred (e.g., institutional cafet erias), stronger consideration of IG use might be warranted. In the event of a common-source outbreak, IG should not be administered to expos ed persons after cases have begun to occur because the 2-week period during which IG is effective will have been exceeded. b) Measles: If administered within 6 days of exposure, IG can prevent or modify measles in a non-immune person. However, any immunity conferred is temporary unless modified or typical measles occurs. The usual recommended dose of IG is 0.25 mL/kg (0.11 mL/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 mL). For imm unocompromised persons the dose is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight (maximum dos e = 15 mL)). For persons receiving IGIV therapy, administration of at least 100 mg/kg within 3 weeks before measles exposure should be sufficient to prevent measles infection. IG is indicated for susceptible hous ehold contacts of measles patients, particularly those for whom the risk fo r complications is increased (i.e., infants aged <12 months, pregnant women, or immunocompromised persons). Infants <6 months of age are usually immune because of passively acquired maternal antibodies. However, if measles is diagnosed in a mother, unvaccinated children of a ll ages in the household who lack other evidence of measles immunity should re ceive IG. IG prophylaxis is not indicated for household contacts who have received a dose of measles vaccine on or after the first birthday, unless they are immunocompromised. Only if administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure is MMR vaccine acceptable for postexposure pr ophylaxis in household contacts aged >6 months except pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and others for whom vaccine is contraindicate d. IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks. Any person exposed to measles who lacks evidence of measles immunity and to whom IG is administered should subsequently receive MMR vaccine, which should be administered no earlier than 5-6 months after IG administration, provided the person is then aged > 12 months and the vaccine is not otherwise contraindicated. 2. Efficacy equivocal: Benefit, if any, not established a) Prevention of rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy b) Prevention of viral hepatitis type b. Use HBIG. b) Hepatitis C c) Hepatitis E B. Specific immune globulins, prepared from plasma of donors selected because of high levels of antibody to the specific diseases. 1. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG): 250 U for wound prophylaxis; 3,000-6,000 U for therapy (see \"Wound Management\"). 2. Rabies immune globulin (RIG): See \"Rabies Prevention Flowchart.\" 3. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG): HBIG recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis to mucosal, sexual, household or Perinatal exposure. HBIG should be gi ven as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours for Perinatal exposure, within 24 hours for percutaneous or mucosal exposure, and within 14 days of sexual contact. T he dose is 0.5 mL for newborns and 0.06 mL/kg (max. 5 mL) for others. 4. Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG): Currently there is no licensed Varicella zoster immune globulin in the Un ited States. There is an investigational varicella zoster immune globulin (VariZIG ) available for use under IND protocols, which may prevent or modify V-Z infection if administered within 96 hours after exposure. OTHER PROPHYLACTIC AGENTS Los Angeles County Department of Health Serv ices Immunization Program (2006) 53 Patients without evidence of immunity to va ricella (i.e., without history of disease or age-appropriate vaccination) who are at high risk for severe disease and complications, who have been exposed to varicella, and from whom informed consent has been obtained, are eligible to receive the IND application product under an expanded access protocol. The patient groups recommended by ACIP to receive VariZIG include the following: a) Immunocompromised patients. b) Neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around the time of delivery (i.e., 5 days before to 2 days after). c) Premature infants born at >28 w eeks of gestation who are exposed during the neonatal period and whose mothers do not have evidence of immunity. d) Premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh <1,000 g at birth and were exposed during the neonatal period, regardless of maternal history of varicella disease or vaccination. e) Pregnant women. Investigational VariZIG is supplied in 125-U vials. The recommended dose is 125 units/10 kg body weight, up to a maximum of 625 units (five vials). The minimum dose is 125 U. This product can be requested from the sole authorized U.S. distributor, FFF Enterprises (Temecula, California) (24-hour telephone, 800-843-7477). For more information ordering see MMWR/March 3, 2006/55(08); 209-210, 24, ( http://cdc.gov/mmwr ). Any patient who receives investigational VariZIG should be observed closely for signs or symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure because VariZIG might prolong the incubation period by >1 week. Antiviral therapy should be instituted immediately if signs or symptoms of varicella disease occur. Immune globulin intravenous (IGIV): When indicated, health-care providers should make every effort to obtain and adminis ter VariZIG. In situations in which administration of VariZIG does not appear possible within 96 hours of exposure, administration of immune globulin intrav enous (IGIV) should be considered as an alternative. IGIV should also be admin istered within 96 hours of exposure. Although licensed IGIV preparations are know n to contain anti-varicella antibody titers, the titer of any specific lot of IGIV that might be available is uncertain because IGIV is not routinely tested for anti-varicella antibodies. The recommended IGIV dose for postexposure pro phylaxis of varicella is 400 mg/kg, administered once. For pregnant women who cannot receive VariZIG within 96 hours of exposure, clinicians may choose either to administer IGIV or closely monitor the women for signs and symptoms of varicella and institute treatment with acyclovir if illness occurs. Note: Any type of immune globulin may cause biological false-positive serologic test (STS) for syphilis and Treponema pallidum inactivation (TPI) tests for syphilis. If a diagnosis of syphilis is being considered, a blood sample should be obtained prior to IG administration. NON-HUMAN ANTITOXINS A. Diphtheria antitoxin (equine origin) 20,000 to 120,000 U for therapy. Screen for horse serum allergy before use. Call ACDC at (213) 240-7942 (974-1234 after hours) to arrange for treatment of the patient. B. Botulinum antitoxin (equine origin): Trivalent (A, B, E) antitoxin preferable for therapy. Antitoxin therapy is more effective if undertak en early in the course of illness. Before administration of antitoxin, skin testing shoul d be performed to test for sensitivity to serum or antitoxin (see package insert). Ad ministration of one 10-ml vial of trivalent botulism antitoxin by the intravenous route re sults in serum levels of type A, B, and E antibodies capable of neutralizing serum toxin concentrations many fold in excess of those reported for botulism patients. Theref ore, after skin testing for sensitivity, contrary to the antitoxin package insert, administration of one vial of antitoxin intravenously is recommended and antitoxin nee d not be repeated since the circulating antitoxins have a half-life of 5 to 8 days. Call ACDC at (213) 24-7941 (974-1234 after hours) to arrange for treatment of the patient. Note: Human derived botulinum antitoxin (BIG) is available from the California Department of Health Services and should be considered for use in infants in preference to equine derived antitoxin. Call the State at (510) 231-7600.

Definition of exposure Exposure: Rabies can be transmitted only when the saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into open cuts or wounds, membranes (e.g., mouth, nose, eyes). Bite: Any penetration of the skin by an animal's teeth. Bites are high-risk exposures. Bites to the face and hands carry the highest risk. Non-bite exposure: Scratches, abrasions, open wounds or mucous membranes contaminated with saliva or neural tissue from a rabid animal constitute non-bite exposures. If the material containing the virus is dry, the virus can be considered noninfectious. Non-exposures: Other contact by itself, such as being in the vicinity of, petting, or handling an animal, or coming into contact with the blood, normally does not constitute exposure, and therefore does not require postexposure vaccination. However, because the injury inflicted by a bat bite or scratch may be small and not evident, prophylaxis is indi cated for situations in which a bat is physically present if a bite or mucous membrane exposure cannot be excluded and prompt testing of the bat to exclude rabies cannot be arranged.

Rabies Postexposure Schedule* Vaccination Treatment Regimen** All exposures Local wound treatment All postexposure treatment should begin with immediate and thorough washing of all bite wounds and scratches with soap and water. Tetanus prophylaxis and measures to control bacterial infection should be given as indicated. Not previously vaccinated HRIG (Human Rabies Immune Globulin) Vaccine 20 IU/kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, up one-half the dose should be infiltrated around the wound(s) and the rest should be administered IM into the gluteal area. HRIG should not be administered in the same syringe or into the same anatomical site as vaccine. Because HRIG may partially suppress active production of antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be given (0.06 x lbs. = mL HRIG). HDCV, RVA, or PCEC, 1.0 mL IM (deltoid area*), one each days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Previously Vaccinated HRIG Vaccine HRIG should not be administered.

RVA: Bio-Port PCEC: Novartis Vaccine at (800) 244-7668. HRIG can be purchased from Bayer Corporation Pharmaceutical Division at (800) 288-8370. ** These regimens are applicable for all age gr oups, including children. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for rabies prophylaxis. When rabies postexposure prophylaxis is administered to persons who are immunosuppres sed by disease or medications, it is especially important that a serum sample be tested for rabies antibody to ensure that an acceptable response has developed. Local pain, low grade fever, headache and malaise can follow receipt of HRIG. Once initiated, rabies prophylaxis should not be interrupted or discont inued because of mild adverse reactions. Serious systemic reactions are rare (6% among persons receiving booster doses of HDCV, and much less frequent among those receiving primary vaccination) . In the face of a serious systemic reaction, advice and assistanc e in management should be sought before deciding to discontinue vaccination of a person at risk for rabies. + The deltoid area is the only acceptable site of vaccination for adults and older children. For younger children, the outer aspect of the thigh may be used. Vaccine should never be administered into the gluteal area. Any person with a history of preexposur e vaccination with HDCV or RVA (Rabies Vaccine Adsorbed); prior postexposure prophylaxis with HDCV or RVA; or previous vaccination with any other type of rabies va ccine and a documented history of antibody response to the prior vaccination.

California Department of Health Services Veterinary Public Health Section: (916) 552-9740 Notes and References This flowchart was designed based on New York City Department of Health guidelines (1). The intent of this flowchart is to help physicians to evaluate possible rabies ex posures occurring in Los Angeles County. It is not meant to substitute for the best judgment of the physician who, with the patient, is clearly responsible for the final decision to administer-or not to administer-postexposure prophylaxis. Th e information presented here has been abstracted from: 1. New York City Department of Health. A Decision Tree for Human Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis. City Health Information 1992; 11:2-3. 2. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rabies Prevention - United States, 1999: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 1999; 48(RR-1);1-21 WOUND MANAGEMENT Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Di sease Control / Immunization Program (2006) 56 The need for active immunization (tetanus toxoid ), with or without passive immunization (tetanus immune globulin [TIG]), depends on t he condition of the wound and the patient's immunization history (see table below). Pers ons with wounds that are neither clean nor minor, and who have had 0-2 prior tetanus toxoid doses or have an uncertain history of prior doses, need TIG as well as Td. This is because early doses of toxoid do not induce immunity, but only prime the immune system. The TIG provides temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin. Th is ensures that protective le vels of antitoxin are achieved even if an immune response has not yet occurred. For wounds of average severity, 250 units of TIG should be administered at a separate site and in a separate syringe from that used for accompanying Td. The following table is a guide to active and pa ssive tetanus immunization at the time of wound treatment or debridement. It presumes a reliable knowledge of the patient's immunization history. Reminder: 1. Regardless of immunization status, all wounds should be properly cleaned and debrided. Wounds should receive prompt m edical treatment to remove all devitalized tissue and foreign material as an ess ential part of tetanus prophylaxis. 2. Enter any immunization administered on t he patient's personal immunization record, or give the patient a notification of immunization for his/her record. 3. If a contraindication to using tetanus toxo id-containing preparations exists for a person who has not completed a primary series of tetanus toxoid immunization and that person has a wound that is neither clean nor minor, only passive immunization should be given using tetanus immune globulin (TIG). 4. An Arthus reaction associated with a vacc ine that contained diphtheria toxoid without tetanus toxoid (e.g., MCV4), deferring Td (DTaP, DT, Tdap) might leave the person inadequately protected against tetanus and TT should be administered. In all circumstances, the decision to administe r TIG is based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus.

(* However, if TT and TIG are both used, use Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed rather than Tetanus Toxoid for Booster Use Only [fluid vaccine].) 3 TIG - Tetanus Immune Globulin. The recommended dose for wounds of average severity is 250 units intramuscularly (IM). When both Td and TIG are administered, use separate syringes and separate injection sites. 4 Yes, if 10 years or more since last dose. 5 Yes, if 5 years or more since last dose. More frequent boosters are not needed and can accentuate side effects. In addition, ACIP recommends that persons who experienced an Arthus reaction after a dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive Td more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management (see next column, Reminder #4). 6 Yes, if known to have a significant immune deficiency state (e.g., HIV, agammaglobulinemia), since immune response to tetanus toxoid may be suboptimal.
