One [old 1999 research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116906/) [homeopathy](/health/homeopathy-for-anxiety) is \"like cures like.\" If a certain thing causes an ailment, it may also cure it. These substances are typically diluted with water over and over again to formulate the homeopathic remedies. Sepia officinalis is ink from the cuttlefish. It can be found as a tincture or as a pill. It is often used for ailments like: [menstrual conditions](https://www.ijrh.org/article.asp?issn=0974-7168;year=2019;volume=13;issue=4;spage=219;epage=228;aulast=Gupta) - hot flashes and menopausal symptoms - irritability associated with premenstrual syndrome - feeling worn out According to the [National Center for Homeopathy](https://www.homeopathycenter.org/medicine_finder/sepia/), it is thought that ancient physicians used the flesh, eggs, or the one bone that is the skeleton of the cuttlefish when preparing this homeopathic remedy. Now the ink is used in homeopathy, and the remedy can be easily bought where homeopathic remedies are sold. It can be used by itself as a single remedy, or with other tinctures in combination remedies. Knowing more about homeopathy and sepia officinalis can help you make informed decisions about whether to try it for your ailments. There are a variety of uses for sepia. The most common uses include: - relieving [menopausal](/health/menopause)symptoms like hot flashes - relieving [premenstrual syndrome](/health/premenstrual-syndrome) - nausea and vomiting while pregnant - feeling overwhelmed [psoriasis](/health/psoriasis) - left-sided headaches - physical fatigue [vaginitis](/health/vulvovaginitis) Homeopathic medicine has [not been](/health/homeopathic-remedies-for-psoriasis#side-effects-and-precautions) widely studied for safety or effectiveness. Whereas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tests prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs to meet regulations, the same is not said about homeopathic remedies. An [old 1999 research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116906/) The same 1999 research review above showed that homeopathic remedies are so diluted that there often isn't even one molecule of the original solution present. Some researchers have hypothesized that the benefits of homeopathy are mainly due to the placebo effect. But in the research review above, double-blind, randomized trials showed significant differences between homeopathic remedies and placebos. Homeopathy can be effective. One explanation for this may be that during serial dilution, there might be an interaction between the water molecules and the original solution to create a sort of memory of the original solution at an atomic level that we don't measure with a simple microscope. When taking homeopathic medicines, it's important to remember that some may contain different amounts of active ingredients or other ingredients. Before taking the homeopathic remedy, talk with a medical professional to see if it may interact with any of the medications or supplements you are already taking. If you notice any side effects or changes in symptoms, call a medical professional. Before taking sepia officinalis or any kind of homeopathic remedy, talk with a healthcare professional first. Even though these are natural supplements and treatments, there may be the risk of an interaction with a medication or other supplement you are taking, or some supplements may not be good for certain medical conditions. If there is a health condition you are experiencing, call a healthcare professional first. Talk with them about the potential treatments for it, and if you are interested in treating it with sepia, let them know. Ask them whether you can try treating it with homeopathy first before moving on to prescribed treatments. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you might be pregnant, or are trying to get pregnant, do not take any homeopathic remedy without first talking with a healthcare professional. Do not take sepia officinalis in place of any medication that your doctor prescribes. If you are experiencing changes in symptoms, talk with a medical professional. Your treatment may need to be adjusted. While many people use homeopathy, there is no established evidence that they are clinically effective for any one condition. Before using sepia officinalis, ask a medical professional if it is safe to use, considering any health conditions you might have and any other medications you may be taking. If you are having any changes in symptoms, call a medical professional first. Do not substitute sepia for anything your doctor prescribed you without talking to them first. "}
