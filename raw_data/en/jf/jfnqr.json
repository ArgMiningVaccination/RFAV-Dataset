I have seen this type of insomnia often in the clinic and it is surprisingly common. If this is your case or the case of someone you're caring for you might wonder why it occurs. Similar to the idea of circadian rhythms, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) explains the rhythm of our bodies based on the 24-hour TCM clock. The TCM organ clock is divided into two-hour sections. Each two-hour section corresponds to a certain organ that is at its strongest and rules over the functions of the body during this time period. During this time, blood and qi (energy) enter certain organs by circulating through the 12 meridians. The body, mind, and emotions are inseparable in TCM. When they are in balance, each meridian flows freely to nourish organs, resulting in optimal health. But if there is disharmony in your body, it is tied to your emotional state and vice versa. Therefore, waking up at certain times of the night has different meanings and is your body's way of trying to tell you about your physical and emotional conditions. Check out the guide below for insight into why you might be waking up at a certain hour. If you're waking up between 11 pm and 1 am it means you need to take care of the gallbladder. Try reducing fat intake or consuming healthier fats since the gallbladder is responsible for breaking them down. On an emotional level, this signifies that you're holding onto heavy feelings of bitterness and resentment. It will be beneficial to reflect on your relationships and release any negativity blocking energy in your system. If you wake up between 1 am and 3 am it means your liver was overloaded. The liver is responsible for detoxifying our bodies and processing emotions each night. You may be suffering from an unhealthy diet, excess alcohol consumption, and/or unresolved anger or high levels of stress. Think back to a night when you had too much alcohol or intense frustration at work. Make sure to drink alcohol in moderation and find ways to deal with your stress in a healthy way. If you need professional help for detoxification, ask practitioners at Tao of Wellness about detox treatments. If you wake up between 3 am and 5 am it could be due to an imbalance in your lungs, specifically breathing. Therefore, any disruption to your sleep during this time means that there is something blocking your ability to take deep, proper breaths. It is also linked to emotional factors, such as grief as a result of dealing with loss. Try to practice abdominal deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga to improve your lung health and grief release. If you wake up between 5 am and 7 am then your large intestine is trying to tell you something. You need to pay attention to getting proper hydration and fiber since the large intestine is responsible for releasing digestive waste from your system. Emotionally, you're likely to be feeling \"stuck\" in a certain circumstance, relationship, job, etc. Try to release the lingering negative emotions that overwhelm you and move forward, both physically and emotionally. Acupuncture is a great way to balance the qi within your body. This will help improve sleep and energy, as well as balance emotions.
