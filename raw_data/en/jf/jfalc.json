New viruses emerge all the time and presently we have limited number of vaccines to combat viral diseases. Non-enveloped viruses such as enteroviruses, rotaviruses and norovirus are very stable viruses with presently no non-toxic means of decontamination. There is a great need to develop safe and broadly acting virus killing, i.e. antiviral ingredients and consumer products to be used as a first line defense against infections. Our research has identified crude fungal liquid fermentation products (without any concentration or fragmentation steps) and hemicellulose, both having separately and combined, efficient virucidal effects against different enteroviruses even at high virus concentrations, and without toxicity to human cells. In addition to enteroviruses, our tests have shown efficacy also to other groups of viruses, such as non-enveloped rotavirus, enveloped zika-virus, and most recently also coronavirus, indicating that our natural products act as broad-range antivirals. The products have a potential to be used as a) novel liquid non-toxic surface and hand sanitizer, and b) ingredients in cosmetic products. These innovative products respond to the need of safe and nature-derived green options to safely inactive and reduce the transmission of infective enteroviruses of public health importance. The project focuses on the most promising business area of disinfectants and antiviral ingredients for cosmetic products for daily use. emerge all the time and presently we have limited number of vaccines to combat viral diseases.
