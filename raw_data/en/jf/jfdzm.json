These programs are financed through revolving accounts (Federal Capital Contribution) and do not receive annual appropriations. Through these revolving fund accounts, funds are awarded to institutions that in turn provide loans to individual students.

Funds returned to HRSA are then awarded to programs that are in need of additional funds.

The agency has played a key role in protecting Americans from recent health emergencies including COVID- 19, opioid overdose, Zika, and HIN1. Key programs of the CDC include immunization and respiratory diseases; HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STD, and tuberculosis prevention; emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases; chronic disease prevention and health promotion; public health and scientific services; injury prevention and control; environmental health; global health; programs that reduce the occurrence of birth defects and developmental disabilities; public health preparedness and emergency response; and cross- cutting CDC-wide activities and program support, including public health infrastructure.

These include a request for $600 mil- lion for dedicated funding to invest in public health infrastructure and ca- pacity, and $50 million to support the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which will sustain efforts begun in FY 2021 with COVID-19 emergency supplemental appropriations. The FY 2023 Budget also provides $310 million for CDC to undertake the fourth year of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative, and $200 million to continue CDC's Public Health Data Modernization efforts.

Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) established a permanent risk adjustment program for non- grandfathered plans in the individual and small group markets. Risk adjust- ment is budget neutral within each state and market, such that charges collected from plans with lower than average actuarial risk are used to make payments to plans with higher than average actuarial risk. Risk ad- justment may be operated by a State, or by the Federal government in the event a State chooses not to operate risk adjustment. Payments and charges are made in the year following the plan year for which they are calculated. TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM payments........................................... 0001459 DEPARTMENT the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) established a transitional three-year reinsurance program to minimize the impact of high-cost enrollees in plans in the individual market for plan years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assessed contributing entities a per enrollee fee to fund the rein- surance program and made payments to issuers in the individual market for enrollees whose medical costs exceed a certain threshold, up to a rein- surance cap. Reinsurance collections and payments were made in the year following the plan year for which they were applicable. Reinsurance col- lections ended in FY 2019 and outlays in subsequent fiscal years reflect remaining payments, refunds, and allowable administrative activities. CONSUMER OPERATEDAND ORIENTED PLAN PROGRAM CONTINGENCY FUND Oriented Plan Contingency Fund was estab- lished by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240). This fund provides assistance and oversight to qualified nonprofit health insur- ance issuers that have been awarded loans or grants under section 1322 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148). CONSUMER OPERATEDAND ORIENTED Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) authorized and appropriated funding for the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Program. The CO-OP Program fosters the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers that operate with a strong consumer focus to offer qualified health plans in the individual and small group markets in the States. The Secretary awarded loans to qualified nonprofit issuers to fund start-up costs and reserves, which enabled qualified issuers to meet state solvency requirements. The Secretary issued the final round of loans in December 2014.
