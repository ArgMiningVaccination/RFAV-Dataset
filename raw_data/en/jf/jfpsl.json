Much interest in drug plants was evinced during the early period of civilization. The use of plants for curing various human ailments has prominently figured in ancient manuscripts such as Herodotus'. The ancient Chinese were using drug plants more than six centuries ago. They were the pioneers in using plants as valuable source of medicine. civilization raised or how the people lived? How they regulated their lands? Or what they used to eat? Etc. One of the aspects that many people are curious about is the old-world medicine, how ancient people dealt with illnesses and how they treated their patients? As for the American civilization, the most recorded advanced medicine was in the Aztec's empire. The Aztec's Empire was the most powerful Mesoamerican kingdom of old ages. In fact, their culture was full of creativity with a combination of methodology and religious tradition. They arrived in the Valley of Mexico in 1325C.E, and their name means Aztlan people, where they were originally from. In fact, I always feel like there is a catch to things like that. Although I wonder if being under hypnosis would be able to fit into these categories. I have been hypnotized two times in my life. I didn 't believe I would be able to be put into a hypnotic state. I thought I was just sleeping, but in fact, I was not. I feel like this fits under shamans. Many people get hypnotized to be able to be cured from something. Much like people who smoke cigarettes. Whats your opinion on hypnosis, do you think it fits under the categories like shamanism? Professionalism and ethics have been in play for a much longer time in healthcare than in any other industry. Runciman and Walton (2007) critically state that when patients come into a healthcare institution, they enter a unique social relationship. In essence they feel completely vulnerable and care should be taken to ensure that they are more confident within the relationship. They are expected to share and expose themselves in the most intimate way making this relationship the most vital for their own physical, emotional and social health. The importance of professional ethics in healthcare can be found in the Hippocratic Oath and other oaths administered by various medical schools. Owning the complete collection of Grey's Anatomy may make someone feel like an expert of the medical field, but when it comes down to knowing the diseases that were common during other periods of time, that understanding seems to be very limited. While diseases like the common cold have been around for a long time, there are many staple diseases that have shaped the medical field and the foundation for medicine today that need to be known. To fully understand diseases during the Elizabethan era, it is vital to understand the cause, type, and treatment of the illnesses that were common during that time period. This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice chronicles the interesting journey of the Harvard graduate and ethnobiologist Mark J. Plotkin as he attempts to record what's left of the slowly dying art of shamanism and traditional medicine, particularly in the northern part of South Africa. The book does an excellent job of relating important medicinal discoveries to their origins in nature and traditional medicine. In this way, the book cleverly mixes the subject of medicine and history in a way that I believe will be interesting for pharmacy students. Throughout my reading of the book, I enjoyed how it felt as though I as the reader got to go on this journey with him to all these interesting locations The religious beliefs and practices of the Tlingit and Navajo people were similar in that their religions wasn't like western religion, such as the organization, expansion, high priests or leaders. Both people groups' beliefs were centered around spirituality, maintaining balance, and respecting all spirits, which is in all living things. They also had similar responses to witchcraft that was suspected within their communities. When people became ill, it was believed to be the result of witchcraft. The Tlingit would have a shaman cure the illness if possible. The most common people to be accused of witchcraft in the Tlingit communities were women, children, and slaves, they were then tortured for confession or killed. However in the Navajo Medicine during the Elizabethan Era was extremely basic. The knowledge most people had about medicine came from their ancestors through many generations. The Elizabethan Era was a time when terrible illnesses such as the Black Plague were killing nearly one-third of the population. The cause of many illnesses during this time was lack of sanitation. Back then, women played a major role in medicine. They often nursed the sick using home remedies that were passed down from generation to generation. During the 1800s, physicians practiced various medical techniques, such as homeopathy and herbalism, while some physicians invented new techniques, like Electrotherapy. The popularized concept that Native American people have a \"mystical\" spirituality and live in harmony with nature is yet another taboo myth. Native Americans do believe in living in harmony with all elements as well as balance and harmony of spirit, mind, body and the environment. This belief also provides the Native American culture with a holistic approach to medicine. Health issues and solutions are typically seen as spiritually based and cared for without western medical interventions. This cultural custom directly affects treatment and how long an individual goes before being treated by a speech pathologist or audiologist. Knowing that health issues are usually cared for spiritually first it would be appropriate for the clinician to This paper presents a 60 years old male of Native American descent named Tomas Smith, who goes to the emergency department in an attempt to find some resolutions for the medical complications his is experiencing. Prior to seeking medical attention, the patient sought physical and spiritual healing for the art of cupping done that was by his tribal leaders, when the patient did not achieve the results he was hoping for, he decides to use the help of modern medicine. The patient and wife are not enthusiastic about modern medicine because of cultural beliefs but Mrs. Smith was afraid that she would lose her husband and call the ambulance for medical Many Native Americans used a traditional wigwam as a place for their religious ceremonies. Most religious ceremonies included dancing, healing, and pow-wows. Wigwams were also used as homes for Native American tribes. The wigwams ergonomics and easy-to-build structure made it the favorable by many tribes. Wigwams became a large part of the lives of Native Americans because it was where most religious events occurred. Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Traditional healers are individuals that are a part of the community and it is less expensive. Money is not the only factor that deters people away from seeking out western medicine, culture is the other. Traditions of the family are respected and a combo of western and traditional medicine are used (Smith, 2000). Of the Mexican immigrant culture, a little more than half of the population self-treat their symptoms and conditions while the other forty-nine percent seek folk healer or western health care professionals (Smith, 2000). Although it is in culture to use folk healers, many do not tell their health professionals about their traditional healer (Smith, 2000). Health professionals may not agree with the methods and treatments of the healers "}
