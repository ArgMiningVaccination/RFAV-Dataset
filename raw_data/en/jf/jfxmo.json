IDENTITY: The technical grade active ingredient (TGAI) is a constituent of oil of thym e, a naturally occurring m ixture of com pounds in the plant Thymus vulgaris (thym e). The product chem istry data subm itted by the registrant satisfies the requirem for product identity. B. USE/USAGE Thym ol (5-m ethyl-2-isopropyl-1-phenol) is to be used in end-use products for use in beehives to control the varroa m ite (varroa destructor ). There is currently no m anufacturing use registration for the technical grade of thym ol (5-m ethyl-2-isopropyl-1-phenol). C. RISK ASSESSMENT No unreasonable adverse effects on hum ans or the environm ent are anticipated from aggregate exposure to thym ol. This includes all anticipated exposures for which there is reliable information. 1. Human Health Risk Assessment a. Toxicological Endpoints Acceptable toxicity studies and waiver requests were subm itted and reviewed. BPPD's reviews cite acute oral LD50 higher than 2 gram s / kilogram (g/kg) which places thym ol's acute oral Toxicity Category III. Corrosive effects were observed after exposure to the TGAI. This places thym ol's prim ary derm al and eye irritations in a Toxicity Category I. The review also indicated the thym ol is a Toxicity Category IV for acute inhalation. Finally, hypersensitivity tests indicated that thym ol is a derm al sensitizer. b. Human Exposure Thym ol is found in the naturally occurring herb Thym e (Thymus vulgaris) . Thym e is used as a food seasoning ingredient, and is generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) natural seasoning by te Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) (21 CFR 182.10). Thym e oil also is recognized as a GRAS essential oil by FDA (21 CFR 182.20). As a result, a large num bers of hum ans have been and continue to be regularly exposed to the active ingredient via physical contact and in their diet with no known reports of adverse effects. In addition, exposures and health risks from the use of registered pesticides are expected to be low. Thus, the Agency does not expect the use of thym ol on food crops to result in any harm ful effects to hum ans. c. Risk Assessment The Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Divi sion (BPPD) has not subchronic, chronic, im mune, endocrine, or non-dietary exposur e issues as they m ay affect children and the general U.S. population. Thym ol is a constituent of a m ixture of organic com pounds known to be rapidly degraded in the environm ent to elem ental com pounds. No toxicological endpoints have Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 6 of 23 been identified, and there is lim ited exposure to this product when used according to the label instructions. The Agency has considered thym ol in light of the relevant safety factors in the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 and under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and has determ ined that there will be no unreasonable adverse ef fects from the use of this product. 2. Ecological Risk Assessment a. Ecological Toxicity Endpoints No toxic endpoints were identified. b. Ecological Exposure As stated above, thym ol is a naturally-occurring plant in the environm ent. The end-use product will be placed inside the beehives. As a result, exposure and, therefore, health risks to no-target aquatic and terrestrial organism s from the use of thym ol is unlikely to occur nor result in addition of exposure and residues to the environm ent that are above pre-existing background levels c. Risk Assessment It is highly unlikely that the use of thym ol will result in any adverse ef fect on terrestrial and aquatic non-target organism s. The active ingredient is a natural com ponent of a com monly found in a plant. As a result, BPPD believes that the use of the thym ol according to label use directions, should result in no significant adverse effects to wildlife. D. DATA GAPS / LABELING RESTRICTIONS There are no data gaps or labeling restrictions. Because of the end-use product's Toxicity Category I for eye irritation, som e restrictions and precautionary labeling are required to m itigate risks associated with the proposed uses (see Labeling Rationale for details). II. OVERVIEW A. ACTIVE INGREDIENT OVERVIEW Common Name: Thym ol; Thym e cam phor; Thym Thym ocide; Topps Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 23 OPP Chemical Code: 080402 CAS Registry Number: 89-83-8 Basingstoke, Hants RG 21 7NE United Kingdom B. USE PROFILE The following, is inform ation on the proposed uses with an overview of use sites and application m ethods. Type of Pesticide: Miticide Use Sites: Varrroa destuctor Formulation Types: Slow release gel m atrix Method and Rates of Application: In the hive. Place a piece of wax sheet, cardboard or plastic sheet (approxim ately 4\" x 4\") centrally on top of the brood fram es as a treatm ent tray. Using the dosing tools (sc oop and spatula), apply the first dose of 50 g gel from the tub onto the tray. Ensure the scoop is full and level off the excess with the spatula. Use the spatula to scrape the gel to an even thickness over the tray area with the spatula. After two weeks apply the second dose of 50 g ge l following the sam e procedure. Leave the product in the colony until it totally disappears from the tray or until the supers are installed, whichever is sooner. Small and wintering bee colonies and nuclei m ay require one dose of 25 g gel onl y, left in place until the product disappears from the tray. Dose out 50 g onto the treatm ent tray as before and cut in half Use Practice Limitations: 1. Do not treat during honey flow. 2. Do not feed colonies during the treatm ent. The treatm ent can be perform ed immediately after the rem oval of the supers. 3. Do not use the product when the m aximum daily tem perature is lower than 60NF or when the colony activity is very low. 4. Do not use the product when the m aximum daily tem perature is above Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 8 of 23 105NF. Timing: The efficacy of the end-use product is m aximized if the product is used in late sum mer after the honey harvest (when the am ount of brood present is dim inishing). However, in the case of severe infestations, the end- use product can also be used during sp ringtim e, when tem peratures are above 60NF. C. ESTIMATED USAGE None used yet since this will be the first registered product. D. DATA REQUIREMENTS The data requirem ents for granting this regist ration under Section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA have been reviewed by BPPD. The m ammalian toxicol ogy a nd ecological effects data requirem ents for thym ol have been fulfilled. Product analysis data requirem ents are adequately satisfied. E. REGULATORY HISTORY Products containi ng thym ol were originally registered in 1964 for use as repellents for dom estic anim als. Subsequently, thym ol-containing pesticides were approved f use as aciricides, fungicides and anti-m icrobials. In Septem ber of 1993, the EPA issued a Reregist ration Eligibility Decision (RED) for thym ol. At that tim e the Agency concluded that thym ol is an active ingredient that should be considered for a broad waiver of generic data requirem ents. On July 17, 2003, Vita (Europe) Lim ited subm itted a section 3 application and supporting documents to register the product Apiguard contai ning 25% of the active ingredient thym ol. The end-used product is proposed to be used in the beehives to control Varroa m ites. A notice of filling a pesticide petition to establish a tol erance for the acaricide thym ol, was published in the Federal register on April 27, 2005 (Volum e 70, Num ber 801). F. CLASSIFICATION In 1997, Biochem ical Classification Com determ ined that thym ol is a biochem ical pesticide because it is naturally occurring and it is used in foods and pharm aceuticals. G. FOOD CLEARANCES/TOLERANCES Thym ol currently e-lim ited exem ption from the requirem ent of a tolerance (\u00a7180.1240) in or on honeycom b in connection with use of the pesticide under section 18 em ergency exem ptions granted by EPA. Tim e limited exem ptions from the requirem ent of a tolerance for residues of thym ol Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 9 of 23 expired on June 30, 2007. Residues f or the biochem ical pesticide thym ol, are exem pt from the requirem ent of tolerance when used on honey, honeycom b and honeycom b with honey. The final rule was published in the Federal Register of January 18, 2006 (Volum e 71; Num ber 11). III. SCIENCE ASSESSMENT A. PHYSICAL/CHEMICAL PROPERTIES ASSESSMENT All product chem istry data requirem ents for thym ol are satisfied. Product Identity and Mode of Action a. Product Identity: Thym ol is a colorless MSDS), is stable under ordinary c onditions of use and storage (NOAA MSDS), has a neutral pH i n alcohol (National Library of Me dicine SIS Chem iID Plus), is not an oxidizer or reducer, m elts at 48 - 51.5\u00b0C (MRID 46485601, MSDS dated Novem ber 15th 2001, National Library of Medicine SIS Chem iID Plus, NOAA MSDS), boils at 232.5-233\u00b0C (MSDS dated Novem ber 15th 2001, Natio nal Library of Medicine SIS Chem iID Plus, NOAA MSDS), has a specific gravity of 0.97 25\u00b0C/4\u00b0C MSDS), a dissociation c onstant of 10.62 @ 20\u00b0C (National Library of Medicine SIS Chem iID Plus), a partition coefficient of 3.3-3.34 (Log Kow; MSDS dated Novem ber 15th 2001, National Library of Medicine SIS Chem iID Plus, EPA 2001), water solubility of 900m g/L @ 20\u00b0C or 0.1g/100g water @ 25\u00b0C (National ary of Medicine SIS Chem iID Plus, NOAA MSDS), and vapor pressure of 0.0022 m m Hg @ 25\u00b0 C, 12.7 Pa @ 40\u00b0C, and 1m m Hg @ 64\u00b0C (National Library of Medicine SIS Ch emiID Plus, NIH Toxnet, NOAA MSDS). b. Mode of Action: Thym ol is the active ingredient in the currently registered end-use product (EP) and is applied as a gel in trays to beehives to control and suppress parasitic varroa m ites. 2. Food Clearances/Tolerances tim e-lim ited exem ption from the requirem ent of a tolerance (\u00a7180.1240) in or on honeycom b in connection with use of the pesticide under section 18 em ergency exem ptions granted by EPA. Tim e limited exem ptions from the requirem ent of a tolerance for residues of thym ol expired on June 30, 2007. Residues for the biochem ical pesticide thym ol, are exem pt from the requirem ent of tolerance when used on honey, honeycom b and honeycom b with honey. The final rule was published in the Federal Register of January 18, 2006 (Volum e 71; Num ber 11). 3. Physical And Chemical Properties Assessment The physical and chem ical characteristics of the TGAI were subm itted to support the registration of the end-use product Apiguard. There are sum marized in Table 1. Table 1. Product chem istry data requirem ents: Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 10 of 23 GUIDELINE NO.

HUMAN HEALTH ASSESSMENT Thym ol is a com ponent of m any non-pesticidal cons umer products currently m arketed in the United States. Thym ol is listed as a food additive by the Food and Drug Adm inistration (21 CFR 172.515; synthetic flavoring substances and adjuvants). Thymol rapidly degraded in the environm ent to elem ental constituents by norm al biological, physi cal, and/or chem ical processes that can be reasonably expected to exist where the pesticide is applied. The phenols of thym ol are considered GRAS as set forth in 21 CFR 172.515 (synthetic flavoring substances and adjuvants). The inform ation subm itted in support of the application for registrat ion of Apiguard and the technical grade active ingredient thym ol adequately satisfies the requirem ents set forth in 40 CFR 158.690 (c) for biochem ical pesticides. The overall toxicologi cal risk from hum an exposure to thym ol is considered negligible. 1. Toxicology Assessment a. Acute Toxicity Acute oral toxicity - rat (870.1100): . The oral ( 2005) and Sax (1984) to be 980, 640-1800, and 880 mg/kg in rats, m ice, and guinea pigs re spectively. The lowest reported oral LD50 concentration for Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 12 of 23 thym ol (640 m g/kg in m ice) was chosen to determ ine the a cute oral Toxicity Category. This concentration places thym ol conservatively into Toxicity Category III for acute oral effects. Acute derm al toxicity - rat (870.1200): Calculated derm al LD50s for technical thym ol (Reference 2) are sim ilar to that (>2000m g/kg) reported by the Environm ental Risk Managem ent Age ncy (ERMA, 2005) of New Zealand and Anonym ous (2000). The lowest calculated derm al LD50 concentration for thym ol (1049 m g/kg in m ice) was chosen to determ ine the acute derm al Toxicity Category. This concentration places thym ol conservatively into Toxicity Category II Acute inhalation toxicity (870.1300): The waiver rationale f or acute inhalation toxicity is based upon inform ation from the U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration Center for Drug Evalua tion and Research and other peer reviewed public ations. Thym ol is added to the anesthetic halothane as a preservative (0.01%) and is considered inactive ( by FDA. 1997) at this concentration. Halothane is used to anesthetize dogs, cats, and other non-f ood anim als for periods som etimes exceeding 4 hours. Anesthetic induction concentrations can typically reach approxim ately 5%. Ca lculation of the exposure from these factors yields a thymol atmospheric concentration of 5m g/L, at which perm anent pathological effects on the anesthetized patients are not expected. Since this theoretical concentration is greater than 2 m g/L (the lower lim it for Toxicity Category IV) thym ol can be conservatively placed into Toxicity Category IV fo r acute inhalation toxicity for technical thym ol. Prim ary eye irritation - rabbit (870.2400): The test m aterial caused corneal opacity which persisted to the final observation at day 28. Conjunctival irritation persisted to day 14, and iritis resolved by day 7. The test m aterial is a severe eye irritant, and can be placed in Toxicity category I. Prim ary derm al irritation - rabbit (870.2500): Data subm itted states that thym ol is corrosive to the skin. As a result, thym ol can be placed in Toxicity Category I. Skin sensitization (Maxim ization test) - guinea pig (870.2600): The waiver rationale f or skin hypersensiti vity is based on inform ation pr esented in Hostynek and Magee (1997). Using quantitative structure activity relationships, Hostyne k and Magee predicted that thym ol is a derm al sensitizer. Thes e results contrast that previously reported in the Federal Register (2003), Anonym ous (2000), and ERMA (2005). b. Mutagenicity, Developmental Toxicity, and Immune Response Genotoxicity and m utagenicity studies were subm itted as waiver rationales f or genotoxicity (870.5000). These, in com bination with other pee r-reviewed publications retrieved by EPA, support the respective data requirem ent for the TGAI. Thym ol has been reported to be non-m utagenic in multiple Am es tests (strains TA97, TA98, and TA100 w eduled DNA synthesis (liquid scintillation), sister chrom atid exchange, and cell transform ation tests in Syrian ham ster em bryo cells in 2005; Ts osomal aberrations in Allium cepa (G rant, 1982). three species of Thymus (capitatus, citriodorus, vulgaris ) also were negative for DNA dam aging activity and m utagenicity in the Am es test (strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 with and w/out non-m utagenic in a salmonella/m icrosom e assay, did not induce the form ation of m icronuclei in m ice, even when orally dosed in the toxic range (1100 m g/kg Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 13 of 23 bw). Further, in the A/He strain of m ice, thym ol did not increase the incidence of spontaneous lung tumors following repeated intraperitoneal dosing (Anonym ous, 2000). Overall , the weight of evidence suggests that thym ol is not genotoxic or m utagenic. The waiver rationale for im mune response (870.3550) is based upon inform ation presented in a peer- reviewed publication (Hagan et al., 1967). In th e subchronic study, no effects were seen in the thym us, spleen, lym ph nodes, white cell counts, re d cell counts, hem oglobin counts, or hem atocrits following the dosing of rats with 1000 or 10000m g/kg of food grade thym ol for 19 weeks Mam malian toxicity data for thym ol is sum marized in Table 2.

Effects on the Endocrine Systems EPA is required under section 408(p) of the FFDCA , as am ended by FQPA, to develop a screening program to determ ine whether certain substances (including all pesticide active and othe r ingredients) \"m ay have an effect in hum ans that is sim ilar t o an effect produced by a naturally- occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect s as the Adm inistrator m ay designate.\" Thym ol is not a known endocrine disruptor nor is it related to any class of known endocrine disruptors. Thus, there is no im pact via endocri ne-related effects on the Agency's safety finding set forth in this docum ent for thym ol. 2. Dose Response Assessment No toxicological endpoints are identified. 3. Dietary Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation In examining aggregate exposure, FFDCA sec tion 408 directs EPA to consider availabl e information concerning exposures f rom the pesticide residue in food and all other non\u00ad occupational exposures, includi ng drinking water from ground water or surface water and exposure through pesticide use in gardens, lawn s, or buildings (residential and other indoor uses). a. Food. Thym ol is found naturally in thym e herb (e.g., Thymus vulgaris , T. zygis ). Thym e is used as a food seasoning ingredient, and is generally r ecognized as a safe (GRAS) natural seasoning by FDA (21 CFR 182.10). Thym e oil also is rec ognized as a GRAS essential oil by FDA (21 CFR 182.20). The volatile oil com ponent of thym e herb is about 2% to 5% content, a nd thym e oil is reported to contain from 30% to 75% thym ol, and even up to 90%. Thym ol may be safely used in foods as a synthetic flavoring substance when used in the m inimum quantity to produce the intended effe ct (21 CFR 172.515). Levels of thym ol reported in foods where it is perm itted as a direct food add itive have been stated as 44 ppm in ice cream , ices, etc.; 2.5 ppm to 11 ppm in non-alcoholic 9.4 ppm in candy, 5 ppm to 6.5 ppm in baked goods, and 100 ppm in chewing gum . Thym ol is a natural com ponent of lim e blossom honey, where the m aximum thym ol cont ent has been determ ined to be 0.16 m g/kg. European studies using Apiguard in bee hives during honey flow dem onstrated that thym ol residues in honey accum ulated up to 4.61 m g thym ol/kg honey after 2 days of exposure. This represents a worst case scenario for potential residues because residue incorporation into honey could have occurred directly from the Apiguard tray. Thym ol residues in wax were not considered in this dietary assessm ent because wax is not known to be a dietary foodstuff. EPA estim ated the dietary exposure t o U.S. subpopulations using the m aximal thym ol Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 15 of 23 residue level from the European studies (4.61 m g/kg) and com pared it to esti mated exposures resulting from thym ol in other foodstuffs (ice cream @ 44 m g/kg, yellow cake @ 6.5 mg/kg, cola beverage 2 11 m g/kg, and caram el candy @ 9.4 m g/kg). Ingestion rates for honey and the foodstuffs were obtained fr om the FDA Total Di et Study (1990). Body weights for the respective populations were derived from the EPA Exposure Factors Handbook (1997). Calculated thym ol exposures from honey were substantially l ess than that from the food stuffs Norm alized data showed that the U.S. general population is potentially exposed to 938 tim es more thym ol from the consum ption of ice cream , yellow cake, cola beverages, and caram el candy than from thym ol consum ed in honey. Sim ilarly, calculations show that the population with highest exposure (6 year old child) is potentially exposed to 279 tim es more thym ol from the cons umpt ion of other foodstuffs than from thym ol in honey. Male adults (60-65 years old) share a sim ilar level of exposure with 251 tim es more exposure to thym ol from foodstuffs other than honey. These calculati ons illustrate that thym ol residues in honey will not contribute signif icantly to the dietary burden of thym ol. b. Drinking w ater exposure No drinking water exposure is expected from the pesticidal use of thym ol which is confined to placem ent in beehives . Thymol is currently registered for use on ornam ental plants, shrubs and grasses so there is som e potential for exposure to water. However, thym ol is a constituent of a m ixture of organic com pounds know n to be rapidly degraded in the environm ent to elem ental com pounds by norm al biological, physical and/or chem ical processes. In the RED, the Agency concluded th at the registered uses of thym ol will result in negligible exposure of the environm ent and nontarget organism s (ref er to page 7 of the RED). Therefore, thym ol is not expected to be found in drinking water. 4. Occupat ional, Residential, School and Day Care Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation Hum an exposure to thym ol is not expected in residential, school and day care areas. a. Occupational Exposure The end-use product is used as a slow release gel m atrix presented in a tray which is placed in a bee hive. The possibility for derm al, eye and inhala tion exposure, is m itigated as long as the product is used according to label directions, which require s the use of protective equipm ent, the restricted entry interval into treated areas. b. Residential, School and Day Ca re Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation No indoor residential, school, or day care uses c urrently appear on proposed labels. Hum an exposure to thym ol should not occur in these areas. 6. Acute and Chronic Dietary Risks for Sens itive Subpopulations Particularly Infants and Children Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 16 of 23 A. U.S. population. There is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to residues of thym ol to the U.S. population, infa nts, and children. This includes all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for whic h there is reliable inform ation. The Agency has arrived at this conclusion based on the fact that the plant is a part of the hum an diet in certain areas of the world with no reported adverse effects, a nd that hum ans have had frequent physical contact with thym e and plants treated with thym ol no negative health effects. B. Infants and children. FFDCA section 408 provi des that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold margin of exposure (also referred to as a m argin of safe ty) for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnat al toxicity and the com pleteness of the database unless EPA de termines that a different m argin of exposure will be safe for infants and children. Margins of exposure are often referred to as uncertainty or safety factors. In this instance, based on all available inf ormation, the Ag ency concludes that thym ol is non-toxic to m ammals, including infants and children. Because there are no threshol d effects of concer n to infants, children and adults when thym ol is used as labeled, the provision requiring an additional m argin of safety does not apply. As a result, EPA has not used a m argin of exposure approach to assess the s afety of thym ol. 7. Cumulative exposure to substances w ith a common mechanism of toxicity. Section 408(b) (2)(D)(v) of the FFDCA r equires that, whe n considering whether to establish, m odify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider ``available infor mation' ' concerning the cum ulative effects of a particula r pesticide' s residues and ``other substances that have a com mon m echanism of toxicity.' ' EPA does not have, at this tim e, available da ta to determ ine whether thym ol has a com mon mechanism of toxicity with other subs tances or how to include this pesticide in a cum ulative risk assessm ent. Unlike other pesticides f or which EP A has followed a cum ulative risk approach based on a com mon m echanism of toxicity, thym ol does not appear to produce a toxic m etabolite produced by other substa nces. For the purposes of this exem ption from the requirem ent of a tolerance, therefore, EPA has not assum ed that thym ol ha s a com mon m echanism of t oxicity with other substances. For inform ation regarding EPA' s efforts to determ ine which chem icals have a com mon mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cum ulative effects of such chem icals, see the f inal 62 FR 62961 Novem ber 1997). 8. Cumulative Effects Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of the FFD CA requires that, when considering whether to establish an exem ption from a tolerance, the Agency consider \"available inform ation concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and other subst ances that have a common m echanism of t oxicity.\" These cons iderations include the possible cum ulative effects of such residues on infants and children. Com mon m echanism s of toxicity are not relevant to a consideration of cum ulative exposure to thym ol because it is not toxic to m ammalian system s. Thus, the Agency does not expect any cum ulative or increm ental effects from exposure to residues of thym ol when Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 17 of 23 applied/used as directed on the label and in accordance with good agricultural practices. 9. Risk Characteriz ation The Agency has considered thymol in light of th e relevant safety factors in FQPA and FIFRA. A determ ination has been m ade that no unreasonable a dverse effects to the U. S. population in general, and to inf ants and children in particular, will resu lt from the use of thym ol when label instructions are followed. C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 1. Ecological Effects Haz ard Assessment Vita (Europe) International subm itted waiver reque sts for avian acute oral (850.2100), dietary (850.2200), toxicity testing. BPPD approved the waive r requests and agrees with the argum ent that exposure of non target organism s is unlikely si nce the product will be placed on a tray inside closed beehives. Moreover, thym ol has a low m ammalian toxicity and degrades rapidly in the environm ent. 1. Environmental Fate and Ground Water Data Environm ental exposure asse ssments on bi ochemical pesticides are not performed unl ess significant human health or ecological effects issues arise in th e Tier I studies for either of these disciplines (40 CFR \u00a7158.690 (c) and (d)). Since Tier II studies we re not triggered, there is no requirem ent for environm ental fate data. 2. Ecological Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation Thym ol is found in the herb Thym e (Thymus vulgaris) . Thym e is used as a food seasoning ingredient, and is generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) natural seasoning by the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) (21 CFR 182.10). Thym e oil also is recognized as a GRAS essential oil by FDA (21 CFR 182.20). As a result, a larg e num bers of huma ns and other organism s have been and continue to be regularly exposed to the active ingredient via physical contact and in their diet with no known reports of adverse effects. Exposures and health risks from the use of registered pesticides are expected to be low. Moreover, thymol will be used in slow re lease gel m atrix presented in tray that regulates the liberation of thym ol in the honeybee colony. As a result, no t oxicology or environm ental fate and effects data were deem ed necessary for this registration. Precautionary labeling of Apiguard stipulates, \"This product is toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Do not apply directly to water, areas where surface water is p resent or to intertid al areas below the mean high wa ter mark. Drift or runoff from treated areas m ay be hazardous to aquatic organism s in neighboring areas. Do not contam inate water when disposing of equipm ent washwaters.\" The waiver requests f or subm itted data are sum marized in Table 3.

EFFICACY DATA No efficacy data are required, because no public health uses are involved. IV. RISK MANAGEMENT DECISION A. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR REGISTRATION Section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA provides for the registra tion of new active ingredients if it is determ ined that (A) its com position is such as to warrant the proposed claim s for it; (B) its labeling and other materials required to be subm itted com ply with the requirem ents of FIFRA; (c) it will perf orm its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environm ent and (D) when used in accordance with widesprea d and com monly recognized practice it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environm ent. To satisfy criteria \"A\" above, thym ol is not e xpecte d to cause unreasonable adverse effects when used according to label instructions. Criteria \"B\" is satisfied by the current label and by the data presented in this docum ent. It is believed that this new pesticidal active ingredient will not cause any unreasonable adverse ef fects, will extend the lif e and usef ulness of ornam entals as claim ed satisfying Criteria \"C\". Criteria \"D\" is satisfied by the data subm itted and the low exposure to the product when used according to label directions. Therefore, thym ol is eligible for registration. Registered use is listed in Table 4, Appendix A. B. REGULATORY POSITION 1. Conditional/Unconditional Registration All data requirem ents are fulfilled and BPPD ation There are no Codex m aximum residue levels established for thym ol. 3. Non-food Re/Registrations Thym ol is currently registered for use as a disinfectant and anim al repellent. Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 19 of 23 4. Risk Mitigation There are no signif icant risk issues. Risks to a pplicators and handlers are m itigated by protective clothing requirem ents and re-entry restrictions. 5. Endangered Species Statement Currently, the Age ncy is developing a pr ogram (The Endangered Species Protection Program ) to identify all pesticides whose use m ay cause potential adverse im pacts on endangered and threatened species and their habitats. To aid in the identif ication of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, seve ral companies have form ed an Endangered Species Task Force (EST) under the direction of the Am erican Crop Protection at the subcounty level, and, particularly, if an endangered species occurs in areas where pesticides would be used. This inf ormation will be usef ul once the Endangered Species Protection Program has been im plem ented. The Agency has no evidence to believe that any endangered or threatened species will be adversely affected if products containing thym ol are used as labeled. The Agency has m ade a no effect finding for the use pattern of thym ol. Thus, no labeling is required for endangered or threatened species at this tim e. C. LABELING RATIONALE It is the Age ncy's position that the labeling for apiguard containing 25% of thym ol com plies with the current pesticide labeling requirem ents. 1. Human Health Haz ard a. Worker Protection Standard Any product whose labeling reasonably perm its use in the production of an agricultural plant on any farm , forest, nursery, or greenhouse m ust com ply with the labeling requirem ents of PR Notice 93-7, \"Labeling Revisions required by the W orker Pr otection Standard (W PS), and PR Notice 93-11, \"Supplem ental Guidance for PR Not ice 93-7, which reflect the requirem ents of EPA\"s labeling regulations for worker protection statem ents ( 40 CFR part 156, subpart K). These labeling revisions are necessary to implem ent the W orker Protection Standard for Agricultural Pesticides (40 CFR part 170) and m ust be com pleted in accordance with, and within the deadl ines specified in PR Notices 93-7 and 93-11. Unless otherwise specifically directed, all statem ents required by PR Notices 93-7 and 93-11 are to be on the product label exactly as instructed in those Notices. The labels and labeling of all products m ust com ply with EPA's current regulations a nd requirem ents as specified in 40 CFR 156.10 and other applicable notices, such as, and including the WPS labeling. Workers and handlers (including m ixer/loaders, a nd applicators) applying this product m ust wear long sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes and socks, chem ical resistant gloves and protective eyewear. b. Non-Worker Protection Standard No non-workers standard necessary since the product is placed inside beehives. c. Precautionary Labeling The Agency has exam ined the toxicological data base for Apiguard and concluded that the proposed Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action Document Page 20 of 23 precautionary labeling ( i.e. Si gnal W ord, Statem ent of Practical Treatm ent and other label statem ents) adequately m itigates any risks associated with the proposed uses. End-Use product Precautionary Labeling: For Apiguard, \"DANGER\". Causes irreversible eye dam age. Harmful if swallow ed or absorbed through skin. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Wear protective eyewear such as goggles, face shield, or safety glasses. Wear chem ical resistant gloves. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and be fore eating, drinking, chewing gum , or using tobacco. Rem ove and wash contam inated clothing before reuse. d. Spray Drift Advisory No spray drift advisory needed. The product is app lied as a slow release m atrix inside the beehive. 2. Environmental Haz ards Labeling End-Use Product Environmental Haz ards Labeling: This product is toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Do not apply direc tly to water, areas where surface water is present or to intertidal areas below the mean high water m ark. Drift or runoff from treated areas m ay be hazardous to aquatic organism s in neighboring areas. Do not contam inate water when disposing of equipm ent washwaters. 3. Application Rate It is the Age ncy's position that the labeling for the pesticide product containing Apiguard complies with the current pesticide labeling re quirem ents. The Agency has not stipulated a maximum num ber of applications for the active ingredient. Place a piece of wax sheet, cardboard or plastic sheet (approxim ately 4\" x 4\") centrally on top of t he brood fram es as a treatm ent tray. Using the dosing tools (scoop and spatula), apply the first dose of 50 g gel from the tub ont o the tray. Ensure the scoop is full and level off the excess with the spatula. Use the spatul a to scrape the gel to an even thickness over the tray area with the spatula. Ensure that there is a free space of at least \u00bc inch between the top of the tray and the hive cover board, fo r exam ple, by placing an em pty super on top of the brood box. Close the hive. After two weeks apply the sec ond dose of 50 g gel following the same procedure. Leave the product in the colony until it totally disappears from the tray or until the supers are installed, whichever is sooner. D. LABELING (1) Product nam e: Apiguard Active Ingredient: Thymol Biopesticide Registration Action \"DANGER\". Eye irritation warning is appropriate. The product shall contain the following inform ation: - Product Nam e - Ingredient Statem ent - Registration Num ber -\"Keep Out of Reach of Children\" - Signal W ord (DANGER) V. ACTIONS REQUIRED BY REGISTRANTS Reports of incidences of advers e effects to hum ans or dom estic an imals under FIFRA, Section 6(a)2 and incidents of hypersensitivity under 40 CFR Part 158.690(c), guideline reference num ber 152-16. There are no data requirem ents, label changes and other responses necessary for the reregistration of the end-use product since the product is being registered after Novem ber 1984 and is, therefore, not subject to reregistration. There are also no existing stocks provisions at this tim e. VI. APPENDIX A Table 4 lists the use sites for the product. Table 4 .
