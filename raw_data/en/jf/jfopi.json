However, the effects on the immune system and mental health varied among studies. Purpose: This meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the randomized controlled trials to draw comprehensive conclusions regarding the psycho-immunological efficacy. Methods: Random-effects models were used to assess the outcome of interest. Egger's tests were used to identify publication bias. Subgroup and meta-regression were used to explore potential moderators. This review was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019148118). Results: Nineteen randomized controlled trials with a total sample size of 1,300 were included in this meta-analysis. Regarding immune system outcome, mind-body therapy significantly improved CD4 T-cell counts (Cohen's d = 0.214, p = .027) and maintained (0.427, p = .049). In addition, baseline CD4 T-cell counts and years since HIV diagnosis significantly moderated the efficacy of mind-body practices on CD4 improvement (all ps < .001). Regarding mental health outcome, mind-body therapy significantly reduced stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms (0.422, p < .001; 0.506, p < .001, and 0.709, p < .001, respectively) while improving quality of life (0.67, p < .001). Conclusions: Meditation/yoga intervention could result in potential benefits with regard to improved CD4 T-cell counts immediately after the intervention and at long-term follow-up, while also improving their mental health. The cost-effective meditation/yoga intervention should be integrated into routine care for people living with HIV, especially for those with lower CD4 baseline and fewer years since diagnosis.
