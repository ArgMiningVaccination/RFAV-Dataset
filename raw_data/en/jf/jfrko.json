Longs to Walgreens: No Deal Walnut Creek, CA -- Longs Drug Stores Corp. rejected an offer from Walgreen Co. to acquire all of its outstanding shares for $75 per share in cash for a total purchase price of approximately $3 billion, including the assumption of debt. The offer represented a $3.50 per share premium over the cash purchase price already proposed by CVS/Caremark Corporation and accepted by Longs. In the latest offer, Walgreens proposed to acquire Longs retail drug stores in California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as its prescription benefits management company, RxAmerica, LLC. According to the San Francisco Chronicle's Web site, SFGate.com, the proposal was rejected \"due to fears over antitrust concerns\" and a possible extension of regulatory approvals which could take up to a year. It also reported Walgreens spokesperson Michael Polzin as saying that Walgreens remains \"committed to pursuing our proposal.\" HHS Declares Public Health Emergency in Texas and Louisiana Washington, DC -- In the wake of Hurricane Ike, HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt declared the states of Texas and Louisiana public health emergencies to ensure that individuals living in those states, including those enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government-run health care services, are not deprived of the programs. According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Acting Administrator Kerry Weems, the declaration allows for temporarily relaxing the agency's normal operating procedures so that health care services \"will continue to be provided to the elderly, people with disabilities, and vulnerable children\" after they left the areas affected by Hurricane Ike.

In-store Clinics Attracting Patients Without Personal Physicians Santa Monica, CA -- A study conducted by the Rand Corporation uncovered the fact that in-store medical clinics typically attract insured and uninsured patients seeking help for relatively minor and easy-to-treat illnesses or preventative care that do not otherwise have a regular health care provider. After analyzing more than 1.3 million visits to retail clinics over a seven-year period, it was also discovered that 43% of patients who visit retail clinics are between the ages of 18 and 44, compared to 23% who visit primary care physician offices. About 90% of the visits were for simple acute conditions and preventative care. This compares to about 18% of visits to primary care physician offices and 12% of emergency department visits.
