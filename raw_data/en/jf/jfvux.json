It integrates the principles of functional medicine throughout the naturopathic program. Graduates learn to consider the whole person including the patient's diet, lifestyle, environment, genetics, physical, mental, and emotional health, and other factors that influence health and well-being. Including functional medicine principles in the UWS naturopathic doctor program distinguishes it from other NMD programs. Naturopathic medicine and functional medicine are science-based, patient-centered approaches to achieving and maintaining health by addressing the root cause, not just suppressing symptoms. Functional medicine's focus on the biochemical and genetic individuality, and the diet and nutrition of each patient, integrates well with the full range of assessments and treatment modalities of naturopathic medicine. This 14-quarter naturopathic doctoral program can be completed in three-and-a-half years and is taught on our [beautiful campus in Portland, Oregon](https://www.uws.edu/community/visit-campus/). The program provides a community of learning through in-person experiences with knowledge, skills, and society reinforced through in-person lectures, labs, team-based learning, and clinical rotations. The NMD degree curriculum offers some online courses delivered both synchronously and asynchronously. Students are expected to be on campus for the entire program.
