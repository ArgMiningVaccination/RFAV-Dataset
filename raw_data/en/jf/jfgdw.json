We are conducting a research study to assess the immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination in patients with various immune deficiencies. Blood samples will be collected before the first vaccine dose, about 1 month following the first dose, at about 1 month following the second dose (if applicable), and at 6, 12, and 24 months after the last dose. We will also ask about any side effects at each time point and up to 1 month following the last vaccine dose. In addition, participants can submit saliva samples every other week for 6 months to test for COVID-19 after vaccination. Individuals can still participate if they have started or completed vaccination; sampling will begin at the next relevant timepoint. This protocol can be completed remotely, including blood and saliva sampling. You may go to your local Quest Diagnostics, or we will provide you with an at-home finger stick blood sampling kit. As the vaccine becomes available to you, please contact the NIH team to coordinate timing and shipment of collection supplies. We thank you for your partnership in better understanding how healthy patients respond to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. To see if you may be eligible, please email [NIAIDCovidVaccineStudy@niaid.nih.gov](mailto:NIAIDCovidVaccineStudy@niaid.nih.gov). Participants will be compensated. The study does not provide the COVID-19 vaccine.
