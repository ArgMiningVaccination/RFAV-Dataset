Mission Statement: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the nation's rst public university, serves North Carolina, the United States, and the world through teaching, research, and public service. We embrace an unwavering commitment to excellence as one of the world's great research universities. Our mission is to serve as a center for research, scholarship, and creativity and to teach a diverse community of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to become the next generation of leaders. Through the efforts of our exceptional faculty and staff, and with generous support from North Carolina's citizens, we invest our knowledge and resources to enhance access to learning and to foster the success and prosperity of each rising generation. We also extend knowledge- based services and other resources of the University to the citizens of North Carolina and their institutions to enhance the quality of life for all people in the State. With lux, libertas \u2014 light and liberty \u2014 as its founding principles, the University has charted a bold course of leading change to improve society and to help solve the world's greatest problems. Approved by the UNC Board of Governors, November 2009, February 2014, July 2022 UNC's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusivity UNC-Chapel Hill has a long-held tradition of striving for excellence. Quality education takes place among persons with differing social backgrounds, economic circumstances, personal characteristics, philosophical outlooks, life experiences, perspectives, beliefs, andexpectations. We at the University acknowledge that we face ongoing challenges to overcome the effects and influences of adverse historical, social, political, and economic factors. A critical element for any 21st century educational institution is a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that functions in a global context. The historical, political, economic, and educational backgrounds of the University, the state, and the nation shape our present circumstances and inform the measures we must take to accomplish our highest aspirations. The University engages in teaching, research, and service to expand and discover knowledge, promote educational enlightenment, and improve understanding. We work to assure that we have a complement of students, faculty, and staff that broadly reflects the ways in which people differ. We speak of these differences as representing \"diversity.\" UNC's commitment to inclusive excellence began in the 1960s through the support of minority programming and continues today through the work of the the University Ofce for Diversity and Inclusion (UODI) (http://diversity.unc.edu). The ofce is led by the vice provost for equity and inclusion, who serves as the chief diversity ofcer and advises the University community on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and issues. The ofce collaborates with University ofcers and campus units to identify and implement the tenets of the Strategic Plan; Carolina Next: Innovations for Public Good. The ultimate goal of both UODI and the University is to continue building an inclusive and equitable environment that values and respects the contributions of all members of the Carolina community.

Roberts Temple Sloan Michael WillifordUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 13 UNC-CHAPEL HILL: AN INTRODUCTION The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the most comprehensive institution in North Carolina, both in the range of its programs at all levels and in the breadth of its specialized research and public service programs. Its 14 schools and the College of Arts and Sciences provide instruction in more than 100 elds, offering 74 bachelor's, 104 master's, 65 doctoral, and 7 professional degrees, as well as 16 certicates, in academic areas critical to North Carolina's future: business, dentistry, education, information and library science, media and journalism, government, law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, and social work, among others. Since 1795, when its doors rst opened to students, the University has remained faithful to its founders' charge to duly encourage and promote all useful learning for the betterment of humanity. The University was anticipated by a section of the rst state constitution drawn up in 1776 directing the establishment of \"one or more universities\" in which \"all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted.\" State support, it directed, should be provided so that instruction might be available \"at low prices.\" The American Revolution intervened, and it was not until 1789, the year that George Washington became president of the new nation, that the University was chartered by the General Assembly. Despite constitutional instructions to the contrary, no state appropriations were made, and the trustees were left to secure land and money themselves. On October 12, 1793, the cornerstone was laid for a brick building on a hilltop near the center of the state amidst the colorful fall foliage of dogwood, oak, and tulip trees. The site, lying at the crossing of north-south and east-west roads, was marked only by a small Anglican chapel that soon shared part of its name \u2014 New Hope Chapel Hill \u2014 with the community that developed there. Legislator and trustee William R. Davie, who had been instrumental in securing passage of the charter, took the lead in organizing the University. Davie presided over the Masonic ritual of the laying of the cornerstone. In time he came to be called \"the Father of the University.\" Many years later a large poplar or tulip tree, rst mentioned in 1818 and still standing near the center of the old campus, was called Davie Poplar in his honor. The rst building and, indeed, the only building for two years, was a two-story brick structure that came to be called Old East. It is now a National Historic Landmark, the oldest state university building in America. Opened to students on January 15, 1795, the University of North Carolina received its rst student, Hinton James of New Hanover County, on February 12. By March there were two professors and 41 students present. The second state university did not begin classes until 1801, when a few students from nearby academies assembled under a large tree at Athens, Georgia, for instruction. By then four classes had already been graduated at Chapel Hill, and there were to be three more before the rst diplomas were issued in Georgia. The next building on the Carolina campus was Person Hall, begun in 1796 and long used as the chapel. The cornerstone of Main or South Building was laid in 1798. All three are older than any other American state university building. The Young University During the early 19th century the trustees began a period of strong support in the development of the young University. Even though theirproclaimed initial goal for the University had been to provide trained leadership for the state, the curriculum followed the customary classical trend. In 1815, however, the natural sciences were given equal place, and in the 1820s Professors Denison Olmstead and Elisha Mitchell prepared the nation's rst geological survey. In 1831 the rst astronomical observatory at a state university was built under the direction of President Joseph Caldwell. Student enrollment increased steadily, and by 1860 only Harvard, Yale, and the University of Virginia had more students. Young men from many states came to Chapel Hill for their education, particularly those from families who had recently left North Carolina to settle elsewhere in the South. The University of North Carolina provided governors not only for North Carolina but also for many other states; countless professions and occupations were represented among its graduates, including cabinet members, clergymen, diplomats, engineers, geologists, judges, legislators, surveyors, teachers, and a president and a vice president of the United States. Though the Civil War closed many colleges and universities, the University at Chapel Hill remained open throughout the war, though its students were few. During Reconstruction, however, it was closed from 1870 until 1875. When it reopened, the University's leadership began to inaugurate programs that once again marked it as a leading university. The General Assembly in 1931 consolidated the University with the Woman's College at Greensboro and North Carolina State College at Raleigh under a single board of trustees. As an economy measure during the Depression and as a means of eliminating duplication, the trustees allocated each unit specic roles in higher education for the state. The ofces of the Consolidated University were established on the Chapel Hill campus and University President Frank Porter Graham became the Consolidated University's rst president. The period of the Depression in the 1930s saw a great deal of new construction on the campus as federal funds became available to create jobs for the unemployed. New dormitories, classroom buildings, a gymnasium, and other buildings and improvements were built in part from this source. World War II also resulted in some new construction and alterations on campus as the University's facilities were used to train military personnel. Expansion continued throughout the 20th century, and today UNC- Chapel Hill ranks among the great institutions of higher education in the nation. Beginning with one building, 41 students, and two professors, the University has now grown to more than 300 buildings, 30,011 students annually, and 3,887 faculty members. Top Rankings The University has been recognized for the quality of its undergraduate and graduate programs in every national survey conducted in the last third of the 20th century and into the 21st. U.S. News and World Report's survey of American colleges and universities consistently ranks the University among the best colleges in the nation and among the top research universities. These accolades reflect the quality of the curriculum and of the faculty, whose research orientation allows them to share with their students not only the thrill of discovery but also the latest advancements and new knowledge. Another asset that contributes to this reputation is UNC- Chapel Hill's superb library system containing more than nine million print and electronic volumes. It is ranked among the top research libraries in the United States and Canada by the Association of Research Libraries.14 UNC-Chapel Hill: An Introduction Commitment to Diversity The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill strives for excellence both in academic engagement and co-curricular support. Sustaining a diverse and inclusive community is critical to achieving educational excellence. Framework for Understanding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at UNC-Chapel Hill The work of the University in the 21st century functions in a global context. The historical, political, economic, and educational backgrounds of the University, the state, and the nation shape our present circumstances and inform the measures we must take to accomplish our highest aspirations. We acknowledge that we face an ongoing challenge to overcome the effects and influences of adverse historical, social, political, and economic factors. The University engages in teaching, research, and service to expand and discover knowledge, promote educational enlightenment, and improve understanding with the ultimate end of uplifting humankind. Education takes place most productively among persons with differing social backgrounds, economic circumstances, personal characteristics, philosophical outlooks, life experiences, perspectives, beliefs, and expectations. The University works to assure that we have a complement of students, faculty, and staff that broadly reflects the ways in which people differ. We believe that \"diversity matters\" within and beyond the campus community. UNC-Chapel Hill's commitment to inclusive excellence began in the 1960s through the support of minority programming and continues today through the establishment of the University Ofce for Diversity and Inclusion (UODI). The University Ofce for Diversity and Inclusion (https:// diversity.unc.edu/) serves as a resource to the entire Carolina campus and partners with all student, faculty, staff, and organizational entities. UODI collaborates with University ofcers and campus units to identify and implement strategies and initiatives for achieving the goals of increased diversity, with the goal of building an inclusive and equitable environment that values and respects the contributions of students, faculty, and staff.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is one of the constituent institutions of the multicampus state university. The University of North Carolina, chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1789, was the rst public university in the United States to open its doors and the only one to graduate students in the 18th century. The rst class was admitted in Chapel Hill in 1795. For the next 136 years the only campus of the University of North Carolina was at Chapel Hill. In 1877 the North Carolina General Assembly began sponsoring additional institutions of higher education, diverse in origin and purpose. Five were historically black institutions, and another was founded to educate Native Americans. Several were created to prepare teachers for the public schools. Others had a technological emphasis. One is a training school for performing artists. In 1931 the North Carolina General Assembly redened the University of North Carolina to include three state-supported institutions: the campus at Chapel Hill (now the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering at Raleigh (now North Carolina State University), and the North Carolina College for Women (Woman's College) at Greensboro (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro). The new multicampus University operated with one board of trustees and one president. By 1969 three additional campuses had joined the University through legislative action: the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of North Carolina at Asheville, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. In 1971 the General Assembly passed legislation bringing into the University of North Carolina the state's 10 remaining public senior institutions, each of which had until then been legally separate: Appalachian State University, East Carolina University, Elizabeth City State University, Fayetteville State University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina School of the Arts, Pembroke State University, Western Carolina University, and Winston-Salem State University. This action created a 16-campus University. In l985 the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, a residential high school for gifted students, was declared an afliated school of the University, and it became the 17th constituent institution. The UNC Board of Governors is the policy-making body legally charged with \"the general determination, control, supervision, management, and governance of all affairs of the constituent institutions.\" It elects the president, who administers the University. The 32 voting members of the board are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four- year terms. Former board chairs and board members who are former governors of North Carolina may continue to serve for limited periods as nonvoting members emeriti. The president of the UNC Association of Student Governments, or that student's designee, is also a nonvoting member. The UNC System Ofce (http://www.northcarolina.edu/) is in Chapel Hill, NC. Each of the 17 institutions is headed by a chancellor, who is chosen by the Board of Governors on the president's nomination and is responsible to the president. Each institution has a board of trustees, consisting of eight members elected by the Board of Governors, four appointed by thegovernor, and the president of the student body, who serves ex ofcio. (The North Carolina School of the Arts has two additional ex ofcio members.) Each board of trustees holds extensive powers over academic and other operations of its institution on delegation from the Board of Governors.

It was chartered in 1789 and formally opened in 1795; from early in its history, it has encouraged research and creative activity. As early as 1853-1854 the catalog of the University carried an announcement of graduate coursework. In 1876, after the institution had been closed for the period 1871-1875, the catalog announced the requirements for the master's degree, and the next issue carried an announcement of regulations governing the degrees of master of arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy. Several graduate degrees were awarded before the turn of the century (the rst Ph.D. having been conferred in 1883) but it was not until 1903 that a separate graduate school with a dean was established. The Graduate School celebrated its 100th year in 2003 by hosting a national forum on graduate education, sponsoring numerous student and alumni recognition ceremonies, and commissioning the book, Pioneer to Powerhouse: The History of Graduate Education at Carolina. In 1922 the graduate faculty voted to vest in the Administrative Board of The Graduate School legislative powers in matters that affected graduate education, to authorize the Administrative Board to admit members to the teaching faculty of The Graduate School, and to vest in the Administrative Board the responsibility for authorizing curricula and courses carrying graduate credit. With the exception of the master of business administration (M.B.A.), the master of accounting (M.A.C.), the master's in clinical laboratory science (M.C.L.S.), the master's in radiologic science (M.R.S.), the master of law (L.L.M.), the master of health sciences (M.H.S.), the master of education for experienced teachers (M.Ed.), and the master of school administration (M.S.A.), all master's degrees offered by the University and the degrees of doctor of philosophy, doctor of education (post-2011), doctor of nursing practice, and doctor of public health are conferred by The Graduate School. Work toward advanced degrees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill proceeds under policies and regulations established by the graduate faculty. The immediate direction of The Graduate School is in the charge of the Administrative Board, of which the dean is chair. At present the board consists of academic and health affairs faculty representatives appointed by the chancellor upon nomination by the dean of The Graduate School. Summer School for Graduate Students The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill established what was possibly the rst summer school in America in 1877. The \"Summer Normal School,\" as it was then called, enrolled 235 students in courses over 10 disciplines. About half the students were teachers; students came from 42 counties across North Carolina and from neighboring states. Summer School was the rst school at UNC-Chapel Hill to enroll women, beginning in its rst year and continuing thereafter. By 1925, records indicate that 19,983 students had enrolled in Summer School. Curricula and courses offered during Summer School are comparable to those of the fall and spring semesters. Summer School offers two sessions of ve weeks each, a three-week Maymester, and other short courses with various beginning and ending dates. The summer program is planned to meet the needs of graduate students who are fullling degree requirements in this institution, visiting graduate students who desire to take courses for transfer to other institutions, teachers andadministrators who desire to meet state certication requirements, and other students who have special educational objectives. Graduate students who wish to be admitted or readmitted for the summer to a degree program should contact The Graduate School. The requirements for admission to a degree program starting in the summer are the same as those in the regular academic year. Those who desire other information or those wanting to enroll in the summer as visiting students should visit Summer School's website (http://summer.unc.edu/), contact Summer School via email at summer_school@unc.edu , or telephone (919) 966-4364. Summer School is located at 134 East Franklin Street, Room 200, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3340. Visiting Scholars Registration as a visiting scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill entitles the registrant to certain privileges of the University, the issuance of a UNC One Card, and the use of University facilities for the duration of the visiting scholar's stay. Eligibility for registration as a visiting scholar is limited to those who 1.Are not on the University payroll as employees in any capacity, and 2.Are visiting the University under the sponsorship of an academic department or school for the furtherance of scholarly interests. Visiting scholars may include faculty members on leave from other institutions of higher learning, postdoctoral fellows, or others who hold the terminal degree in their elds and who are invited to visit by a department or school.

Selected certicates are approved at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. The University does not award any credential below a bachelor's degree credential, and any approved undergraduate certicate must be awarded in conjunction with a bachelor's degree. A certicate program is a formal program of courses and other related experiences in a eld of specialization. In some disciplines, a certicate is akin to a professional credential, while in others, a certicate is recognition of competence in a given skill, practice, or eld of study. Like an academic degree, a certicate program is offered by a host academic school, department, or curriculum and is related to an academic area of study. It carries academic credit. The campus encourages interdisciplinary and interinstitutional certicate programs where appropriate. All certicate programs that award academic credit, regardless of intended audience, are governed within The Graduate School through policies set forth by the Ofce of the Provost. Additional information and an ofcial listing of current certicate programs are available on The Graduate School's website (https://gradschool.unc.edu/ facultystaff/program-development/certicates.html).32 Schools and Departments SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS Welcome!

The department plans to admit graduate students beginning in the fall 2025 semester.) The department's geographical breadth covers Africa, North America, South America, and the Caribbean, and the disciplinary diversity of our faculty encompasses history, anthropology, political science, literature, ethnomusicology, performance and dance, and other elds. These specializations inform the tracks and concentrations of our new graduate program. Additionally, the department has a long-standing and highly regarded language program that currently offers elementary, intermediate, and advanced language instruction in Swahili and Wolof. We began sponsoring our rst course in Yoruba in spring 2022. Our approach to graduate training bridges historical separations between African Studies and African American/Diaspora Studies and unites those elds within intellectual and methodological frameworks that focus on the experience and the agency of peoples of African descent in the modern world from a historical, cultural, and comparative perspective in general, and with respect to the impact of globalization on Africa and the African diaspora in particular. As such, we also aim to address major gaps in current studies of the global experiences of people of African descent. Upon entry into the M.A. or Ph.D. program, students will be initially admitted into one of the following major geographic elds: (1) Africa, (2) African America, or (3) African Diaspora (non-North America). For the purpose of deepening the major geographic eld with multi-disciplinary and content-specic study, students\u2014in consultation with their primary advisor and by the end of their third semester of enrollment\u2014will also declare two major thematic concentrations within the major geographic eld. The options include: (1) Literary Studies and Cultural Production; (2) Gender, Sexuality, and Feminism; (3) Development, Public Policy, and Social Change; and (4) Histories and Africana Critical Theory. Further, by the end of the third semester of enrollment, each student will select a minor geographic eld to complement their major geographic eld. Students may take any conguration of courses in the minor geographic eld to fulll degree requirements and are not required to declare a thematic concentration in the minor geographic eld. The selection of the two major thematic concentrations within the major geographic eld and the choice of minor geographic eld should be informed by coursework taken in these areas.

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 39 DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN STUDIES (GRAD) The Department of American Studies offers a Ph.D. in American studies and an M.A. in folklore as well as a graduate minor in either American studies or folklore for students pursuing a graduate degree in other departments. Ph.D. in American Studies The Ph.D. degree in American studies provides rigorous training in interdisciplinary methods dedicated to the understanding of the complex cultures and history of the United States and its place in the world. Program graduates will be prepared both to teach at the college and university levels in American studies and related elds, including Southern studies, American Indian studies, literature, history, art history, cultural studies, and folklore, and to pursue professional opportunities in museums, historical sites, archives, or related elds requiring interdisciplinary perspectives and methodologies. Admission Students will be admitted to the Ph.D. in American studies from a range of academic programs, some with an undergraduate degree, some with a master's degree in American studies or another relevant discipline. Candidates for admission should be rmly grounded in the humanities, social sciences, or the arts. The best qualied students should articulate an interest in American history, literary, expressive and/or material culture, and/or critical theory; should show some familiarity with library, web-based, and/or ethnographic research methods; and should offer a specic rationale for their interest in the UNC-Chapel Hill graduate program. In addition to The Graduate School application form, candidates for admission will present one or two writing samples, a statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation, ofcial transcripts, and a curriculum vitae. Transfer credits may be awarded at the department's discretion on the basis of course equivalencies. Applications will be accepted in December for matriculation the following August. Consult the website of The Graduate School (http:// gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) for details, specic deadlines, and a link to the online application system. M.A. in Folklore (https:// americanstudies.unc.edu/areas-in- american-studies/folklore/) The M.A. program in folklore (https://americanstudies.unc.edu/areas- in-american-studies/folklore/) focuses on the study of creativity and aesthetic expression in everyday life and on the social and political implications of this expression as it unfolds in contested arenas of culture. Not bound to traditional denitions of folklore, and committed to preparing students for ethical practice in a multicultural world, the program offers a flexible M.A. curriculum that readies students for both public practice and further academic study. Admission Applications will be accepted in December for matriculation the following August. Consult the website of The Graduate School (http:// gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) for details, specic deadlines, and a link to the online application system.The Department of American Studies also offers a Ph.D. in American studies; however, admission to the M.A.in folklore does not constitute admission to the Ph.D. in American studies. Ph.D. in American Studies The Ph.D. program in American studies balances flexibility and a focus on students' own areas of interest with requirements designed to insure knowledge of key issues and texts in the interdisciplinary study of American culture. Ph.D. students must complete 20 courses (60 hours). Those who enter the program with an M.A. may count up to 9 hours of previous study toward the degree. Four specic courses-AMST 700 , AMST 903 -are required. Students generally take six other courses offered by American Studies core faculty and the remainder of their courses in a variety of associated graduate programs, including English, history, music, and religious studies. Those who enter the program with a B.A. degree must undertake the M.A. Research Seminar (AMST 901 ) and the Capstone Project (AMST 992 ). Students pursuing the Ph.D. take two comprehensive exams, one in American studies and another in an area of specialization developed in consultation with their advisors before beginning their dissertation work. They are also expected to participate actively in the departmental colloquium. Students who join the department with a master's degree can expect to spend less time on coursework than those who enter with an undergraduate degree, although students admitted with a master's degree in a eld other than American studies may need to take some additional courses as they progress toward the American studies Ph.D. The graduate studies committee will make the determination on an individual basis. Students who enter with an undergraduate degree earn the M.A. at the end of their second year, upon completion and defense of the capstone project, before proceeding to preparation for comprehensive examinations and the dissertation. Research Prociency Certication Each Ph.D. candidate is expected, as a condition of advancing to candidacy, to select and develop an individualized prociency that will improve the quality and impact of their research and enhance the capacity they will wield in their professional lives. This empowers students to add value to their education by dening and pursuing an enabling skill set that can deepen the dimensions of their research, practice, and service. Examples of useful prociencies might include: the study of a relevant language other than English, including Cherokee, offered in our department; ethnographic eld work; oral history interview and recording techniques; digital modes of coding, mapping, and visualization; training in the processes of public planning and policy; facility in survey methods and quantitative analysis; skills in documentary production; archival curation and museum programming. The prociency must be in addition to or extend the skill set that students bring with them at matriculation. Certication of this prociency is met by two requirements:40 Department of American Studies (GRAD) the completion of at least one course or an equivalent process of training; a practical demonstration of its acquisition. Incoming doctoral students have the responsibility to work with their preliminary advisor to select a prociency and prepare a plan for its attainment before they complete their prospectus and become candidates for the Ph.D. A written application on a departmental form will spell out which skill set they will acquire to meet this certication, describe the extent of their present competency, explain why it is relevant to their research, and outline how their plan enables them to gain prociency. Incoming students will submit their proposal to the Graduate Studies Committee by October 1 of their rst semester. This committee will meet to approve or suggest alternations to this proposal by November 15. At the end of the fall of the second year, the director of graduate studies will follow up and conrm with students and their dissertation directors whether the benchmarks of attainment have been fullled, and if not, what plan is in place to complete the requirement. Colloquium All students enrolled in the American studies graduate program are expected to participate throughout their graduate careers in a monthly colloquium in which faculty and M.A. and Ph.D. candidates will offer presentations of their work-in-progress. The colloquium exposes graduate students to the research interests of faculty in American studies and allied elds and more advanced students, provides opportunities for sharing discourses and ideas, and may also include visiting graduate students and faculty from international partner institutions. The colloquium is the collegial wellspring of the program, the intellectual and social center of the American Studies community. The conversation occurring there will naturally both inform and be informed by classroom work, particularly in AMST 700 and AMST 701 will help to shape, against the backdrop of individual specializations, a common discourse; and will provide a site for the formation of the American studies social and intellectual community. Comprehensive Exams All students, regardless of whether they enter with a B.A. or M.A., undertake their comprehensive exams in the fall of their third year. Students and faculty members will work collaboratively, with the aim of integrating the best work with the most current scholarship in particular elds. Each student will assemble a three-person examination advisory committee (often consisting of two faculty members from the Department of American Studies and one from a related department), and in consultation with committee members the student will develop reading lists for two exams, one in American Studies (with lists drawn from readings in core courses) and one in an area of specialization. Students will undertake a written exam for each list. Shortly after passing the written exams, each student will undergo an oral exam covering both concentrations. Students are expected to receive passing evaluations on the written and oral exams. Any student who fails one or more sections of the exam may repeat the failed section(s) only once, no sooner than three months following the exam. Teaching and Professional Development All students will be expected to teach as part of their service requirement for nancial aid. Students will most often serve as teaching assistants in undergraduate courses taught by members of the faculty. More advanced students may have the opportunity to develop and teach undergraduate courses in their areas of specialization.Doctoral Dissertation and Defense The dissertation constitutes an original contribution to knowledge that advances the interdisciplinary understanding of American culture. It may be based upon archival research, analysis of texts and/or cultural artifacts, ethnographic research, or a combination. The student will assemble a ve-person doctoral advisory committee, which must include three faculty members from the Department of American Studies. The student ordinarily completes the dissertation prospectus and renes it with the advice of the doctoral advisory committee at the end of the semester that begins with their successful completion of the comprehensive exams. The prospectus must be approved by the committee following a prospectus defense. Upon completion of the dissertation, all degree candidates must successfully defend their dissertation before their doctoral advisory committee. M.A. in Folklore The M.A. program in folklore balances flexibility and a focus on students' own areas of interest with requirements designed to insure knowledge of key issues and texts in the discipline. Master's students must complete 10 courses (30 hours). Two specic courses-Approaches to Folklore Theory (FOLK 850 ) and The Art of Ethnography (FOLK 860 )- are required, and students must take three additional courses offered by core faculty. Students take the remainder of their courses in a variety of associated graduate programs, including American studies, anthropology, communication, English, history, music, and religious studies, or they may take advantage of the opportunity to enroll in courses at neighboring universities, particularly those offered at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. Students pursuing an M.A. must compile a critical literature review at the beginning of their third semester and must complete and defend a thesis at the end of their second year of study. Graduate Minor in American Studies The American studies graduate minor serves students admitted in a variety of departments, including art, communications studies, English, history, and religious studies. Interdisciplinary training in the study of American culture can enhance scholarly and teaching capabilities for these students. The object of study is American culture in all its diversity, and the methodologies include historical, literary, and visual analysis as well as ethnography, sociology, economics, and political science as appropriate. To apply, contact the director of graduate studies. The graduate minor consists of ve courses, to be selected with the advice of the chair or director of graduate studies in American studies. These courses should include AMST 700 or AMST 701 and at least two other graduate courses with an AMST designation. Additional courses may be chosen from related departments. These courses must be in addition to those required for the degree in the student's major eld of study. Graduate Minor in Folklore Students pursuing the Ph.D. in another department at UNC-Chapel Hill may qualify for a minor in folklore by completing six courses, chosen in consultation with the coordinator of the folklore program. These courses must be in addition to those required for the degree in the student's major eld of study.

Contact Information Department of American Studies Visit Program Website (https://americanstudies.unc.edu/ ) Director of Graduate Studies Gabrielle Berlinger gberling@unc.edu Chair Patricia Sawin sawin@unc.eduUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 49 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY (GRAD) The Department of Anthropology offers advanced work leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees. Students admitted into the graduate program are admitted for the Ph.D. degree. A master's degree may be taken as part of the program leading to the Ph.D. degree; however, a master's degree is not an essential part of the doctoral program. The Department of Anthropology works closely with the Institute for Research in Social Science, the Institute for the Study of the Americas, the Carolina Population Center, and the Research Laboratories of Archaeology. Up-to-date lists of anthropology faculty members and courses, along with additional information about the graduate program, faculty research projects, and other information, are available on the department's website (http://anthropology.unc.edu/). In order to organize constellations of research interest, the department curriculum is organized by programs and concentrations. Programs are offered in archaeology, human biology, ecology, and evolution, and sociocultural anthropology and ethnography. Concentrations include health, medicine, and humanity; global engagement; race, difference, and power; heritage and unwritten histories; and social formations and processes. Students are expected to take at least three courses from within their chosen area of concentration or from a set of courses designated by their program. Programs are distinguished from concentrations by their institutional links to other faculty and administrative units on campus, and by their greater specicity for certain course requirements. Students interested in one or the other program are advised to so declare when they enter the department if they have not yet done so. Graduate students may take courses offered by other departments or institutions such as Duke University. Departmental policy is to help the student select courses that supplement and strengthen the specialization in anthropology. Incoming students are required to take ANTH 701, 703, and 705 during their rst year. In addition, they will take whatever courses are required by their subeld: 1. Sociocultural students must complete 702 by the end of their second year. It is only offered biennially, so students are required to take it at the rst opportunity. In addition, students are highly encouraged to take 898 (Engaging Ethnography). 2. HBEE students must choose additional courses in consultation with their advisor. 3. Archaeology students must choose additional courses in consultation with their advisor. 4. Medical anthropology students must choose additional courses in consultation with their advisor. Any exceptions to these requirements must be approved by the director of graduate studies. During the second year of study, graduate students are required to produce a substantial piece of independent research, advised by a three- member faculty committee and presented to the entire faculty at the end of the fourth semester. Graduate students are advised to take their written and oral Ph.D. exams by the end of the sixth semester.The Ph.D. degree requires specialization in a dened area of study and the completion of an acceptable dissertation treating some problem within this area. The Ph.D. program is quite flexible; any area or problem can be selected for study, provided it meets the approval of the student's advisor, the Ph.D. committee, and the faculty. Part of the training of a professional anthropologist is based on a minimum of one year's eld work, which provides the context for the dissertation data in sociocultural anthropology or human ecology. For students concentrating in archaeology or biological anthropology, the Research Laboratories of Archaeology offer opportunities for student-led investigations as well as analysis of existing collections of archaeological material. The Human Biology Lab offers opportunities for student-led research. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Contact Information Department of Anthropology Visit Program Website (http://anthropology.unc.edu) Chair Amanda Logan Thompson althomps@email.unc.edu Director of Graduate Studies Townsend Middleton ctm22@email.unc.edu64 Department of Applied Physical Sciences (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED PHYSICAL SCIENCES (GRAD) The Department of Applied Physical Sciences combines applied science and engineering to solve real problems for North Carolina and the world through technology, innovation and partnerships, and the preparation of knowledgeable and responsible students, citizens, and researchers. The department expands interdisciplinary research and teaching by strengthening an intellectual climate in which science is collaborative and focused on applications. The doctoral program in materials science is an interdisciplinary graduate program that brings together faculty members from chemistry, mathematics, physics and astronomy, and various departments across the University to engage in research and training in applications of the physical sciences. The primary areas of emphasis in the program are optical and electronic materials, nanomaterials, polymers, and biomaterials. Students pursuing Ph.D. degrees in materials science begin their studies with a core curriculum covering the fundamentals of materials, including their structures, surfaces, fabrication, thermodynamics, and materials science laboratory techniques. They continue with elective courses offered within APS or other departments as appropriate to their area of research concentration. Graduate students engage in research under the supervision of one of the participating materials science faculty in APS. APS is also home to BeAM (https://beam.unc.edu ) (Be A Maker), the UNC network of makerspaces. Research Interests The four areas of research emphasized in the program are electronic, nano, polymer, and biomaterials. These four areas are not discrete, however, as research projects in solar energy, soft and biological matter, structural materials, optical engineering and neuroscience, data science and computational modeling demonstrate. Individual faculty members typically have research interests in more than one of the primary areas, and collaborate with others to address several grand challenges. For detailed information on the graduate program, please email (apsssm@unc.edu ) or call the graduate program coordinator at (919) 962-7216 . Facilities and Equipment Students and faculty members have access to state-of-the-art central facilities for materials synthesis, processing and characterization. These capabilities are located within individual research laboratories and, especially, within the Chapel Hill Analytical and Nanofabrication Laboratory (CHANL (https://chanl.unc.edu )). Faculty and students also have access to the expertise, tools, and equipment in BeAM (https:// beam.unc.edu/ ) (Be A Maker), the network of UNC campus makerspaces. Fellowships and Assistantships Research and teaching assistantships are available to qualied graduate students. The duties of teaching assistants can include guiding students in BeAM (https://beam.unc.edu ) (Be A Maker, the UNC-Chapel Hill network of makerspaces) and teaching laboratory sections, and assisting in the supervision of advanced laboratories, teaching recitation sections, and grading papers. Summer support is generally available. A varietyof fellowships (https://gradschool.unc.edu/funding/gradschool/ fellowshipsandgrants.html) are available. Degree Requirements The Ph.D. degree requirements include completion of a suitable set of courses, literature review, prospectus, a rst doctoral oral exam, an original research project culminating in a dissertation, and a nal oral exam. The general regulations of The Graduate School govern credit hour, residency, and examination requirements. Courses All graduate students must pass the following courses, or must have passed their equivalents elsewhere: Code Title Hours MTSC 710 Materials Science First Year Seminar: Resources for success in your PhD program1 MTSC 711 Materials Science First Year Seminar: Developing your plan for success1 MTSC 718 Seminar in Materials Science and Engineering 1 MTSC 780 Advanced Materials Science 3 MTSC 785 Introduction to Scientic Computing for Materials 3 Each student also takes additional courses offered by Applied Physical Sciences (APS) or participating departments, as appropriate for his or her area of study. Literature Review At the end of the rst year (typically early May) students write a literature review. The literature review is intended to prepare students and their advisor for their specic research, the oral defense, which will take place towards the end of the second year, and future publications. First Doctoral Oral Exam There are two oral exams. The rst oral exam is coordinated with the student's doctoral advisory committee (DAC). The oral exam will ascertain if the student has acquired the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in research. Two weeks prior to the exam students submit a written prospectus to their DAC. The prospectus describes a detailed research proposal. The rst oral exam includes a 45-minute presentation of the student's research project aim in the context of the existing literature and research results to date. It is recommended that students also present their possible next steps (future work!) and elaborate on what is needed in order to be successful in their research. For example, it could be that the research would benet from an internship at another university or industrial partner, or from collaborative research at one of the national labs. Committee members review proposals and research plans during the oral exam, ask questions, and give suggestions and feedback. Dissertation and Final Oral Exam The nal oral exam is coordinated with the student's DAC and is a defense of the research thesis. Professors Theo J.

Credits for studio practice constitute the majority of credits. These are earned through independent study and critique. All M.F.A. students have individual studio space to support their creative research. With the department's interdisciplinary approach, students need not choose a particular medium for specialization. They may use different media to express a variety of aesthetic and conceptual goals. This, however, does not preclude a media focus but does mean that media choices are integral to students' intellectual and aesthetic explorations. The structure for feedback in the program is through weekly critiques when students interact with the studio faculty over the course of the semester. A formal review brings the entire faculty together to evaluate each student's progress at the end of the rst semester, and the student's committee members evaluate that progress at the end of the second and fourth semester. The academic component of the M.F.A. program is designed to complement the art-making process. The program strongly believes that the decision to pursue the making of ne art in an academic context carries an attendant responsibility to develop the verbal and written articulation of the visual. To help achieve this goal, students participate in two graduate seminars (three credit hours each). Other academic credits are satised by a requisite six hours of additional coursework in art history. Usually, students are urged to take one of these courses in the area of contemporary art history. Students also take six hours in electives in which the students are able to take advantage of upper-division and graduate-level courses in elds related to their studio practice or studio courses that help them advance or expand their technical and material skills. Students select these courses depending on the focus of their studio explorations, thus stretching the capacity of their creative work. The remaining academic credits are earned through the master's thesis. This includes mounting a group exhibition of the thesis work, curated by and at the Ackland Art Museums, as well as a solo show in the Department of Art's Allcott Gallery; writing a thesis statement to accompany the thesis work; and presenting a visual lecture as the M.F.A. thesis defense that is then submitted to the Carolina Digital Repository. In addition to the core curriculum, the UNC-Chapel Hill master of ne arts program supports students by bringing artists and critics to UNC- Chapel Hill throughout the year. For the Hanes Visiting Artist Lecture Series, artists are typically invited to campus for a two-day visit, during which time they give a public lecture and provide private critiques for the department's graduate students. This program has proved to be a vital conduit for graduate students to see the work of, and interact with, a large and diverse number of professional artists. Additionally, the Visiting Arts Professionals Program brings visiting critics, gallerists, curators, or other art professionals to campus 4-5 times per year to further introduce students to the professional art world, furthering knowledge and fostering mutually benecial practical and professional connectionsand relationships. These guests participate in a moderated, informal conversation with students and also conduct studio visits. Master of Arts Degree The master of arts degree generally follows the requirements of The Graduate School as described in the section on graduate degree requirements in The Graduate School Handbook (http:// handbook.unc.edu/ ). Both a broad knowledge of world art and a basic sampling of the diverse theory and methods employed by our faculty in the discipline of art history. The master's program in art history is designed to be completed in four semesters. Course Work Total of 12 courses, 36 credits distributed as follows: Three required courses: Methods in Art Historical Research (ARTH 850) in the rst semester; Writing Seminar (ARTH 991)in the second year, and Master's Thesis (ARTH 993) in the fourth semester Nine courses, ve of which should be graduate research seminars (900-level) Students are strongly encouraged to take courses in a range of art- historical elds. Language Requirement By the end of the third semester, all M.A. students are required to have met the language requirement of one language other than English, appropriate to the area of study. The language will be determined in consultation with the student's advisor and the director of graduate studies. The student can demonstrate competency by obtaining a passing grade on the UNC-Chapel Hill reading competency exam, or earning a B (or a graduate P) or better in a fourth semester or higher language course, or earning a B (or a graduate P) in a literature course in that language at UNC-Chapel Hill. No credit toward the M.A. coursework requirement is given for language courses. Master's Thesis The M.A. thesis is completed by the end of the fourth semester of enrollment. The completed thesis must be signed by the members of the thesis committee and submitted to The Graduate School in time for May graduation. Master's Thesis Defense and Oral Exam Students will present their M.A. thesis at an oral examination prior to the formal submission deadline for M.A. theses. The examining committee will comprise the student's thesis committee. The oral examination will include questions about larger issues raised in the Methods and Writing seminars and thus will constitute a comprehensive examination of the student's work toward the M.A. degree as well as of the thesis itself. Students who fail the thesis examination may repeat it prior to the end of classes and if successful may apply for the next graduation date. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The degree of doctor of philosophy generally follows the requirements of The Graduate School as described in the section on graduate degree requirements in The Graduate School Handbook (http:// handbook.unc.edu/ ). Additionally, specic departmental guidelines governing movement through the program, such as the formation of the dissertation committee and scheduling of committee meetings can be found on the departmental Sakai website.78 Department of Art and Art History (GRAD) Course Work Ph.D. students entering with an M.A. in art history or closely related eld take a total of nine courses, at least four of which are research seminars (900-level), plus a nal course, ARTH 994 (Doctoral Dissertation). Two of the nine courses may be taken in other departments as electives for supplementary and complementary studies. Ph.D. students entering without an M.A. take a total of 15 courses, plus a nal course, ARTH 994 (Doctoral Dissertation). The required courses normally include ARTH 850 (Methods in Art Historical Research) and the Writing Seminar (ARTH 991), with a Professional Development Course (ARTH 852) strongly recommended. Of the remaining courses, at least six must be research seminars (900-level). Two of the nine courses may be taken in other departments as electives for supplementary and complementary studies. Electing to Pursue an External Minor Ph.D. students may choose to complete a formal external minor, which consists of at least ve additional courses in a eld related to his or her area of specialized study (such as communication studies, women's studies, history, or medieval studies). The student must secure prior approval of the department offering the minor, and a copy of the proposed courses to be taken must be signed by both departments and entered in the student's permanent record in the Department of Art and Art History and the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School. Language Requirement Ph.D. students are required to demonstrate prociency in two languages other than English. The rst language will be the language that fullled the M.A. language requirement. The second language should be appropriate to the area of study and will be determined in consultation with the student's advisor and the director of graduate studies for art history. Some elds require additional languages and students should study these languages as necessary. Competency in the second language will be determined following the same guidelines as those for the M.A. language requirement. Preliminary Doctoral Exams Ph.D. students take both the written and the oral preliminary exams during the semester after the Ph.D. coursework is completed. Most Ph.D. students will take the preliminary exams during the spring semester of their second year in the Ph.D. program. Those students pursuing an external minor will take the preliminary exams during the fall semester of their third year. Written Exams. Students take the written exams over the course of a one-week period. Students who fail the written exams may repeat them only once. These exams are taken in three parts: rst major eld of study (six hours), second major eld of study (six hours), methodological/thematic area of study (six hours). Preliminary Oral Exam. An oral exam will take place within two weeks of the written exam. The oral will be on the content of the written exams and may also include a defense of the dissertation prospectus. The examining committee will consist of at least three members who must be full-time active graduate faculty members or adjunct teaching faculty members in art history. Dissertation Prospectus. Ph.D. students defend their dissertation prospectus orally. If the dissertation prospectus is not defended at the oral exam, this defense should take place within four months of the written exams. At least two weeks before the prospectus defense, the student submits a dissertation prospectus to his orher dissertation committee, which should consist of ve faculty members, three of whom must be permanent members of the UNC- Chapel Hill art history faculty. Dissertation and Final Oral Exam After passing the preliminary doctoral exams, the student begins work on the dissertation. Once the dissertation is completed and approved by the advisor and dissertation committee, the student defends the nished dissertation. For further information, the applicant should write to the director of graduate studies for art history (https://art.unc.edu/people/ administration-and-staff/ ).

Sherman dsherman@email.unc.eduUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 87 DEPARTMENT OF ASIAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES (GRAD) The M.A. in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies is a two-year, interdisciplinary humanities degree that prepares students to engage with the social, environmental, and political challenges facing countries in Asia and the Middle East, and their transnational communities. Students can choose between two tracks: the interdisciplinary track and the Chinese track. This degree will provide students with deep cultural knowledge of Asia and the Middle East while training them in the intellectual flexibility necessary to grasp and work with complex and dynamic issues as they arise. By applying humanist approaches to real world problems, students will learn to evaluate research and apply analytical methodologies from various disciplines to specic situations and questions. This intellectual flexibility, the hallmark of humanist approaches attuned to change and contingency, is foundational to the type of leadership necessary for an interconnected world. The M.A. in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies will prepare students linguistically, culturally, and intellectually for participation in top Ph.D. programs and for careers in government and non-prot and private sectors in or related to Asia and the Middle East. It is designed to complement professional degrees (e.g. in business, journalism, law, library and information science, global public health, medicine, public policy, social work) for students planning to practice abroad or with populations within the United States. Master of Arts Degree M.A. students must complete 33 hours of graduate study. At least 18 credit hours must be from courses offered within the Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 101 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS (GRAD) The Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics is an administrative division of the School of Medicine and a member of The Graduate School. The graduate program offers instruction and research opportunities leading to the Ph.D. degree. Applicants are offered admission with the expectation that they will complete their doctorate. While the curriculum is designed as a Ph.D. program, a terminal master's degree can be offered under special circumstances. Modern research in biochemistry and biophysics is designed to address mechanism and function; it utilizes the paradigms of molecular biology but is influenced by chemistry, physics, and genetics. The philosophy of the department and its graduate program is to provide students with broad training in modern approaches to the eld and unique opportunities for multidisciplinary training. Financial Aid and Admissions Funds available from the University, the department, and individual research grants provide stipends for students. All applicants are considered for special fellowships and research or teaching assistantships. Students typically receive a stipend and coverage of in- state tuition and fees, along with major medical insurance. Nonresidents with predoctoral fellowships or assistantships are recommended for special tuition rates. Applications are considered from prospective graduate students who present evidence of superior scholarship in biology, chemistry, or biochemistry. The department recommends that students prepare themselves by taking general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics, and calculus. It is anticipated that students who have not had these courses will take them, as appropriate, after their arrival. Departmental information may be obtained through the department's website (http://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/). Applicants should apply online at The Graduate School's admission website (http:// gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). Research Interests Faculty member's research interests are diverse and include research in the following areas: cell signaling and growth control, DNA repair and replication, membrane biophysics and function, molecular regulation including transcriptional control, nervous system development and function, and protein structure/function, including enzymology. Model systems used by the faculty range from bacteria to mammals; techniques span molecular biology to physical biochemistry. Please visit the department's website (http://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/) for more information. Facilities The departmental research facilities are centered in the Genetic Medicine Building, which is within walking distance of other medical school departments, research centers, and the departments of biology, chemistry, and physics. The building is equipped with instruments for molecular biological, biochemical, structural, and biophysical research. Animal care facilities are available to support the department's research endeavors. Research and training support is provided by several core facilities on campus.Students are admitted to the graduate program through the BBSP portal, complete a minimum of three laboratory rotations, and then join the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the end of their rst year. All students in the department are required to complete a seminar in biochemistry (BIOC 701 ) OR seminar in biophysics ( BIOC 704 ); BIOC 712 , which is a grant-writing course designed to help prepare students for their comprehensive written examination; and BIOC 715 , which is a scientic presentation course. Students are also required to complete six credit hours in core courses and four credit hours of electives. Further information on course requirements (http://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/ students/degree-requirements/) may be found online. Students in the combined M.D./Ph.D. program are required to complete all course requirements. The director of graduate studies advises entering students about course selection until the student chooses a research sponsor. Students select research sponsors from the department's primary and joint faculty members following the three laboratory rotations. After a research sponsor has been selected, a dissertation committee is formed to review the student's yearly progress. The examinations required for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. are administered as a comprehensive oral exam, a comprehensive written exam, and a nal oral defense of a dissertation. The comprehensive oral exam (defense of the initial thesis proposal) will stress the dissertation proposal and related areas in an effort to ascertain the student's understanding of the research project that he/ she is undertaking. The comprehensive written examination will cover major topics in the areas of biochemistry and biophysics and cell and molecular biology. The most important requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a nal oral defense of a dissertation or original research carried out independently by the candidate. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Contact Information Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics Visit Program Website (http://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/) Chair Jean Cook108 Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (GRAD) CURRICULUM IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY (GRAD) Modern biology, in this postgenome age, is being greatly enriched by an infusion of ideas from a variety of computational elds, including computer science, information science, mathematics, operations research, and statistics. In turn, biological problems are motivating innovations in these computational sciences. There is a high demand for scientists who can bridge these disciplines. The goal of the Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) is to train such scientists through a rigorous and balanced curriculum that transcends traditional departmental boundaries. Incoming students are expected to matriculate from a broad range of disciplines; thus, it is important to ensure that all students have a common foundation on which to build their BCB training. The rst year is dedicated to establishing this foundation and training all students with a common set of core BCB courses. BCB students will also participate in three laboratory research rotations their rst year and ultimately join a laboratory at the end of those rotations. Research work is done in the laboratory facilities of the individual faculty member and is supported primarily by faculty research grants. Curriculum faculty have appointments in 18 departments in the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, Gillings School of Global Public Health, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, School of Information and Library Science, and the College of Arts and Sciences. This level of diversity allows students a broad range of research opportunities. Requirements for Admission for Graduate Work Ideal BCB candidates should have an undergraduate degree in a biological, physical, mathematical, or computational science. They must apply to the program through a unied application program known as the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP). Students apply for graduate study in the biological or biomedical sciences at UNC-Chapel Hill. Students interested in any of the BBSP research areas apply to BBSP, and those whose application portfolio places them highest on the admission list are asked to visit Chapel Hill for interviews. Students who are ultimately admitted to UNC-Chapel Hill make no formal commitment to a Ph.D. program. After completing their rst year of study students leave BBSP, join a thesis laboratory, and matriculate into one of 14 participating Ph.D. programs. During their rst year BBSP students are part of small, interest-based groups led by several faculty members. These groups meet frequently and provide a research community for students until they join a degree-granting program. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible, preferably before December 1. (Applicants seeking a master's degree are not considered for admission.) Financial Aid Stipends for predoctoral students are available from an NIH predoctoral training grant and from the University. Tuition, student fees, and graduate student health insurance are also covered by the training grant and the University.In addition to the dissertation requirements of The Graduate School (four full semesters of credit including at least six hours of doctoral dissertation, a written preliminary examination, an oral examination and a dissertation), students in the Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology must meet the following requirements: complete all ve of the BCB core courses (BCB 715, 716, 717, 720, and 722) complete twelve hours of elective courses (as determined by student and thesis advisor); at least 9 hours must be computational participate in the BCB Colloquium as attendees during the rst and second years act as teaching assistant for one of the BCB modules in Year 2 attend BCB Student Seminars in Years 2 and 3; present in BCB Student Seminars beginning in Year 3 until graduation participate in BCB Grant Writing course in Year 2 attend BCB sponsored special seminars and new student symposium attend the BCB annual retreat; present posters or talks Students are required to rotate through at least three laboratories before choosing a thesis advisor.

The following programs are afliated with BBSP: Applied Physical Sciences, Biochemistry and Biophysics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Biology (MCDB Division), Cell Biology and Physiology, Chemistry (Biological Chemistry Division), Genetics and Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Immunology, Neuroscience, Nutrition (Biochemistry Division), Oral and Craniofacial Biomedicine, Pathobiology and Translational Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences (Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmaceutics tracks), Pharmacology, and Toxicology. Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in any of these programs apply to the BBSP. For a complete list of faculty in BBSP see the faculty page (http://bbsp.unc.edu/research/faculty- database/ ) of the program's website. See individual program listings for more information about individual Ph.D. programs. These also can be accessed from the BBSP website (https://bbsp.unc.edu/ ). Admission Requirements A bachelor's degree (B.S. or B.A.) is required for admission into BBSP. Successful applicants have a strong background in the biological sciences, chemistry, physics, or mathematics. Only applicants with both strong academic records and prior research experience are favorably considered. An interview, usually on campus, is required prior to admission. Financial Assistance All BBSP students receive an annual stipend ($37,000 in 2023-2024). Tuition, health insurance, and fees are covered by the program. During their rst year, BBSP students are part of weekly small-group discussions led by faculty members. These groups provide a research community for students until they join a degree-granting program. In these groups, students develop professional skills, including scientic writing, original research presentations, responsible conduct of research, and quantitative reasoning. The faculty members in these groups advise students in selecting laboratory rotations and courses that meet their individual interests. BBSP students choose from more than 400 faculty members as they pursue three required research rotations in the fall and spring semesters of their rst year. At the completion of the third rotation, each student selects an academic advisor who will provide guidance for his or her dissertation research training. The student also joins a Ph.D. program that the advisor is afliated with and completes that program's requirements. The BBSP does not have a core scientic curriculum and only requires students to enroll in research rotations (BBSP 901 ) and small-group discussions ( BBSP 902 ). Students may take courses offered by any of the participating Ph.D. programs (see individual program listings for available courses). After joining a specic Ph.D. program, students must fulll the specic coursework requirements of that program.BBSP Graduate-level Courses BBSP 705.

The Department of Biology offers a program of study leading to a doctor of philosophy degree in biology. It also offers two masters degrees: a master of science degree requiring independent research and a thesis, and a master of arts degree requiring a written library report. However, the master's degree programs only admit students on an individual basis in the following cases: 1. A request is initiated by a prospective student's graduate advisor, or 2. A current student in the Ph.D. degree program requests to move to a master's degree program. Special departmental rules and guidelines for advanced degrees are available upon request. For more information regarding our programs, please visit the Biology website. Facilities The Department of Biology is currently housed in four modern buildings. The newest building, the Genome Sciences Building, opened in July 2012. The department is equipped with modern instrumentation for research and research training in the diverse biological disciplines represented by the faculty. UNC-Chapel Hill has a world-class library system, including the Health Science Library, which is dedicated to resources related to biological research. A major research asset is the location of the University, which makes the varied flora and fauna of the Appalachian Mountains, Piedmont Plateau, Coastal Plain, and Atlantic Coast accessible for research and instruction. The department operates a small eld station a few miles from the Chapel Hill campus in the Mason Farm Biological Reserve, which includes several hundred acres of upland and floodplain habitats. The Coker Arboretum and the North Carolina Botanical Garden are of value to students in the study of questions in plant biology. The Herbarium, containing more than 600,000 specimens, is especially rich in collections of the vascular plants and fungi of the Carolinas and the Southeastern United States. The Highlands Biological Station, administered for the University system by Western Carolina University, is located in the biologically rich mountains at Highlands, North Carolina. Graduate courses offered cover various parts of the mountain biota. Credit may be obtained through UNC-Chapel Hill or Western Carolina University. A limited amount of research support is available on a competitive basis. (See the annual announcement of the Highlands Biological Station.) The University is a member of the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS). Financial support is available for students attending OTS courses in tropical ecology in Costa Rica. Additional information about the graduate program including instructions for application is available online (http://bio.unc.edu ).Fellowships and Assistantships Applicants interested in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, development, or physiology should apply to the graduate program via the Biology and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP (http://bbsp.unc.edu/ )) application portal. Applicants with an interest in evolutionary biology, ecology, behavior, organismal biology, or quantitative biology should apply to the graduate program using UNC's Graduate School application portal (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). Application for admission and graduate appointments should be submitted according to The Graduate School and departmental deadlines. All outstanding prospective graduate students who apply for admission are automatically considered for University fellowships. More than 45 teaching assistantships are open to graduate students. Duties of assistants include preparation for, and supervision of, laboratory and recitation sections of undergraduate courses. Duties usually require 15 to 20 hours per week, including six contact hours in classes and 9 to 14 hours of preparation or other services associated with instruction. Research assistantships are also available. Salaries and duties are variable as determined by the research needs of faculty supervising the work. Applications for these appointments must be made personally to faculty members directing grant-supported research. The following awards are specically for graduate students in the Biology Department: The Alma Holland Beers Scholarships are awarded annually to support summer research of students in botany. They are nonservice awards. The William Chambers Coker Fellowship is awarded annually to a student or students in the nal years of work toward a doctor of philosophy in a botanical eld. This is a nonservice award that carries with it an additional supplement for tuition and fees. The Mrs. W.C. Coker Fellowship is awarded annually to an outstanding rst-year graduate student in plant biology. This is also a nonservice award that carries with it an additional supplement for tuition and fees. The H.V. Wilson Marine Scholarship is awarded annually for summer work at a marine laboratory. It is a nonservice award. The faculty members in the Department of Biology offer instruction and research training in the following diverse biological disciplines. Genetics and Molecular Biology Genetics is both a discipline (the study of heredity) and an experimental approach (manipulation of genes or the genetic material). Today, most geneticists work at the molecular level by manipulating RNA, DNA, or entire genomes. Our group is strong in both model organism genetics and genomics. Areas of emphasis include biochemistry and molecular biology, chromosome biology, developmental genetics, genomics, protein synthesis, enzyme mechanics, and plant genetics. Cell Biology, Development, and Physiology Developmental biologists address the mechanisms through which cells acquire specialized functions to form complex body plans. These features are accomplished in part through cell proliferation, migration, and shape changes. The department has a strong research program in these areas, which are major topics in cell biology, as well as inUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 115 other aspects of developmental biology. Areas of emphasis include cytology, mitotic and meiotic mechanisms, histochemistry, experimental morphogenesis, morphogenetic movements, tissue culture, hormones, plant development, signal transduction, functional morphology, biomechanics and neuroethology, and membrane functions. Evolutionary Biology Evolution is inherited change in the characteristics of populations over time. Evolutionary biologists seek to explain the remarkable t of organisms to their environment (adaptation), the origins of diversity, including the formation of new species (speciation), and the relationships among organisms. The department has a strong focus on the genetic and ecological mechanisms of adaptation and speciation. Ecology Ecologists study how organisms interact with other organisms and with their physical environment. UNC-Chapel Hill's group has strength in behavioral, conservation, community, disease, evolutionary, and marine ecology. Areas of emphasis include population biology, life histories, and ecosystem phenomena in diverse systems. Behavior and Organismal Biology Organismal biologists seek to understand the diversity of life forms on earth by analyzing organismal structure and function. UNC-Chapel Hill's Department of Biology takes an integrative approach to this research, combining analyses at levels ranging from molecules to whole organisms. The group also endeavors to understand the evolution and mechanisms of behavior. It uses theoretical, observational, and experimental approaches in a variety of species, from crawling behavior in sea slugs to communication in birds. Areas of emphasis include social and mating systems of vertebrates, communication, ecology and ontogeny of behavior, predator-prey interactions, marine ecology and oceanography, comparative physiology, neuroethology, functional morphology, and comparative biomechanics. Plant Biology The department has an active and diverse group that studies features specic to plants or that uses plant model systems to address questions of broad interest. Areas of emphasis include host-pathogen interactions, signal transduction, development, genomics, and chromosome biology. Marine Biology After completing required coursework in the department, students in marine biology have access to the research facilities of the Institute of Marine Sciences, Morehead City, North Carolina. By cooperative arrangements, deep water research can be carried out through the use of the research vessel of the Duke University Marine Laboratory. Quantitative Biology The quantitative biology track of study will develop young scientists who can investigate how basic physical processes have been brought together in living systems. One component of the training program will focus on events at smaller scales, micron-level and below, to cellular, sub- cellular, and multi-cellular processes. Another component will focus on events at larger scales, from the tissue to organ level, to processes at the organism and population level. Despite this distinction for most projects, a central goal of the training will be to prepare students to work on multi- scale problems that connect disparate levels of biology.This track of study features and fosters extensive interactions among students and faculty. Core training components will be rigorous, but will be combined with the programmatic flexibility as needed to accommodate the training goals of students with diverse backgrounds. Every aspect of the program will encourage innovative, imaginative, and unconventional approaches to physical biology. Interdisciplinary Studies Inter-departmental degree programs in genetics, ecology, neurobiology, and marine sciences offer unusual opportunities for special training through participation of staff from the Department of Biology and many other departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Division of Health Affairs.

Please apply separately to (1) SOPHAS and (2) UNC-Chapel Hill (via the Graduate School application). Visit https://gradschool.sites.unc.edu/master-of-public-health/ for more details. If you are interested in the online M.P.H., please visit the MPH@UNC (https://onlinemph.unc.edu/ ) website and ll out an inquiry form. Milestones The following list of milestones (non-course degree requirements) must be completed; view this list of standard milestone denitions (p. 29) for more information. Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also be appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https://146 Department of Biostatistics (GRAD) sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992) course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experience and produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance they need with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. ElectivesStudents in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University. For information on policies and procedures, please visit the Gillings School Student Handbook (https://sph.unc.edu/students/gillings-school- student-handbook/ ) website.

Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. program in business administration is designed for individuals who plan careers in research and teaching. A limited number of students are admitted each year, resulting in a high-quality learning environment that emphasizes rigor and personal attention. Although many students enter the program with an M.B.A., this degree is not a requirement for admission. However, an M.B.A. from an accredited institution usually allows the student to waive some of the business fundamentals requirements. Prior to admission to the doctoral program, students are expected to have knowledge of elementary calculus and basic computer skills. A foreign language is not required for graduation from the program. Research and teaching assistantships are available on a competitive basis. The requirements for the Ph.D. in business administration are as follows: Business Fundamentals. All Ph.D. students are expected to possess or to acquire a basic knowledge of accounting, nance, marketing, organizational behavior, and production. This requirement involves a level of competence roughly equivalent to the M.B.A. core courses on these topics. Most students entering with an M.B.A. or similar degree meet this requirement without additional coursework. Appropriate courses will be recommended for students who do not meet this requirement prior to beginning the program.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 149 Economics. All Ph.D. students are expected to possess or to acquire knowledge of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory. The basic requirement is an M.B.A. or graduate-level course on each topic. Once again, most students with an M.B.A. meet this requirement without additional coursework. However, individual areas within the business school (e.g., nance) may require that students take specic courses after entering the program to meet this requirement. Appropriate courses will be recommended for students who do not meet this requirement prior to beginning the program. Research Methods/Quantitative Methodologies. All Ph.D. students are required to take ve courses (15 hours) in research methods/ quantitative methodologies. At least one course (three hours) must be a research methods course covering topics such as the philosophy of science, research design, sample selection, etc. At least three of the courses (nine hours) must focus on quantitative methodologies such as statistics, operations research, econometrics, etc. The fth course (three hours) may be a more specialized research methods course (e.g., survey research, lab experimentation) or another quantitative methodologies course. Major Area of Concentration. All Ph.D. students are required to declare a major area. The major area consists of six courses (18 hours). Students may concentrate in one of the following areas: Accounting Operations Finance Organizational Behavior Marketing Strategy and Entrepreneurship These courses may be a combination of required courses offered within the major area, required courses offered outside of the major area, or approved elective courses. Supporting Area. All Ph.D. students are required to declare a supporting area. The supporting area consists of four courses (12 hours). The supporting area allows the student to develop a strong expertise in an area related to the student's research and teaching interests. These courses are usually drawn from a single area within the business school or from a specic outside department, but a student may assemble four courses from more than one area if the courses represent a coherent package. Research Paper. During the summer and fall following the rst year, all Ph.D. students are required to complete a research paper. The paper must be evaluated and approved by the student's faculty. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the student with important research experience and to develop research and writing skills. Most of these papers are later presented at professional meetings, and many lead to publication. Some papers develop into dissertations. Comprehensive Examination. All Ph.D. students must pass a written comprehensive examination on the student's major area of concentration and on relevant material from the other requirements. Students usually take this examination after completing coursework, typically at the end of the second year. Some areas may require an oral examination after completion of the written examination. Dissertation. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a dissertation prior to graduation from the program. The dissertation is a thorough theoretical and empirical investigation of a specic problem important to the student's major area. The dissertation's value is in its contribution to knowledge, in the scholarly manner in which it is organized and presented, and in the demonstrateddevelopment of the student's conceptual and research skills. Before substantial work on the dissertation is undertaken, a written dissertation proposal must be presented and approved by the student's dissertation committee. In most cases, the dissertation proposal is completed during the student's third or fourth year in residence and the dissertation is completed during the fth year. Teaching and Research. All students are required to serve as teaching assistants for at least one semester and as research assistants for at least one semester.

A bachelor's degree (B.A. or B.S.) is required for admission. Applicants are expected to have a strong background in the biological sciences, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Details of the application process are available at the BBSP website (http://bbsp.unc.edu/ ) and The Graduate School's admissions website. (http://gradschool.unc.edu/ admissions/ ) Briefly, the application should include transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and a personal statement outlining career goals. The mission of the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology is to provide students with a rigorous, individually tailored educational experience to prepare them for research and teaching careers in the biomedical sciences. This graduate program will provide a forum for graduate students to learn current concepts in modern cell biology and physiology and to develop the skills necessary to formulate sophisticated strategies for analysis of contemporary problems in cell biology and physiology. Based on a solid foundation of coursework in cell biology and physiology, students will further complement their training by selecting courses in bioinformatics/statistics, genetics, pharmacology, immunology, and/or biochemistry that best support and enhance their specic area of research interest. Dissertation research enables students to apply these tools to a problem of intellectual and biomedical interest. Students receive strong training in the scientic process and apply their skills to probe the mechanistic basis of biological problems at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. A strong emphasis will be placed on career development, such as oral and written presentation skills, and mentoring students in a way that enables them to explore the diverse job opportunities available to them in the post-graduate biomedical workforce. Graduates will be well prepared to continue their research careers in a number of academic disciplines. Assistantships and Other Student Aid Students are supported by a stipend set by BBSP annually plus tuition, fees, and medical insurance. The curriculum provides training for students whose research/teaching career objectives are faculty positions in medical school basic sciences departments. However, the flexibility of the program also provides for the training of students who seek careers in basic science as well as in clinical science departments of medical schools, in other professional schools such as dental schools, in liberal arts academic departments such as biology, or in state, federal, private, and industrial research laboratories. The program for the Ph.D. normally takes ve to six years to complete. Persons interested in a combined M.D./Ph.D. program must be accepted into the School of Medicine and the departmental graduate program, whereupon the combined studies are scheduled in accordance with individual requirements. Ph.D. students take graduate-level courses in their rst year as well as conduct laboratory rotations. Students who join the curriculum at the end of year one are examined for advancement to candidacy. Ph.D. candidacy is followed by a dissertation based on original research is conducted under the supervision of a faculty advisor.

Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. degree in chemistry is a research degree, and students normally begin research during the rst year in graduate school. The Ph.D. degree consists of completion of a suitable program of study, a preliminary doctoral oral examination, a written comprehensive examination (satised by a research summary and dissertation prospectus), an original research proposal, an original research project culminating in a dissertation, and a nal oral examination. Master of Arts (Non-Thesis) The master of arts (non-thesis) degree requires a minimum of 30 semester hours. A typical path to degree completion is 18 hours of advanced chemistry courses and 12 hours in seminar courses and thesis registration. (Only six hours of CHEM 992 can count towards the 30-hour requirement.) Students must accrue a total of at least two semesters of \"full time\" status based on UNC-Chapel Hill course registration (9 hours in one semester is full-time, 6-8 hours is half-time, 3-5 hours is quarter-time). Students must be registered for 3 hours of CHEM 992 in the semester in which the MA Written Report is completed and the degree will be conferred. The M.A. written examination is a written report on the current state of research in an area that is relevant to a departmental research topic, submitted to and approved/signed by the research advisor. As a substitute for a thesis, the candidate must earn a minimum of three hours of CHEM 992 (master's non-thesis option) in the semester of planned graduation and submit a written research report to the research director. Master of Science The master of arts degree requires a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit. A typical course load involves 18 hours of advanced chemistry courses and 12 hours in seminar courses and thesis registration. (Only six hours of CHEM 993 can count towards the 30 hour requirement). Students must accrue a total of at least two semesters of \"full time\" status based on UNC-Chapel Hill course registration (9 hours in one semester is full-time, 6-8 hours is half-time, 3-5 hours is quarter- time). Students must be registered for three hours of CHEM 993 in the semester in which the M.S. thesis is defended. Third-, fourth-, and fth- year students must register for CHEM 993 for three hours until they graduate. The written comprehensive examination is a research summary approved by the dissertation committee. The oral examination comprises the Doctoral Qualifying Examination as approved by the dissertation committee. A master's thesis and nal oral examination are also required. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Its faculty members, world-class scholars leading cutting-edge research, are redening the eld of planning. City and regional planning is an interdisciplinary eld that seeks to improve the quality of life for people in human settlements. Planners are involved, for example, in forecasting alternative futures of a city or region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness, environmental pollution, and urban decay. City and regional planners work for a variety of public, nonprot, and private organizations. In the public sector, local, state, and federal governments all employ city and regional planners. In the nonprot sector, planners work for national, state, and local advocacy groups promoting sustainable development. In the private sector, planners work for development companies and consulting rms. Two graduate programs are offered in city and regional planning: The Professional Master's Degree Program The program leading to the degree of master of city and regional planning prepares the candidate for professional planning practice . The curriculum covers social and institutional problems and provides students with training in planning, public policy research, and management skills. The Doctoral Program The doctoral program in planning provides training in research methods, planning theory, and areas of specialization that enable graduates to contribute to the development of substantive theory, knowledge, and scholarship in planning; to formulate and evaluate innovative public policy; and to administer research programs in domestic and international contexts. The program is small but highly selective and individualized. It is ideal for mature students from a variety of backgrounds. Degrees Offered The department offers two degrees: the master of city and regional planning (M.C.R.P.) and the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in planning. The two-year master's degree program prepares students for the professional practice of planning. The Ph.D. program prepares students for careers in research and university teaching in planning. The two graduate degree programs are largely independent. City and Regional Planning, Master's Program (M.C.R.P.) The program leading to the degree of master of city and regional planning prepares the candidate for professional planning practice. The curriculumcovers social and institutional problems and provides students with training in planning, public policy research, and management skills. Satisfactory completion of the degree requires completion of a minimum of 51 credit hours, including an area of specialization and a master's project in that area. The normal course load is 12 to 15 credit hours per semester. Thirty-nine of the required 51 credits must be taken in the Department of City and Regional Planning. Coursework for the degree is divided into core requirements, area of specialization, and electives. Each student is assisted by a faculty advisor in designing an educational program. The advisor helps select courses appropriate for the student's educational interests and goals.

Taken concurrently, the two degrees may be obtained in four years rather than the ve years ordinarily required. The program seeks to develop professionals capable of dealing with both the legal and planning aspects of urban and regional development and policy. Coursework is designed to prepare students for a variety of professional roles in which knowledge of planning methodology and process, coupled with the analytical skills and professional expertise of the lawyer, are essential. Graduates join private law rms, consulting rms, and public legal and planning staffs. To enter this program, students must apply separately to the School of Law and to the Department of City and Regional Planning, and must be accepted independently by both. Students entering the program spend their entire rst year in either the planning department or the law school, and students must make this choice at the time of admission.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 179 The second year is normally spent full time in the program not selected in the rst year. After the rst two years, the student has an additional 43 semester credits to complete in the law school and 12 semester credits to complete in planning. For more information: https://law.unc.edu/admissions/ law_admissions@unc.edu Business (M.B.A.) + M.C.R.P. The Kenan-Flagler Business School and the Department of City and Regional Planning offer a dual-degree program leading to the M.B.A. and M.C.R.P. degrees, usually in three years. The program builds management and planning skills that enable graduates to pursue rewarding, flexible, and socially useful careers in the private, nonprot, or public sectors. Graduates work in real estate and economic development consulting, nancial institutions, and entrepreneurial rms. Increasingly, applicants to the business and planning program want to pursue career paths that combine planning and management and seek the flexibility to move between jobs in the public and private sectors. To enter this program, students must apply separately to both the Department of City and Regional Planning and the Kenan-Flagler Business School, and must be accepted independently by both. Students entering the program spend their entire rst year in either the planning department or the business school. The second year is spent full time in the other program. In the third year, students take courses in both business and planning. Sufcient electives can be taken in planning and business so that a curriculum can be tailored to each student's career objectives. Admission to the business school is based on demonstrated potential for responsible leadership, the quality of the student's academic transcripts, and the applicant's score on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), administered by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, NJ. For more information: https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/programs/mba/full-time-mba/ admissions/ mba_info@unc.edu Public Administration (M.P.A.) + M.C.R.P. This dual-degree program prepares professionals who want the flexibility of moving between planning and management positions in government. The Department of City and Regional Planning and the Public Administration program in the School of Government collaborate to enable students to receive both the M.C.R.P. and the M.P.A. degrees in three years and a summer that includes a professional eld experience in public administration. The intent of the combined program is to ensure that students have two complete and complementary, but distinct, areas of training. The M.P.A. requirements ensure adequate training in public management. The M.C.R.P. requirements ensure adequate training in core planning knowledge and skills, and in an area of planning specialization. Students must obtain admission to both the M.P.A. and M.C.R.P. programs independently. With prior approval from faculty advisors in both programs, students may then count certain courses toward both degrees. The combined program requires a total of 75 semester credit hours. Students are advised to gain approval from faculty advisors for their specic program of courses during the rst semester of residence toensure that they can meet all requirements of both programs within three years.

The dual degree program between the Department of City and Regional Planning and the Gillings School of Global Public Health (SPH) allows students to connect the public health and urban planning elds through professional training that will encourage greater intersections in professional practice. To enter these programs, students must apply separately to the Department of City and Regional Planning and the departments in the Gillings School of Global Public Health and must be accepted independently by both. Students entering the program spend their entire rst year either in the SPH or the Department of City and Regional Planning. The second year is spent full time in the other program. In the third year, students take both public health and planning courses. Students should be able to complete both programs in three years (instead of four years). At the end of the program students are expected to complete master's projects or other capstone requirements for each department that demonstrate mastery of the two elds and an understanding of the interconnections between the elds. For more information: https://sph.unc.edu/students/admissions/ Karla Townley-Tilson, Director of the M.P.H. Program, kttilson@unc.edu Landscape Architecture at North Carolina State University + M.C.R.P. The dual-degree program in landscape architecture and planning strengthens the design dimension of the planning curriculum, and creates a venue for working closely with the College of Design at North Carolina State University. The Department of Landscape Architecture offers two graduate program tracks leading to the master of landscape architecture (M.L.A.), both of which emphasize creative problem solving and a long- term commitment to responsible design. The curriculum provides the professional skills needed to deal with the human and natural forces that shape the land. The department is especially concerned with the protection, restoration, enhancement, and regeneration of the natural and cultural environments in urban, rural, and wilderness settings. To enter this program, students apply to each department separately and must gain admission to both. The amount of time required for the M.L.A. will depend on whether the student is pursuing the First Professional Degree track (82 credits) or Advanced Studies track (42 credits). Usually students will be able to reduce the time needed to attain both the M.C.R.P. and the M.L.A. by about one year by taking coursework in each department that counts toward the other department's degree program.

The program is small but highly selective and individualized. It is ideal for mature students from a variety of backgrounds. The Ph.D. degree requires a minimum of 36 credits. A master's degree in planning is not required, although most doctoral students have previous graduate work or work experience in planning or a related eld. Students must fulll four semesters of residence. In practice, doctoral candidates who hold master's degrees in planning or a related eld generally require four semesters of formal course work in residence before beginning the dissertation. Other candidates may require ve or more semesters, depending on their preparation. Each student develops an individualized course of study to reflect a specic area of interest and career aspirations. Areas of specialization and appropriate course work are determined jointly by the student, program advisor and the student's program committee. Programs are designed to meet the student's needs and build on prior academic training, for which substantial departmental or University faculty resources are available. Courses in the area of specialization must be mutually reinforcing and coherent; must prepare the student for expertise in some body of knowledge, methodology, or problem area; and must provide the student with the appropriate research methods, research design, and knowledge base to do scholarly research. The comprehensive exams, taken at the end of coursework, require knowledge of planning theory, research design, research methods, and the student's specic area of specialization.

Program Conference The student, with the help of the faculty advisor, denes an area of specialization, identies the appropriate research methodology for that area, and works out the program in detail. This means making up a list of the courses for the area of specialization and the research methods area, including when courses will be taken. In selecting appropriate courses, the student and advisor should consult with other relevant faculty members within and outside the department. Upon agreementUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 181 by the advisor that the program is ready, the student makes a formal proposal of his or her doctoral program. Comprehensive Exam Memo This document is written by the student and reviewed by each committee member and, once agreed upon, signed by the committee chair. The purpose of this memo is to foster an agreement between the student and the committee regarding the scope and details of the student's comprehensive exam. To that end, the memo will indicate exam dates, time limits for each question, editing schedules, and any other issue the student and faculty may deem necessary. Attached to the memo will be nal versions of the reading lists which will have been previously agreed upon by the student and the committee. Comprehensive Exams Comprehensive doctoral exams consist of two parts: 1.Written exam (doctoral written examination): The written exam is intended to assess students' knowledge of the material covered in his or her coursework as well as the application of that knowledge. The inclusion of substantial amounts of material not covered in coursework is discouraged. This exam should not be focused only on the student's possible dissertation topic, but rather test general knowledge in his or her areas of interest. 2.Oral exam (prospectus oral examination): The oral exam is a forum for the student to further demonstrate synthetic knowledge of specied subject matters and demonstrate readiness for an independent research project. Proposal Defense The proposal outlines the student's plan for his or her nal dissertation research. The student must form a committee of faculty to advise, review, and approve the proposal, and ultimately, the nal dissertation. Dissertation Defense The dissertation defense consists of two parts: 1.Written dissertation document (approved doctoral dissertation) 2.Oral defense (dissertation defense): The oral defense is a forum for the student to discuss the results and implications of his or her research Recommended Checklist Teaching experience: Most Ph.D. students serve as teaching assistants during their time in the program. Research Programs in Urban and Regional Studies Through the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, the Water Resources Research Institute, the Carolina Population Center, the Institute for the Environment, the Institute for Economic Development, the Highway Safety Research Center, and members of the faculty, graduate students in the Department of City and Regional Planning and in related departments collaborate on research in a range of subject areas concerning planning, human behavior, and the environment. Established in 1953 and later expanded under a grant from the Ford Foundation, the program of the Center for Urban and Regional Studies is concerned with theoretical and empirical research in urban processes and area development. The center has a permanent staff for planning and administration of its program and for the development of an interdisciplinary research-oriented program of services to local and stategovernments in North Carolina and elsewhere. The department's faculty use the center to pursue research interests and collaborate with faculty members of other University departments on research projects. In 1964, the Water Resources Research Institute was established to support research on all aspects of water resources, including the planning, programming, and analysis of urban and regional systems for development and control of quantity and quality of water and related land use. The institute serves as a focal point for faculty and student research and interdisciplinary seminars relating to water resources. The Carolina Population Center (CPC), established in 1966, provides coordination of the interdisciplinary program in population research and training. The center provides population research services to faculty doing research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences in the United States and abroad. Departmental faculty and students are engaged in international research through the CPC. The Institute for Economic Development was created in 1971 within the Extension Division of the University to sponsor the Basic Economic Development course. Now under the auspices of the Department of City and Regional Planning, the institute promises to strengthen the department's research and teaching mission and to enlarge its service capacity. The Institute for the Environment is UNC-Chapel Hill's focal point for interdisciplinary environmental research, educational programs, and service activities for faculty, staff, and students. As such, the institute leverages the collective strength of UNC's environmental expertise to reach beyond campus to develop and implement innovative solutions to the world's environmental and energy challenges. Its mission is 1.to strengthen environmental research capacity across UNC by supporting a multidisciplinary community of scholars that enhances collaboration, increases sharing of knowledge, and identies solutions to the world's critical environmental problems. 2.to work in partnership across UNC and external partners to coordinate and deliver 21st-century educational programs that provide students with the experience and skills to thrive in a growing global economy; and 3.to put new environmental knowledge into action by engaging and serving communities, here in North Carolina and around the world. The Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC) is dedicated to improving transportation safety, with a major emphasis on highway safety. The center conducts basic and applied research that increases knowledge and contributes to reducing death, injury, and related societal costs. HSRC works to translate developed knowledge into practical interventions that can be applied at local, state, national, and international levels. HSRC conducts research in the three major areas of the highway safety problem: the driver/occupant, the vehicle, and the roadway. HSRC produces guidebooks, brochures, how-to manuals, news releases, public service announcements, and newsletters to communicate highway safety information to research colleagues, safety advocates, government ofcials, and motorists. In addition to these activities organized under an institute or center, faculty members are engaged in research projects administered by the department. Several other facilities in the nearby Research Triangle Park enrich and support the department's teaching and research programs:182 Department of City and Regional Planning (GRAD) The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is a not-for-prot corporation that conducts research under contract to departments of federal, state, and local governments; public service agencies; foundations; and industry clients ranging from local rms to national corporations. RTI was created as a separately operated afliate of the three major universities that form the Research Triangle. Initial start-up funding for RTI was provided through a grant from the Research Triangle Foundation. The institute is organized into major groups whose areas of capability span social and economic systems and human resources, statistical sciences, survey research, chemistry and life sciences, energy, engineering, and environmental sciences. The Environmental Research Center of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the largest eld installation of the EPA, was dedicated in December 1971. Today it is an international center of scientic expertise in environmental research. The Triangle Universities Center for Advanced Studies, Incorporated (TUCASI) represents an additional effort in the Research Triangle to capitalize on the presence in a small radius of three major doctoral research institutions, their facilities, libraries, and auxiliary resources. TUCASI is a joint activity of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University in Durham, and North Carolina State University in Raleigh. TUCASI is the parent body that sponsors development of advanced study enterprises on its 120-acre campus within the Research Triangle Park. The center, chartered in 1975, is governed by a board of trustees, representing the constituent universities, the Research Triangle Foundation, and elected members. The National Humanities Center (NHC) was the rst resident activity on the TUCASI campus. The center opened in 1978 as an institute for advanced study in history, literature, philosophy, and other elds of the humanities. Each year, approximately 45 leading scholars from the United States and other nations come to the NHC to pursue individual research and engage in interdisciplinary seminars, lectures, and conferences. Their work results in books, articles, and other contributions to learning. Grants from major foundations, corporations, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the major universities in the Triangle, and individuals support the center's program funding and administrative costs. The UNC Institute for Transportation Research and Education (ITRE) is part of North Carolina State University. Its responsibilities include facilitation of transportation-related programs throughout the 17 UNC system campuses. Included among ITRE's activities are workshops, short courses, research projects, and training programs for transportation professionals throughout North Carolina.

Its primary missions are research and graduate and undergraduate teaching. Research particularly emphasizes big data bioinformatics and computational biology cloud computing computer architecture computer graphics computer-supported collaborative work computer vision cyber physical systems databases and data mining geometric computing high-performance computing human-computer interaction machine learning medical image analysis natural language processing networking real-time systems robotics security software engineering theory The M.S. and Ph.D. curricula are oriented toward the design and application of real computer systems and toward that portion of theory that guides and supports practice. The Ph.D. program prepares teachers and researchers for positions with universities, government research laboratories, and industry. Academic employment ranges from four- year colleges, where teaching is the primary focus, to positions at major research universities. The M.S. program prepares highly competent and broadly skilled practitioners. A majority of the master's graduates work in industry, in companies ranging from small start-up operations to government laboratories and large research and development corporations. Most of the department's approximately 150 graduate students are full time. Students contribute to nearly every aspect of the department's operation. In addition to taking a variety of courses, they participate in groundbreaking research, teach, attend research group meetings, and can serve on committees that affect all aspects of life in the department. The Computer Science Students Association sponsors both professional and social events and represents the students in departmental matters. Its president is a voting member at faculty meetings. Facilities The Department of Computer Science is housed in two adjacent buildings, the Frederick P. Brooks Jr. Computer Science Building and J.Carlyle Sitterson Hall. These two buildings are connected by hallways on all floors so that they function as a single, larger building. The Brooks Building was dedicated in 2008 and named for the department's founding chair, Frederick P. Brooks Jr. It opened up 32,000 square feet of new research space, ofces, and classrooms. These include a 50-seat classroom; the Stephen F. Weiss Seminar Room, with seating for 20 around a table; the Registrar's classroom, with theater seating for 80; and the Faculty Conference Room, which seats 50 at tiers of curved desktops. Meetings or discussion groups take place in the chair's conference room and in ve smaller meeting areas, each with projectors. Perhaps the most striking area of the building is the new noise-controlled graphics laboratory, which is divided into three areas by floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains for light and sound suppression. It has 11-foot ceilings and a unistrut mounting grid to mount hardware as needed. Sitterson Hall, which opened in 1987 and is named for former University Chancellor J. Carlyle Sitterson, provides 74,000 square feet of sophisticated, state-of-the-art research facilities and ofce space. It is organized in clusters to create research communities featuring shared laboratories and open conference areas to facilitate interaction among students and faculty. Included are the 60-seat C. Hugh Holman video teleclassroom, named for the former provost and dean of The Graduate School who was instrumental in establishing this department; a 125-seat auditorium; the Lib Moore Jones Classroom, named for the department's rst secretary; a reading room; and various research laboratories, conference areas, and study areas. Graduate students have access to all of the department's research and teaching facilities, including specialized research laboratories for graphics and image processing, computer building and design, and collaborative, distributed, and parallel systems. The laboratories, ofces, conference areas, and classrooms are bound together by the department's fully integrated, distributed computing environment. General Computing Environment The department's computing environment includes over 1,000 computers, ranging from older systems used for generating network trafc for simulated Internet experiments to state-of-the-art workstations and clusters for graphics- and compute-intensive research. Departmental servers provide compute service, disk space, e-mail, CVS (version control software), Web service, database services, backups, and many other services. All systems are integrated by means of high-speed networks and are supported by a highly skilled technical staff that provides a consistent computing environment throughout the department. The data network provides connections at either 100 Mbps, 1Gbps, or 10 Gbps. Most students are assigned to a two- or three-person ofce, though some larger ofces can hold more students. Each student is assigned a computer, with computer assignments based on the students' research or teaching assignments and their seniority within the department. In addition to the departmental servers and ofce systems, our research laboratories contain a variety of specialized equipment and facilities. General computing systems include 800+ Intel-based computers as well as about 50 Macintosh systems. The department's most powerful system is the Biomedical Analysis and Simulation Supercomputer (BASS, pronounced like \"base\"), which consists of 452 CPUs tightly coupled to each other and to 180 GPU computing processors that function as image and geometry calculation accelerators, providing the equivalent computing power of more than 13,000 processors for image-intensive applications.214 Department of Computer Science (GRAD) Our systems primarily run the Windows 7 operating system, and a smaller number of systems, including many of the servers, run Ubuntu or Red Hat Linux. We use the AFS le system for central le storage. Languages most commonly used include J++, C++, Java, and C. Document preparation is usually accomplished with standard applications on PC systems. Our extensive software holdings are continually evolving. Libraries Students have access to the entire University library system, which includes a major academic affairs library and numerous satellite libraries containing more than 6,000,000 books and periodicals, as well as access to libraries at North Carolina State, Duke, and North Carolina Central Universities with a unied online searching capability. The Kenan Science Library, located in Venable Hall, and the Science Library Annex, located in Wilson Library, are libraries with extensive holdings in computer science, mathematics, operations research, physics, and statistics. Admissions and Financial Aid Admission to the department is highly competitive, and preference is given to applicants who are solidly prepared. Although the department welcomes promising students from all disciplines, entering students must have a substantial background in both mathematics and computer science. This background normally includes at least six semester courses in mathematics and six in computer science. Students who are admitted but who have not completed all the requirements must complete them after admission. For more in-depth information on the admissions process see the department's (http://cs.unc.edu/ admissions/graduate/graduate-programs/) and The Graduate School's (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) Web sites. Sponsorship Because of the large number of applicants, the department's faculty members are unable to provide individual assessments of an applicant's chances for admission. Applicants cannot improve their chances of admission by nding a faculty sponsor within the department, because all admissions decisions are made by a faculty committee that reviews all applications, ranks the applicants by overall merit, and makes decisions on admission and nancial support based on the application material submitted. Students are assigned to specic research projects just prior to the start of each semester, after faculty members and students have had an opportunity to meet and to discuss their interests. Deadlines Applicants for fall admission are encouraged to submit all application materials, complete with a personal statement, all transcripts, and recommendations, to The Graduate School by early January. To ensure meeting that deadline, applicants are encouraged to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) no later than December 1. Early submission of applications is encouraged. International applicants should complete their applications earlier to allow time for processing nancial and visa documents. For more information, send electronic mail to info@cs.unc.edu . Interested persons are encouraged to visit the department's Web site (http:// www.cs.unc.edu). A flexible course of study for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees focuses on areas of choice and accommodates differences in students' backgrounds. The two degree programs share a basic distribution requirement chosen from theory and formal thinking, systems and hardware, and applications subject areas. The Ph.D. programincludes work in specialized areas, preparation for teaching, and active involvement in advanced research. Master of Science An M.S. candidate must earn 30 semester hours of credit in courses numbered 400 or higher (with the exception of some introductory courses), of which up to six hours may be transferred from another institution or graduate program, and of which 18 hours must be completed in the Department of Computer Science. A candidate must also satisfy the program product requirement and must demonstrate the ability to write a professional-quality technical document. A comprehensive exam (written or oral) is required for degree completion. For more in-depth information (http://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/ ms-requirements/) see the department's Web site. Doctor of Philosophy Admission to the doctoral program is by a vote of the department faculty and is determined by performance on the preliminary research presentation and exam, course grades, admissions information, accomplishment on assistantships, and other testimony from the faculty. Admission is normally considered following the research presentation and exam. Students who have been major contributors to a paper submitted to a well-known, refereed conference or journal may apply for a waiver of the admissions exam. There is no credit hour requirement for the Ph.D. program, but a Ph.D. candidate must complete courses to satisfy the distribution requirement and any needed background preparation, and must write a comprehensive paper. A candidate must also satisfy the program product requirement, participate in the technical communication seminar, pass an oral examination in the proposed dissertation area, and submit and defend a dissertation that presents an original contribution to knowledge. The normal time needed to complete the degree by a full-time student with an assistantship is ve years. For more in-depth information (http://cs.unc.edu/academics/graduate/phd- requirements/) see the department's Web site. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Oral and Craniofacial Biomedicine Oral and craniofacial biomedicine is a highly translational, multidisciplinary program of study that focuses on the growth,development, and pathologies of the craniofacial complex and associated physiological structures, as well as the study of disease and healing mechanisms related to these structures. The discipline of oral and craniofacial biomedicine applies and extends the concepts of immunology, embryology, physiology, cellular and molecular biology, pharmacology, microbiology, and biochemistry to understanding the growth and development and pathologies associated with the craniofacial complex and oral cavity. Expertise and authority in the concepts of host-pathogen interactions, skeletal biology and extracellular matrices, and cancer are well represented within the program and by the qualications of program faculty located in numerous UNC-Chapel Hill programs and departments, including the UNC Adams School of Dentistry, School of Medicine, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Center for Cystic Fibrosis, and the Center for AIDS Research. Attention in dental research and practice is now focusing on the dynamics of oral disease and prevention and treatment at the earliest stages of development, including research on risk factors for disease as well as the cellular and molecular events in disease pathogenesis. Molecular approaches for oral disease analysis and the complexity of disease elements require advanced training in the discipline of oral and craniofacial biomedicine. Modern biomedical research is also identifying systemic relationships between oral conditions, health status, and diseases such as atherosclerosis, HIV, and cancer. The oral cavity also offers an ideal model to study biological structures and cellular mechanisms important throughout the body and important in immune response.

Three polio (unless greater than 18 years of age). Two measles (rubeola), two mumps, one rubella (two MMR doses meet this requirement) or positive titers.232 UNC Adams School of Dentistry (GRAD) COVID-19 vaccination series, including prior boosters, or intent to request a medical or religious exemption. Hepatitis B series (not required for individuals born before July 1, 1994). See school requirements below. UNC Adams School of Dentistry Requirements Varicella vaccination series (two shots) or a positive titer. Hepatitis B vaccination series (three shots) and a positive hepatitis B antibody (HBsAb) quantitative titer. (Please make sure your physician does not order a qualitative titer.) Ideally, a titer is recommended one to two months after completion of the series for proof of immunity to hepatitis B but can be checked at a later date. Two-step tuberculosis skin test (TST) or a TB blood test (IGRA). DDS and DH students report to Campus Health and follow the testing procedures required. Advanced Dental Education students report to Employee Health and follow the testing procedures required. The matriculating student is required to submit an ofcial certicate of immunizations that is signed by an authorized healthcare provider. Immunization documentation is to be submitted to both UNC Campus Health Services (CHS) and to the UNC Adams School of Dentistry through eMedley and Connect Carolina by a published and specied date. CHS will notify students who are not in compliance with the state immunization requirements noted above. Individuals who have not met the state immunization requirements after 30 calendar days from the rst date of attendance will be administratively withdrawn from the University by the University Registrar. See the UNC Campus Health website (http:// campushealth.unc.edu/services/immunizations/health-science-students- immunizations/ ). Students with deciencies in the additional immunization requirements of the school will be notied of the deciencies by the UNC school's director of clinical compliance. The school will work with students to meet these additional requirements. The failure to comply with the school's requirements after consultation with the director of clinical compliance and the agreed-upon resolution schedule will result in administrative withdrawal from the school. Additional Requirements Annually: Influenza vaccine not earlier than September 1. Tuberculosis screening. Verication of health insurance. UNC-Chapel Hill requires all eligible students to have health insurance (see the UNC Campus Health Student Health Insurance website (http://campushealth.unc.edu/ charges-insurance/mandatory-student-health-insurance/).)

Each student is responsible for becoming familiar with the general regulations of The Graduate School and particularly with the dates indicated on the calendar for the academic year. This information is contained elsewhere in the Graduate Catalog. Please note that, due to the nature of the professional training programs, the calendar for graduate students in the Department of Dramatic Art will not always coincide with that of the University. Graduate students in the department are frequently required to work on productions during University-scheduled holidays. A limited number of graduate appointments are available in the department. Appointments are presently awarded in the areas of acting, technical production, and costume production in support of courses. All appointments involve instructional or laboratory supervisory responsibility. Through disciplined classroom training and a progressive involvement in performance or production opportunities, students in the master of ne arts (M.F.A.) program are challenged to develop the skills and attitudes that enable them to compete in the professional theatre. Emphasizing accomplishment in a range of performance and production styles, the programs complement the variety of theatrical experiences available in the PlayMakers Repertory Company (PRC), a professional full-season equity company and a member of The League of Resident Theatres. Within his or her area of specialization, a student will be ready upon graduation to perform a variety of roles or assume a range of responsibilities onstage or backstage in stage, lm, or television. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a member of URTA (University/Resident Theatre Association, Inc.). Curriculum Each candidate pursues a course of study in a conservatory environment. Classroom training offers a variety of approaches, each designed to develop and rene the candidate's artistic and professional potential.Classroom work is augmented by participation in the professional season of PlayMakers Repertory Company. In addition to the PRC, students nd performance opportunities in studio projects and productions. Evaluation At least once each semester, the faculty formally evaluates the candidate's progress and makes recommendations concerning his or her continuation in the program. Evaluations are made of each individual on the basis of classroom and performance or production work. Letter grades (H, P, L, F) are assigned for work in all courses. Residency and Requirements All candidates are required to be in residence for three years, six consecutive semesters. The departmental system of evaluation requires that the student be invited to continue in the second and then in the nal year of the program. While all programs require their students to complete 60 credit hours, those hours are apportioned differently from program to program. In addition to 60 credit hours, each area of specialization carries its own graduation requirements. Candidates are encouraged to ascertain individual requirements for graduation as soon as possible.

We promote exploration and discovery of the natural world by engaging students in research-based learning at all levels. Our graduates are equipped with the strong science foundation, critical thinking skills, and interdisciplinary perspectives required to tackle current and future environmental and resource challenges. We encourage engaged service that translates knowledge for the public good. We support a welcoming and inclusive environment, foster diverse identities and perspectives, and encourage collaboration with all segments of society. Facilities The primary location of our department in Chapel Hill fosters interactions with faculty, students, and staff from other UNC-Chapel Hill departments, nearby research institutions and companies; places scientists within easy reach of RDU International Airport, allowing for the convenient transport of equipment and personnel to distant ports and eld locations; and provides ready access to advanced computational resources through RENCI (Renaissance Computing Institute). The department's marine laboratory, the Institute of Marine Sciences (https://emes.unc.edu/ institute-of-marine-sciences/ ) in Morehead City, provides coastal access for eld studies and instruction. Shared, flexible laboratory space is also now available at the Institute since the addition of a new wing. The department maintains research facilities and ofce space in both Murray-Venable Hall and Elisha Mitchell Hall. Specialized analytical equipment and facilities supporting marine science include low background alpha, beta, and gamma detectors, a dedicated GC/MS system, a state-of-the-art isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry facility for compound specic carbon analyses, high capacity light- and temperature-controlled incubators, and a full range of specialized chromatographic and spectroscopic gear. Observational instrumentation for eld use includes a suite of current meters and temperature/pressure sensors, near-bottom and sub-bottom water samplers and prolers, and a specially built a sensor and data system for aircraft sampling of the coastal ocean and atmosphere. Geological instrumentation includes two thermal ionization mass spectrometers with associated Class 100 clean labs; quadrupole ICPMS; a sediment analysis laboratory including laser-size particle analyzer; X-ray fluorescence spectrometer; X-ray diffractometer; scanning electron microscope with X-ray analysis and cathodoluminescence; counting laboratory (alpha-, beta-, and gamma- emitting radionuclides); experimental petrology laboratory. Access to a eld-emission electron microprobe is also available through a remotely operated system at Fayetteville State University. Geological Sciences The department offers programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geological sciences. A broad background is offered in most major areasof geoscience, with particular emphasis on global hydrology, flooding and fluvial hydrology, coastal processes and geochemistry, paleoclimatology and paleoecology, structural geology and tectonics, surface processes, and tectonic geomorphology. Admission and General Degree Requirements Students admitted to pursue a graduate degree in the department are typically expected to have an undergraduate degree in traditional geology, geochemistry, geophysics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, or other related interdisciplinary elds. Please note that the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is no longer required of applicants. All foreign students whose native language is not English also must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examination. Course requirements for incoming students will be determined by individual graduate committees, often in consultation with the director of graduate studies. Specic requirements are varied to meet the needs and career objectives of the individual. Financial Aid The department typically supports 10-12 graduate students in geological sciences with teaching assistantships during the 9-month academic year with stipends of ~$18000. In addition, all graduate students are eligible to apply for departmental summer fellowships ($7,000), research funds, and conference funds from a departmental endowment. The department also nominates up to three students for consideration by The Graduate School for graduate fellowships; no additional application is necessary. Faculty research grants support some research assistantships. Out-of-state students are recommended for remission of out-of-state tuition costs; all students are recommended for an in- state tuition award. Most students are eligible for both and therefore are responsible only for the payment of student fees. Further information may be found on the department's website (http://marine.unc.edu/ ). Master of Science Requirements for the master of science degree are 30 semester hours (including a minimum of three hours, but no more than six hours of GEOL 993 ), a thesis, and a nal oral examination in defense of the thesis. Doctor of Philosophy Many students have completed a master's degree before being admitted to the doctoral program, but some students enter the Ph.D. program having completed only an undergraduate degree. Students admitted to the M.S. program who elect to pursue a Ph.D. instead may be permitted to bypass the master's degree after one semester of residence upon demonstration of superior scholastic performance and research potential. Recommendation by the student's graduate committee and approval by the geological sciences faculty is required in this case. Admission to the Ph.D. program after completing the M.S. degree in the Department of Geological Sciences requires faculty approval. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of 48 semester hours of graduate credit (which may include 30 hours from the M.S. degree) and a minimum of six hours and preferably no more than 12 hours of GEOL 994 , a written comprehensive examination and an oral comprehensive examination, a dissertation, and a nal oral examination in defense of the dissertation.250 Department of Earth, Marine, and Environmental Sciences (GRAD) Marine Sciences The department provides teaching and research in estuarine, coastal, and oceanographic sciences leading to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in marine sciences. Research programs in physical oceanography, marine biology and ecology, marine geochemistry, marine geology, and coastal meteorology are conducted in North Carolina and throughout the world by faculty from the department. Courses and facilities at other coastal laboratories are also available to UNC-Chapel Hill marine sciences students through cooperative agreements. Courses at North Carolina State University, UNC-Charlotte, UNC-Greensboro, North Carolina Central University, and Duke University may be taken for credit through an interinstitutional registration program. Admission Requirements For admission to the department, an undergraduate degree is required in a basic science such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, bacteriology, botany, zoology, geology, or in computer science or engineering. Students are advised to develop a broad undergraduate science major with as many as possible of the following courses: mathematics through calculus, computer science, physics, general and organic chemistry, environmental science, physical chemistry, invertebrate zoology or paleontology, botany, zoology, ecology, physiology, geology, and statistics. Each graduate student must gain a broad background in the marine sciences as well as an in-depth understanding of his or her own subdiscipline (e.g., chemical oceanography). This is accomplished by taking at least three of the four core courses (listed below) and advanced courses determined by each student's advisory committee, and by participating in research that ultimately results in an M.S. thesis or a Ph.D. dissertation. By the end of the 24-month period that begins when a student rst enrolls in the department, the student is expected to have completed the four core courses, How to Give a Seminar (MASC 705), and Student Interdisciplinary Seminar (MASC 706), and to have taken a written comprehensive exam (M.S. students) in his or her subdiscipline. Further information on degree requirements may be found at the department's website (http://marine.unc.edu/ ). Master of Science The M.S. degree program is similar to the Ph.D. program except for the following: the advisory committee will be composed of three faculty members, the comprehensive examination is a written exam only, and scientic research will result in a written thesis, to be defended by the student. At least 30 hours of course credit must be earned prior to completing the M.S. degree program. Additional details on the comprehensive examination, admission to candidacy, semesters of residence credit, the thesis, and nal oral examination (the thesis defense) are provided in the Marine Sciences Graduate Student Handbook and in The Graduate School Handbook, both available on the department's website (http://marine.unc.edu/ ). Doctor of Philosophy The academic program for a Ph.D. student will be supervised by a faculty advisory committee of at least ve members drawn from the UNC-Chapel Hill graduate faculty. Course requirements normally include at least three of the four core courses, additional advanced courses determined by the student's advisory committee, one hour of MASC 705 and one hour of MASC 706. A waiver for one or more of the core courses can be arranged with the approval of the student's advisory committee and the department's Performance Committee. Additionalrequirements include passing a comprehensive examination containing both written (research proposal) and oral (proposal defense seminar) parts, a period of study or research at a marine station or participation on an oceanographic cruise, teaching experience sufcient to develop and demonstrate competence, and scientic research resulting in a written dissertation, which is defended by the student. More details on the Ph.D. comprehensive examination, admission to candidacy, semesters of residence credit, the dissertation, and nal oral examination (the dissertation defense) are provided in the Marine Sciences Graduate Student Handbook and in The Graduate School Handbook, both available on the department's website (http://marine.unc.edu/ ).

During the rst year of the program, students concentrate on the core areas of econometrics, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. Later, each student chooses a eld of specialization. The department's objective is to provide students both with broad training in economics and econometrics and in a chosen eld of specialization. A number of students supplement their study in economics at UNC- Chapel Hill with work in nance, statistics, mathematics, biostatistics, urban and regional studies, computer science, and operations research, along with courses at Duke University and North Carolina State University. Strong offerings in these and other related areas enhance the overall graduate training offered to students. Fellowships and Assistantships The department offers several fellowships and a number of research and teaching assistantships. All applicants to the Ph.D. program are considered for nancial support, and most students enrolled in the Ph.D. program receive a stipend, tuition assistance, and health insurance from the Department of Economics or other sponsors for the rst ve years of the program. Detailed information regarding the fellowships, assistantships, and instructorships may be obtained on the graduate program web page (https://econ.unc.edu/graduate/ ) in the department's website (https://econ.unc.edu/ ). Master of Science The Economics Department Master of Science (M.S.) degree is intended to complement Ph.D. programs from our and other departments. Students can obtain an M.S. while working toward a Ph.D. in economics or they may pursue an M.S. if they decide to leave the Ph.D. program early or they do not meet the requirements. In addition, students from other graduate programs at UNC-Chapel Hill may pursue an M.S. in economics while completing the Ph.D. in the other program. Note that our economics graduate program does not include separate M.S.- and Ph.D.-level courses. Thus, any student pursuing an M.S. through our program must have the background and qualications to successfully complete Ph.D.-level course work. For these reasons, only applications from UNC-Chapel Hill graduate students currently enrolled in another primary degree program will be considered. The master's program does not consider candidates outside of these circumstances. Master's and doctoral students take the same courses in the rst year; therefore, master's students must have competitive backgrounds similar to our doctoral students to do well in the courses. The master's degree requires the following coursework: Code Title Hours ECON 710 Advanced Microeconomic Theory I 3 ECON 720 Advanced Macroeconomic Theory I 3 ECON 700 Basic Quantitative Techniques 3 One course in econometrics: 3 ECON 770 Introduction to Econometric TheoryECON 771 Econometrics ECON 870 Advanced Econometrics Two courses in a specialized eld 6 Three electives 9 A research course: ECON 992 Master's (Non-Thesis) 3 Total Hours 30 Courses are to be selected in consultation with, and with the approval of, the director of graduate studies and the faculty in the eld of specialization. In addition to coursework, a master of science student writes a research paper under the direction of the faculty advisor. The Graduate School Handbook describes the general requirements for the master's examinations and for the papers. Doctor of Philosophy A doctoral candidate must complete 15 Ph.D.-level courses and two semesters of the doctoral dissertation course (ECON 994 ). Unless otherwise specied by the faculty in the specialized eld, at least 12 of the 15 courses must be from the Department of Economics. All courses must be approved by the director of graduate studies. Courses in the Fundamentals of Economics The following seven courses or their equivalents are required: Code Title Hours ECON 710 Advanced Microeconomic Theory I 3 ECON 711 Advanced Microeconomic Theory II 3 ECON 720 Advanced Macroeconomic Theory I 3 ECON 721 Advanced Macroeconomic Theory II 3 ECON 700 Basic Quantitative Techniques 3 ECON 770 Introduction to Econometric Theory 3 ECON 771 Econometrics 3 Total Hours 21 Courses in the Field of Specialization within Economics Each student selects a eld of specialization. At least three (3) courses in the eld of specialization are required. Current examples of eld of specialization courses are available on the web page Field Specialization Requirements. (https://econ.unc.edu/graduate/graduatedegrees/eld- specialization-requirements/) Notice that these are only examples and new elds of specialization can be created by students under the supervision of a faculty member. Courses in Supporting Fields The remaining courses are supporting courses chosen by the student in consultation with the director of graduate studies and other faculty members. The supporting courses may be within the eld of specialization or in areas that complement the eld of specialization. Doctoral Exams and Dissertation Students must pass qualifying exams in econometrics, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. Students are also required to produce and pass a eld paper. The qualiers are taken in May and August of the student's rst year. Students have three opportunities to pass each of the exams they take.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 257 The Graduate School Handbook describes the requirements for the doctoral oral exam, doctoral dissertation, and nal oral defense of the dissertation. The doctoral oral exam includes an evaluation of the thesis prospectus. The general regulations of The Graduate School apply to students receiving graduate degrees in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Professors Gary A.

With these purposes in mind, the school's graduate programs are designed to meet the needs of professional educators who seek to further their knowledge, understanding, and skills relating to educational processes. These professionals vary in their career orientations. Some are employed in (or wish to become employed in) educational institutions, and others, in agencies and organizations performing noninstructional educational functions. The research mission involves continuing inquiry into the development of knowledge of the teaching-learning process; human development; the organization of schools and educational agencies; the historical, social, and philosophical bases for educational institutions; and the processes of program development and implementation. The service mission provides public and private institutions and agencies with the benets of research and consultation, thereby enhancing these institutions and agencies' ability to satisfy their educational objectives. The teaching mission involves the faculty and graduate students in applying the knowledge base in eld settings and translating it into coursework. The School of Education has attempted to present correct information as of the publication this catalog. However, this information does not establish a contractual relationship, and the school reserves the right to alter any statement when review is complete. Therefore, applicants should contact the School of Education to obtain updated information on programs prior to nal application procedures. Licensure The School of Education recommends eligible graduates of its approved education programs to the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction for licensure as teachers, school administrators, school counselors, school psychologists, and curriculum and instruction specialists. In addition, the school recommends licensure candidates from the following University degree programs: the School of Information and Library Science (for school media coordinators), the School of Social Work (for school social workers), and graduates of the speech-language pathology program in the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences. Initial professional licensure is recommended for master of arts in teaching graduates at the initial level and for master of education in school counseling at the advanced specialist level. The master's program for experienced teachers provides the opportunity for practicing teachers who hold a current teaching license to achieve the advanced competencies of master's-level licensure. School administrators are eligible for licensure at the master's (for school principals) and specialist and/or doctoral levels (for school superintendents). School psychologists are eligible for licensure at the specialist and/or doctoral level. Curriculum and instruction specialists may complete an Ed.D. for doctoral-level licensure. Applications for North Carolina licensure must be submitted through the N.C. Department of Public Instruction's online licensure system by the graduate seeking N.C. licensure. Forms are no longer submitted by theUNC School of Education Licensure Ofcer. The UNC School of Education Licensure reviews and either approves or denies all licensure applications routed to UNC through the N.C. Department of Public Instruction online licensure system. More information about applying for N.C. licensure is available on the School of Education website (https://ed.unc.edu/ academics/licensure/). The programs described in this catalog are approved by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the State Board of Education, and the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, with specialty accreditation from the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) and the American Psychological Association (APA). Note: Additional information may be found on the School of Education's website (http://soe.unc.edu ). The School of Education offers three doctoral degrees, the doctor of philosophy, the doctor of education, and the doctor of school psychology: 1.The doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in education with ve research areas (applied developmental sciences and special education; cultural, curriculum, and teacher education; learning sciences and psychological studies; policy, leadership, and school improvement). 2.The doctor of education (Ed.D.) with two research areas, one in educational leadership and one in curriculum and instruction (*The curriculum and instruction program is on hiatus and currently not accepting new students.) 3.The doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in school psychology is a separate Ph.D. program that is APA- and NASP-approved and that prepares school psychologists to work in school, clinical, and hospital settings. The master's programs include the following degrees: 1.The master of arts in teaching (M.A.T.) with a concentration in middle grades or secondary education for English, social studies, mathematics and science; elementary education; English as a second language education; K-12 special education (General Curriculum); and K-12 ESL 2.The master of education (M.Ed.) in school counseling and the master's for experienced teachers 3.The master of school administration (M.S.A.) 4.The master of arts in education (M.A.) The Graduate School administers all but the master of school administration program and the master's for experienced teachers with an Early Childhood Intervention and Family Support (ECIFS) strand area, which the School of Education administers. Two off-campus, part-time programs are offered: the master of education (M.Ed.) for experienced teachers (ECIFS) and the flexible master of school administration (M.S.A. Flex). The current content specialty areas for the M.Ed. program is early childhood intervention and family support (birth through kindergarten). The ECIFS content areas offers admission every spring for students to begin their program of study in May. It is a two-year program for part time students who are practicing professionals in the early childhood eld. The part-time, off-campus M.S.A. Flex program is designed for working professionals and stretches the normal two-year program offered over an extended period of two and a half academic years, beginning eachUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 263 January with a new cohort. While the program emphasizes preparation for the school principalship, individuals with other educational career aspirations (such as district-level leadership positions) will nd it appropriate.

Programs of Study Master of Arts (M.A.) in Education Master of Arts in Educational Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship The M.A. in Educational Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship (MEITE) is a professional degree program that prepares its graduates for careers in the educational technology eld, both in the public and private sectors. Students from all backgrounds join the program, and MEITE enrolls students into either full-time or part-time cohorts that begin in August and January. The MEITE program is 36.0 credit hours, and it consists of a \"core\" group of courses (12.0 credit hours), one specialized course track (12.0 credit hours), a yearlong internship experience (6.0 credit hours), and a summer thesis project (12.0 credit hours). There are four specialized tracks, and students are to complete one of the following track options: The Edupreneur utilizes the core concepts for design thinking to develop and prepare for the launching of unique, innovative ventures in the eld of educational technology. This track is ideal for students who wish to begin their own startup or join an early-stage startup. The Innovative Specialist gains a deep understanding of the trends, research, and budgetary issues related to leadership, business, and innovation in educational organizations. This track prepares students to work in the innovation departments of educational organizations, including companies, schools, districts, and non-prots. The Learning Engineer uses the learning sciences and design thinking principles along with data and analytics to improve designers' choices, instructors' practices, and learners' experiences and outcomes. This track builds the knowledge and skills needed to work in school districts, universities, textbook companies, eLearning providers, training departments, and non-prot organizations. The Human-Machine Interactionist learns the attributes necessary for effective human-machine interaction from an end-user perspective, which includes the visual aesthetics, intuitive design, technical knowledge, and text transactions. This track prepares students to join rms developing digital products for teaching, learning, productivity, and efciency. Adaptive Learning Analyst trains students in techniques for evaluating assessment data reported by a range of instructional technologies and uses that data to improve teaching and student learning outcomes Throughout the program, students will collaborate with the MEITE program director, advisor, and faculty, who work to ensure the students have a positive experience in the classroom, at their internship, and after the program. Master of Education (M.Ed.) for Experienced Teachers The M.Ed. for experienced teachers is a part-time, eld-based program for teachers currently employed in local schools and community-based programs, public and private. The program is designed to assist licensedteachers having at least two years of experience in reflecting upon their experiences and developing further skill and art as professional educators. It is a 31-to-36-hour program (depending on the content area) that begins in the summer and extends through the subsequent two years. Courses during the traditional calendar school year are offered generally from 4:30 p.m. to 7:20 p.m in a hybrid format. Courses will be offered in a Hyflex format (with fully remote- synchronous and asynchronous sessions) in addition to the traditional Hybrid format beginning in Summer of 2022. For specics about content areas, please visit the School of Education's website (http://soe.unc.edu ) or call (919) 966-1346. Master of Education (M.Ed.) in School Counseling The M.Ed. program in school counseling is predicated on the Strengths- Based School Counseling (SBSC) model, which asserts that the school counselor's primary role is to promote and advocate for positive youth development for all students and for the environments that enhance and sustain that development. The SBSC approach characterizes positive youth development as nurturing and enhancing empirically identied student strengths or competencies rather than focusing on student weaknesses and problem areas. SBSC provides a framework to guide the practice of school counseling in the 21st century that is both compatible with and operationalizes many of the features of the ASCA National Model for School Counseling Programs. Strengths-based school counselors employ a variety of direct (e.g., counseling, classroom guidance) and systemic (e.g., consultation, advocacy) interventions to promote culturally relevant student development in the academic, personal/social, and career domains. The strengths-based perspective identies the counselor as a school leader who works with students, teachers, administrators, parents, and other members of the community and promotes strengths-enhancing environments for all students. Requirements The M.Ed. program in school counseling consists of four semesters of full-time study \u2014 60 semester hours of coursework over a 14-month period. Students normally begin classes during the last week in May. Students nish the program by August of the year following their entrance into the program. Because the 60 semester hours of coursework are completed in a 14- month period rather than in the more traditional two-year period for programs of this type, this is a concentrated and intense program. As a result, only full-time students are admitted, and students may not enter the program at times other than the one specied above. 1.Thirty (30) hours of content courses 2.Twenty-four (24) hours of skill/clinical courses 3.Six (6) hours of graduate-level electives, approved by the advisor The fall practicum runs from August through October. The fall internship runs from October through December. Students must spend a minimum of 100 (40 direct service) clock hours in the practicum and 600 (240 direct service) hours in the internship in their eld experiences during the August to June K-12 public school year. The schedule for accumulating the required 700 hours is typically completed in three full-time days perUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 265 week at the school site and/or arranged with both the eld supervisor and EDUC 705 instructors. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) The Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) program is designed for individuals wishing to teach elementary school (grades K-6), middle school (grades 6-8) or high school (grades 9-12) in the subject areas in math, science, English, or social studies, Special Education General Curriculum (grades K-12), or English as a Second Language (grades K-12). This eld-based, student-centered, cohort model program relies on partnerships between public schools and the University and provides the context of real classrooms as the motivation for students to connect theory and practice. Through the use of its signature pedagogy of experiential education, the M.A.T. is a professional preparation program that is designed to prepare candidates for initial teaching licensure in North Carolina by providing opportunities for students to accomplish three general objectives: 1.Expand their understanding of methodology in a content specialization 2.Gain an understanding of curriculum and instruction, and 3.Provide knowledge of the social and psychological foundations of education The M.A.T. is a 12-month, full-time program that requires 40 hours of coursework. There are optional add-on programs (12 hours each) in special education and English as a second language, which if taken, extend the program length and cost by approximately two months. Seminars, methods, contexts, learner, and learning courses are ongoing throughout the M.A.T and are both interdisciplinary and subject area oriented. The program of study and more detailed program and application information can be found on the School of Education's website. (http:// soe.unc.edu/academics/mat/#program-details) Some clinical placements could include multiple settings and levels of instruction. Seminars, methods, contexts, learner, and learning courses are ongoing over the entire 12-month period and are both interdisciplinary and subject area oriented. Master of School Administration (M.S.A.) The M.S.A. on-campus and M.S.A. FLEX programs prepare individuals to lead schools and other educational organizations for the schools of North Carolina and the nation. These programs include three dimensions: 1.Awareness (i.e., acquiring concepts, information, denitions, and procedures) 2.Understanding (i.e., interpreting knowledge to school environments, integrating concepts with practice, and using knowledge and skills in context) 3.Knowledge (i.e., applying knowledge and skills to specic problems of practice) While most of those who complete this program move into administrative positions at the school-site level, some assume roles within state, regional, or national organizations that focus on educational professional development, research, or policy making. The completion of this program leads to eligibility for licensure from the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction and qualies graduates for administrativecertication in most states. For additional information, please visit the school's website (http://soe.unc.edu ). Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Curriculum and Instruction (*The curriculum and instruction program is on hiatus and currently not accepting new students.) The Ed.D. program in curriculum and instruction is designed specically for people who seek to become curriculum leaders for the 21st century. While the target populations for this program are those who have master's degrees and who work in curriculum or instructional specialties ofces and state departments of public instruction, higher education and non-prots. The program will also enroll experienced teachers and other school personnel who have or seek leadership roles within schools or other educational settings. The program also prepares curriculum developers and those professionals interested in assessment in higher education. Potential professional leadership roles for curriculum and instruction doctoral program graduates include district- or state-level directors of curriculum and instruction or a specialty area, P-12 specialty area supervisors, school-based leaders working with mentor teachers, leaders in higher education and leaders in non-prot settings. A variety of specialty areas may be selected within the Ed.D. program; those include instructional technology, curriculum design and development, cultural and linguistic diversity, special education, universal pre-kindergarten, international education, higher education and non-prot management. This program accommodates full and part time students. Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership The Educational Leadership doctoral program develops students primarily for leadership roles in K-12 public school districts throughout the nation. The program prepares students to excel in ever-changing national, state, and local educational environments. Courses are offered in the evenings during the fall and spring terms, in the summer and on weekends. Most students are enrolled part time and typically take two courses per semester. Students may transfer up to nine credit hours, subject to program faculty approval. Credits must have been taken at the graduate level, for a grade, within the past ve years. Educational Leadership, Ed.D. The program of study for the Ed.D. in educational leadership can be found on the School of Education's website (https://ed.unc.edu/ ). The School of Education is approved by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction to recommend the superintendent license in the areas of educational leadership at the Specialist/S level and Doctoral/D level. More information on the required programs of study and specic licensing requirements can be found on the School of Education's website (https://ed.unc.edu/ ). If an Ed.D. student does not have a master's degree in educational leadership or school administration, he or she is required to take a minimum of nine additional credits in the Master of School Administration (M.S.A.) program. The student may, with the chair's permission, transfer up to nine educational leadership credits from another accredited institution. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Education The schools in North Carolina and in the nation face myriad complex issues and challenges. These challenges range from meeting the266 School of Education (GRAD) educational and social-emotional needs of diverse student populations to designing, implementing, and evaluating educational programs within cultural contexts. The Ph.D. in education prepares leaders in educational research who understand these issues and who can improve educational practice using state-of-the-art knowledge and research skills. The design of the program fosters collaboration among faculty members and students from diverse disciplines. Such cooperation across levels and areas of interest provides the opportunity to develop relevant research agendas. Graduates of this program are prepared for leadership positions in research and teaching at major universities and institutes in the state and nation. The Ph.D. in education is a single program with four research emphases: applied developmental sciences and special education; culture, curriculum, and teacher education; learning sciences and psychological studies; policy, leadership, and school improvement. These ve elds blend areas of inquiry that were formerly discrete. The following courses are required for all School of Education Ph.D. students: Code Title Hours EDUC 710 Introductory Statistical Methods 3 EDUC 825 Development and Learning 3 EDUC 830 Field Techniques in Educational Research 3 One advanced research methods course (varies) EDUC 867 Issues in Educational Policy and Research 3 EDUC 876 Histories of School and Schooling 3 The mission of the applied developmental science and special education (ADSSE) program area is to train doctoral students in the interdisciplinary, theoretical foundations of applied developmental science and special education. These foundations will provide young scholars with the tools to advance knowledge about human development from birth through adolescence, with a particular focus on studying children/students at risk for learning and behavioral challenges. This mission is accomplished by offering research perspectives in 1.the developmental trajectories of families and children/students from diverse sociocultural backgrounds in the multiple contexts in which they live, including school, home, neighborhoods, and communities, as well as a grounding in 2.evidence-based models of prevention that seek to provide equitable opportunities for learning and successful adjustment for all children by emphasizing education and instruction directed towards individual differences among learners. The ADSSE program is dedicated to developing a new generation of interdisciplinary scholars who have acquired a rigorous research knowledge base with expertise in a quantitative, mixed method, and single case methodology. Students work closely with their advisor and committee members to develop the skills and experiences necessary to work as leaders in a variety of research settings, including institutions of higher education, governmental entities at the state or federal level, and private research rms. Students may choose one of three specializations within the ADSSE strand: 1) Applied Developmental Science; 2) Special Education; and 3) Sociocultural Diversity. Throughout the doctoral experience, students will engage in research activities, grant writing, and the dissemination of their research and prevention efforts, such as presenting their research at local, state, and national conferences, and teaching college-level classes.The mission of the applied developmental science and special education (ADSSE) program area is to train doctoral students in the interdisciplinary, theoretical foundations of developmental science.

Throughout the doctoral experience, students will engage in research activities, grant writing, and the dissemination of their research and prevention efforts, such as presenting their research at local, state, and national conferences, and teaching college-level classes. The Culture, Curriculum and Teacher Education strand is designed for future scholars and researchers who will study the linguistic, social, and cultural contexts of education and how culture, language, and education are produced locally, nationally, and globally. This strand prepares future scholars, researchers, and faculty members who work in the areas of teacher education including general and discipline specic elds (e.g., mathematics, science, and social studies); multiple and critical literacies; social and cultural foundations of education; the intersectionality of race, gender, language, sexual orientation, and class; qualitative research methods broadly conceived; and how all to these contribute to creating social and educational inequities. Our focus is both critical and constructive. Our efforts rst describe, interpret, and critique current practice and belief and then move to strategizing about how to create a more equitable society and world. We prepare scholars to be rst rate educators, theorists, and qualitative research methodologists\u2014and advocates for change. The Learning Sciences and Psychological Studies (LSPS) Ph.D. program focuses on how people learn, drawing on interdisciplinary theory and research from biological, cognitive, social, and cultural perspectives. LSPS students use this knowledge to improve education in formal settings like schools and colleges, as well as informal settings that range from museums and community centers to video games and virtual reality. Our students also gain the foundational skills necessary to conduct rigorous scientic research, including extensive training in state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative research methodology. Students interested in LSPS can elect to concentrate in a number of areas, including mathematics education, science education, educational technology, cognition, and quantitative methods and evaluation. In particular, many of our research faculty specialize in the design and evaluation of digital learning technologies, and the implications of these technologies for diverse, equitable, and inclusive education in today's society. As one of only 21 Ph.D. programs worldwide recognized by theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 267 International Society of the Learning Sciences, our graduates are uniquely positioned to be leaders among the next generation of educational researchers, prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia. The aim of the Ph.D. program in policy, leadership, and school improvement (PLS) is to prepare leaders who will influence the direction of educational organizations at home and around the world. The program produces scholars, administrators, and analysts for leadership roles in K-12 systems, universities, research organizations, and policy-making bodies. It does so by developing students' understanding of the societal, political, and economic conditions affecting schools; the capacity to analyze educational problems and their proposed solutions; and the ability to design innovations and implementation processes that work. The Ph.D. program in PLS is among the few programs at elite public universities in the nation to offer opportunities to study with a faculty whose work in K-12 administration, education policy, and school improvement is internationally known. As leaders in these areas, our faculty works collaboratively with students to develop research questions and hypotheses, study them in state and national settings, and link ndings to practice. Faculty and students in PLS are engaged in the examination and critique of today's important and contested issues in education, including Teacher quality Turn-around schools High school effectiveness Resource allocation Principal instructional leadership Issues of class, gender, immigration, and race in education In addition to disciplinary core and research courses, students pursue programs of study that include courses in policy making, education program evaluation and policy analysis, school law, leadership, educational innovation, implementation, and taking reforms to scale. In combination with courses in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods, students develop their research skills through a professional seminar and assistantships with faculty members. Committed to professional service, our faculty members are also members of editorial boards and advisory forums at the national, state, and local levels. They also work directly with school systems, consulting on issues of stafng, instructional delivery, and governance. PLS faculty members are currently working with the federal Race to the Top initiative in North Carolina and a national education research center funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Engaging the tensions of individual freedom and collective responsibility and addressing both local and national issues and their histories, as well as international perspectives, scholarship in teacher education and curriculum includes school-based inquiry as well as theoretical studies of pedagogy, knowledge, and the construction of democratic communities. This inquiry flourishes when it employs a variety of research methods, qualitative and quantitative research as well as historical, literary, and philosophical studies. Students will select research courses that will complement their own intellectual skills and prepare them to address the problems they wish to study. Students in the Ph.D. program are required to maintain full-time enrollment through the completion of coursework, with the expectation that they will graduate in three to four years. Programs of study are available on the School of Education's website (http://soe.unc.edu ).Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in School Psychology The goal of the UNC-Chapel Hill doctoral School Psychology program is to prepare school psychologists as scientist-practitioners to assume leadership positions in academic, research, and applied settings (e.g., schools, clinics and hospitals). To this end students study both broad and general knowledge in psychology, obtain knowledge, skills, and competencies specic to a professional psychologist, and participate in a wide variety of supervised clinical and research activities designed to prepare them for these positions. The UNC doctoral program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (http:// www.apa.org) and through this accreditation has approval by the National Association of School Psychologists (http://www.nasponline.org). Applicants to the program should have an undergraduate degree in psychology or human development, or a master's or specialist degree in an area of psychology, education, or related discipline. The program emphasizes a prevention/intervention approach to enhancing the academic and social/emotional competencies of children and youth. It also emphasizes an ecological, systems perspective, recognizing that children and youth reside within increasingly complex situations, including their families, neighborhoods, communities, and school. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of the school system is emphasized and students develop the skills and understanding necessary to communicate with other school professionals as well as parents and community agencies as part of a multidisciplinary team. Finally, intervention research and implementation science are the used as the framework from which psychologists can help manage the research to practice gap and learn to successfully promote evidence-based practices. Students are expected to develop expertise in assessment, intervention, prevention, consultation, evaluation, and research, gaining increasingly advanced knowledge and skills as they progress through the program. Within the educational setting, school psychologists serve numerous clients including pupils, teachers, supporting educational personnel, and parents. In community and clinical settings students gain experience providing services to high needs populations of children, youth and families. Students take internships in school, clinic and hospital settings in North Carolina and around the nation and most participate in the APPIC process. Completion of the program leads to eligibility for licensure from the State Department of Public Instruction (http://www.ncpublicschools.org/licensure/) as a Level III School Psychologist in North 22 | Rev 071218 Carolina and qualies one for such certication in most other states. Also, graduates are eligible for licensing by the North Carolina State Psychology Board.

We encourage our graduate students to discover a particular eld, learn its histories, and dene its problems. Through coursework, independent reading, and research, and with the support of an academic advisor, students develop a major eld of study, as well as a focus of interest that often takes shape within or adjacent to the major eld of study. See Programs for more information on these areas of study. Admissions Requirements Application for admission must be made by The Graduate School's electronic application process. These also serve as applications for fellowships and assistantships if the applicant marks the appropriate statement on the form. Applicants for advanced degrees must have completed an undergraduate degree, customarily with a major in English, comparative literature, a foreign literature, area studies, or related eld, at the time of enrollment. To be reviewed for admission by the department's graduate advisory committee, applications must be supported by Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, at least three letters of recommendation, and ofcial transcripts showing courses, grades, and degrees awarded. A writing sample and a personal statement also should be submitted. Those students applying to the Ph.D. program who wish to focus on comparative literature should also submit (by email as an mp3 or mp4 le) a three- to ve-minute recorded sample of the student reading a selection of text in his or her second language beyond English. This recorded sample should be sent to the attention of the graduate student services manager, whose email can be found on the department's web page. Students who have already completed an M.A. degree in English, comparative literature, a foreign language literature, or comparative literature at another institution may petition the relevant director of graduate studies for a reduction of up to nine credits (three courses) from their UNC-Chapel Hill requirements. More information about the department can be obtained via its website (http:// englishcomplit.unc.edu ). Fellowships and Assistantships Financial support for graduate students is described in the Admissions and Financial Information section of the Graduate Catalog. All applicants to the Department of English and Comparative Literature are eligible to compete for University fellowships and assistantships. In addition, the department awards two types of assistantships-research assistantships and teaching fellowships. Neither is usually available in the summer. Research assistants are assigned to faculty members to help with research projects. Teaching fellows have full instructional responsibility for sections of beginning composition or, in the case of some comparative literature students, foreign language courses. Graduate students in the third year of the English Ph.D. program who also have taught at least four sections of composition become eligible for teaching literature courses. Non-native speakers are not considered for teaching fellowships until they have been enrolled in the Ph.D.program for at least a year. Teaching fellows earn an annual stipend; they are trained and supervised by the directors of composition and undergraduate studies, and they are subject to student and faculty evaluation. Library and Research Facilities The library system at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is ranked among the top 20 research libraries in the United States. It has excellent holdings for the study of English philology and British and American literature, including the Southern Historical Collection (containing manuscripts, letters, and diaries) and the Hanes Collection of Incunabula. Through cooperative arrangements, university libraries in the Triangle area are open to graduate students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature The English and comparative literature program offers a course of study leading to a doctor of philosophy degree, with potential specializations in a range of areas. We encourage our graduate students to discover a particular eld, learn its histories, and dene its problems. Through coursework, independent reading, and research, and with the support of an academic advisor, students develop a major eld of study, as well as a focus of interest that often takes shape within or adjacent to the major eld of study. The student's organization of the eld and focus should to be rigorous enough to situate the student within a discipline, tradition, or area, and supple enough to accommodate his or her specic interests, questions, and predilections. Subject to the approval of the academic advisor and the director of graduate studies, the eld and focus will form the basis of the Ph.D. examination (written exams on each eld and an oral exam on both thereafter). One's focus can be dened in many different ways. It can be characterized in terms of a genre, such as drama, lyric, the novel, lm, literary criticism, or theory; or in terms of a particular period. For doctoral students focusing on English literature, suggested elds include: Medieval literature Renaissance literature 18th-Century British literature Romanticism Victorian literature 19th-Century American literature 20th-Century American literature Critical theory Digital humanities Medicine and literature Multi-ethnic American literature Cultural studies Rhetoric and composition Film studies, among many others A partial list of well-recognized foci for both English and comparative literature includes Philosophy and literature History of science/medicine/technology/psychology Visual culture/art history (including photography, et al.) Cinema/lm studiesUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 299 Sexuality studies/gender studies/queer theory Anthropology and literature Religion and literature Politics and/or social thought Theater/spectacle/performance theory Poetics/literary criticism Literary and/or cultural theory For those concentrating on comparative literature, the focus will always cross linguistic boundaries from the student's primary into the secondary language(s) and will complement the broader, more diachronic coverage in the primary geo-cultural tradition. Comparative literature at UNC-Chapel Hill boasts particularly strong resources in medieval and early modern literature, comparative romanticisms, visual culture and global cinema, and Romance language studies. Comparative literature draws together a number of core faculty and many more afliated faculty from across the University and strives to balance a belief in the value of a shared critical language with the exigencies of working in particular national languages, locations, literatures, and media. The comparative literature eld maps out a general eld of study within a primary geo-cultural literary tradition and over a broad chronological period. The phrase \"geo-cultural literary tradition\" is intended to describe what in some cases might be called a national literature tradition, but clearly not in all cases. Students may choose from, but are not limited to, such elds as African and/or African Diaspora literatures American literatures-either United States or North American and/or Central American and/or South American Caribbean literatures (in French, English, Spanish, and other languages) Classical literatures East Asian literatures English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh/\"British\" literatures French and/or Francophone literatures literatures Middle Eastern/Arabic/Islamic literatures Postcolonial literatures-New World (Canadian/Caribbean), or South Asian, or Pacic Rim, etc. Russian and/or Slavic literatures South Asian literatures Spanish/Iberian literatures Examples of periods would include Classical (Greek, Roman, Late Antiquity/Early Christian) Medieval (or premodern Islam/Asian studies) Renaissance/Early Modern (usually up to 1700 in Northern Europe) Neoclassical/18th Century/Enlightenment/\"Age of Empire\" Early Transatlantic/Colonial Americas (roughly 1450-1750, or a portion thereof) Enlightenment/Romanticism (roughly 1750-1840) Nineteenth CenturyModernism (late 19th and early-to-mid 20th Century) Contemporary (1945 to the present) For the doctor of philosophy degree in English and comparative literature, students must fulll the following course requirements: a pedagogy course and an introduction to graduate study. Students following a comparative literature track are also required to complete CMPL 841: History of Literary Criticism. In addition to coursework, a candidate for the Ph.D. must pass two written examinations and an oral defense of the examinations administered by the department, for which the student prepares by working closely with a faculty committee a year in advance. Doctoral candidates focusing on English literature must also demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language. Doctoral candidates focusing on comparative literature must demonstrate expert-level prociency in two foreign languages (one of which must be demonstrated at the time of application). The program culminates with the candidate writing a dissertation (and registering for at least three semester hours of ENGL 994 ) and successfully defending it in an oral examination. Students must also satisfy residence credit requirements set by The Graduate School. The department strongly recommends that candidates for the Ph.D. have supervised classroom teaching experience before receiving the degree. Such experience, when it can be offered, is considered as fullling a requirement for the degree. M.A. in English with a Concentration in Literature, Medicine, and Culture The M.A. in English's concentration in literature, medicine, and culture (http://hhive.unc.edu/litmedcult/) works closely with the Department of Anthropology (http://anthropology.unc.edu/graduate-program/) and the Department of Social Medicine (http://www.med.unc.edu/ socialmed/ ). Students enrolled in the concentration are expected to participate in interdisciplinary coursework and research projects with faculty from across the University. Faculty in the literature, medicine, and culture concentration come from over a dozen departments across the University, as well as the Honors Program (http:// honorscarolina.unc.edu/current-students/curriculum/interdisciplinary- minor-in-medicine-literature-and-culture/), which also offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate minor in the eld. Among the many distinctions of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is its School of Medicine (http://www.med.unc.edu/), ranked second in primary care by U.S. News & World Report. With its hospital and allied schools of Nursing (http://nursing.unc.edu/ ) and Social Work (http:// ssw.unc.edu/), the school stands only a few minutes' walk from the College of Arts and Sciences, where over a dozen departments rank among the top 25 nationally in their elds. Students benet from close proximity between top-ranked programs in the healthcare and the liberal arts. Professors Daniel R. Anderson , Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy David J.

With the participation of faculty and students from many disciplines and departments, emphasis is placed on interdisciplinary activities that explicitly consider the complexity of the environment and integrated approaches to problem identication and solution. In particular, it seeks to foster an understanding and appreciation of ecological systems, human and nonhuman, and to demonstrate the value of ecological approaches to the solution of current and future environmental problems. Current faculty come from the departments of anthropology, biology, biostatistics, city and regional planning, communication, economics, environmental sciences and engineering, geography, earth, marine and environmental sciences, public policy, and sociology. Whereas degree programs with a strong ecology component may be arranged in other departments, by combining many approaches and methods and by linking the social and natural sciences the curriculum explicitly considers the complexity of the environment and the need for integrated approaches to problem identication and solution. Using the resources of many departments, E3P provides both broad and specialized training in ecology, human ecology, and the study of environmental systems. Graduate degrees available in the program are the master of science, the master of arts, and the doctor of philosophy. Applications will be accepted from persons with varied backgrounds and goals, with the specic program of study and research tailored to the needs of the individual. Requirements for Admission For admission to E3P, an undergraduate degree is required in a natural science such as physics, chemistry, biology, bacteriology, botany, zoology, or geology; a social science such as anthropology, sociology, or economics; a mathematical area such as statistics, mathematics, or systems analysis; an engineering area; or environmental science. The deadline for a completed application in order for students to be considered for fall admission is in January. However, students must submit all program and Graduate School admission materials by December if they wish to be considered for campus fellowships and other forms of graduate appointments. Late applications will cause students to miss out on some opportunities. Detailed information is available on both the curriculum's website (http://www.cee.unc.edu) and The Graduate School's admissions website (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). Every student must gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of the eld of ecology as it is treated among various traditional disciplines. This is accomplished in two ways: rst, through the ENEC 567 and ENEC 569 course sequence; and second, through the composition of the student's advisory committee. Students are required to do their best to establish state residency in their rst year and must apply for state residency after their rst year in order to be considered for tuition remission in subsequent years.Doctor of Philosophy Each ecology Ph.D. student, in addition to taking ENEC 567 and ENEC 569 , must register for ENEC 994 at least once for three hours credit. There are no other course requirements for the Ph.D. except for those designated by the student's graduate advisory committee and as long as the student meets the credit hour requirements of The UNC Graduate School. Owing to the diversity of research methods and approaches within the eld of ecology, the curriculum has no explicit research skill course requirements for graduate degrees. The student's graduate advisory committee is responsible for seeing that the student has gained the prociencies expected of a degree candidate in the student's selected area of expertise. Master's Degrees Two ecology master's degrees are offered by the program: the master of science degree requiring independent research and a thesis, and the master of arts degree requiring a thesis question and literature research review. All master's degrees are terminal degrees at UNC-Chapel Hill. Master's students must request readmission for Ph.D. work following completion of all requirements for the master's degree. Master of Science The master of science course requirements are determined by the student's advisory committee. They must include a minimum of 30 hours of graduate credit (of which no less than 24 hours must be earned in courses, and at least three hours in research), and completion of the thesis. One semester of registration is required in ENEC 567 and ENEC 569 , and M.S. students must register for three hours of ENEC 993 . Master of Arts Requirements for the master of arts are the same as those for the master of science, except a master of arts paper is prepared (ENEC 992 ) in place of a master's thesis (ENEC 993 ).

Leslie Director of Graduate Studies and Graduate Admissions Andrew J. Yates326 Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING (GRAD) The Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering in the Gillings School of Global Public Health focuses on the interface between people and the environment. Uniquely situated in a school of public health, the department combines the physical sciences, health sciences, engineering, and policy to develop solutions to current and emerging environmental challenges, both globally and locally. This includes climate and environmental change, emerging contaminants, infectious agents and their impacts on health and equity. This multidisciplinary approach provides unique academic and research opportunities for students. WE WORK TO Understand environmental transport and transformation of chemicals and infectious agents Protect vulnerable populations from toxic exposures Mitigate the impacts of climate change on air, water, and health; and Create a healthy, sustainable, and equitable future. Our faculty bring expertise in the physical and life sciences, engineering, and policy. We work both locally and globally, in occupational and environmental settings, on issues relevant to air quality, water, health, energy, and resource management. The wide scope of departmental research is reflected in the three interdisciplinary elds of study, faculty's areas of research, and afliated labs and research institutes. The three interdisciplinary elds of study are: Air Quality and Atmospheric Processes, Human Exposure and Health Effects, and Sustainable Water Resources. Air Quality and Atmospheric Processes Atmospheric processes have a major influence on air quality, as well as on long#term global processes such as climate change. Over the past 30 years, major research contributions of our faculty and students include the generation of an experimental database used to develop and test photochemical mechanisms that contribute to air pollution; development of methods to measure and monitor airborne contaminants; and the development and application of occupational exposure models. Human Exposure and Health Effects Our faculty study the range of processes that ultimately lead to environmentally related diseases, from characterizing and quantifying human exposure to understanding the cellular, molecular and biochemical underpinnings of these diseases. Major research activities include: developing methods to measure and monitor chemical or microbial contaminants; and elucidating the genetic factors that lead to differences in disease outcomes among individuals or populations. Sustainable Water Resources Population growth and economic development continue to place increasing stress on global water resources, stresses that stem primarily from rising consumptive demands for limited supplies and increasing contamination of natural waters. Our faculty seek solutions to these challenges using a variety of computational, experimental, and eld approaches. Our research results improve engineering applications and provide substantive guidance to policymakers.Our research strengths include: Characterizing exposures to contaminants in air, water, soil, and workplaces Developing engineering and policy solutions to environmental risks Using molecular approaches to understanding diseases caused by toxic substances in the environment Overcoming environmental health challenges in developing countries Learn more (https://sph.unc.edu/envr/department-research/) Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Milestones The following list of milestones (non-course degree requirements) must be completed; view this list of standard milestone denitions (p. 29) for more information. Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also be appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https:// sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during340 Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering (GRAD) the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992) course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experience and produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance they need with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. Electives Students in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University. For information on policies and procedures, please visit the Gillings School Student Handbook (https://sph.unc.edu/students/gillings-school- student-handbook/ ) website.

Renowned faculty members provide students with training in effective research practices and methods. The department conducts innovative research and provides classroom and real-world educational interdisciplinary opportunities that emphasize the integration of substantive area knowledge and cutting-edge epidemiologic methods. It also works with students to apply their epidemiology research to a variety of health problems in North Carolina and across the world. Research resources include diverse studies of disease endpoints (cancer, cardiovascular, infectious disease, injury, and reproductive/perinatal/pediatric epidemiology) and factors and methods that impact patterns of disease and population health (environmental, occupational, pharmacoepidemiology, genetic, social, and methods). Degrees and Certicates The Department of Epidemiology offers a master's degree and a doctoral degree, and cosponsors a certicate. The master's and doctoral programs offer a body of research skills together with the opportunity to work closely with faculty on key research questions, and to share the challenge and rewards that epidemiology provides. Master of Science in Clinical Research (M.S.C.R.) The M.S.C.R. program is an interdisciplinary research degree program housed within the Department of Epidemiology in the Gillings School of Global Public Health. The program is designed for physician-scientists and others who want to develop the skills necessary for a successful career as a principal investigator and collaborator in clinical and translational research. The M.S.C.R. requires a minimum of 36 semester hours of credit and is designed as a two-year program with at least two full semesters in residence. The program may be completed on either a part-time or full-time basis. Those in the M.S.C.R. program must have a doctoral-level professional degree (M.D., Pharm.D., Ph.D., D.D.S., nurses with Ph.D., D.V.M., etc.) or extensive health professions experience (R.N.'s, P.A's). At the time of enrollment in the M.S.C.R., participants will simultaneously be residents, clinical fellows, post-doctoral fellows, or junior faculty at UNC or Duke University. We anticipate that each student will already be afliated with a \"home academic program,\" reflecting the funding source (e.g., T32 or K12 funding), training program (e.g., post-doctoral fellowship), or department. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in epidemiology prepares students for careers in research and teaching, often at a university, federal, or state agency, or private research institution. Students develop research and teaching skills in epidemiology through coursework and practice opportunities. The doctoral program includes coursework, preliminary doctoral examinations, and doctoral research. Students typically complete the doctorate in three to ve years after admission. Certicate in Field Epidemiology The Certicate in Field Epidemiology (http://sph.unc.edu/phlp/ phlp-degrees-and-certicates/certicate-in-eld-epidemiology/) is cosponsored by the Department of Epidemiology and the Public HealthLeadership Program. The program is specically designed for working practitioners and emphasizes practical, applied skills. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Please apply separately to (1) SOPHAS and (2) UNC-Chapel Hill (via the Graduate School application). Visit https://gradschool.sites.unc.edu/master-of-public-health/ for more details. If you are interested in the online M.P.H., please visit the MPH@UNC (https://onlinemph.unc.edu/ ) website and ll out an inquiry form. Milestones The following list of milestones (non-course degree requirements) must be completed; view this list of standard milestone denitions (p. 29) for more information.Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also be appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https:// sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 351 course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experience and produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance they need with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. Electives Students in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University. For information on policies and procedures, please visit the Gillings School Student Handbook (https://sph.unc.edu/students/gillings-school- student-handbook/ ) website.

The department offers admission to the fall semester only. Potential applicants seeking admission information pertaining to their specic area of specialization should visit the EXSS Graduate Program Admissions page (http://exss.unc.edu/graduate-programs/admissions/). Application Prerequisites and Requirements All areas of specialization within the Exercise and Sport Science Master of Arts program have specialization-specic prerequisite coursework and/or experiences for all applicants. Successful completion of an undergraduate statistics class is a prerequisite for all areas of specialization. All applicants must have had a statistics class, or other coursework that includes appropriate content and topics in statistical analysis. Applicants are strongly encouraged to satisfy the statistics prerequisite by having completed an undergraduate statistics class at the time of the application. Advanced Placement credit in statistics will not satisfy this prerequisite, only classes actually taken at the college level. For additional application and admissions information, see thedepartment's website (http://www.unc.edu/depts/exercise/) or The Graduate School's website (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). Assistantships The Department of Exercise and Sport Science awards incoming students teaching and research assistantships to help fund the students' education and to provide practical experiences related to their area of study. Assistantships involve one or more of the following activities: research assistant, teaching assistant for lifetime tness and physical activity courses, teaching assistant for the exercise and sport science laboratories, certied athletic trainer, or athletic department assistant. The Department of Exercise and Sport Science's graduate program offers a master of arts degree in exercise and sport science. Applicants to the program must choose between three areas of specialization: athletic training, exercise physiology, and sport administration. The minimum number of semester credit hours required by The Graduate School for the master of arts degree is 30. However, the minimum required by each area of specialization in exercise and sport science varies and typically exceeds 30 hours. Required courses are determined by the faculty in each area of specialization. In addition to course requirements and other required curricular experiences, all students in both the athletic training and exercise physiology areas of specialization must pass a written comprehensive examination on all coursework. Sport administration students must complete an approved substitute for the comprehensive exam in the form of two capstone courses. Students in all three areas of specialization must complete a research thesis, and successfully defend the thesis in a nal oral examination on the thesis. Specialization Descriptions Athletic Training The Department of Exercise and Sport Science offers a specialization in athletic training at the graduate level which has existed as a post- professional athletic training education program since 1975. The primary mission of the post-professional athletic training education program is to provide a science/practice model designed to educate and develop clinical scholars to be leaders in the eld of athletic training. The major objectives for students in the program are 1.to provide advanced experiences that improve clinical skills related to evidence-based clinical practice, and 2.to help students develop the academic skills needed to evolve clinical practice and advance the profession of athletic training. We recruit graduate students who are Board of Certication certied athletic trainers who have distinguished themselves both academically and as highly competent clinicians. We provide the means for each graduate student to gain advanced knowledge and experience in prevention, evaluation, management, and rehabilitation of sport-related injuries through a combination of didactic lecture in the classroom, supervised practical application of this knowledge in a clinical setting, and a strong science-research experience oriented toward clinical practice. All students admitted to this program serve as teaching assistants in the lifetime tness program and as athletic trainers in the Department of Athletics. A comprehensive examination on all coursework and a research thesis are required of all students. The athletic training program's website (http://exss.unc.edu/graduate- programs/specializations/athletic-training/) contains additional detailed information.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 353 Exercise Physiology The mission of the exercise physiology specialization is to prepare students to pursue research careers in exercise physiology related elds, biomedical industries, or careers in the tness/wellness industry. Biomedical and wellness careers include sport settings, hospital tness centers or clinics, academic or industry research assistants/coordinators, or biotechnology industry. Students preparing for research careers or Ph.D. programs are provided an advanced understanding of how the physiological constructs are applied to exercise and the environment, as well as knowledge of the research process. Additionally, those students are provided the opportunity to develop laboratory techniques and acquire laboratory skills. Students preparing for a career in the tness/wellness eld are provided background, testing skills, and practical experience to succeed in a variety of settings. Many exercise physiology graduate students, no matter the area of focus, have presented research at national and regional science conferences, as well as other professional meetings. Sport Administration The mission of the sport administration specialization is to integrate theory and practice to prepare graduate students for leadership positions in intercollegiate athletics. Within a two-year learning experience, the sport administration graduate student cohort, consisting of a highly select and diverse group of students from across the United States, engages in both formal coursework and intense practical experiences designed to prepare for a college sport administration career. During their rst year, students are provided challenging coursework in administration, economics/nance, legal issues, sport marketing, governance and compliance, research methods/statistical analyses, and sport facility and event management. In addition, students engage in extensive hands-on event-operations experiences with the UNC Athletic Department. During the second year, students complete a full-time, one-year internship in an administrative area within the UNC Department of Athletics, a capstone two course sequence, and a research thesis. Thirty-two hours of graduate coursework are required.The program's website (http://exss.unc.edu/ graduate-programs/specializations/sport-administration/) contains additional information. Law and Sport Administration Dual- Degree Program (J.D.-M.A.) The dual-degree program provides an opportunity for students who are interested in both law and sport administration to earn both degrees over four years of study. Students benet from a respected law curriculum, combined with a sport administration curriculum with a unique focus on intercollegiate athletics. There is a growing market in college athletics for professionals with both degrees. Graduates of the dual-degree program may work in athletic compliance and enforcement at a university, conference ofce, or national governing body such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Legal positions in athletic departments, fundraising and development, and law rms that represent colleges and conferences are also likely. To be eligible to apply for the J.D.-M.A. dual-degree program students must be currently enrolled in their second year in the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Law. Students will be responsible for paying tuition and fees separately to both the Law School and The Graduate School. The M.A. in exercise and sport science must be completed prior to or simultaneously with completion of the J.D. degree. Completion of the M.A. requires successful completion of all requiredexercise and sport science courses, a capstone two-course sequence, and a research thesis. Business and Sport Administration Dual- Degree Program (M.B.A.-M.A.) The dual-degree program provides an opportunity for students who are interested in both business administration and sport administration to earn both degrees over four years of study.

Troy Blackburn Executive Assistant Jennifer CandersUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 359 CURRICULUM IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (GRAD) The Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular Biology is an interdepartmental predoctoral training program leading to a Ph.D. degree in genetics and molecular biology. The goal of this program is to train students to be creative, sophisticated research scientists within the disciplines of genetics and molecular biology. To this end, we emphasize acquisition of a foundation of knowledge, accumulation of the laboratory skills required for implementing research objectives, development of the ability to formulate experimental approaches to solving contemporary problems in the biological sciences, and completion of an original research project. During their rst year, students enroll in graduate-level courses and participate in laboratory rotations. Subsequently, students select a faculty research advisor and establish an advisory committee. Research work is done in the laboratory facilities of the individual faculty member and is supported primarily by faculty research grants. The curriculum faculty have appointments in 14 departments in the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and the College of Arts and Sciences. The faculty represent diverse research interests that use the tools of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to address fundamental questions in the areas of cell cycle regulation, chromosome structure, development and disease models, DNA repair and recombination, genome stability, evolutionary genetics, genomics, human genetics, neurobiology, pathogens and immunity, signal transduction, transcription, gene regulation, and virology. Students are able to choose from a variety of biological systems and questions for their thesis research. Requirements for Admission for Graduate Work Applications from students with good academic records and interest in research careers in genetics and molecular biology are favorably considered. Applicants preferably have majored or minored in one of the following disciplines: genetics, biology, microbiology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, or biophysics. They usually have taken calculus and organic and physical chemistry, although these are not essential. Applicants are accepted to begin their initial studies in the fall. They must apply to the program through a unied application program known as the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP). Students apply for graduate study in the biological or biomedical sciences at UNC-Chapel Hill. Students interested in any of the BBSP research areas apply to BBSP, and those whose application portfolio places them highest on the admission list are asked to visit Chapel Hill for interviews. Students who are ultimately admitted to UNC-Chapel Hill make no formal commitment to a specic Ph.D. program. During their rst year, BBSP students are part of small, rst-year groups led by several faculty members. These groups meet regularly and provide a research community for students until they join a degree-granting program. After completing their rst year of study, students leave BBSP, join a dissertation laboratory, and matriculate into one of 15 participating Ph.D. programs. The BBSP application consists of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores (optional), transcripts of records, three letters of recommendation, and a statement of purpose, all submitted through the web-based application system of The Graduate School. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. Applications are not accepted after the deadline,usually at the end of November. (Applicants seeking a master's degree are not considered for admission.) Financial Aid Stipends for predoctoral students are available from an NIH predoctoral training grant and from the University. Tuition, student fees, and graduate student health insurance are also covered by the training grant and the University. In addition to the dissertation requirements of The Graduate School (four full semesters of credit including at least six hours of doctoral dissertation; a written preliminary examination, an oral examination, and a dissertation), students in the Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular Biology must meet the following requirements: complete four didactic courses ( GNET 621 and either GNET 631 OR GNET 632 are required; the other two may come from any appropriate combination of full-semester courses or ve-week modules, with three modules being equivalent to a full course; at least one module or course must have a quantitative, statistical, or computational focus) complete one seminar/journal club course that focuses on critical reading of the literature act as a teaching assistant for one semester participate in a student seminar series as an attendee until the end of the third year present in the student seminar series in the third and subsequent years participate in the annual retreat held jointly with the Department of Genetics and the Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology attend the weekly seminar series sponsored by the curriculum and the Department of Genetics publish at least one peer-reviewed research article as rst or co-rst author Students are required to rotate through at least three laboratories before choosing a dissertation advisor. It is strongly recommended that students attend national meetings to better understand how their research ts with progress in their eld.

The department approaches this goal by creating an environment in which exceptional Ph.D. and M.A. students can draw on the strengths of faculty and research centers to develop and sharpen their own research interests, capabilities, and programs around critical geographical problems. The graduate curriculum is designed to promote a broad sense of the geographical tradition in its evolving relationship with other sciences, social sciences, and humanities disciplines, and to provide a disciplinary and interdisciplinary platform for more specialized scientic and scholarly investigation. The program offers opportunities for graduate students with diverse backgrounds and goals to receive training in varied and integrated aspects of the discipline and to work directly with faculty members on specic research projects. Master's and doctoral degrees are offered, but the programmatic focus is on the doctoral degree. As much as possible, all programs are tailored to the needs and interests of the individual student. The student's academic advisor and committee members have prime responsibility for developing, with the student, an appropriate course sequence and research program and for providing mentoring of the student. The program aims to foster maximum flexibility for individuals while ensuring a uniformly high standard of geographical training for all graduate students. Graduate students work closely with research centers and programs related to their interests, including the Carolina Population Center, the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, the Institute for the Study of the Americas (UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University), the Center for the Study of the American South, the Carolina Center for the Study of the Middle East and Muslim Civilizations, the Southeast Regional Climate Center, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research, the Curriculum in Ecology, the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, the Curriculum in Environment and Ecology, and UNC-Chapel Hill's schools of public health and medicine. Up-to-date lists of geography faculty members and courses, along with additional information about the graduate program, faculty research projects, and other information are available on the department's website (http:// geography.unc.edu). Students build strong research, teaching, and professional skills with emphases on data analysis, project design and management, and oral and written communication that prepare them for careers at universities and in public and private sectors. A large proportion of graduate students receive nancial assistance. Sources of aid include teaching assistantships and work on sponsored research projects within the department, University-wide competitive assistantships, nonservice fellowships and merit scholarships, and externally awarded fellowships. The department occupies the top two floors of Carolina Hall and has access to extensive computational laboratories needed to fulll its research and teaching mission, with specialized facilities dedicated to spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems. A range of geographic data sets is readily available. An extensive collection of geographic books and periodicals, including an exceptionally strong collection of foreign periodicals, is held in the nearby Davis Library, while Wilson Library houses a large map collection.The Department of Geography offers advanced work leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees. Both the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees are offered, but the major emphasis of the program is on the Ph.D., even for those not yet possessing an M.A. Incoming students are roughly evenly mixed between those with and without a master's degree. Incoming graduate students are required to complete three core courses (GEOG 702 , GEOG 703 , and GEOG 704 ) presenting the foundations of geographical theory, communication, and research. Thereafter the program of study is flexible and tailored to the needs of the individual student. Students select the appropriate coursework and dissertation topic in consultation with their advisor and research committee. The Department of Geography has faculty strength in ve overlapping areas of concentration. These represent coherent foci and areas of active faculty research, not mutually exclusive categories. Indeed, many students and faculty members work on projects that span more than one area. So, while intensive training is offered in a number of diverse areas, the program is noted for its integrative and cross-cutting approaches. The department's diverse graduate students are pursuing a wide variety of research at UNC-Chapel Hill. Departmental research specializations include Biophysical Geography and Earth Systems Science. UNC-Chapel Hill geographers examine the biophysical environment as an integrated system, emphasizing the linkages and feedbacks between terrestrial and atmospheric form and function. The focus is on the interactions between the structure and composition of the earth's surface, its soils and vegetation, and the atmosphere with those processes that actively cycle energy and material through them. Culture, Society, and Space. UNC-Chapel Hill geographers investigate the intersection of space, place, landscape, and region with social and cultural processes, including issues of identity and representation, spatio- temporalities of social belonging and exclusion, and the production and circulation of value and values. This work encompasses a diversity of methodological approaches, scales, and concerns, from urban dynamics and symbolic spaces to rural landscapes, agrarian and industrial change, and social geographies of race, class, gender, health, and religion. Geographic Information and Analysis. UNC-Chapel Hill geographers apply geographic information sciences as an integrated set of spatial digital technologies to investigate biophysical and social phenomena. They use and develop tools, techniques, concepts, and data sets associated with geographic information systems, remote sensing, data visualization, global positioning systems, spatial analysis, and quantitative methods. Globalization and International Development. UNC-Chapel Hill geographers study the consequences of processes of globalization (and the anti-globalization and global justice movements they stimulate); international development and its effects on the geographies of international and local capital, labor, technology, information, goods and services; postsocialism, political economy, political geography and geopolitics, and political ecology. Nature-Society Studies and Human-Environment Interactions. Drawing on analytical and theoretical perspectives from ecology, socioecological systems, political ecology, science studies, and cultural studies, UNC- Chapel Hill geographers investigate the social contexts, drivers, and consequences of environmental change and struggles over land use and resources.366 Department of Geography (GRAD) Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

The Carolina-Duke graduate program in German studies is a fully merged graduate program that draws on one of the largest German studies faculties in the country, as well as on the considerable library holdings of each institution. Students apply to a single program and graduate with a diploma bearing the names of both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Carolina-Duke Graduate Program in German offers students a combination of disciplinary rigor and interdisciplinary flexibility that recognizes the fundamental interrelation of all the cultural expressions of societies where the German language is spoken. Taking full advantage of the intellectual, educational, and cultural resources of two great universities, the program offers an attractive combination of individual attention in small classes and a close connection to the broader communities of literature, cultural studies, and German studies at Duke University and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The core German studies faculty (at a current number of 19, one of the largest in North American German studies), represents all branches of research in the eld, including medieval studies, gender and sexuality studies, literary theory and poetics, European intellectual history, modernism, realism, German-Jewish studies, Holocaust studies, politics and culture in the 20th century, lm and media studies, science studies, Afro-German and Turkish-German culture, and contemporary society. This ensures that all major aspects of German literary, cinematic, and cultural history, from medieval manuscripts to contemporary cinema, are covered by experts in the eld. Faculty engage in innovative, interdisciplinary teaching and research projects involving other departments and programs and support close intellectual ties with major German universities. Students take courses full time in their rst year of study; in subsequent years they acquire pedagogical training and teaching experience at both a private (Duke University) and a public (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) university. Multiple program options are available to students, from the study of historical periods and genres (medieval to contemporary) to literary criticism and theory. Interdisciplinary work is strongly encouraged. Admission is competitive and limited to no more than seven students a year. Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are committed to offering six consecutive years of full funding, including tuition, to students in good standing in the program. Note: The previous Ph.D. programs in German studies at Duke University and in Germanic languages at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill no longer admit new students.Admissions Requirements We seek applicants with extraordinary academic records and intellectual curiosity, and we welcome applicants of any nationality, from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. A bachelor's degree or the international equivalent is required, generally in German studies or a related eld. All applications are routed through The Graduate School at UNC-Chapel Hill in a single admissions process that ensures that incoming students matriculate fully at both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Duke University. Please read UNC's admissions instructions (http://gradschool.unc.edu/ admissions/ ) for detailed information about the application process and requirements. Additional information is available on the Carolina- Duke website (http://carolina-duke-grad.german.duke.edu/apply/how- apply/ ). Questions regarding translation issues and foreign degrees and transcripts should be directed to gsll@unc.edu . Application Deadline Applicants are strongly encouraged to complete their applications by early December and must meet all posted deadlines (http:// gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). Teaching Teacher training is a central component of the Carolina-Duke Graduate Program in German Studies. Both departments provide rigorous training in foreign language teaching, which includes an introduction to the interdisciplinary elds of applied linguistics and second-language acquisition. Teaching assistantships are normally available to students in their second through fth years of study who continue to make satisfactory progress towards the completion of their degree and remain in good standing in the program. It is crucial that teaching assistants (TAs) have highly advanced German language skills. During their rst year, students' language prociency in German will be evaluated. Only students who achieve a level of \"Superior\" (C1 according to ACTFL guidelines (http://www.actfl.org/i4a/ pages/?pageid=4236 )) will be asked to teach in the German language program. Students who do not possess the required prociency in German will be expected to obtain this prociency as soon as possible. Beginning TAs generally teach rst-year German and take the foreign language pedagogy course concurrently with their rst semester of teaching. In later semesters graduate students often teach second-year German and occasionally more advanced undergraduate courses as well (German culture and society, advanced composition, introduction to German literature). In addition, students may serve as discussion leaders in larger lecture courses or serve as research assistants. Study and Research Abroad Students are strongly encouraged to study and conduct research abroad as an integral part of their graduate work. Both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have strong, long-standing partnerships with German universities. Duke offers student exchanges with the Free University of Berlin and the University of Potsdam, programs in which graduate students in German studies regularly participate. Furthermore, select graduate students will be invited to serve as mentors, instructors, and/or program assistants in the undergraduate Duke study abroad summer program in Berlin.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 375 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has partnerships with German universities, including exchanges with the University of T\u00fcbingen and the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and a new exchange with the University of Z\u00fcrich. Further, graduate students in German at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have a strong track record for successful DAAD and Fulbright fellowships for study abroad. Course of Study 1.Five core courses: Foreign Language Pedagogy, Theories, and Practices; Foundations in German Studies, 1000 to 1750; Foundations in German Studies, 1750 to 1900; Foundations in German Studies, 1900 to the Present; and German Linguistics or History of the German language. Incoming students who have satisfactorily completed equivalent graduate courses may be exempted by the directors of graduate studies and graduate advising from one or more of the required courses. 2.Students are required to take two courses outside the German studies program that complement the students' areas of interest in an interdisciplinary fashion. In their rst semester students take all their coursework in the program. In subsequent semesters, students may take one course per semester outside the program. All courses taken outside the program must be approved by the directors of graduate study. 3.A total of 16 courses (including those enumerated above), two of which must be credit for work on the dissertation. 4.Demonstration of advanced reading knowledge of an additional foreign language (a language besides English and German) that is appropriate to the student's areas of research interest. This may be done at any point during the student's studies, but the requirement must be satised prior to the time that the doctoral thesis is submitted for the nal defense. 5.A writing prociency review, normally by the end of the second year. 6.A Ph.D. preliminary exam, normally by the end of the third year. 7.A dissertation chapter and prospectus review defense, normally by the end of the fourth year. 8.An oral dissertation defense, normally by the end of the fth year. In addition, students are strongly encouraged to attend the program's monthly \"works-in-progress\" seminar, at which faculty, advanced graduate students, and guests present their current research. Students are also strongly encouraged to audit one graduate course per semester once they have completed their required coursework during terms in which they are in residence. Qualifying Requirements 1.Satisfactory performance in all coursework. 2.Satisfactory performance in the teaching program. 3.Demonstration of prociency in German, including all four competencies (reading, writing, speaking, and listening), at a level of \"Superior\" (C1 according to ACTFL guidelines (http://www.actfl.org/ i4a/pages/?pageid=4236 )), usually by the time the student enters the program or by the end of the rst year of study. 4.Demonstration of reading knowledge in a second foreign language relevant to the student's research, as approved by the directors of graduate studies. 5.All students will submit an annual plan of study report each year prior to completion of their preliminary exam. Doing so encouragesstudents to reflect in broad terms on their current intellectual interests and possible future trajectories for these interests. Visit the Annual Plan of Study Report (http://carolina-duke- grad.german.duke.edu/annual-plan-study-report/) web page for more information. 6.Successful completion of the writing prociency review, normally by the end of the second year of study. Normally, students will submit a revision of a paper originally written for one of their courses. 7.Completion of the preliminary examination with a grade of \"pass.\" The exam is normally taken in the third year of study. 8.Participation in a bi-weekly dissertation colloquium once the student has successfully passed the preliminary examination, for each semester the student is in residence. Participants submit an abstract of their project at the beginning of each semester and share chapters of their work in progress. 9.Successful completion of a dissertation chapter review, usually by the end of the fourth year of study.

Dissertation research Carolina-Duke Courses Students will enroll in courses both at Carolina and at Duke. In addition to the UNC German courses listed in this catalog, students should also look at the Duke graduate German courses (https://german.duke.edu/ courses/ ). Courses outside German Studies Students will normally take at least two courses outside the German studies program. They are encouraged to take more as relevant to their interests and research. All Carolina-Duke graduate students should familiarize themselves with Duke University's Responsible Conduct of Research (http:// gradschool.duke.edu/academics/degree_reqs/rcr/) (RCR) requirements. International Carolina-Duke graduate students should familiarize themselves with the English Language Prociency (http:// gradschool.duke.edu/academics/degree_reqs/eis.php) requirements. Transfer Credit Students coming in with an M.A. in German may, at the discretion of the directors of graduate studies, receive credit for coursework completed at their previous institution. A maximum of four courses can be remitted, and decisions about credit for prior coursework will be made at the end of the students' rst year in the Carolina-Duke graduate program.376 Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures (GRAD) Reviews, Examinations, Dissertation The Annual Plan of Study Report All students are required to prepare and submit to the directors of graduate studies an updated plan of study form by January 31 of years one through three. Once the preliminary exam has been taken, students prepare and submit instead an abstract of their dissertation project. The Writing Prociency Review For the writing prociency review-an hour-long oral review that takes place in the second year of study-students submit a scholarly paper, normally written in English and about 30 pages in length, which expands and reworks a paper written for one of their courses. The director of graduate studies sets up a committee of three faculty members, including the student's primary advisor, in consultation with the student. Ph.D. Committee For the purpose of the preliminary examination and the dissertation chapter review, the Ph.D. committee consists of four faculty members, including the faculty advisor, selected by the student in consultation with the faculty advisor and the director of graduate studies. A fth faculty member will be added to the committee for the dissertation defense. Typically, faculty members from the preliminary exam will also serve on the dissertation review and dissertation defense committees. At least one faculty member must come from each university department, and the majority of the committee must consist of Carolina-Duke German faculty members. The Preliminary Examination The purpose of the preliminary exam is to ensure competency in a teaching eld and to establish a comprehensive intellectual framework for the dissertation project. The exam should be designed so that students approach their teaching interests and dissertation research in such a way as to engage a set of broad questions that will speak to scholars both within and outside the eld of German studies. The exam centers on two equally weighted lists, one of which generally concerns itself with a broadly dened literary eld, such as a recognized period, movement, or genre across several periods. The other list focuses on a more specic topic such as represents the student's projected area of doctoral research, it being understood that by \"area\" of doctoral research something broader is envisioned than a list of texts immediately pertinent to the \"topic\" of the dissertation. In keeping with the prevalent conception of German studies, at least one of the exam lists ought to have a substantive interdisciplinary component; this might include integrating a particular historical span of literary production with an adjacent and related area, such as visual culture, music, religion, cultural anthropology, literary or critical theory, media studies, philosophy, linguistics, or political theory. The preliminary examination has both a written and an oral component. The written portion of the exam is a take-home, open-book exam, consisting of two substantial questions, one on each eld, given every other day. Students are given 48 hours per question and are expected to write for each question an original essay of roughly 15 pages on the assigned topic. Students are encouraged to make use of all available technology and of any materials, resources, databases, etc., they would normally consult while doing research. The oral portion of the exam, with questions from all examiners, lasts about 90 minutes and generally takes place no more than two weeks after the written exam.Dissertation Overview A successful German studies Ph.D. dissertation is expected to be a mature and competent piece of writing, embodying the results of signicant and original research, and it must constitute a signicant contribution to the eld of German studies. Following the preliminary exam in their third year of study, students are generally expected to complete their dissertation chapter review during their fourth year of study and to defend their dissertation by the end of the fth year. Once a student has begun work on the dissertation, the Annual Plan of Study requirement is replaced by a requirement that the student produce a dissertation abstract. This abstract is to be updated on an annual basis and, once it has been approved by the dissertation advisor, turned in by the deadline for the Annual Plan of Study. Dissertation Chapter and Prospectus Review In consultation with their advisor, students develop a dissertation project. Students submit to the dissertation review committee a chapter of 30 to 45 pages, a seven-to-ten page overview of the dissertation, and a comprehensive bibliography. The oral review lasts approximately 90 minutes. Dissertation Defense When the student and the primary advisor are satised that a defensible draft is complete, they will offer it to the members of the committee for nal approval and set a date for the nal examination (also known as the dissertation defense). The defense will usually be held as soon after submission of the nal draft as is practical and in keeping with University and Graduate School requirements. Following each UNC faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Our program allows ample choice to students in designing academic programs to t particular interests and needs while providing them with rigorous training in African history, ancient history, Asian history, European history, global history, Latin American history, military history, Russian and East European history, United States history, and the history of women and gender. Degree requirements and departmental culture encourage comparative and interdisciplinary study. The program promotes close mentoring relationships with faculty and sustains a lively intellectual community among the graduate students. Extensive information about the graduate program in history (https:// history.unc.edu/graduate-program/) is available online. Please use this site to supplement the brief summary included in the Graduate Catalog. Admission The department considers applications from those holding undergraduate degrees and those who have obtained M.A. degrees elsewhere. Students admitted to the department with an M.A. from another university will be reviewed by the faculty at the time of entry into the program to determine whether they should take a second M.A. degree here or proceed directly to the Ph.D. training. Preference in admission is given to students who intend to proceed to doctoral work, either directly or after completion of the M.A. degree. Fellowships and Assistantships The department funds most of its students through teaching assistantships or fellowships and also offers research grants and dissertation fellowships. In addition, The Graduate School awards fellowships to both entering students and students in the later phases of their doctoral training. Libraries and Research Opportunities The Davis and Wilson libraries have many collections of great value, and the University itself is conveniently situated close to a number of other research centers, particularly the Duke University Library and the North Carolina State Department of Archives and History (https:// www.ncdcr.gov/about/ofce-archives-and-history/). The library houses many outstanding special collections, including the William Henry Hoyt Collection on revolutionary France and the Peabody Collection on international law and diplomacy. Especially notable are the Southern Historical Collection (one of the most important manuscript collections on the subject), and the North Carolina Collection (a repository of books, magazines, pamphlets, and newspapers published in or about North Carolina). The Southern Oral History Program and the Center for the Study of the American South further enhance research and training in the history of our region. The University Center for Global Initiatives, the Center for European Studies; the Institute for the Study of the Americas; the Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies; the Center for Jewish Studies; the Carolina Center for Middle East and Muslim Civilizations; the Department of Asian Studies; and various Triangle Area research and study groups sponsor fellowships, seminars, speakers, and other opportunities in their respective areas. The Department of History participates in theinterdisciplinary Medieval and Early Modern Studies Program (MEMs), which offers fellowships and research grants. MEMs places special emphasis upon viewing the premodern world from a global perspective. The Ancient World Mapping Center (http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/) forms part of the Department of History, and there is no other unit worldwide that matches its mission of promoting cartography and geographic information science within ancient studies. In addition, a variety of workshops regularly bring together faculty and graduate students who share interest in particular historical topics or approaches. The M.A. Program The courses required for the M.A. degree usually include an introduction to historical thought ( HIST 700 ) and an introductory seminar on research (HIST 900 ), to be taken in the rst year of study; a two-semester reading colloquium or its equivalent in the student's major eld; one additional seminar (900-level course); three hours of thesis credit (HIST 993 ); and four other courses, of which as many as three may be taken in elds other than that in which the student is concentrating or even in other disciplines. M.A. candidates must also pass a reading-knowledge examination in an appropriate foreign language, prepare a thesis based on original research, and pass an oral examination on the thesis. Students entering in fall 2010 and afterwards are expected to complete the M.A. after three semesters in residence. The Ph.D. Program Satisfactory completion of the M.A. does not automatically entitle a student to continue at the doctoral level. After the M.A. oral examination, the student's committee reaches a formal written decision about whether he or she should continue toward the Ph.D. All courses taken at UNC-Chapel Hill for the M.A. (except HIST 993 ) may be credited toward the doctoral program. If The Graduate School approves for transfer credit up to six hours of graduate courses taken elsewhere, these may be credited as well. Candidates for the Ph.D. complete the following minimum course program (in addition to the requirements for the M.A.): a research seminar, two courses in a second eld of study, research design (HIST 905 ), and dissertation credit (HIST 994 ). A reading knowledge of two foreign languages or advanced prociency in one is required for the Ph.D. degree. Each doctoral student must pass written comprehensive examinations in the major eld as well as an oral examination that focuses on the dissertation. The nal requirements for the Ph.D. are a dissertation and an oral examination on it. The department expects doctoral students to proceed efciently with their work. For those who enter the program in fall 2010 and afterwards and who are pursuing both the M.A. and the Ph.D., all coursework and the comprehensive written and oral examinations must be completed by the end of the sixth semester. For those who enter the program with an acceptable M.A. from another institution, A.B.D. (all but dissertation) status must be achieved within four semesters. The entire degree program must be completed within a period of eight years.

Lindsay450 Human Movement Science Curriculum (GRAD) HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE CURRICULUM (GRAD) The Department of Health Sciences in the School of Medicine offers an interdisciplinary program of study in human movement science leading to the doctor of philosophy degree. The intent of this program is to develop research and teaching scholars who are capable of producing and disseminating new knowledge in the eld of human movement science. The doctoral program in human movement science is offered through the cooperative effort of the Division of Physical Therapy (UNC School of Medicine) and the Department of Exercise and Sport Science (College of Arts and Sciences). This program is designed to provide students an opportunity for doctoral study in areas that will increase our knowledge of human movement. The program focuses on contributing to the scientic basis of human movement and developing theory and methods for maintaining health, preventing disability, and improving movement ability. Focusing on normal movement and movement disability requires a special emphasis in research and education that draws upon yet differs from the focus of related sciences. Students of varied academic disciplines are accepted into the program. Students in our program study across several areas of interest in human movement: Biomechanics Exercise physiology Injury prevention Neuromuscular control and motor learning Rehabilitation (musculoskeletal, neurological) Note: The Division of Physical Therapy retired the M.S. in human movement science degree, so applicants are no longer being accepted for the M.S. as a terminal degree. Research Facilities Several research facilities are available for students in the departments participating in the program. These include the Recovery of Gait and Neurorehabilitation (ReGaiN) and Cassidy Plasticity Laboratories in the Division of Physical Therapy, and the Applied Physiology, Integrative Exercise Oncology Lab, MOTION Science Institute, STAR Heel Laboratory, and the Matthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science. These laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art instruments for measuring a range of human movement and performance through behavioral, physiological, biomechanical, cognitive, sensory, and computer modeling instrumentation. Admission Student selection is based primarily on academic records and research experience. Requirements include the following: At least one core HMSC faculty member has agreed that he/she may serve as the applicant's mentor if the applicant is admitted to the program. This is not a guarantee of admission, but an indication that the faculty member has endorsed the application. A master's degree in a eld related to human movement (e.g., physical therapy, exercise science, athletic training, biomedical engineering, anatomy, etc.) is preferred. In rare circumstances, qualied candidates with a bachelor's degree will be considered for admission.A grade point average of 3.0 or better in the last two years of the student's most recent degree program. A typical student who is admitted has a 3.4 GPA or better. Coursework in the following areas, completed within the past ve years, is a prerequisite for admission. Completion of coursework in these areas longer than ve years ago may require completion of an admissions examination. Statistics Human anatomy Human physiology AND at least one of the following courses: Physics Biomechanics Chemistry Psychology Exercise physiology Motor learning/motor control/ neuromuscular control Neuroanatomy Three letters of academic recommendation Curriculum vitae Written statement of the academic/career goals and research interests Name of the faculty member who has agreed to mentor the applicant. (Applicants should contact a faculty member in their area of interest prior to beginning the application process.) The curriculum core requirements allow flexibility in designing programs of study to meet the student's interests. Each student's program of study is developed under the guidance of his or her advisor and committee, and includes three major components: 1. Human Movement Science (16 credit hours) 6 credits of Human Movement Science core courses HMSC 700 , HMSC 701 , and HMSC 702 6 credits of advanced Human Movement Science content 4 credits of doctoral seminar in Human Movement Science (IHMS 870 ) 2.

Contact Information Human Movement Science Curriculum Visit Program Website (http://hmsc.unc.edu ) Director Erik Wikstrom wikstrom@unc.edu Associate Director Mike Lewek mlewek@med.unc.edu454 School of Information and Library Science (GRAD) SCHOOL OF INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SCIENCE (GRAD) The programs of the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) are designed to prepare students for professional employment and advanced study in the elds of information and library science. The school offers graduate instruction leading to the degrees of master of science in information science (M.S.I.S.), master of science in library science (M.S.L.S.), professional science master's degrees (P.S.M.) in digital curation and biomedical and health informatics, doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in information and library science, and a doctor of philosophy (Ph.D) in health informatics. The school also offers an undergraduate major in information science (B.S.I.S.) and an undergraduate minor in information systems. Within these degree programs, students complete a core set of courses and build their own specialized program of studies on this foundation. The goal of the M.S.I.S. program is to enable students to contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of information systems and networks; lead the development of new technologies and new applications relating to the delivery of information; and demonstrate a theoretical knowledge of information science, including the theory of information storage and retrieval, systems science, and social, political, and ethical implications of information systems. With an M.S.I.S. degree, students nd jobs in areas that include (among others) information system analysis design, development, and support; database design and administration; user experience design (including interface design and usability testing); website design and management; social media; information resource and knowledge management; information security; and competitive intelligence. The goal of the M.S.L.S. program is to help students become leaders in the dynamic world of libraries and information organizations as they change to address 1) the needs of communities that are becoming more diverse, 2) an increasing multiplicity of information formats and technologies, and 3) a global perspective toward knowledge barriers and access. Students should be procient in the theories and practices used in libraries, archives, and other cultural institutions, including effective communication across differing ethical, cultural, political, social, and emotional perspectives. Typical job titles for graduates include library director, archives manager, records manager, digital librarian, documents librarian, cataloger, public and reference services librarian, school librarian, acquisitions and collection manager, youth librarian, community engagement/outreach librarian, database administrator, special collections librarian, academic library subject specialist, and systems librarian. The 48 credit hours of coursework is selected, in consultation with the student's faculty advisor, from the information and library science curriculum or, as appropriate, from related subject elds in other schools and departments of the University or at neighboring universities. A capstone course, INLS 992, offers students the opportunity to write a research paper or complete a group practicum project. A theme within the curriculum for both master's degrees is evidence-based practice, which requires students to interpret and apply existing research to theirprofessional situations, as well as to design and conduct their own research where necessary data is not otherwise available. Graduate certicates within either the M.S.L.S. or the M.S.I.S. are available in the areas of: applied data science, biomedical imaging science, bioinformatics, computational linguistics, digital curation, digital humanities, and public health informatics. A program leading to a certicate as a school library media coordinator is also available as part of the M.S.L.S. The School of Information and Library Science participates in several dual or cooperative degree programs. These include dual-degree programs with the Department of Health Policy and Management, Gillings School of Global Public Health, which combines the master of health administration (M.H.A.) or the masters of science in public health (MSPH) degree with either the M.S.L.S. or M.S.I.S. the Department of Art, which combines the master of arts in art history (M.A.) with either the M.S.I.S. or M.S.L.S. degree the School of Government, which combines the master of public administration (M.P.A.) with either the M.S.I.S. or M.S.L.S. degree the School of Law, which combines the juris doctor (J.D.) degree with either the M.S.L.S. or the M.S.I.S degree A cooperative program allows students to combine the master of arts (M.A.) in public history at North Carolina State University with either the M.S.L.S. or the M.S.I.S. Participation in any dual-degree program requires separate admission to both degree programs. A fast track B.S.I.S to M.S.I.S or M.S.L.S degree A fast track B.S. in Environmental Science or B.A. in Environmental Studies to M.S.I.S The basic requirement for admission to the master's programs is a bachelor's degree from a recognized college or university. The student's undergraduate work should demonstrate a strong foundation in liberal arts and sciences. Each master's student is expected to enter the program with a foundation in the basic technological tools (e.g., HTML, CSS, databases) employed in the eld. Applicants must meet the requirements for The Graduate School. For details about the entrance requirements and the curriculum for the master's programs, see the program descriptions available on the school's website (http:// sils.unc.edu/programs/). The professional science master's (P.S.M.) in biomedical and health informatics is an interdisciplinary program that prepares the next generation of health informatics leaders. The degree consists of 35 credits and requires about 1.5 academic years (17 months) of full- time study or 2(+) years of part-time study to complete. There are two tracks: public health informatics and clinical informatics. Students in each program track complete a practicum consisting of an internship in a health care, public health, health research, or health information technology organization that includes a project synthesizing knowledge gleaned from the entire program curriculum. The professional science master's (P.S.M.) in digital curation is a 30-credit-hour, online degree that focuses on digital curation. A comprehensive, project-oriented curriculum allows students to develop the core skills, knowledge, and competencies for ensuring the longevity, authenticity, discoverability, and usability of digital assets. The doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in health informatics is a 55-credit, interdisciplinary program that emphasizes advanced databaseUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 455 management, analytics methods and evaluation, and human-computer interactions in health informatics. The doctor of philosophy in information and library science (Ph.D.) is a research degree. Thus, the purpose of the doctoral program in SILS is to educate scholars who are capable of addressing problems of scholarly consequence in the eld of information and library science. Each student will develop a program of studies that is tailored to individual interests and career goals. Required classes include a one semester seminar on research issues and questions (INLS 881) and completion of a course in statistics. Additional courses in research methods and theory development are recommended, as are research experience and substantive content courses that are related to a student's research interests. There are also opportunities for students to develop teaching skills through both coursework and teaching experience.

Contact Information School of Information and Library Science Visit Program Website (http://sils.unc.edu ) Dean Gary Marchionini Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Brian Sturm sturm@ils.unc.edu468 Department of Linguistics (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS (GRAD) The Department of Linguistics offers graduate work leading to the degree of master of arts in linguistics, and a concentration in Hispanic linguistics as part of a dual-degree program in Hispanic linguistics with a Ph.D. in Romance studies. The Department of Linguistics also co-sponsors a graduate certicate in computational linguistics, jointly administered by the Department of Computer Science and the School of Information and Library Science. M.A. in Linguistics Degree candidates for the regular M.A. in linguistics must demonstrate both a basic knowledge of the eld of linguistics as a whole and the ability to do independent study in a chosen specialty. Basic knowledge of linguistics is acquired by taking certain required courses; knowledge of a specialty is gained through elective courses as well as by writing a thesis. The elective courses are expected to form a coherent program in a subeld of linguistics (e.g., phonology, syntax, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, language acquisition) or in the application of linguistics to a closely related discipline (e.g., anthropology, the study of a particular language or language family). To this end, each student, after consultation with the director of graduate studies, will by the end of the second semester of residence choose a permanent advisor, who will supervise the student's program of study. Information on applying to the linguistics M.A. program, as well as a detailed description of program requirements, can be found on the Linguistics Department Web site (https://linguistics.unc.edu/graduate- program/ma-linguistics/). M.A. in Linguistics with Concentration in Hispanic Linguistics This dual degree program prepares students with knowledge of Spanish to pursue advanced graduate study in the linguistic analysis of Spanish and related languages, e.g. Portuguese or indigenous languages spoken in proximity to Spanish (e.g. Maya, Guarani, Basque). Students in this program complete an M.A. in linguistics before proceeding to the Ph.D. program in Romance studies, both with concentration in Hispanic linguistics. More information can be found on the program Web site (http://hispaniclinguisticsgraduatestudies.web.unc.edu/ ). Graduate Certicate in Computational Linguistics This certicate provides training in linguistic analysis, machine learning, text/data mining, natural language processing and generation, and related areas to prepare students for careers in the tech industry or academia. The program is open to currently enrolled graduate students in linguistics, computer science, information and library science, and related elds such as communication, education, speech and hearing sciences, and others. The program is also open to non-degree-seeking students. More information can be found on the program Web site (https://linguistics.unc.edu/graduate-program/computational-linguistics- certicate/).Degree programs must satisfy the general requirements of The Graduate School. In addition, the student must fulll the following curriculum requirements for the master of arts degree: Code Title Hours Course Requirements LING 520 Linguistic Phonetics3 LING 523 Phonological Theory I 3 LING 530 Syntactic Theory I 3 One course from among: 3 LING 525 Introduction to Historical and Comparative Linguistics LING 528 Language Acquisition I LING 537 Semantic Theory I Five elective courses in linguistics or related areas, as approved by the student's academic advisor15 Thesis credit 3 Total Hours 30 Note: Students are expected to complete their nonelective courses during their rst year. This schedule qualies students to be considered for a linguistics teaching assistantship by their third semester. Deviations from it are therefore strongly discouraged. Foreign Language Requirement Reading knowledge of one foreign language. This requirement may be met in one of three ways: 1.By passing the Graduate Student Foreign Language Test, given each November and April by The Graduate School. For information and registration, go directly to the website (http://gradschool.unc.edu/ student/gflpa.html ). 2.Where available, by passing the reading courses for graduate students numbered 601 and 602 (these courses do not earn graduate credit). Note: Students with some prior experience may nd it feasible to meet the requirement by enrolling directly in and passing 602, bypassing 601. 3.Where neither option 1 nor option 2 is available, students may arrange to have their competence certied by a qualied faculty member, usually through an informal examination. Comprehensive Examination During the semester following completion of the nonelective courses (which should be the fall term of the second year), students will form an examining committee of three faculty members in the department. It is expected that this committee will also serve as the M.A. thesis committee. The student will submit a prospectus of the M.A. thesis, as described below. The oral examination will assess the student's mastery of topics from the rst-year sequence of course work and gauge the merits of the prospectus. Writing Requirement Each student must demonstrate the ability to write a professional- quality scholarly, scientic, or technical document. There are two options available for satisfying this requirement.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 469 Thesis Option The master's thesis (normally 50 to 100 pages in length) must be approved by a committee consisting of the thesis director and two other faculty members at the oral comprehensive exam. Students form their thesis committee with the advice of their academic advisor, who may (but need not) be the thesis director. At the comprehensive oral exam for the M.A., the department requires that students who have elected this option submit a prospectus of the thesis. The prospectus should state clearly what problem is to be investigated, how the investigation is to be carried out (written research, eld work, experiment, etc.), and a preliminary bibliography. The prospectus should rst be discussed with the thesis director. Students should then submit a \"clean\" version to all three committee members and set up a meeting at which the prospectus can be informally discussed and approved (perhaps with modications). Students are also expected to consult their thesis director regularly during the actual writing of the thesis. Formal requirements regarding the format and submission of the M.A. thesis are found in the Thesis and Dissertation Guide. The nal oral examination, administered by the thesis committee, focuses on a defense of the thesis, but the faculty reserves the right to question students on other relevant topics. Students should avoid scheduling a thesis defense during the summer, since faculty members often are not available. If it is absolutely unavoidable, students should consult committee members well in advance. Research Paper Option The research paper is a report of original research that is of sufcient quality that it can be published or presented in a public scholarly forum. The research paper is to be written with the guidance of a faculty supervisor. The student should nd two faculty sponsors, at least one of whom must be a member of the Linguistics Department, and at least one of whom must be the faculty supervisor, who agree to read the research paper for content and style. The student will submit a proposal for the research paper at the M.A. comprehensive oral exam. The research paper is then to be written during one semester, while the student is registered for LING 992 (thesis substitute), with the faculty supervisor. The research that the paper describes must also be presented by the student in a public scholarly forum in order to fulll the nal oral examination requirement. The faculty sponsors should communicate to the director of graduate studies their approval of the paper. The requirement is satised when both faculty members have accepted the same version of the paper and have certied that the research has been presented in a public scholarly forum. The faculty sponsors should communicate this to the director of graduate studies, along with a printed version of the paper. The DGS will communicate the outcome to The Graduate School using the Report of Approved Substitute form. Important Degree Deadlines Each year The Graduate School sets deadlines for graduation in a given term (fall, spring, summer). There are two sets of dates to be mindful of: 1.Students wishing to graduate must submit an application to graduate, as stipulated in the Graduate Student Handbook (http:// handbook.unc.edu/graduation.html ). These documents must be submitted in advance: typically July for August graduation, February for May graduation, and October for December graduation, but ofcial dates will be posted on the University Registrar's calendar (http:// registrar.unc.edu/AcademicCalendar/). There is no penalty for failure to complete requirements for a requested graduation date, but astudent cannot graduate without having submitted the application to graduate. Therefore students should submit it in time for any semester in which they think they may graduate. 2.The nal electronic version of the thesis must be submitted to The Graduate School before the student can graduate. The deadline for submission is shortly before graduation; please see the University Registrar's calendar (http://registrar.unc.edu/AcademicCalendar/) for current dates. Note: The previous Ph.D. program in linguistics (1967-2011) no longer admits new students. Legacy students should consult the Department of Linguistics Web site (http://registrar.unc.edu/AcademicCalendar/) for degree requirements. Hispanic Linguistics Dual Graduate Track: M.A. in Linguistics and Ph.D. in Romance Studies, Both with Concentration in Hispanic Linguistics Hispanic linguistics is a discipline that focuses in particular on the structure, history, dialectal variation, acquisition, and use of Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages in contact with Spanish, using the analytic tools of modern linguistic theory. Specialists in Hispanic linguistics have a general, theoretical background in linguistics and specialize in phenomena directly relevant to the linguistic analysis of these particular languages. A Hispanic linguist has explicit, conscious knowledge of how these languages work, can communicate that knowledge to others, and can extend the world's stock of knowledge about those languages through original research. Application and Admission It is the policy (https://handbook.unc.edu/dual.html ) of The Graduate School that \"[s]tudents must apply to and be accepted by both programs individually before beginning in the dual degree program. In a practical sense, this means that students should apply to both academic programs at the same time, or apply to the second program no later than during their rst year of the rst program.Dual degrees will not be awarded after the curricular requirements have already been met without initial application.\" The applications will be considered separately by the admissions committees of the two departments. Those committees will make the nal decision about admission to each department. A student who is not admitted concurrently by both departments is not admitted to the dual track for the relevant term, although he or she may still be admitted to the linguistics M.A. singly by a vote of that department's admissions committee. Based on the prerequisites set forth by the Department of Romance Studies, said student is ineligible for admission to the Romance studies Ph.D. for that term, though he or she may reapply to that degree for a later term. (A prospective student who already has an M.A. in linguistics cannot receive a second M.A. in the same eld, hence is not eligible for the dual track, and should apply directly to the Romance studies Ph.D.) A prospective student whose degree intent is a terminal M.A. in linguistics with concentration in Hispanic linguistics need only apply to the Linguistics Department. If the student later wants to be admitted to the dual track before completing the M.A., he or she must apply only to the Ph.D. in Romance studies during the rst year of the M.A. If the student completes, or is in the second year and expects to complete, the M.A. and wants to be admitted to the Ph.D. in Romance studies, he or she must apply to the Department of Romance Studies.470 Department of Linguistics (GRAD) Click here (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/instructions.html ) for information and guidelines on the The Graduate School's admissions application. Prospective students will submit their applications electronically to The Graduate School. Applications are only accepted for study beginning in the fall semester of each year. Recommenders must submit their letters electronically through the online application system. We do not accept any recommendations on paper or via e-mail. To be considered for competitive Graduate School fellowships, an applicant must submit all materials by the second week of December. (Actual date changes with the semester.) This includes GRE scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, writing sample, and the audio le referred to below. (All are to be submitted electronically.) Prospective students do not send hard copies of transcripts when applying. They are only uploaded into their application. If the students are admitted they will then have to submit hard copies of their FINAL transcript to The Graduate School only. Departmental funding (usually in the form of a teaching assistantship) may still be available to those who apply no later than the second week of January (the actual date changes with the semester) for Fall admission. Although applications received up to the latter date will be considered, it is strongly recommended that materials be submitted by December 15th. Please note that in addition to the application materials that The Graduate School requests (such as the GRE), the dual track would like to receive the following three items: * A one-page statement (written in English) in which the student explains his/her reasons for pursuing a graduate degree in Hispanic linguistics. S/ he should also detail the areas of the proposed eld. * A writing sample in Spanish, such as a term paper that s/he has written for a course or a published article. * An audio le of a few minutes' duration, on which s/he identies herself by name in English; then speaks in Spanish about her professional goals and reads (also in Spanish) a short passage of his/her choice. The audio le is to be submitted to romlgrad@unc.edu. This last item is particularly important if the student is applying for a teaching assistantship. The prerequisite for admission to the M.A. track with concentration in Hispanic linguistics is completion of a bachelor's degree and knowledge of Spanish. Advising The dual track will be served by the graduate advisors in each department. M.A. advising will be the responsibility of the linguistics graduate advisor, while Ph.D. advising will be the responsibility of the Romance studies graduate advisor. A student who is admitted to the dual track is admitted simultaneously to the linguistics M.A. program and the Romance studies Ph.D. program, and must accept both admission offers before enrolling in classes. In any given semester, the student must be term-activated in one program or the other. Incoming students will normally be term-activated in the linguistics M.A. for approximately the rst two years before switching their term activation to the Romance studies Ph.D. Regardless of which program the student is term-activated in, however, he or she may, in any semester, make progress towards the requirements of either program, or of both. Dual track students should ensure they have successfully submitted an application to graduate for each of their intended degree programs.Graduate Certicate in Computational Linguistics Students admitted to the graduate certicate in computational linguistics must complete three courses (nine credit hours), of which one course may be counted towards their home degree. Students with background in linguistics must complete three courses from the following list: Code Title Hours COMP 455 Models of Languages and Computation 3 COMP 486/ INLS 512Applications of Natural Language Processing 3 COMP 562 Introduction to Machine Learning H3 COMP 755 Machine Learning 3 INLS 509 Information Retrieval 3 INLS 613 Text Mining 3 INLS 690 Intermediate Selected Topics (Data Mining: Methods and Applications)1-3 HHonors version available.

Please apply separately to (1) SOPHAS and (2) UNC-Chapel Hill (via the Graduate School application). Visit https://gradschool.sites.unc.edu/master-of-public-health/ for more details. If you are interested in the online M.P.H., please visit the MPH@UNC (https://onlinemph.unc.edu/ ) website and ll out an inquiry form. Milestones The following list of milestones (non-course degree requirements) must be completed; view this list of standard milestone denitions (p. 29) for more information. Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 485 SPHG 703 and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also be appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https:// sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992) course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experienceand produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance they need with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. Electives Students in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University. For information on policies and procedures, please visit the Gillings School Student Handbook (https://sph.unc.edu/students/gillings-school- student-handbook/ ) website. Residency Requirements Exit Survey Contact Information Department of Maternal and Child Health Visit Program Website (http://www.sph.unc.edu/mhch/) Chair Carolyn Halpern carolyn_halpern@unc.edu486 Department of Mathematics (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS (GRAD) The Department of Mathematics offers graduate training leading to the degrees of master of arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy. A master's degree may be included or bypassed in the doctoral program. All of a student's graduate work may be done within the department or, when appropriate, may be done under the direction of an approved advisor in an allied discipline. The Department of Mathematics is housed in Phillips Hall and Chapman Hall. The Department of Mathematics offers a number of teaching assistantships and teaching fellowships each year. Applicants for nancial aid are also considered for several University fellowships awarded by The Graduate School in the Universitywide competition. Applications for admission and nancial assistance may be obtained from The Graduate School. Applications led by the posted deadline will receive full consideration. The general regulations of The Graduate School govern the work for graduate degrees in mathematics. Specic requirements are explained below. In general, a graduate student in mathematics may receive credit only for mathematics courses numbered 600 and above. These descriptions summarize the requirements for the master's and Ph.D. degrees. More detailed statements may be obtained from the department. The director of graduate studies must approve all aspects of a student's program. The purpose of the graduate programs is to develop mathematical skills appropriate for competition in academia or industry. The course schedule for rst-year students will depend upon each student's undergraduate training. The normal course load for a graduate student is three courses (nine credit hours) per semester. Graduate students must maintain full-time status in order to qualify for tuition and health insurance benets. First-year students typically choose courses from ve yearlong sequences in algebra (MATH 676, MATH 677), analysis (MATH 653, 656), geometry-topology (MATH 681, MATH 680), scientic computation ( MATH 661, MATH 662), and methods of applied mathematics ( MATH 668, MATH 669). The Ph.D. comprehensive exams are based on the content of the rst- year sequences. These exams are offered in January and August of each year, just before the semester begins. A Ph.D. student can pass either the Pure Math option or the Applied Math option for the comprehensive examination. To pass the Pure Math option a student must pass any three of the ve comprehensive exams. To pass the Applied Math option, a student is required to pass Methods of Applied Math and Scientic Computation. During the second year a typical Ph.D. student will take the Ph.D. comprehensive exams and select courses from a list of 20 more advanced \"second tier\" courses. A typical master's student will complete that degree during the second year. The department considers two years to be the normal time needed to complete a master's degree. A candidate for a master's degree must satisfy each of the following requirements: 1.Earn at least two semesters of residency credit and complete all requirements within ve years 2.Demonstrate computer programming ability by passing an approved undergraduate or graduate course in programming3.Perform satisfactorily in 30 hours of graduate work in a program approved by the director of graduate studies. At least 15 of these hours must be in Department of Mathematics courses numbered 600 or above 4.Complete a master's project or thesis for a master of science degree or a master's thesis for a master of arts degree 5.Pass an oral examination upon completion of the master's project or master's thesis. The exam will cover coursework as well as the project or thesis 6.A master's candidate must pass one of the written comprehensive exams given to doctoral students. A candidate for a Ph.D. degree must satisfy each of the following requirements: 1.Earn at least four semesters of residency credit and complete all requirements within eight years 2.Satisfy the same computer programming requirement as a master's student 3.Complete either the Pure Math option or the Applied Math option for comprehensive examinations by the beginning of the sixth semester 4.Pass at least six courses from the following two lists: a) the second tier courses or b) rst-year comprehensive courses that are not basic courses for any of the comprehensive exams passed by the student. Of these six courses at least three must be numbered over 700 and drawn from the second tier list. 5.Pass the Teaching Assistant Teaching Seminar and perform a minimum of two semesters of instructional service 6.Pass a preliminary oral exam on the chosen Ph.D. specialty area 7.Write a Ph.D. thesis and defend it successfully during a nal oral exam chaired by the thesis advisor Minor in Mathematics Graduate students in other departments who plan to offer mathematics as a (complete or partial) minor eld for the Ph.D. should consult the director of graduate studies in mathematics for approval of their programs and for assignment of an advisor in the Department of Mathematics. This should be done at the earliest possible time in order to prevent disappointment for the student. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

By setting high standards for both scholarly and professional achievement, the school seeks to prepare graduates to be leaders and critical thinkers, no matter what career paths they might take. Master of Arts in Media and Communication The master's in media and communication prepares students to be leaders and critical thinkers through training in skills, communication concepts, and research and analysis. With high standards for scholarly and professional achievement, the program serves individuals interested in entering media and communication professions, professional communicators who want more education in a specialized eld, and individuals interested in communication research and teaching. Annual enrollment in the program totals about 45 students. The program consists of three areas of study: journalism, strategic communication, and theory and research. Students in the new, one- year journalism curriculum specialize in interactive design journalism, public life reporting, or video journalism. The strategic communication and theory and research programs of study are both designed to be completed in two academic years. A J.D.-M.A. dual-degree program, part of the theory and research area of study, also is offered in partnership with the UNC School of Law. It allows students to earn both degrees in as little as four years. Requirements All residential master's students, regardless of area of study, must pass the school's word usage and grammar test. This examination is a basic requirement for graduation for UNC Hussman undergraduate students and should pose no challenge for graduate students. Each student must pass a comprehensive examination \u2014 either written or oral, depending on area of study \u2014 covering the material in the student's courses and an oral defense of the nal project (journalism, strategic communication) or thesis (theory and research). Journalism Area of Study The 2023-2024 academic year is the rst for the new, one-year journalism program of study. The 30-credit curriculum allows aspiring and early-career journalists to \u2014 in just 12 months \u2014 intensively learn thespecialized skills of their craft. Each journalism student pursues one of three specializations: Interactive design journalism focuses on the development of interactive stories and content production for dynamic web projects. Public life reporting focuses on the development of investigative reporting expertise, allowing students to produce stories about education, health care, housing, immigration, labor, law enforcement, and racial/ethnic discrimination, among other issues. Video journalism teaches students how to acquire audio, photo, and video content; structure stories; and produce short and long-form documentary lms. Students start with a bootcamp course, either fundamentals of reporting or fundamentals of video journalism, in summer session II to develop foundational skills. In the fall, all students take law, ethics, and contemporary issues, as well as journalism methods. The remaining two fall courses and four spring courses are a mix of specialization requirements and electives. Students begin work on a culminating nal project during their spring courses and nalize the project during the following summer session I, with guidance from a panel of three faculty. They complete the program by passing an oral comprehensive exam and presenting their completed project to the faculty panel. Up to two elective courses may be taken from related subject elds in other schools and departments of the University or at neighboring universities. Strategic Communication Area of Study The strategic communication area of study prepares students for advertising, marketing communication, and public relations positions in agencies, corporations, nonprot organizations, and government. Because the professional master's curricula should prepare students to be leaders in the 21st-century workplace, this area of study seeks a balance between critical thinking and technical communication skills. Strategic communication master's students complete 36 total credit hours, comprised of 11 courses over three semesters and a nal thesis project in the fourth semester. At least nine courses must be taken within the school, and up to two courses may be taken from related subject elds in other schools and departments of the University or at neighboring universities. Each student is required to take four core courses (research methods, media law, strategic writing, and digital storytelling). Other required courses include a campaigns course, market intelligence, principles of public relations, and a public relations seminar. Theory and Research Area of Study The theory and research area of study is designed for students who are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree or research positions in industry. The curriculum for students in this area is closely tied to the Ph.D. program curriculum. Theory and research students do not take professional skills courses. Within this 39-credit-hour curriculum, each student completes a core set of classes and works with an advisor to build a specialized program of study based on this foundation. Core courses include mass communication theory, research methods, and media law. Students also are required to take at least two courses in other schools and departments at the University or at neighboring universities. A research thesis also is required of each theory and research master's student.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 495 J.D.-M.A. Dual Degree The J.D.-M.A. dual-degree program is designed for students interested in pursuing graduate studies in law and media and communication, and who plan to practice media or intellectual property law, pursue academic careers in law and mass communication elds, pursue doctoral study in a related eld, or pursue careers in journalism or strategic communication with a law-related emphasis. Admitted students typically complete the required rst-year law school curriculum during the rst year of study. The M.A. portion of the program requires 39 course credit hours and typically follows the theory and research program of study curriculum described above. In the dual- degree program, a student may count up to 12 credit hours of LAW courses toward the M.A. and up to 12 credit hours of MEJO courses toward the J.D. That accounts for the 24 course credit hours that are \"shared.\" That means that the dual degree requires a total of 101 unique course credit hours, and 27 of those course credit hours are MEJO course credit hours. All degree requirements from both schools must be completed before the degrees are awarded, and dual-degree students must apply for concurrent graduation for both degrees the same semester. Students who do not maintain dual-degree status may need to take additional coursework if they pursue either degree separately after being admitted to the dual- degree program. Master of Arts in Digital Communication (Online) The master's in digital communication empowers working professionals to advance their careers and bring immediate impact to their organizations. Students explore the economic drivers and technological changes affecting media and communication. Through a rigorous, project-based curriculum, students learn to nd trends, patterns, and stories in data and communicate insights that will drive impactful decision-making. Students collaborate closely with faculty and peer professionals, learning to develop effective content creation and dissemination strategies across platforms, deliver unforgettable user experiences, and lead with strategic and entrepreneurial thinking. Courses use an asynchronous course management system, which means that students are not required to gather online for class at specic times. The M.A.D.C. does feature one-hour synchronous sessions in some courses. These sessions are recorded for students to watch at another time if they are unable to attend in real time. M.A.D.C. students also are required to attend two on-campus residencies, rst a two-day orientation the week before classes begin and then a week-long summer residency between the rst and the second year of the program. The M.A.D.C. program admits one group of no more than 20 students each fall. Each entering class progresses through the program together over a 2.5-year period. Classes are intentionally small with an emphasis on interaction between faculty and students. Requirements The nal new courses of a revised curriculum were added in 2022-2023. The 30-credit-hour program consists of nine online courses and the nal thesis project:Code Title Hours MEJO 710 Psychology of Audiences 3 MEJO 711 Multi-platform Storytelling 3 MEJO 713 Media Analytics 3 MEJO 719 Leadership and Entrepreneurship 3 MEJO 720 Communication Strategy and Planning 3 MEJO 722 The Business of Media 3 MEJO 723 Visual Literacy and User Experience 3 MEJO 724 Reputation Management 3 MEJO 725 Media Innovation in Practice 3 MEJO 992 Master's (Non-Thesis) 3 Length of the M.A.D.C. Program The M.A.D.C. program is designed to be completed in 2.5 years on a part- time schedule. During the rst year, students enroll in two courses in the fall, two courses in the spring, and one course in the summer. In the second year, students enroll in two courses in the fall and two courses in the spring. In the third year, students enroll in a nontraditional thesis course in the fall. Ph.D. in Media and Communication The doctorate in media and communication prepares students to excel in college teaching and research positions or research careers in communication industries. Advancing the body of knowledge through theory building and testing, faculty work closely with each student to develop a program of study that is both interdisciplinary and tailored to meet the specic needs and interests of the student. The goal of the program is to produce outstanding scholars, effective educators, and highly skilled researchers. The program is small and selective; no more than seven to 10 students enter the program each year. Admissions decisions are based not only on standard criteria but also on a determination of whether the applicant's interests and goals t with those of the program and faculty. For that reason, the statement of purpose that must accompany an application is extremely important, and applicants are encouraged to be as specic as possible in outlining their research interests and career goals. Requirements The doctoral program is designed to be flexible and interdisciplinary, but also to ensure that students are equipped to conduct rigorous research and teach or practice in at least one substantive area. Full-time students take four courses each semester for their rst two years in the program, for 48 credit hours (400-level and above courses) that combine the three core courses below and electives. In their third year, students enroll in six dissertation credit hours, to total 54 required credit hours, and also complete comprehensive exams. Code Title Hours MEJO 703 Mass Communication Research Methods 3 MEJO 705 Theories of Mass Communication 3 MEJO 801 Professional Seminar in Doctoral Studies 3 The remaining required credit hours must be arrayed into three groups of courses: 1) a substantive area of study consisting of at least 15 hours of coursework; 2) research methods consisting of at least four courses; and 3) at least nine hours of coursework for the development of a secondary496 Hussman School of Journalism and Media (GRAD) area of expertise or exploration of other substantive or methodological areas of the academy. Major and minor substantive areas include: Media processes and production Legal and regulatory issues in communication Media uses and effects Health communication Political, social, and strategic communication Other requirements include: At least eight courses, totaling at least 24 credits, of 700-, 800-, and 900-level courses within the Hussman School of Journalism and Media At least four semesters in residence, with a minimum of two semesters in continuous study at UNC-Chapel Hill Satisfactory performance on both written and oral comprehensive exams, taken at the end of the Ph.D. coursework Successful completion and oral defense of a dissertation Length of the Ph.D. Program Most students complete the Ph.D. program in three to four years. Some students elect to stay a fourth year to compete more effectively for research-intensive positions at Research 1 universities or to pursue more ambitious dissertations. The Graduate School requires students to complete the degree within eight years of rst registration in the doctoral program. J.D.-Ph.D. Dual-Degree Program The J.D.-Ph.D. dual-degree program is designed for students interested in pursuing graduate studies in law and media and communication and who plan to practice media or intellectual property law, pursue academic careers in law and mass communication elds, or pursue careers in journalism or strategic communication with a law-related emphasis. Admission to the UNC School of Law and the doctoral program in the Hussman School of Journalism and Media must be gained independently in order to be admitted to the J.D.-Ph.D. program. Admitted students typically complete the required rst-year law school curriculum during the rst year of study. Dual-degree students must complete the required 54 credit hours for the Ph.D., of which up to 12 credit hours may be drawn from approved courses in the J.D. curriculum. Dual-degree students also must complete the required 86 credit hours for the J.D. degree, of which up to 12 hours may be drawn from approved courses in the Ph.D. curriculum. This allows J.D.-Ph.D. students to complete the dual-degree program with 116 credit hours over approximately ve years, depending on the individual student's progress and program of study. All degree requirements from both schools must be completed before the degrees are awarded, and dual-degree students must apply for concurrent graduation for both degrees the same semester. Students who do not maintain dual-degree status may need to take additional coursework if they pursue either degree separately after being admitted to the dual- degree program. Funding Roy H. Park Fellowships are available to select incoming doctoral students each year. Each fellowship provides an annual stipend, paymentof tuition and fees, research and travel support, and health insurance. Park fellows are guaranteed three years of funding. Many doctoral students who desire to study for four years are able to secure a fourth year of funding from other sources. Only U.S. citizens are eligible for Park Fellowships, and continuation of funding each year is dependent on satisfactory progress in the program. Each fellow must work as a graduate assistant for 15 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters. The school also funds doctoral students through the Cobbs Scholarship, for which international and domestic applicants are eligible. Ph.D. students are also sometimes funded by external grants supporting UNC Hussman faculty research projects. Professors Francesca Dillman Carpentier, W.

It offers instruction leading to the doctor of philosophy degree. A terminal master of science degree is granted only under special conditions. The department is highly regarded in many scientic disciplines, including immunology, microbial pathogenesis, virology, infectious diseases, host/ pathogen interactions, molecular genetics, prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular and cellular biology, and cancer biology. Research in the department is supported by funds from the University, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the American Cancer Society, and other private foundations and granting agencies. Research Environment The Department of Microbiology and Immunology consists of approximately 70 faculty members with active research laboratories, 60 graduate students, 90 postdoctoral scientists, 20 research staff, and 10 administrative staff, who together form a highly interactive, friendly, and collaborative community. The department occupies the entire sixth floor (~25,000 net square feet) of the new Marsico Hall, as well as the recently renovated ninth floor of the Burnett-Womack Building. A signicant number of faculty members who hold primary appointments in the department have laboratories in the nearby Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center as well as other departments within the School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health. A variety of modern equipment is available in individual laboratories or shared by multiple users throughout the department. Well-equipped research laboratories are supplemented by specialized rooms dedicated to tissue culture, controlled temperature environments, BSL3 physical containment for research on microbial select agents, supervised animal care, etc. In addition, the University operates an extensive network of core facilities with major equipment and expert support staff, including flow cytometry, genomics, proteomics, oligonucleotide synthesis, DNA sequencing, X-ray crystallography, NMR, animal models (transgenic mouse and embryonic stem cell services), animal histopathology, bioinformatics, gene chips, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry. The department is fully supplied with high-speed Internet connections (both wired and wireless). University libraries provide electronic access to thousands of professional journals. Admission Students seeking admission to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology apply to BBSP, a common portal by which students interested in any of the 14 participating graduate programs begin their studies at UNC-Chapel Hill. To apply, prospective students should visit the BBSP (http://bbsp.unc.edu/admissions/ ) and graduate admissions (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) websites, ll out the online application, and select Microbiology and Immunology as their rst choice of interest.Financial Assistance All Ph.D. students making satisfactory degree progress receive a stipend plus in-state tuition, fees, and health insurance. Funds are available from individual research grants, training grants, the department, and the University. Students are encouraged to apply for a predoctoral fellowship from the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, or other organizations. As is the case for all graduate students in the basic science departments of the UNC School of Medicine, education during the rst year is under the guidance of the interdisciplinary Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program (BBSP). Students rotate through three different research laboratories of their choosing in year one. For students interested in microbiology and immunology, recommended classroom courses include Immunobiology (MCRO 640 ). Upon choosing a dissertation laboratory and joining the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, students are provided with an outstanding learning environment, an opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research, and most importantly, thorough preparation for a successful career in science. The microbiology and immunology Ph.D. program is designed to provide a foundation of fundamental knowledge in modern microbiology and immunology, foster critical scientic thinking, develop written and oral communication skills, allow students to gain teaching experience, and offer opportunities to travel and present posters or talks at national meetings. Specic components of the microbiology and immunology Ph.D. training program include: Completion of six relevant courses, including two courses based directly on discussion of the primary literature (e.g., MCRO 710 , MCRO 711 , MCRO 795 are required. Students typically nish four of the six classes while in BBSP and the remainder during year two. There is no language requirement. The written preliminary exam (also known as the doctoral written examination) consists of an original non-thesis research proposal, written in a format similar to an NIH pre- or postdoctoral fellowship proposal. The proposal is written whenever the student likes over the course of the spring semester of year two. The oral preliminary exam (also known as the doctoral oral examination) centers on the topic of the thesis project and provides an opportunity for the student to demonstrate his or her ability to discuss the elds of science related to the thesis proposal, as well as the ability to analyze problems and design experiments. The exam serves a dual purpose as the initial meeting of the thesis committee. Therefore, a separate decision to approve or disapprove the thesis project will occur in the same meeting. Students must regularly attend weekly student and departmental seminars ( MCRO 701 ) beginning in year two and present their research annually in the student seminar series beginning in year three. Students act as teaching assistants for two semesters in department- approved courses, typically in years two and three. Students form a dissertation committee in the start of year three, obtain approval of their dissertation project, and meet annually with their committee to discuss research progress. Completion of sufcient original research for at least two rst-author papers in high-quality peer reviewed journals is expected. As a minimum standard, to earn the Ph.D. degree we require that512 Department of Microbiology and Immunology (GRAD) A student must make meaningful contributions to and be an author on at least two manuscripts intended for publication in respected, high-quality professional journals or books, At least one of the two manuscripts must be a rst (or co-rst) author primary research manuscript, At least one of the two manuscripts must be accepted for publication, and If the second manuscript is not accepted for publication, then peer reviews must be returned prior to the private Ph.D defense. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Contact Information Department of Microbiology and Immunology Visit Program Website (http://med.unc.edu/microimm/) Chair Craig E. Cameron516 Department of Music (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC (GRAD) The department offers the degrees of master of arts (M.A.) in musicology and the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in musicology, construing \"musicology\" in its broad sense to encompass the interrelated disciplines of music history, music theory, ethnomusicology, and studies of popular culture. Special Facilities Central to the departmental resources is the Music Library, which ranks high among the nation's music libraries for its scholarly editions, periodicals, early source materials, iconographic aids, microlms, folk- music collections, and recordings as well as access to major music research databases and thousands of streamed audio and video recordings. In addition, the Southern Folklife Collection (SFC) is one of the nation's foremost archival resources for the study of American folk music and popular culture. SFC holdings extensively document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production. Prerequisites for Degree Programs The usual prerequisite for admission to graduate work leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees is a bachelor of arts degree with a major in music, or a bachelor of music degree, comparable to those given at this university. Applicants for the graduate program must submit with their application samples of their recent writing on musical subjects. The graduate program is an integrated M.A.-Ph.D. program, constructed on the assumption that students will pursue the M.A. and Ph.D. in one continuous sequence: the M.A. is one of the required steps in earning the Ph.D. Please note that applicants are no longer required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Fellowships, Assistantships, and Other Student Aid In addition to campus-wide grants, assistantships and special grants are available to selected graduate students in music. The deadline for all graduate applications is in December; a separate application for aid is not necessary but may be indicated on the general application form for admission to The Graduate School. Selected applicants are nominated for University-wide awards that range from $20,000 to $26,000. Teaching assistantships may be awarded by the department; these awards average $20,000 and usually include tuition remission for out-of-state students, payment of in-state tuition, and other benets. For a full listing of the program's nancial aid opportunities, please see the Department of Music's Graduate Handbook . For the M.A. degree, students must demonstrate reading prociency in one language other than English judged suitable to the scheme of study by the written consent of the director of graduate studies. Students may demonstrate prociency in one of four ways: 1.By achieving a grade of B or better in a UNC-Chapel Hill fourth- semester (204) language course2.By placing out of the fourth-semester language course through the placement examination given by the appropriate foreign language department 3.By passing the appropriate Foreign Language Prociency Assessment offered through The Graduate School 4.Through petition overseen by the director of graduate studies MUSC 750 , Resources and Methods in Musicology, is required of all students in their rst semester. Other courses are drawn from a range of offerings in the department. Graduate students have the option to include courses from other departments as part of a certicate program or toward the student's intellectual focus. Courses taken outside the department must be approved in advance by the director of graduate studies in music and by the departments concerned as directly relevant to a proposed course of study. For the M.A. degree, students take courses totaling 30 credit hours and write a thesis that is typically a revision and expansion of a paper prepared for a graduate seminar taken in the Department of Music. Students write the M.A. thesis in the third or fourth semester of study, registering concurrently for MUSC 993 , Master's Research and Thesis. All students pursuing a master's degree take a written comprehensive examination; a nal oral examination is not given. At the conclusion of each spring semester a written examination is given to satisfy the requirements for the M.A. degree and to qualify students to continue toward the Ph.D. Students already in the department's M.A. program take the examination in the second year. Those who received the M.A. degree at another institution and had the requirements of the M.A. waived must take the examination in the spring of their rst year of study. As part of the completion of an additional 12 hours of seminars beyond the 30 hours required for the M.A. degree, students enroll in an independent study to prepare for the Ph.D. written examination at the end of their fth semester (third for those with the M.A. requirements waived). By the end of the sixth semester of study (fourth semester for those with the M.A. requirements waived), students must take an oral examination on a proposed dissertation topic. They then register for at least two semesters of MUSC 994 , Doctoral Dissertation, and MUSC 994 's corequisite, MUSC 991 , Dissertation Colloquium; complete the dissertation; and undergo a second oral examination in its defense. More detailed explanation of these requirements appears in the Department of Music's Graduate Handbook. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

With strong research funding and a long and successful training history, the curriculum ranks among the best programs in the country. The program has 74 primary faculty members who can serve as dissertation advisors. Research opportunities in the curriculum are supported by the presence of an active neuroscience community at UNC-Chapel Hill. This community includes members of every basic science department in the School of Medicine, members of many clinical departments, as well as several departments in the College of Arts and Sciences. University research and clinical centers with a neuroscience component also contribute to the vibrant and active community that makes neurobiology a major intellectual focus at UNC-Chapel Hill. The Neuroscience Curriculum enrolls an average of 45 students at different levels of training at any given time; typically, ve to ten students are accepted each year depending on available funding. Students in the curriculum are supported during their rst and/or second years by a long- standing training grant funded through NINDS, and in subsequent years by either their mentor's research grants or individual fellowships. The average time to graduation is 5.3 years. Neuroscience is by its very nature an interdisciplinary endeavor, and at UNC-Chapel Hill the neuroscience curriculum provides a broadly structured training curriculum and research environment that spans the range from genetic studies of the nervous system through the complexities of human cognitive function. Applicants are urged to complete their applications through BBSP (http:// bbsp.unc.edu/admissions/ ) by early December. Courses required for the Ph.D. degree in neuroscience include Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience (NBIO722 Fall) and Systems and Translational Neuroscience (NBIO723 Spring). Students are expected to enroll in both semesters of this course sequence. The purpose of the course in Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience is to explore the experimental and theoretical basis for current concepts of nervous system function. The course runs as a series of three blocks in the fall semester and three blocks in the spring semester. This is NOT a survey course in neuroscience. The goals of the course are not so much to inform as to foster an understanding of how we accumulate our knowledge and hypotheses, not to provide a complete textbook picture of the functioning nervous system as we currently know it but to provide the intellectual tools and skills to evaluate current and future hypotheses, not so much to provide answers to questions as to attempt to dene the unanswered questions. Block 1 (NBIO 722 Fall) - Neuroscience Bootcamp: Introduction to Techniques Used in Studying the Nervous System/Electrical Signaling (~19 sessions) Because students taking the core course have diverse backgrounds, this block is divided into two sections. Block 1a - Neuroscience Bootcamp: Introduction to Techniques Used in Studying the Nervous System (~9 sessions). The rst block serves as an introduction to neuroscience as well as an overview of many of the techniques students will encounter while reading materials and papersfor the rest of the course. Examples of topics covered include statistics and hypothesis testing, molecular biology and genetic engineering, confocal microscopy, and functional anatomy of the rodent brain. Fall. Jensen, Itano, S. Cohen, Brenman.1 Block 1b - Electrical Signaling (~10 sessions). This block introduces materials related to electrical excitability of neurons. Topics include ion channels, membrane potentials, generation and propagation of action potentials, dendritic excitability, and computational neuroscience as it relates to electrical signaling of neurons. Fall. Frohlich, Kato, Kasten, Manis.1 Block 2 - Synaptic Mechanisms (~10 sessions). This block focuses on synaptic mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and termination of signaling, as well as intracellular signaling cascades that are regulated by synaptic transmission. Topics include electrophysiological and molecular analysis of neurotransmitter release, short-term plasticity in neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling and regulation of intracellular signaling cascades, and gene expression. Fall. Philpot, Reissner1, McElligott, Dudek. Block 3 - Receptors (~10 sessions). This block focuses on neurotransmitter signaling through distinct receptor subclasses. Topics include G-protein coupled receptors and associated signaling, receptor binding theory, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate and GABA receptors, receptor trafcking and localization. Fall. McElligott, Herman, Scherrer, Diering1. Block 4 - Development of the Nervous System (NBIO 723 Spring) (~11 sessions). This block focuses on molecular mechanisms of neuronal development and their relation to disease. Topics include neurogenesis, neural stem cells, molecular control of axonal guidance and neuronal migration, and cell and Spring. Shiau, Maness, Anton, Deshmukh, Gupton, Song1, Stein. Block 5 - Anatomy and Function of Sensory and Motor Systems (~17 sessions). This block focuses on the neural circuitry that comprises sensory and motor systems. Topics include organization and function of the retina and visual cortex, mechanosensation, genetically dened circuits for cortex, basal Manis, Fitzpatrick, Snider, Weiss, Cheney. Block 6 - Neurobiology of Disease (~12 sessions). This block focuses on the neurobiological underpinnings of disease. For each topic the disease and its impact on society is introduced, and then detailed discussions of the molecular, genetic underpinnings and circuit and behavioral consequences of the disorder are presented. Topics include epilepsy, addiction, fear and anxiety circuitry, schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. This block also includes two classes devoted to human neuroimaging methods such at fMRI and DTI. Spring. Gilmore, Cohen1, Ditcher, Stein, Zylka. 1denotes the head the of Scientic Results Neurobiology ( NBIO 850 ) The class teaches the principles for giving effective talks. The course also covers how to introduce speakers, prepare slides, and speak with the public about science. Spencer Smith currently directs the course, with additional faculty members participating in each class. The class is limited to Neuroscience Curriculum students. Students prepare talks, rene them in small groups (three to four students), and then present520 Neurobiology Curriculum (GRAD) them in class. The in-class talk is videotaped, and these tapes are reviewed by the students in a session with their peers. After another round of rening their talks with their small group, the students give their polished talks to the department in a formal setting. Writing is critiqued in class, with peers and guest faculty members all offering input. The videotaped reviews and peer critiques help tremendously to teach effective speaking and writing methods in NBIO 850 (a.k.a. PClass); thus, preparing students for the next stage in their scientic careers. Fall. Song, Phanstiel. Neuroanalytics (NBIO 750) The purpose of this course is to provide both practical and theoretical training in advanced data analysis approaches commonly used in neuroscience research. Over the past 10 years there has been a dramatic shift within the eld from relatively simple data analysis approaches such as calculating means and standard errors of grouped data, to now performing complex analysis on higher dimensional datasets to uncover unappreciated features. The material in this course should be immediately useful to any student who is working with modern data collected in neuroscience, from sequencing, electrophysiology, imaging, biochemistry, and behavior. The concepts in the course will be taught through programming in python. While understanding mathematical concepts behind analysis is important, we will largely focus on the big picture and try to illustrate concepts by emphasizing graphical representations of how datasets are treated with these approaches. Throughout the course, we will utilize real-world neuroscience data from a variety of sub-disciplines as examples, and also focus on teaching the implications and limitations of the approaches we cover. At the end of the course, students should have a solid foundation of scientic computing, which will prepare them to independently conduct analysis of their own data or prepare them for more advanced courses. Spring even numbered years. Stein. Neuroscience Seminar Series (NBIO 893) Diverse but current topics in all aspects of neuroscience. Relates new techniques and current research of notables in the eld of neuroscience. Content focuses on presentations by invited, non-UNC faculty, UNC faculty, and mini-series presentations from current neuroscience students. Topics vary from week to week. Students in the curriculum are expected to attend and participate in the neuroscience seminar series, and in particular year 2 and 3 students will be enrolled in NBIO 893 each semester, for which their attendance and participation in seminars and dissertation defenses is tracked and graded. Fall and spring. Brenman. On the curriculum's website, the courses menu lists descriptions of the core courses of the neuroscience curriculum; other selected offerings are shown under the electives menu. Additional elective courses in biochemistry, statistics, molecular biology, physiology, etc., are available to compensate for specic deciencies or enhance training. It is the current philosophy of the curriculum faculty that students should receive a broad exposure to as many aspects of neuroscience as reasonable, from molecules and genetics through systems, behavior, and human diseases of the nervous system. The following is a partial list of courses that neuroscience students may consider for their elective requirements.

Contact Information Neuroscience Curriculum Visit Program Website (https://www.med.unc.edu/neuroscience/ curriculum/ ) Director of Graduate Studies Jay Brenman Student Services Manager Sue ModlinUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 525 SCHOOL OF NURSING (GRAD) At the graduate level, the School of Nursing offers the master of science in nursing (M.S.N.), the doctor of nursing practice (D.N.P.), and the doctor of philosophy in nursing (Ph.D.). Master of Science in Nursing The master of science in nursing (M.S.N.) program prepares nurses for advanced practice nursing focused on direct patient care or as advanced specialists in health care leadership and administration. Length of Program The program of study varies from 33 to 46 credits of academic coursework, including clinical practice, a professional portfolio as a substitute for the oral comprehensive examination, and a master's paper (or in some cases, a thesis). Advanced practice students (i.e., nurse practitioner students) may purse the M.S.N. degree on a full-time basis, while students seeking preparation in health care leadership and administration may pursue the M.S.N. degree on a full-time or part-time basis. Master's Program Curriculum The curriculum includes professional, research, clinical core courses and advanced nursing practice courses. The professional (NURS 746, NURS 790I) and research (NURS 740, NURS 992 or NURS 993) courses are required of all students. The clinical core courses and advanced nursing practice courses focus on the student's selected area of specialization and role preparation. The program options offered reflect a combination of current practice trends as well as available faculty resources. Each student is admitted to a specic advanced nursing practice population or specialty area and assigned a faculty advisor appropriate to the student's educational and career goals. Upon completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for national certication examinations appropriate to their advanced area of preparation. The M.S.N. program prepares nurses as (1) advanced practice registered nurses (i.e., nurse practitioners) focused on direct patient care or (2) as specialists in health care leadership and administration. The current advanced practice nursing population foci include adult- gerontology primary care nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner, pediatric nurse practitioner-primary care, and psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner. The Heath Care Leadership and Administration option is offered online and incorporates both with synchronous and asynchronous online learning. The nurse practitioner options are delivered in hybrid format, with a mix of face-to-face and online courses. The M.S.N. program also includes advanced practice courses in adult oncology. Master's students may elect to take these offerings as electives or declare an oncology focus in addition to their primary population or specialty area of interest. A graduate certicate in nursing education (additional nine credits) is available for students who desire to develop these skills in teaching and learning along with their advanced nursing preparation. Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing The Ph.D. program of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is grounded in our commitment to enhancing the health of individuals, families, and communities; increasing the effectiveness of health care systems; and furthering the translation of research into practice.Graduates of the program are prepared to advance the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of nursing science, engage in interdisciplinary inquiry, and disseminate knowledge. The Ph.D. curriculum reflects the goals of the National Institutes of Health to foster discovery and increase the knowledge base for improving the health of all populations and to reduce health disparities. The program emphasizes the integration of the biological and behavioral sciences; the development and testing of evidence-based, theoretically grounded interventions; and the improvement of health care quality and outcomes. Faculty research addresses three areas of emphasis: enhancing health in vulnerable populations, managing chronic health problems, and strengthening health care systems. Students work closely with internationally renowned faculty from nursing and other disciplines to develop the skills and expertise needed to launch their program of research and pursue a successful career in academic and health care settings. Length of Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program of study is a minimum of 52 credits of academic coursework including a qualifying examination and a dissertation. Students may pursue the Ph.D. degree on a full-time basis only. Ph.D. Program Curriculum The Ph.D. curriculum in the School of Nursing includes the following components: coursework, a written qualifying exam, mentored research experience and the dissertation. The program of study for students incorporates both required and elective courses distributed as follows: core knowledge and competencies (20 credits), core research methods (17 credits), and elective courses in the student's substantive area or courses that support the development of methods or additional research practica (9 credits). Six of these credits must support the dissertation research from outside the discipline of nursing or be interdisciplinary. A minimum of 6 dissertation credits are required. Doctor of Nursing Practice The Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) program prepares nurses for the highest level of advanced practice nursing focused on direct patient care (i.e., nurse practitioner) or as leaders in health care systems. Graduates receive preparation in such key areas as evidence-based practice, organization and systems leadership, nance, health policy, information technology, population health, quality improvement, patient safety, and translational research with the goal of improving patient and population health outcomes. Length of Program The program credits range from 60-73 credit hours for those with baccalaureate preparation and 36 credits hours for those with M.S.N. preparation. The program includes academic coursework, clinical practice, a qualifying examination, and a practice-focused scholarly project. Students with baccalaureate preparation may pursue the D.N.P. degree on a full-time basis, while students with M.S.N. preparation may pursue the D.N.P. degree on a full-time or part-time basis. D.N.P. Program Curriculum The B.S.N. to D.N.P. program of study builds upon baccalaureate education and expands current M.S.N. education to prepare nurses for the highest level of professional nursing practice. Each student is admitted to a specic advanced practice or specialty area and assigned a faculty advisor appropriate to the student's educational and career goals. Upon completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for526 School of Nursing (GRAD) national certication examinations appropriate to their advanced area of preparation. The following nurse practitioner population foci are available in the B.S.N. to D.N.P pathway: adult-gerontology primary care, family, pediatric primary care, and psychiatric-mental health. The Health Care Leadership and Administration option prepares nurses as leaders in health care systems. The M.S.N. to D.N.P pathway is for nurses who have completed the M.S.N. degree and are certied or eligible for certication as an advanced practice registered nurse (nurse practitioner) or a health systems leader. The M.S.N. to D.N.P. curriculum builds on the M.S.N. degree to achieve the highest level of nursing practice. This pathway is offered in online format that incorporates both synchronous and asynchronous learning. A graduate certicate in nursing education (additional nine credits) is available for D.N.P students who desire to develop these skills in teaching and learning along with their advanced nursing preparation. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Milestones The following list of milestones (non-course degree requirements) must be completed; view this list of standard milestone denitions (p. 29) for more information. Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also be appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https:// sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not550 Department of Nutrition (GRAD) successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992) course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experience and produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance they need with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. Electives Students in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University.

The duties of assistants include supervising laboratory classes in introductory physics or astronomy, supporting the supervision of advanced laboratories, teaching recitation sections, and grading assignments. Graduate School fellowships are available for well-qualied applicants to the department's graduate program. Graduate students can usually be supported in the summer by teaching or research. Research assistantships are also offered, especially to those who have completed a year or two of graduate work. The stipend is at least $30,000 for the calendar year. Application forms for admission, including graduate appointments, should be completed online (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ). The purpose of the graduate program is to educate professional scientists at the Ph.D. level. The training prepares students for careers on university and college faculties; in industrial research and development facilities; in government laboratories and research centers; and in a variety of other scientic and technical venues. Scientic training at this level is achieved through classroom study in the core areas of the discipline common to all subelds of physics and astronomy, as well as in specialized areas at the advanced level. With this foundation, training will continue by engaging in a program of research, in partnership with one or more faculty members, which results in original work of scientic scholarship in the form of a doctoral dissertation. This research may consist of experimental, theoretical, observational, or computational work; or it may combine elements of several or all of these. The general regulations of The Graduate School govern the work for graduate degrees in physics and astronomy. Specic requirements summarized below. Detailed information may be obtained from the department. A candidate for a Ph.D. degree must complete the following requirements: 1.Pass the doctoral written exam in four of the following seven core courses: PHYS 701, 712, 721, 741, ASTR 711, 712, 719, and completing a research or literature review paper. 2.Pass the teaching seminar (PHYS 510) and the introductory graduate seminar (PHYS 885). 3.Completing course work in four additional electives at a satisfactory level.

Each year about 12 students enroll to pursue the doctor of philosophy in political science. However, the department also offers a master of arts in political science through the TransAtlantic Masters (TAM) (http:// tam.unc.edu ) program. Admission The general prerequisite for admission to graduate study is a bachelor of arts degree or equivalent. A student is not required to have an undergraduate major in political science but will normally be expected to have had at least nine semester hours of coursework in political science. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is optional. Students may submit their GRE scores if they wish, but this is not a requirement. Applicants are encouraged to have their applications complete by December 1 and no later than posted deadlines. Applicants are also required to submit a writing sample and a personal statement. The Center for European Studies The Center for European Studies (CES), a Jean Monnet Center of Excellence and a U.S. Department of Education Title VI National Resource Center, advances understanding of the social, political, and economic events that shape contemporary Europe. The overarching mandate of the center is to enhance undergraduate and graduate instruction in contemporary European studies, to promote scholarship and training for students and faculty from all disciplines and professional schools, and to stimulate institutional and public awareness of Europe's economic, cultural, and political importance on campus, in North Carolina, and across the nation. CES has close ties to the TransAtlantic Masters program, which offers an M.A. in political science and includes study at UNC and at one or more partner universities in Europe. For more information on TAM please visit the dedicated website (http:// tam.unc.edu ). CES furthermore brings many European experts to campus, holds conferences and lecture series on events surrounding contemporary Europe, and offers Foreign Language Area Studies Fellowships to graduate students to support intensive language training. Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies The Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies (CSEEES) is an interdisciplinary center run jointly with a sister center at Duke University. In addition to offering an undergraduate major in Russian and East European studies, the center actively promotes graduate education and research in this area of the world. As a U.S. Department of Education Title VI Center, CSEEES awards Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowships to a few graduate students each academic year and summer to help them acquire the language skills and area expertise necessary for advanced study and eld research in this part of the world. The Louis Harris Data Center The national polling company Harris Interactive (formerly Louis Harris & Associates) has been surveying Americans' opinions on issues of national importance since the late 1950s. Harris surveys cover manytopics, including national morale, the arts, energy policy, women's roles, political candidates, violence, health, and housing. The breadth and scope of the Harris surveys make them a rich source for secondary analysis by social scientists. In 1965 Louis Harris agreed to make his data available for secondary analysis by researchers. Harris and the University of North Carolina jointly agreed to establish at Chapel Hill the Louis Harris Data Center as the national archive for all Harris data. Since 1965 more than 200 national, state, and community studies conducted by Harris Interactive have been deposited at the Harris Data Center for use by researchers at the University and elsewhere. Programs The focus of our graduate program is to train students for professional careers in political science, usually in academic institutions but also (and increasingly) in government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Our program emphasizes the acquisition of substantive knowledge, methodological skills, and communication tools that will allow the student to conduct cutting-edge research and to teach effectively. We aim to train political scientists for competence in the discipline as a whole, as well as with expertise in specic subelds and topics. To this end, we offer our students small graduate classes on a wide array of substantive and methodological topics. Our graduate students also receive a great deal of individual attention from faculty members, with many opportunities for collaboration and co-authorship. Our students also gain substantial experience in teaching, both through teaching assistantships and the opportunity to teach one's own course. This experience, coupled with the research training we offer, is essential for success in careers in university-level teaching and scholarly research. Ph.D. candidates who elect to work in nonacademic settings, including think tanks and government agencies, also nd that our program's combination of substantive training and methodological competency is invaluable. At the M.A. level, the student is required, in addition to passing the course programs successfully, to write a thesis and to be examined orally on the major eld of interest and in defense of the thesis. At the doctoral level, preliminary examinations are both written and oral, in that order. Written examinations are given annually in September. The nal part of the examination is an oral defense of the dissertation proposal. Successful completion of these examinations permits a student to become a doctoral candidate. Following completion of the dissertation, a nal oral examination will be held, which is primarily a defense of the dissertation but may include such excursions into underlying theory and related elds as are germane to the dissertation. Field and Course Requirements The political science curriculum is designed to ensure that graduate students develop a professional competence in the discipline as a whole, as well as expertise in one major and one minor eld. The courses in the department are grouped under the following broad categories: international relations, comparative politics, political theory, American politics, and methodology. Ph.D. students are required to demonstrate competence in two elds of study and, by participating in the instructional program, to undergo training as teachers. A minimum of four courses and a comprehensive590 Department of Political Science (GRAD) examination is required in the major eld. Three courses are required in the minor eld. The Institute for the Study of the Americas and the Graduate Certicate The Institute for the Study of the Americas and the Consortium in Latin American Studies at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University serve as a medium for interdisciplinary communication on Latin America, encouraging and stimulating instruction and research on the region. They provide funding for interdisciplinary working groups, visiting scholars, research workshops, and guest lectures, as well as support for graduate students through academic year and summer fellowships and research and conference travel grants. The program has been funded as a National Resource (Title VI) Center since 1991 by the U.S. Department of Education. Although the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill does not grant an interdisciplinary postgraduate degree in Latin American studies, graduate students seeking to document their area expertise are encouraged to earn a certicate in Latin American studies in conjunction with any advanced degree in any University graduate program. The requirements for the certicate are 1.A minimum of two semesters of residence 2.Language competence in Spanish or Portuguese 3.Four graduate courses on Latin American topics 4.A thesis on a topic related to Latin America, and 5.An oral defense of the thesis Graduate students interested in obtaining a certicate in Latin American studies should contact the director of the Institute for the Study of the Americas.

Practicum Prior to beginning a practicum, students must: 1) have nal grades in and 2) receive approval from the practicum team to begin their practicum hours. To satisfy degree requirements, a Gillings M.P.H. practicum must: Be an applied public health practice (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/ community-engaged-learning/ ) experience that addresses a health issue from a community or population (not individual) perspective. Take place in a professional public health setting such as a health department, nonprot organization, hospital or for-prot rm. To be appropriate for a practicum, University-afliated settings must be primarily focused on community engagement, typically with external partners. University health promotion or wellness centers may also beUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 631 appropriate. Faculty-supervised lab settings are not appropriate for the practicum. Allow for the application of graduate-level public health skills. Yield at least two student-generated, practical, non-academic work products (e.g., project plans, grant proposals, training manuals or lesson plans, surveys, memos, videos, podcasts, presentations, spreadsheets, websites, photos with accompanying explanatory text, or other digital artifacts of learning), produced for the practicum site's use and benet, that demonstrate attainment M.P.H. Foundational Competencies (https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/112/2022/10/CEPH-Foundational-Competencies.pdf). Be mentored by a supervisor (preceptor) with public health expertise and experience to guide the practicum work. (See \"Preceptor Requirements\" below.) Take place in a location approved for student travel (UNC Travel Policy (https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/ GillingsMPHPracticum/Shared%20Documents/Website/June %202022%20Practicum%20Website%20Updates/UNC%20Travel %20Policy/)), and the student must complete UNC Gillings International Pre-Departure Travel Requirements (https:// sph.unc.edu/global-health/global-travel-toolkit-2/) prior to travel if applicable. Comprise a minimum of 200 hours (equivalent to ve weeks of full- time work). Comprehensive Exam (Master's Written Exam) A milestone degree requirement for all graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill, including M.P.H. students at the Gillings School of Public Health, is the comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam will cover the public health foundational knowledge and competencies covered in the M.P.H. Core courses: SPHG 711, 712, 713, 721, 722. Students will have an opportunity to demonstrate synthesis and higher order learning of the 22 core competencies achieved in the M.P.H. Core courses during the exam. The written exam will be administered in SPHG 722 and graded by Gillings faculty. Clear instructions on how to prepare for and complete the comprehensive exam will be provided. Should students not successfully pass the comprehensive exam a remediation plan will be developed. Students cannot retake the comprehensive exam for 90 days after the initial exam and must be registered in at least one credit while taking the comprehensive exam. Culminating Experience (Thesis Substitute) M.P.H. students must have permanent grades in all M.P.H. Core or concentration courses before taking the culminating experience (992) course. An Incomplete in any M.P.H. Core or concentration course will prevent a student from beginning the culminating experience (992) course. Each student completes a 3-credit culminating experience and produces a high-quality written product that is completed in the last term of the program of study. The high-quality written product demonstrates a synthesis of two foundational and two concentration- specic competencies appropriate to the student's educational and professional goals. This culminating experience ideally is delivered in a manner that is useful to external stakeholders, such as nonprot or governmental organizations, and could take the form of a course- based capstone project or master's paper but will be tailored to the concentration a student chooses. Academic Advising and Faculty Mentoring We are committed to providing quality academic advising and mentoring for all students. We ensure that M.P.H. students get the guidance theyneed with several components: 1) an orientation program that provides an overview of the types and sources of M.P.H. advising; 2) cohort advising sessions in year 1 to disseminate information that is relevant to course planning and registration (one-on-one advising is available to students at any point). One-on-one advising in year two as students prepare for graduation; 3) faculty mentoring that provides students with tailored support for their academic, professional, personal development, and practicum support. M.P.H. students will complete a 14-credit-hour Integrated Core taught by an interdisciplinary team of instructors. The 6-credit rst semester focuses on understanding public health issues, and the second semester, 8-credit focuses on creating solutions to those issues. All M.P.H. students complete COMPASS (Core Online Modules to Promote and Accelerate Student Success). These self-paced online modules are open for students prior to their rst academic year. Students can complete any and all parts of COMPASS up to and including the rst week of class. Electives Students in the M.P.H. program are required to take 9 credits of elective coursework. Students are expected to use their electives in a thoughtful way to strengthen their public health knowledge/skills and are encouraged to consult with their academic coordinator early prior to the registration period for this purpose. In addition to those courses offered in the Gillings School there are many appropriate electives elsewhere in the University.

Residency Requirements Exit Survey Contact Information Public Health Leadership Program Visit Program Website (http://www.sph.unc.edu/phlp/) Director Anna P. Schenck632 Department of Public Policy (GRAD) DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY (GRAD) Research and Faculty Expertise UNC Public Policy faculty members have strengths in seven broad areas of policy research: Education and Labor Markets Public policy research in the area of education policy includes evaluation of policies, programs, and schools in K-12 education, early childhood education, and post-secondary education. In addition, faculty interests include how educational policies affect inequality in student, teacher, and school outcomes. Other topics on labor markets in the United States include policies that impact working families, tax policies, self- employment, professional/occupational licensing, and the link between higher education and the labor market. (Related faculty: Alinor, Davis, Gitterman, Handa, Hemelt, Lauen, Moulton) Environment and Human Welfare Public policy research in the area of environment and human welfare (including health) focuses on climate change, energy policy, and environmental and natural resource management policies in national, state, and developing country contexts. (Related faculty: Handa, Hsu) Business and Public Policy; Entrepreneurship and Innovation UNC Public Policy's goals in this area is to facilitate research and teaching at the intersection of business, government, and society. The technological, political, economic, and institutional environment of business creates challenges for policymakers and society. Globalization, the rise of the digital economy, and the emergence of new industries and organizational forms, along with calls for (re)regulation and the need to alleviate inequality, require a rm grounding in economics, organization theory, and strategic management. New conceptual frameworks, theoretical advances, and rigorous empirical analysis are required to craft better strategies for integrating policy considerations into general managerial thinking. To that end, the research focus is on various topics in innovation, entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, science and technology, and strategic management and their resulting implications on public policy. (Related faculty: Bao, Moulick) Social Policy and Inequality Public policy research focuses on the ways that social policies ameliorate or exacerbate disparities within and between groups. Specic research expertise includes social safety-net policies, innovative policy incentives (such as cash transfer incentives in developing countries), marriage, and women's reproductive health and rights. This area also includes the study of politically relevant identity groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities groups, low-income individuals, women, members of LGBTQ* communities, and immigrants. Policy, Bioethics, and Human Rights Public policy research in health policy \u2014 domestically and globally \u2014 includes a focus on mental health and substance abuse; maternal, reproductive, and infant health; AIDS and infectious disease control; environmental health; health insurance and managed care; and biomedical and behavioral research. Much of this research is focused onimproving health behaviors and outcomes, reducing health inequalities, understanding the economic and institutional basis of effective policies, and exploring ethical and rights-based approaches to Meier, Rubalcaba) International Development Public policy research in this area explores the interplay between economics, politics, and human rights approaches in shaping development policy. Specic topics include the household and community determinants of human capital investment; the impact of social programs and policies on poverty, migration, and human development; household barriers to labor market participation; drivers of civil conflict; corruption; natural resource governance; poverty and environment trade-offs and synergies; energy poverty; aid accountability; public opinion regarding foreign direct investment; the human right to health. (Related faculty: Guttierez, Handa, Meier, Seim, Sullivan) Global Conflict and Cooperation Public policy research in this area includes challenges where the causes and consequences extend beyond the borders of any one country. Faculty study how effectively national governments, transnational organizations, and the institutions of global governance respond to these global issues. Specic areas of expertise include the impact of international/regional economic integration on labor standards; the effects of foreign economic and military aid; external interventions into domestic armed conflicts; how international law affects public health, international accountability, and anti-corruption efforts; international migration; and international cooperation to address critical issues.

Seminar (3 credits) The accelerated dual bachelor's-graduate degree requires an internship and a Maymester seminar. Students should complete the required internship during the summer (preferably) or fall and spring semester (if necessary). The internship allows students to gain experience and apply their knowledge to signicant problems in the public, private, or non-prot sectors. M.P.P. students also apply analytical and professional skills in a nal capstone policy project. Doctor of Philosophy UNC Public Policy offers the Ph.D. degree to students who aim to contribute new knowledge and address major domestic and global policy challenges. The Ph.D. in public policy combines core foundations in theory, empirical and normative analysis, and a policy eld area. The core curriculum is designed to help each doctoral student develop and use appropriate theoretical and analytical approaches to address problems in policy areas such as education and labor markets; environment and human welfare; innovation and entrepreneurship/science and technology policy; social policy and inequality; health policy, bioethics, and human rights; international development policy; and global conflict and cooperation. Degree Requirements Core Courses Once enrolled, each student completes a set of doctoral-level core courses in applications of interdisciplinary social science theory to public policy issues as well as research design, appropriate research methods (including econometrics), and a specialization in a particular subject area of public policy. Doctoral students are required to complete 47 hours of coursework, including 29 hours in core courses common to all students634 Department of Public Policy (GRAD) and 18 hours in a self-dened policy specialization eld. Core courses include Code Title Hours PLCY 800 Mathematical Preparation for Public Policy and Economics3 PLCY 801 Design of Policy-Oriented Research 3 PLCY 810 Public Policy Seminar (2 semesters) 2 PLCY 816 Politics and Public Policy Theory 3 PLCY 817 Institutional Analysis for Public Policy 3 PLCY 880 Normative Dimensions of Policy Analysis and Research: Theories, Methods, and Ethical Foundations3 HPM 881 Linear Regression Models 3 PLCY 882 Advanced Panel Data Methodology for Public Policy3 PLCY 888 Advanced Economic Analysis for Public Policy I 3 PLCY 889 Advanced Economic Analysis for Public Policy II 3 Total Hours 29 Students who have successfully completed graduate courses elsewhere that approximate these required courses may petition to have up to nine such hours counted toward the Ph.D. in public policy. Courses proposed for transfer must be approved as part of the student's program within the department, and material from those courses may be included as part of the comprehensive doctoral examinations. Students normally spend two years in full-time course work, and somewhat longer if they enter the program without key prerequisite courses or a master's degree in a related eld. A dissertation is required. Policy Field Each student designs an individual course of study for a policy eld. The 18-credit-hour requirement gives students rigorous training in the theory, methods, and subject matter within a substantive policy eld. The eld area course of study must include both doctoral-level understanding of the subject matter of the policy area and at least three hours of research methods, in addition to the econometrics sequence (HPM 881 and PLCY 882) and research design course (PLCY 801) required for the core. Students take no less than nine credit hours of courses related to the theory and subject matter of their policy eld; up to six hours of credits may be taken as independent studies. The remaining six hours of the required policy eld credits are normally completed as PLCY 992 and PLCY 994 during master's and dissertation research. The student's additional research methods course should provide her or him with the ability to design and carry out dissertation research and to continue making scholarly contributions in his or her chosen eld. Each student is assisted by an individualized program committee in identifying courses, independent readings, and other sources of information to acquire both the substantive knowledge and the quantitative and other analytical skills appropriate for the student's policy eld. Master's Requirements The M.A. in public policy is available as an option for students who are opting to exit the Ph.D. program prior to completing all requirements for the PhD. In such cases, the student must meet departmental and Graduate School degree requirements for a master's degree, including 30 earned credit hours, two full semesters of residence credit, passing an exam requirement, and completing a thesis or (thesis substitute) project.For students choosing to exit with the M.A., the 30 credit hours will be earned through core and elective courses, generally completed in the student's rst two years in the program. Students must take and pass the written core exam and complete a thesis to earn the M.A. credential. Students nearing completion of their core courses and intending to exit the program without completing the Ph.D. may petition the director of graduate studies to write an approved thesis substitute with an oral exam defense. The oral defense will occur before at least three committee members and will cover appropriate core course material from the program in lieu of sitting for the written core exam. The thesis substitute format will be determined by agreement between the student and the faculty committee and may include a literature review or discussion/research paper. Students who decide to exit the program by completing these latter M.A. requirements may not later choose to continue for the Ph.D. without taking and passing the core written exam. Graduate Minor Doctoral and master's students not enrolled in the Ph.D. program in public policy may elect to minor in public policy. Requirements for the minor include 15 hours of approved coursework in public policy for doctoral students, or nine credits for master's students, approved by the director of graduate studies in public policy and the student's major department. These credits may not be double-counted as courses required for the student's major degree. Professors Daniel P.

GittermanUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 641 DEPARTMENT OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES (GRAD) The graduate program in religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill deals with religion both as a distinctive human experience and as a mode of culture, history, and society. Both orientations dene religion as a broad area of human existence, and students are encouraged to explore the tension between those two general approaches. The interests of the department's faculty express the variety of methodological orientations to this study. Faculty members in other departments of the University offer strong interdisciplinary support. The Graduate School of the University offers two degrees in religious studies: the master of arts and the doctor of philosophy. All students are admitted to the doctoral program and requirements depend on whether the entering student has been awarded a master's degree in religious studies or an afliated discipline prior to matriculating at UNC. The Department of Religious Studies also sponsors the joint Duke-UNC Graduate Certicate in Middle East Studies. The Ph.D. program is primarily intended to prepare students for a career in university and college teaching and research in religious studies. It currently offers specialization in ancient Mediterranean religions, Islamic studies, medieval and early modern studies, religion in the Americas, religion and culture, and religions of Asia. A.

Students apply directly to the Ph.D. program. All students in the Ph.D. program may receive the M.A. degree en route after completing satisfactorily all of the second-year requirements. Each Romance studies graduate program offers advanced literary and interdisciplinary training guided by a vibrant community of scholars representing the wide range and complexity of trends and schools that constitute the study of the humanities today. We offer three concentrations within the Ph.D. in Romance studies: French and Studies (https://romancestudies.unc.edu/graduate/programs/ italian/ ) Literatures, Languages, and Cultures of the Iberian Peninsula and Latina America (https://romancestudies.unc.edu/graduate/ programs/spanish/) We also offer a dual-track option in Hispanic Linguistics (https:// romancestudies.unc.edu/graduate/programs/hispanic-linguistics/). For this program, students will need to apply to both the Department of Romance Studies and the Department of Linguistics. Research Facilities The Walter Royal Davis and Wilson Libraries' Spanish, French, and Italian collections rank in the top 20 in the nation. The Spanish and Spanish American collections are particularly strong in medieval, Golden Age/ Colonial, and 19th- and 20th-century holdings. The French collection has similar strengths in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and is enriched by the Charles Nodier and Ren\u00e9 Char materials. The Italian collection exhibits strength in the 19th century. These strengths are enhanced by extensive holdings in reference, specialized journals, and rare books. Among the latter are a notable gathering of 20th-century rst editions of French writers, a distinguished Spanish drama collection of more than 26,000 plays (many of them pre-1830 sueltas ), and the Flatow Collection of Latin American Cronistas, consisting of early imprints of the discovery and conquest of the New World. For students applying to the doctoral program with the M.A. in hand, appropriate placement and course transfer will be determined on a case- by-case basis by the director of graduate studies in consultation with the graduate advisors. The department may transfer up to nine courses (27 credits) into the Ph.D. program. Students transferring a total of six courses (18 credits) may have the second-year qualifying exams and the research paper (thesis substitute) requirements waived.

Admission into the M.S.W. program is based on an evaluation of the applicant's transcripts, references, written statement of interest in the eld, prior experience, and readiness to undertake graduate professional education. To be considered for admission, the applicant must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, preferably with a broad liberal arts preparation in social and biological sciences and the humanities. In the admissions process for the Ph.D. program, students are asked to provide evidence of A master's degree in social work from a school accredited by the Council on Social Work Education or, less preferably, in a related discipline Academic ability, as demonstrated in academic achievement Writing ability, as demonstrated in a writing sample Commitment to the values, goals, and purposes of the social work profession Professional experience in human services, and A direction for and commitment to scholarly work congruent with the objectives and resources of the doctoral program. The M.S.W. Program Students complete the M.S.W. generalist curriculum of 29 credit hours that covers content related to human behavior and the social environment, institutionalized discrimination, social work practice, social policy, and research. In the evidence-informed practice specialization curriculum, students choose among two concentrations for an additional 33 academic credit hours: the community, management and policy practice concentration (CMPP), and the direct practice concentration (DP). The CMPP concentration prepares students for advanced social work practice related to administration, management, and community and policy practice. The DP concentration prepares students for advanced social work practice with individuals, families, and groups. In both the M.S.W. generalist and specialization curriculum, students also enroll in eld education in addition to their classroom-based coursework. In eld education, M.S.W. students are placed in more than 250 government, nonprot, and other human services agencies each semester of their studies. Through these eld placements, students receive hands-on experience working in a wide array of practice areas such as anti-poverty programs, child welfare, community and program development, family violence, healthcare, behavioral health, among others. Students develop coherent and cohesive plans of study to meet their M.S.W. degree requirements in consultation with faculty advisors. They select courses to meet their individual professional and educational goals, while also meeting the academic requirements of their concentration. In addition, students can explore content outside of their concentration and use elective credits to pursue learning goals related to diverse areas of interest.The typical time for degree completion is four semesters of full-time study. However, graduates of undergraduate social work programs that are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education who meet specic course and admissions requirements are eligible to apply for the advanced standing program. In the advanced standing program, students fulll the degree requirements in 12 months beginning in May of each year. Additionally, students can earn a M.S.W. degree via a three-year program offered at UNC-Chapel Hill. In the rst year, students take two courses each semester. In the second year of this program, students take two courses each semester, participate in a eld seminar, and complete 16 hours per week. Their nal year, students in this program complete the specialization curriculum. The School of Social Work also offers one off-campus program that is located in Winston-Salem. Students in this program complete M.S.W. degree requirements over the course of three years. The rst two years of M.S.W. study take place at the off-campus program site. In the rst year, students take two courses each semester. In the second year of this program, students take two courses each semester, participate in a eld seminar, and complete 16 hours per week in a eld placement each semester. In the nal year, students complete the degree as full-time students on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. The Ph.D.Program The Ph.D. program curriculum is grounded in core courses designed to understand, analyze, and intervene in social problems. Thorough training is offered in theory, research methodology, data analysis, and intervention development and testing. Students design their program of study to focus on a social problem of interest and are matched with faculty mentors to guide them in their work. Students publish, apply for grant funding, and complete a teaching practicum. They have rich opportunities for both independent teaching and research. Following the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.

Programs of study are available at the master's level in speech-language pathology. Programs of study at the doctoral level are available in clinical audiology (Au.D.) and in research (Ph.D.). The study of speech and hearing requires knowledge in both normal and atypical speech, language, and hearing. The speech and hearing sciences curriculum provides a multifaceted learning environment, including classroom, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Three major tracks of study are possible within the curriculum: audiology, speech-language pathology, and speech and hearing sciences. There are three academic degree programs: 1.A master's degree (M.S.) for entry-level clinical practice of 2.A professional doctorate in clinical audiology (Au.D.) 3.A Ph.D. in speech and hearing sciences for students with a background in speech-language pathology or audiology and related areas who desire a research degree All of these programs are interdisciplinary in nature, involving clinical and research activities with other University departments and centers in addition to the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences. The entrance, academic, and residency requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees correspond to those of The Graduate School. Applicants to the Au.D. program follow the guidelines established by the School of Medicine for that degree program. Students enrolled in clinical degree programs (M.S. and Au.D.) are prepared to meet licensure and certication requirements necessary for the practice of speech-language pathology or audiology. Additional information describing the graduate programs in speech and hearing can be obtained on the division's website (http://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/sphs/).

Contact Information Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences Visit Program Website (http://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/sphs/)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 703 DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH (GRAD) The department offers the master of science (M.S.) in statistics, analytics, and data science (STANDS) and doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in statistics and operations research (STOR). The M.S. program is intended for students who wish to pursue careers in data science and analytics or as a preparation for continuing on to further graduate studies in related areas. This program focuses on training students in advanced quantitative thinking due to the increasing demand for skills in data-driven decision making in the modern world. It is possible for motivated students to complete the requirements in three semesters, though the typical duration is four. For students graduating with an undergraduate STAN degree, there is also an option of ve-year M.S.-STANDS program. The Ph.D. degree in STOR is designed for students planning a career in teaching or research. The educational and research prole of the STOR Ph.D. program is focused on the core disciplines of statistics, optimization, probability, and stochastic modeling. These disciplines have driven, and continue to drive, progress in data science and machine learning, as well as business and medical analytics. The STOR Department is one of the few in the U.S. that brings together experts in each of these disciplines under one academic roof. STOR offers a rigorous but flexible interdisciplinary Ph.D. program within which students can benet from the strength and diverse expertise of the department's core faculty, while also having the opportunity to interact with domain scientists and researchers working in other elds. STOR Ph.D. students complete foundational coursework in the four core disciplines before undertaking more specialized coursework and directed dissertation research. Dissertation research is completed under the supervision of one or more faculty advisers. Research topics may lie within a single core discipline, or may span several core disciplines. Many research topics involve interdisciplinary research, with active collaboration with faculty and students at UNC including Environmental Sciences, Biology, the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Computer Science, Biostatistics, Economics, and the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences, as well as industry in the Research Triangle Park and across the U.S. The breadth and depth of the STOR Ph.D. program prepares graduates for a wide variety of careers, ranging from academia to industry, and from the public to the private sector. Recent graduates have taken jobs in mathematics, statistics, IE, OR departments, and high- tech, biotech companies, and government agencies, etc. The Ph.D. degree requires at least three (but usually ve) years of full-time graduate study, predicated upon substantial undergraduate mathematical preparation. Research is a central component in the work of doctoral candidates. Research training consists of required core coursework as well as electives that are designed to bring students up to date in their research eld and intensive one-on-one work with a faculty member on a specic dissertation topic. Doctoral students who want to pursue academic careers are provided with ample opportunities to teach introductory undergraduate courses, and they are given extensive training to develop their instructional skills. Doctoral students may also participate in paid internships with local industrial employers to gain experience in a business environment. Their professional skills are further enhanced by work on real-world projects with clients in the department's consultingcourses. Several courses provide opportunities for students to give technical presentations and rene their communication skills. Further information on the graduate degree programs can be obtained from the department's website (https://stor.unc.edu/programs/). Admissions and Financial Aid Admission to the department is highly competitive, and preference is given to applicants who have solid technical preparation. Although the department welcomes promising students from all disciplines, entering students must have a substantial mathematical background and applicants must satisfy the entrance requirements of The Graduate School. A student admitted with a deciency in any area must make up for it at the beginning of her or his graduate work. If the deciency is not severe, this can be accomplished without interrupting the normal program. Application form (http://gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) Students can indicate on this application form (http:// gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/ ) whether they intend to pursue the M.S. degree program or a Ph.D. Funding basics (https://gradschool.unc.edu/funding/basics/ fundingbasics.html ) including links for nancial aid are provided by The Graduate School. Most of our Ph.D. students receive some form of nancial support, such as Graduate School fellowships, departmental assistantships, research assistantships, or internships. Departmental assistantships involve grading or teaching an undergraduate course. Some of our students are supported as research assistants by faculty. Our supported students receive a tuition and fee waiver, and health insurance for the duration of their studies. Degree Requirements M.S. Program The M.S. degree requires 30 credit hours of coursework and the completion of a master's project. Students can choose from a variety of courses, including a limited number from outside the department. Upon approval of The Graduate School, at most six credit hours may be transferred from another accredited institution or from within UNC- Chapel Hill for courses taken before admission to the M.S. program. Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. degree requires at least 45 semester hours of graduate coursework and the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation. Detailed information about specic courses, elective courses and allowable courses outside of the STOR department as well as potential course plans based on interests of accepted students are provided on the graduate admissions section of the program's website (http://stat- or.unc.edu/programs/statistics/phd/). Statistics Courses for Students From Other Disciplines A number of STOR courses in probability and statistics are of potential interest to students in other disciplines. At the advanced undergraduate/ beginning graduate level, STOR 455 and STOR 556, provide an introduction to applied statistics, including regression, analysis of variance, and time series. STOR 435, STOR 535, and STOR 555 provide introductions to probability theory and mathematical statistics,704 Department of Statistics and Operations Research (GRAD) respectively, at a postcalculus level while courses like STOR 538 and 572 describe applications of the discipline to fundamental areas such as sports analytics and healthcare analytics. The three graduate course sequences-(STOR 664, STOR 665), (STOR 654, STOR 655), and ( STOR 634, STOR 635)-provide comprehensive introductions to modern applied statistics, theoretical statistics, and probability theory, respectively, at a more mathematical level. In each case it is possible to take only the rst course in the sequence. Concerning mathematical prerequisites, STOR 664 and STOR 665 require a background in linear algebra and matrix theory, while the remaining courses require a solid background in real analysis.

The curriculum is an interdisciplinary program, and its faculty is drawn from various administrative units of the schools of medicine, pharmacy, and public health. The training faculty also includes scientists at government laboratories on campus or in the Research Triangle Park (e.g., EPA, NIEHS). The research interests of the faculty include most areas of toxicology, with particular emphasis on understanding the links between the environment and health risks, the mode of action of toxicants and disease pathogenesis, and how emerging knowledge could be translated into prevention strategies, new therapeutic interventions, and an improved scientic basis for risk assessment. The main areas of research concentration are molecular carcinogenesis, mechanistic toxicology, neurotoxicology, cardiopulmonary toxicology, hepatic toxicology, computational toxicology, developmental toxicology, immunotoxicology, drug and xenobiotic metabolism, and ethanol toxicology. Multidisciplinary efforts are directed at environmental toxicology, systems biology, animal models of human diseases, translational research, and biomarkers. The faculty generally does not conduct research in the areas of aquatic toxicology, forensic toxicology, the ecological aspects of toxicology, or studies in invertebrate systems. The research activities of the Curriculum in Toxicology are conducted in the laboratory facilities assigned to each faculty member by a participating administrative unit. Applications Students with interest in the Ph.D. degree in toxicology must apply for Graduate School admission through the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program. Applications are considered from students who have received or expect to receive a B.S./B.A. or an M.S. degree in a scientic discipline. A desirable background for predoctoral studies in toxicology includes courses in biological sciences (including histology and animal physiology), in chemistry (including analytical and organic), and in mathematics through calculus, although all of these are not absolutely essential. A strong course in general biochemistry accelerates the student's progress. Applicants are evaluated on the basis of undergraduate (and graduate) academic performance, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, and letters of recommendation. Students are accepted on the basis of their achievement and potential. Prior research experience is strongly considered in the assessment of qualications for admission. Financial Aid The curriculum seeks to fund predoctoral students each year. All applicants are considered for nancial aid awards. Doctor of Philosophy The selection of graduate courses for the Ph.D. degree is influenced by the student's prior academic background. The academic courses that are considered appropriate for graduate training in toxicology include biochemistry, biostatistics, pathology, pharmacology, toxicology, and two elective courses in the specic areas of the doctoral research. In addition, each predoctoral student is expected to participate in other trainingactivities (i.e., student-centered seminars and scientic meetings) while developing the doctoral dissertation project. Attendance and participation in the Curriculum in Toxicology seminar series is required during the entire training period. A major requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a doctoral dissertation based on the development of the student's research project. Written and oral examinations are required in the elds of general toxicology and the student's research concentration. Professors Louise M.

The program advises undergraduate students considering a graduate degree in various disciplines (sciences, arts and humanities, social sciences, and professional arenas). These advisors can help clarify the differences between a doctorate and a master's degree and the opportunities a terminal degree may offer. The program is primarily responsible for helping students considering graduate school understand what their next steps are in researching and applying to graduate programs, so that they can move forward independently and effectively. Students can schedule a pre-grad coaching appointment by visiting Handshake (https://careers.unc.edu/students/resources/schedule-appointment/).

This holistic approach complements classroom experiences and lays the foundation for students to become better prepared to succeed in life beyond college. Graduate Student Housing. Carolina Housing recognizes that the living needs of graduate and professional students are usually different from those of undergraduates. At Carolina, graduate and professional students can enjoy the benets of being affordably close to classes, facilities, and events, and living in a community of fellow graduate students where the atmosphere is characterized by early quiet hours and respect for personal time and space. Baity Hill Graduate and Family Housing (https://housing.unc.edu/live/ explore-the-halls/graduate-and-family-housing/) is Carolina's on-campus community for graduate students providing apartment-style housing. The property houses students with families and graduate students with roommates. This one- and two-bedroom apartment community is situated on rolling hills adjacent to the campus. The apartments are within walking distance of the campus and are served by campus and city bus routes. Rental costs compare favorably with similar area housing. Parking is available for graduate students on a limited basis, and a fare- free campus bus service offers several routes that connect the north, middle and south regions of campus. Find specications for apartments by visiting the Carolina Housing website (https://housing.unc.edu/live/ explore-the-halls/graduate-and-family-housing/). Generally, demand for on-campus housing for graduate students exceeds the supply. On-campus housing is not guaranteed for graduate students, although every effort is made to offer a space to all applicants. Returning residents have priority to re-contract for the following academic year before spaces are offered to new graduate students. Additional information is available on the Carolina Housing website (https:// housing.unc.edu/live/explore-the-halls/graduate-and-family-housing/). Off-Campus Graduate Student Housing.

Student Government The by-laws of the Board of Trustees of the University invest in the chancellor of the University \"the duty . . . to exercise full authority in the regulation of student conduct and in matters of student discipline.\" At the same time the chancellor has delegated authority to exercise disciplinary and administrative functions in student life to agencies of student government. Within the context of this delegated authority and responsibility, the student body at the University has been self-governing for decades. Student government at Carolina is more than 100 years old, and hundreds of students are involved in the various branches every year. From serving on the Board of Trustees to the appropriation, oversight, and authority of student fees, from instituting governmental service to enforcing the Honor Code, student government affects the life of every student every day. The entire framework of student government's activities rests on its ability to maintain the foundation of administrator-student relations. The University should serve as an advisor, not as a supervisor, to the student body. To enjoy this freedom, students at Carolina must be willing to take a certain amount of responsibility to develop their own community and community values. Student government serves to maintain this freedom and the advisory, not supervisory, relationship. In 1876 the Honor System ofcially ended all vestiges of the monitorial system; in 1904 a judicial body, the University Council, was established; in 1938 the Student Legislature was established; and in 1946 a written constitution was approved. In 1968 the coeducational Honor Court was formed out of the Men's Court and Women's Court to hear all Honor Code cases. The Instrument of Student Judicial Governance was ratied and put into operation in 1974, was signicantly revised in 2003, and then amended in 2015 and 2017.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 723 Student government at UNC-Chapel Hill approximates the federal system of government with its three branches: an executive branch, a legislative branch, and a judicial branch. The Executive Branch of Student Government This group (http://execbranch.unc.edu/) serves as the ofcial voice of the student body to the University and broader community, including the town of Chapel Hill and the state of North Carolina. Heading the executive branch is the student body president, assisted by the vice president, the president of the Graduate and Professional Student Government, student body treasurer, student body secretary, the chief of staff, and the senior advisor. As determined by and reflective of the needs of the student body, the president structures his/her cabinet and committees and makes appointments to a wide range of University committees that address those needs and other concerns as they arise during the year. These committees usually include hardship parking, elections board, University services, information technology, student life, minority affairs, rst-year focus council, and public service. Legislative Branch Student Congress is unicameral, consisting of 41 representatives elected by the student body, with the student body president and the student body treasurer serving as nonvoting ex ofcio members. The speaker of the Student Congress is elected from among the 41 representatives. Graduate and professional students and on- and off- campus undergraduates are proportionally represented in the Congress. Student Congress handles considerable legislation and, as one of its primary responsibilities, oversees the student activity fees budget and other student fee areas. Established by student and University committees before approval by the Board of Trustees, a predetermined amount of the fees paid by each student provides the source of funds for Student Congress's annual allocation and subsequent appropriations budgets. These funds are allocated to petitioning student organizations that have received ofcial University recognition. The student body can petition for changes in the student activities fee at any time. Student Congress representatives are elected in the spring for one-year terms, and each member serves on one of three standing committees: nance, rules and judiciary, and student affairs. A fourth committee, ethics, is composed of senior members of the Congress. Judicial Branch There are two major areas that comprise the judicial branch; the rst is responsible for the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance, and the second is responsible for resolving issues related to the Student Code (https://senate.unc.edu/law/ ). The Honor Court hears all cases involving potential violations of the Honor Code. There are separate courts for undergraduate students, graduate students, and students in the Schools of Law, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Business. The Honor Court is organized as follows: Ofce of the Student Attorneys General: The appropriate (undergraduate or graduate) student attorney general investigates all potential violations of the Honor Code. Staff members also present cases to the Honor Court and assist students accused of violating the Honor Code. University Hearings Board: These boards are made up of faculty, staff, and students. The University Hearings Board generally hears appeals of Honor Court cases.Students interested in serving on the Honor Court or the student attorney general's staff should contact the Honor System Ofce at (919) 966-4084 for information about how to apply. Student Supreme Court: This court adjudicates all issues of student constitutional law to be decided under the Student Code. This body most closely lls the traditional judicial branch of government and consists largely of students with previous experience in student government, mediation, and/or law. For Graduate Students The Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) (http:// gpsf.unc.edu ), the ofcial representative of graduate and professional students at the University, is organized based on school, departmental, and curricula organizations. The GPSG provides communication between graduate and professional students, represents graduate and professional students both within and outside the University community, and provides structures capable of dealing with ongoing issues and concerns. It also allocates and administers the funds appropriated to it from student fees. Every duly enrolled graduate and professional student is automatically a member of the GPSG.

The policies and procedures in this section of the catalog include information about course credit; registration and enrollment; attendance, grading, and examination; academic standing, transcripts; and other important information. Regulations and Requirements for Undergraduate Students Students are responsible for observing the procedures, regulations, and requirements of the University as they are set forth here and in other ofcial University publications. This section describes many of the requirements and regulations that apply to undergraduates, but it is not a complete list of all such regulations and requirements. Unless otherwise stated, the regulations described in this section will govern the academic progress of students from their rst year in the General College through their nal semester in the College of Arts and Sciences or one of the undergraduate professional schools. The staff of the University will gladly provide students with detailed information concerning their academic program or academic problems, but this does not relieve any student of individual responsibility for meeting the University's requirements and observing University regulations. Regulations and Requirements for Graduate Students The Graduate School Handbook contains most of the policies and procedures of The Graduate School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Students should become familiar with the material pertaining to their degree programs, and, together with their faculty advisors, make certain that the chosen program of study complies with all policies. If University policies change during the academic year, those changes will appear here.730 Credit and Evaluation CREDIT AND EVALUATION Calculation of Transferred Semesters Based on the Number of Transferred Credit Hours Several academic procedures, including the determination of academic eligibility, depend on the tally of semesters that students have completed. When credit hours are transferred, a calculation must be made as to the number of semesters the student is regarded as having used up. This calculation is based on the number of credit hours accepted by UNC- Chapel Hill for transfer, not on the number of semesters in which the student was enrolled at other colleges. Excluded from this calculation are transfer hours awarded for courses taken concurrent with high school. Students are regarded as having used up one semester for every full multiple of 15.0 semester credit hours accepted for transfer. When credits are transferred from a college that operates on the quarter-term system, one quarter-term credit hour equals two-thirds of a semester credit hour. See \"Transfer Candidates\" in the \"Undergraduate Admissions (http:// catalog.unc.edu/admissions/undergraduate/)\" section of the Catalog for additional information. The same formula is applied to credit hours that a student earns while enrolled in a part-time program of study at UNC-Chapel Hill, with 90 hours regarded as six semesters and 105 hours regarded as seven semesters. Note: Hours earned in any UNC-Chapel Hill summer term are not included in this formula. The formula also applies to transfer credit hours awarded for any courses taken at other institutions during a fall or spring semester (but not during summer terms) after a student matriculates at UNC-Chapel Hill. Credit by College Board Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or SAT Subject Examinations Students who meet UNC-Chapel Hill standards on certain approved College Board Advanced Placement examinations, examinations of the International Baccalaureate Program, certain SAT Subject Tests (e.g., foreign language), and other tests as listed below, may receive academic credit for comparable University coursework. Each year the Ofce of Undergraduate Admissions publishes (https://admissions.unc.edu/ credit/credit/test-and-placement-credit/) the minimum scores necessary for the awarding of course credit (also listed below for AP and IB exams); however, nal authority for awarding this placement credit lies with the chair of the department or curriculum in which credit is to be received. Minimum scores for placement may change from year to year. Regulations for credit in the year in which the student began study at UNC-Chapel Hill as a full-time student determine the standards that apply, not the year in which the student took the examination. Such credit will not be contingent upon the completion of further work in the subject unless specied by an academic department. By-Examination (BE) credit awarded based on a student's scores on the Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, SAT Subject Tests, other tests as listed below, or departmental examinations may be used to fulll General Education requirements. For students admitted as new rst-year or transfer students beginning in fall 2009 or later, the followinglimitations apply to the use of By-Examination (BE) credit in a major or minor: No more than two courses (six to eight credit hours) of BE credit may be used as part of the major core. No more than one BE credit course (three to four credit hours) may be used as part of a minor. Students who wish to enroll in a course for which they have By- Examination credit should discuss their decision with an academic advisor. In the event that a student takes a course for which Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, SAT Subject Test, or other tests as listed below, credit is awarded, the By-Examination credit will be forfeited when the course is completed.

English Beginning in fall 2012, the English and Comparative Literature department started offering a new foundation course, ENGL 105, which took the place of ENGL 101 and 102. All students entering in fall 2012 and beyond are required to take this course; there is no exemption through test placement . For additional information on English placement, please see the department's website (https://englishcomplit.unc.edu/ ). Credit by Departmental Examination Enrolled students who, through individual study or experience, have gained knowledge of the content of undergraduate courses offered by the University may, with the approval of the relevant department and school or college, receive credit (without grade) for such courses by special examination. The student must receive the approval of the department and college/school at least 30 days before the examination is taken, and the examination must be taken before the beginning of the last semester or full summer session before the student's graduation. Policy on Credit for Internships\u2014The College of Arts & Sciences No internship automatically earns academic credit. Students who want academic credit for an internship should contact the director of undergraduate studies in a relevant academic department or curriculum (http://catalog.unc.edu/undergraduate/academic-enrichment/736 Credit and Evaluation internships/ ) before beginning the internship and must complete an internship course in that academic unit. Not all departments and curricula offer internship courses. Internships may not be used to meet the high impact (HI) or experiential education (EE) Gen Ed requirements unless the student earns academic credit for the internship through a department or curriculum. A student must enroll in a course that has been approved as meeting the High Impact or EE requirement in order for an internship to fulll that requirement. Students who must earn academic credit as a condition of doing the internship\u2014and who cannot get credit through an academic department or curriculum\u2014should contact a counselor at University Career Services for possible credit in SPCL 493 before beginning the internship. The student must write a statement describing his or her learning objectives and a paper reflecting on the experience. SPCL 493 is a one-credit, Pass/ Fail course that does not count toward any graduation requirements. Modes of Instruction (College of Arts & Sciences) The University provides ve (5) modes of instruction for undergraduate courses. These include four (4) modes that incorporate remote elements. Since the student learning outcomes are consistent across instruction modes, a course fullls the same degree requirements regardless of the instruction mode. 1.In Person (IP) 2.HyFlex (IR). 3.Remote - Synchronous (RS) 4.Remote - Mostly Asynchronous (RM) 5.Remote - All Asynchronous (RA) The College of Arts & Sciences is committed to providing in-person, residential instruction as the primary experience for undergraduate students. However, there are some specic situations when remote student learning may be benecial or necessary. The college dean, in consultation with the provost, will establish guidelines on both the types of courses that can be offered and the specic situations when courses can be offered in a remote format (modes 2-5). In addition, senior associate deans, in consultation with the dean of the college, will establish guidelines on both the types of courses that can be offered and the specic situations when courses can be offered in a remote format (modes 2-5). They will also set limits on how many and in which cases remote classes can be offered every semester. Instructors will need approval from their department chair to offer remote classes (modes 2- 5). Global Language Placement Credit For General Education Purposes: Students may complete their General Education global language requirement through one of the below means: Completion of a level 3 or higher language course at UNC approved for the global language requirement. Veried completion of two or more years of secondary education primarily taught in a language other than English . Veried completion of two or more semesters of higher education (dened as the equivalent of 24 eligible for transfer credit hours) primarily taught in a language other than English. Completion of a UNC language placement test in the language with a placement beyond level 3. Non-UNC language exam scores (including AP, IB, and others) submitted to UNC which are approved as credit for level 3 or above. Transfer credit for a language course approved as level 3 or above. Credit for languages not currently taught at UNC will articulate as GENR 203 (level 3) which meets the global language General Education requirement. Placement (PL) credit without hours for level 3 (GENR 203) of a language not currently taught at UNC obtained through the language prociency verication process detailed on the UNC Language Placement website . Every effort is made to verify prociency in any language, but UNC cannot guarantee that an appropriate placement test or language expert will be available for prociency verication in all languages. For the purposes of the above policy, \"language other than English\" includes languages regardless of country of origin, including sign languages and other languages that do not include a written form . Institutions primarily taught in a language other than English do not need to be located outside the United States to qualify under this policy. For Continuing a Language Taught at UNC: Experiential Speakers of a Global Language Enrolled students who have learned a language currently offered at UNC-Chapel Hill by experience (i.e., having grown up speaking another language in the home or having lived several years in another country) and who are conversant and literate in that language and in English, may take a placement test in that language for placement (PL) only and not for credit hours. This placement will determine the student's next UNC course in the language. Native Speakers of a Global Language For academic purposes, a native speaker is a student raised in a country outside the United States and formally educated through all or most of high school in a language other than English. Native speakers cannot use By-Examination (BE) credit in their native language to reduce the requirements for a major in that language and will not receive credit for levels 1 through 4 of their native language(s). However, upon recommendation of the appropriate language department, they may receive credit for courses taken at UNC-Chapel Hill beyond level 4 if those courses are heavily based on literature, lm, culture, or other content. Native speakers of languages other than English may use the above listed options to satisfy their General Education global language requirement. Native speakers who wish to pursue placement (PL) in their language should follow the appropriate department or General Education process on the Language Placement website . Hours of Credit Work is valued and credited toward degrees by semester hours, one such hour usually being awarded for one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours out of class student work each week. One hour of credit is usually awarded for each three hours of laboratory or eld work or work in studio art. For more information on the University's course numbering system, see UPM #4 (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/policies-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 737 procedures/university-policy-memorandums/upm-4-standard-course- numbering-system/ ). For the denition UPM #29 (http://registrar.unc.edu/ academic-services/policies-procedures/university-policy-memorandums/ upm-29-denition-of-a-credit-hour/). Independent Studies for Credit The University offers independent study experiences for undergraduate students. Such courses, including directed readings, internships/ practica, mentored undergraduate research, and senior honors thesis courses for an individual student, are offered for academic credit through departments and curricula. Twelve hours of graded independent study credit may be counted toward graduation (excluding six hours of senior honors thesis credit). No more than 12 hours may be taken in any one semester, with the exception of students completing a full-time teaching internship program in the School of Education and other approved practicum/internship programs in the professional schools. Students may participate in formalized programs, or they may make individual learning contracts for work under the supervision of a member of the permanent faculty at the department/curriculum level. For information about independent study courses in their majors, students should consult the director of undergraduate studies or independent study coordinator in their major department or curriculum. Students, in consultation with the faculty member, must complete a learning contract and have it approved by the director of undergraduate studies (or designee). Registration for an independent study course must be completed after the learning contract has been approved and no later than the last day of \"late registration\" (the end of the second week of classes in fall or spring semester or the equivalent date in each summer session ). A template (http://registrar.unc.edu/ les/2014/02/Template-Adapted-for-Use-in-the-College-of-Arts-and- Sciences.pdf ) for such a learning contract is available online. Students are strongly encouraged to begin this process early, well before the beginning of the semester. For more information, see UPM #30 (https://registrar.unc.edu/academic- services/policies-procedures/university-policy-memorandums/ independent-study-policy/ ). This policy is maintained by the College of Arts and Sciences and Educational Policy Committee. Last revised November 28, 2017. See also Resolution 2012-12 (http://faccoun.unc.edu/ (http://faccoun.unc.edu/les/2011/03/ Res2013-06OnIndependentStudyTFReportFinal.pdf). Semester Schedule UNC-Chapel Hill academic operations are on a semester calendar, primarily divided into the fall and spring semesters with standard course meetings within a 17-week session. Summer School offers two sessions of ve weeks each, a three-week Maymester, and other short courses with various beginning and ending dates. For specic dates, see the University's Academic Calendar (https://registrar.unc.edu/academic- calendar/ ).738 Registration, Enrollment, and Withdrawal REGISTRATION, ENROLLMENT, AND WITHDRAWAL Registration General Policies UNC-Chapel Hill students use the ConnectCarolina Student Center to register for courses. Students should refer to the Registration Guide (http://registrar.unc.edu/guide/) on the Ofce of the University Registrar's website for instructions regarding registration. Students who register during the billing period must pay tuition and fees, or give notice of anticipated aid, to the Ofce of Student Accounts and University Receivables by the published tuition and fees due date or their schedule will be cancelled and all their classes dropped before the beginning of classes. Students who register after the billing period must pay estimated tuition and fees or give notice of anticipated aid before they can register for that semester. Students who register after the date designated for ofcial registration must pay an additional fee of $20.00 for late registration. If the delay results from circumstances clearly beyond the student's control, an appeal may be made in writing to the registrar. The appeal must show sufcient justication for the delay and has to be approved by the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. North Carolina law requires that no person shall attend a college or university in North Carolina without presenting a certicate of immunization to the college or university on or before the rst day of matriculation. This certicate indicates that the student has received immunizations required by law. New students at UNC-Chapel Hill must provide the director of Campus Health Services with an immunization record certied by a physician. Students who fail to present the required certicate of immunization within 30 days of enrollment will be withdrawn from the University. Their enrollment will not be reinstated until they have provided a certicate of immunization to Campus Health Services. Registration for credit for any course at the start of the semester is limited to the rst ve days of classes unless a late registration is approved by the course instructor and the student's dean or academic advisor. Any student who has not registered for courses after the primary billing date will be restricted from accessing the registration system for that term and will be required to submit a prepayment. For more information, please see \"Course Schedule Changes\" below. Registration Advising for First-Year Students and Sophomores All rst-year students and sophomores are assigned a primary academic advisor in the Academic Advising Program in the College of Arts and Sciences but may see any advisor as appropriate. Advisors' names and ofce locations (http://advising.unc.edu/see-an-advisor/ ) are posted on the web. First-year students must meet with an advisor for registration advising at least once during their rst year before registering for their third semester on campus; an online module to assist students with registration, policies, and procedures is also available. All students are strongly encouraged to review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester and regularly meet with an advisor to ensure that they remain on track to graduate.Advisors will answer students' questions and review their tentative course selections to help students achieve appropriate academic progress. In subsequent semesters, students are encouraged to discuss academic progress with their academic advisor. Students should follow instructions received from the Ofce of the University Registrar, which may be accessed by logging on to ConnectCarolina. Registration Advising for Juniors and Seniors Juniors and seniors receive academic advising during registration periods according to the directives set out by their college/professional school and major. Juniors who have not yet declared a major must meet with an advisor in the Academic Advising Program before registration. The department or curriculum in which the student's primary major is housed determines the procedures juniors and seniors must follow for registration. In some cases, the student must meet with a faculty advisor in the department or curriculum of the primary major before being able to register each semester. These advisors answer questions specic to the major and about graduate and career opportunities in the eld. Students admitted to a professional school will receive advising and assistance on all academic matters from an advisor in their school. Academic Level (Class Standing) All students who begin their undergraduate careers at UNC-Chapel Hill are considered rst-year students for the rst and second semesters. In their third semester and thereafter, a student's classication (sophomore, junior, senior) is determined by the cumulative number of credit hours earned: 1-29 credit hours earned: rst-year 30-59 credit hours earned: sophomore 60-89 credit hours earned: junior 90 + credit hours earned: senior Registration Priority A student's rst available date for registration (registration priority) is based on the number of earned credit hours (excluding in progress credits and test credits) and the number of semesters completed. By policy of the Faculty Council (Resolution 2007-3), the University limits students to eight semesters of full-time study. Transfer students who transfer in the UNC-Chapel Hill equivalent of two or more semesters (see \"Calculation of Transferred Semesters Based on the Number of Transfer Hours\") may enroll in up to 10 total semesters (Resolution 2017-1 (https://facultygov.unc.edu/les/2017/01/ Res201701OnMultipleAreasofStudy.pdf)). To help ensure graduation within the eight-semester limit, students' registration priority will include the number of semesters completed in the calculation. Terms in residence are tallied in three ways: 1.UNC-Chapel Hill full-time enrollment Regardless of the number of credit hours, any fall or spring semester of enrollment in UNC-Chapel Hill courses (including UNC-Chapel Hill study abroad courses, but excluding Carolina Courses Online) counts as one semester of full-time study, unless the student is enrolled as a part-time student through Part-Time Classroom Studies. (Summer sessions at UNC-Chapel Hill do not count as semesters.) 2.UNC-Chapel Hill part-time enrollment Each full multiple of 15 cumulative credit hours earned at UNC- Chapel Hill in fall or spring terms (not summer terms) counts as oneUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 739 semester of full-time study for any student enrolled as a part-time student through Part-Time Classroom Studies. 3.Transfer credits awarded for courses taken at other colleges Each full multiple of 15 cumulative transfer-credit hours counts as one semester of full-time study. Excluded from this calculation are transfer hours awarded for courses taken either concurrent with high school or during any summer term after the student has matriculated at UNC-Chapel Hill. Students may refer further questions to the Academic Advising Program (if the student is in the College of Arts and Sciences) or to their respective dean's ofce. Repeating Course Enrollments A student who proceeds with enrollment in a course not designated as repeatable can only earn credit once toward the fulllment of the University's minimum undergraduate degree requirement. The credit is earned from the course with the highest passing grade or, if grades are the same, the latter attempt. The grades of all attempts of the course, however, are computed in the student's cumulative grade point average. Certain University courses (e.g., applied music, special studies, undergraduate research, etc.) may be taken more than once for credit and are so designated in the course catalog as repeatable. A particular physical education activity (PHYA) course may be taken more than once, so long as a different level of the same course (beginning, intermediate, and advanced) is taken during each separate enrollment. PHYA courses do not award academic credit hours toward an undergraduate degree, but the grade is factored into the cumulative grade point average. Students may enroll in no more than one lifetime tness (LFIT) course, and only one LFIT course will count toward academic credit hours for an undergraduate degree. For the purposes of receiving nancial aid, hours for repeated courses will only be considered a part of the total upon which awards are based if: 1.the student is repeating a course previously failed, or 2.the course is the rst repeat of a prior course in which a passing grade (D or higher) was received. Maintained by the Educational Policy Committee. Last approved on April 21, 2017, see Resolution 2017-6 (https://facultygov.unc.edu/les/2017/04/ Res2017-6RepeatingCourseEnroll.pdf). Cancellation of Enrollment A cancellation of enrollment is, in effect, the same as a student not registering. Classes are not reflected on the student's transcript, and no tuition and fees are charged. If a student registered for classes a cancellation is only applicable if there no documentation of student attendance or for the following administrative reasons. A registration cancellation will be processed for any student who has a \"hold\" on the tuition and fees due date for each term, and students will be notied. A cancellation will be processed if a student is not cleared nancially; is not academically eligible to continue in school; or shows a cashier's hold, Ofce of Undergraduate Admissions hold, dean's ofce hold, or Campus Health Services cancellation hold. In some cases, a student may request to cancel his or her registration for personal reasons and may do so by following instructions (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic- services/withdrawals-cancellations/) listed on the Ofce of the University Registrar's website. To request a cancellation after classes begin, however, students must process the cancellation through their academicadvising dean's ofce. For more information also see the sections on withdrawing from the University. Administrative Changes to Course Registration Students have the responsibility to maintain the accuracy of their course schedule. A department or curriculum in the College of Arts and Sciences has the option to drop a course from a student's registration if the student fails to attend both of the rst two class meetings (or the rst class meeting if the course meets only once each week). The appropriate dean's ofce will be responsible for informing departments of students who cannot attend the rst two class meetings because of illness or other reasons approved by a dean. Students should never presume that an instructor or department/curriculum will systematically drop classes from the student's schedule. However, if such an action is taken by a department/curriculum, the registration openings resulting from these drops will be offered to other students seeking enrollment in the courses during the ofcial add period (rst ve days of classes) or thereafter, as determined by the instructor of the class or by the department, curriculum, or school. Departments/curricula can drop students' courses using the computerized registration system prior to the last day to reduce a course load for nancial credit. To effect such a drop after that date but before the end of the eighth week, a student can drop the course through ConnectCarolina. (See \"Course Schedule Changes\" below.) Students who have applied for graduation and who have requested an academic underload must have that request approved to receive nancial credit for reducing their course load. Auditing Courses To audit a class, registered students and persons not registered must obtain a registration/drop/add form from the teaching department offering the class. Permission from the class instructor and the department chair is required and should be indicated on the form with a written signature. This procedure applies to fall, spring, and both summer terms. Requests to audit a class may be submitted only after the end of the ofcial registration period (last day for students to add a class or late register) when it has been determined that there is still space available in the class. This date can be found on the University Registrar's Calendar (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-calendar/) for the specic term. Auditing classes is permitted only in lecture-based courses and never in courses that include laboratories or performances. Auditing is not permitted in courses that focus on the development of written or oral communication skills or that rely heavily on class participation. Auditing is not permitted in independent studies courses, internships, special topics, directed readings, or similar courses. Auditing is also not permitted in classes that are offered primarily online. Students may not audit courses offered through the Friday Center for Continuing Education (Part-Time Classroom Studies, Carolina Courses Online, Self-Paced Courses, or tutorial programs) or courses preparing students for credit by examination. Students auditing a course do not write papers, take quizzes or examinations, or request review of their work, and do not participate in class discussions unless otherwise directed by the course instructor. Students who audit a course may not subsequently receive course credit for that course. Additional information on the University's policy on auditing (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/policies-740 Registration, Enrollment, and Withdrawal procedures/university-policy-memorandums/upm-9-auditing-courses/) is available online. Students ofcially registered for other classes in the same term may audit a class without paying a fee. Persons not registered for classes must pay a $20.00 fee per class to the Ofce of Student Accounts and University Receivables, then bring the permission and receipt to the Ofce of the University Registrar to complete the process. Payments will only be accepted after the end of the ofcial registration period. Effective fall 2017, individuals of age 65 or older may audit a class without paying a fee. If requested, a copy of the registration transaction will be given to the student to provide to the class instructor at the beginning of the term. Changes in Fall and Spring Semester Schedules Continuous Course Enrollment: Foundations English Composition and Foreign Language Requirements Effective in fall 2012, students admitted as rst-year or as transfer students are required to complete ENGL 105 /ENGL 105I (ENGL 100 and ENGL 105 /ENGL 105I , if applicable) during their rst year, and they must maintain continuous enrollment in Foundations global language courses until they have completed this requirement. Students are not permitted to drop ENGL 100 , ENGL 105 /ENGL 105I , or global language levels 1 through 3 being used to fulll the Foundations requirement after the second week of the semester, unless approved by a dean in the Academic Advising Program. Such approval will be for exceptional circumstances only. Students should not stop attending English composition and rhetoric and Foundation global language classes without speaking with a dean in the Academic Advising Program. Course Schedule Changes Insofar as possible, changes in course registration schedules should be made during the rst ve days of classes. During this time, students may add courses using the online registration system. During days six through ten of classes, students must obtain permission to register or make additions to their schedule from the course instructor; if approved, the academic department, curriculum, or school will add the student through the computerized registration system. After the tenth day of classes, if students wish to register or make additions to their schedule, they must obtain a registration/drop/add form from their academic advisor, the concerned department, or their professional school and must obtain the signatures of both their instructor and their school dean (or dean's designee). For students in the General College and the College of Arts and Sciences, only the associate dean for advising (or dean's designee) has this authority. After the tenth day of classes, deans (or deans' designees) will approve only those registrations or course additions that have rst been approved by the instructor. Approval of additions to a student's schedule during this period is at the deans' (or the deans' designees') discretion. Course Schedule Changes during Weeks One and Two During the rst two weeks of classes, students may drop a course using the online registration system, but they are responsible for ensuring that their schedules do not fall below the minimum 12 academic hours required for full-time registration. Course Schedule Changes during Weeks Three through Eight When a course is dropped between the second and eighth week of classes, a notation of WC (withdrawal by choice) shall be recordedand used internally for tracking and reporting purposes. For external purposes, the WC notation is equivalent to the W grade. Once declared, a WC notation cannot be rescinded except when a student withdraws from an entire semester due to extenuating circumstances. All rst-year, rst-time students entering the University in fall 2014 or thereafter are allowed to accumulate no more than 16 hours of WC notations during their undergraduate career. Different drop-add procedures apply to rst-year students who entered the University as degree-seeking students prior to fall 2014, along with sophomore and junior transfer students who entered in fall 2014, and junior transfer students who enter in fall 2015. Details on the previous policy (http://registrar.unc.edu/guide/registration-policies/drop- add-procedures/rules-course-drops/) can be found on the University Registrar's website. Course Schedule Changes after the Eighth Week of Classes: The Appeal Process After the eighth week of classes, students must petition to drop courses through the dean's ofce of the school in which they are enrolled. For students in the General College and the College of Arts and Sciences, the associate dean for advising (or designee) has this authority. To drop a course after the eighth week of classes, students must complete and submit an appeal to the appeals committee of their college or school. In the General College and the College of Arts and Sciences, an appeals committee meets weekly (except the week of July 4 and Christmas). Possible legitimate reasons for requesting a course drop after the eighth week of classes include serious illness, personal or family problems, nancial problems requiring employment after the start of the semester, or other compelling and extenuating circumstances that prevent students from meeting their academic responsibilities. Students must rst discuss their reasons for requesting a late course drop with an academic advisor or their academic dean. The advisor or dean will explain the process for an appeal and refer the student to the online information and link to the online appeal form. The appeal must include a statement from the student and pertinent documentation that provides compelling support for the appeal. The student must submit all documents online to the ofce of the associate dean for advising in the Academic Advising Program of the College of Arts and Sciences and General College. Submission of an appeal does not ensure that the request will be granted, and students must continue to attend classes and complete all assignments until informed of the committee's decision. If a course drop is approved, the registration/drop/add form is processed through the Ofce of the University Registrar. Students enrolled in professional schools should acquaint themselves with the appropriate appeals procedures in their schools. The notation of W (withdrawn) is entered in the grade column of academic transcripts if students are permitted by their school to drop a course after the eighth week of classes or proportional equivalent for summer terms and other nonstandard enrollment periods. This notation is automatically entered unless the student's academic dean species otherwise. Interinstitutional Registration A student regularly enrolled in a degree program at the University may enroll by interinstitutional registration for a course at Duke University, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina State University, theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 741 University of North Carolina at Charlotte, or the University of North Carolina at Greensboro under the following conditions: Space must be available in the course. The student's advisor as well as their academic advising dean's ofce must certify a.that the course is appropriate for the student's degree program, and b.that an equivalent course is not available at this university during the same term. Enrollment in interinstitutional registration is limited to one interinstitutional course per regular term, provided that the student is registered for the balance of her or his full-time load at UNC-Chapel Hill. All enrollment transactions must be processed by the Ofce of the University Registrar. A student will be billed by his or her home institution for all the courses taken (including interinstitutional courses) at the prevailing tuition rate. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will receive no fees from an interinstitutional student taking courses at this campus unless there is a special fee associated with a particular course. In such a case, the student must pay the fee. The last day for a student to submit an interinstitutional request to the Ofce of the University Registrar will be the last day to add a course without departmental approval, according to the registrar's calendar. If a student is interested in a course that begins after this deadline, due to differing university schedules, or separate modules that the course is being offered in, the deadline will be the fth day after the start of that class. Start dates will be veried with the school offering the course. Students must comply with the academic calendar of their home institution for all dates, such as deadlines for adding and dropping courses. A student taking a course by interinstitutional registration will be graded in the course in accordance with the grading system of the institution where the course is taken, and grades will be converted in accordance with the grading system of the home institution. The transcript will identify the institution where the course was taken in the space where the descriptive course title is normally shown. Additional information (http://registrar.unc.edu/guide/special- enrollments/inter-institutional-programs/), procedural instructions, and forms are available at the Ofce of the University Registrar's website. Academic Course Load Fall and Spring Semesters To meet the minimum graduation requirement of 120 academic hours within the eight-semester limit, students should average 15 hours each semester. However, four-hour foreign language courses and four-hour laboratory science courses often account for course loads of 16 to 18 hours. Students may not enroll in more than 18 academic hours unless they have earned a 3.000 grade point average in the preceding regular semester and have a cumulative 2.500 grade point average. Exceptions require the approval of the student's dean. With approval of their dean, seniors meeting graduation requirements during their nal semester in residence may enroll in up to 21 academic hours if they have a cumulative and preceding semester grade point average of 2.000. The minimum course load for a single semester is 12 academic hours. Students may not go below the 12-academic-hour minimum without permission of their dean. All students should discuss semesterenrollment of fewer than 15 academic hours with their advisor because such enrollments may affect academic eligibility and the ability to complete all degree requirements in the required eight semesters. The approved maximum course load for students in a part-time program is eight credit hours in a fall, spring, or summer term. Summer School The summer term begins with the rst day of Maymester and continues through the last day of the Summer Session II. Administered by Summer School, summer courses are offered in two sessions (Summer Session I and Summer Session II), with a Maymester period overlapping the rst three weeks of Summer Session I. For UNC-Chapel Hill students, credit hours and grades count the same as in fall or spring terms. For visiting students, transfer of grades or credit is determined by their home institution. The typical full course load is two courses, usually six credit hours. However, effective Summer 2021, students may enroll in up to nine credit hours each in Summer Session I and in Summer Session II. It is recommended that, if students enroll in a Maymester course, they not enroll in a second Maymester or Summer Session I class. Pass/Fail Option The Pass/Fail option provides students an opportunity to enroll in an additional course (beyond the usual load of ve academic courses) or to reduce their concerns about competing with prospective majors in a course in which they have considerable interest. Students who declare a course on the Pass/Fail option will receive the grade of PS (pass) when a letter grade of A through D is recorded on the ofcial grade roster and F when the course is failed. For the purpose of computing a grade point average, a PS grade does not count as hours attempted; therefore, a PS grade does not affect a student's grade point average. However, an F under the Pass/Fail option counts as hours attempted and is treated in the same manner as F grades earned in any other course. Course content and requirements are the same for Pass/Fail registrants as for regular registrants. The minimum performance for a PS grade is equivalent to the minimum performance for the letter grade of D. Regulations Governing the Pass/Fail Option The following regulations govern the use of the Pass/Fail option: 1.Students may only take one student-elected Pass/Fail course each semester. 2.No more than 23 total credit hours of Pass/Fail credit hours will be allowed in a student's undergraduate career, with no more than 16 hours (of the 23) from student-elected Pass/Fail classes and no more than 13 hours (of the 23) from established Pass/Fail courses. 3.The following courses may not be declared Pass/Fail: Courses used to satisfy General Education requirements (this does not apply to General Education courses that are only offered as Pass/Fail courses, such as Lifetime Fitness, College Thriving, and some forms of EE/High-Impact courses) . Courses a student has taken previously for a letter grade. Courses in a student's major or minor department or curriculum (or cross-listed with those departments or curricula), even if used as an elective. However, students who change their major (or minor) may count in the new major (or minor) one course previously completed with the grade PS.742 Registration, Enrollment, and Withdrawal Courses specically required by the major or minor, including foreign language courses and any additional required courses (but see the note below) Summer School courses An honors seminar or honors course Courses taken via interinstitutional enrollment First-year seminars Note: Prerequisites to courses specically required for the major or minor may be taken Pass/Fail unless a specic grade is required in the prerequisite course. Maintained by the Educational Policy Committee. Last approved on October 30, 2015, see Resolution 2015-12 (http://faccoun.unc.edu/les/2011/03/ Res2015-12Pass-Fail_Final.pdf). Pass/Fail Declaration Procedure To declare a course on the Pass/Fail grading system, a student must complete the Pass/Fail course declaration form. Students should discuss the advisability of taking a course on the Pass/Fail grading system with their advisor before committing themselves to a formal declaration. The period for making Pass/Fail declarations begins on the fth day of classes of each semester and concludes at the end of the eighth week of classes. Pass/Fail declaration forms may not be submitted after the eighth week of classes. Tuition Guarantee Program Effective fall 2016, undergraduate students seeking a baccalaureate degree at UNC-Chapel Hill are eligible for xed tuition as required by the North Carolina General Statute \u00a7116-143.9 and UNC Policy 1000.17, Policy for the Tuition Guarantee Program. Further information about the Tuition Guarantee Program can be found on the website for the Ofce of the University Registrar. Withdrawal After the term start, students withdrawing from the University should submit an ofcial withdrawal request through their ConnectCarolina Student Center to start the process (see sections on medical and academic withdrawal below) before the end of classes during a semester or summer session. Students in attendance considering withdrawal should contact their academic advising dean's ofce, Campus Health Services, or Counseling and Psychological Services for additional information. Ofcial term withdrawal from the University is required if a student wishes to drop all classes after a semester begins. An ofcial withdrawal may facilitate readmission in a future term. Leaving the University without completing the ofcial withdrawal process can result in the assignment of nal class grades computed as failing in establishing grade point averages and possibly rendering a student academically in-eligible. Enrolled students who do not withdraw ofcially will be responsible for the full tuition and fee payments associated with enrollment for the entirety of the semester. Medical Withdrawal If a student decides to withdraw for reasons of illness, either physical or psychological, the student should contact Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services, whether the treatment was received there or elsewhere. If a medical withdrawal is authorized, the ofcial withdrawal will be handled through the Ofce of the Director of Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services.Administrative Withdrawal A student who is withdrawn for disciplinary purposes must comply with the specic requirements or conditions outlined by the adjudicating body (e.g., Honor Court, Emergency Evaluation and Action Committee, etc.) prior to readmission. Unless specied by the adjudicating body, the term(s) in which disciplinary suspension is active shall not be calculated in the four academic year degree credit hour equivalency. Preclearance from the adjudicating body may be required in certain cases. Academic Withdrawal from All Courses If a student decides to withdraw for reasons other than health related, or if a withdrawal cannot be authorized through Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services, the student should submit an ofcial withdrawal request through the ConnectCarolina Student Center. Grades are required from instructors once the drop deadline has passed. In determining an undergraduate student's eligibility for readmission the following conditions apply: For students who ofcially withdraw from the University after the second week of a fall or spring semester, a grade of W is assigned to each course the students were enrolled in at the time of withdrawal. Students who ofcially withdraw from the University are assigned a semester in residence if their withdrawal is initiated before the end of classes during a fall or spring semester and if it is accompanied by the recording of six or more academic hours of F grades for that semester's work (grades recorded after the drop deadline). This means that the F grades and no others will be computed in the semester and cumulative grade point average. Withdrawal from a summer session is not counted as a semester in residence. If the withdrawal is initiated after the drop deadline during a summer session, a grade of W is assigned to each course that the student is enrolled in at the time of withdrawal. The credit hours associated with the withdrawal will count as attempted but not passed hours in the determination of the student's academic eligibility. If the student is enrolled in ve or more more academic hours, the student must obtain grades from their instructors before the withdrawal can be processed; if the withdrawal is accompanied by the recording of ve or more academic hours of F grades for that semester's work the F grades will be recorded and computed in the semester and cumulative grade point average. Students enrolled as summer session visitors from schools outside UNC-Chapel Hill must withdraw through the Ofce of the Dean of Summer School. If a student completes an ofcial withdrawal or is withdrawn administratively for any reason from a fall or spring semester, tuition and fees will be prorated over a period of nine weeks at a rate of one-tenth of the semester's bill, after deducting an administrative charge. The last date for credit on a student's nancial account for withdrawal is nine weeks after registration. If a student completes an ofcial drop from a summer class within the rst three days of classes for the session, tuition and fees will be prorated. If a student withdraws from the University during a semester and receives nancial aid funds prior to the date of withdrawal, a portion of that money will be returned to the aid program(s). The repayment will be calculated by the Ofce of Scholarships and Student Aid when the ofcial withdrawal is noted within the ConnectCarolina system. Retroactive Withdrawal Students may request a retroactive term withdrawal from a semester or summer session under extraordinary circumstances. Such requests must be made in writing to the appeals committee of theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 743 college or school in which the student is currently enrolled. The decision of that appeals committee is nal. If the retroactive term withdrawal is approved, the effective date of this action is always the last day of classes in the term or session. No refunds are ever provided when a retroactive withdrawal from a semester or summer session is approved.744 Attendance, Grading, and Examination ATTENDANCE, GRADING, AND EXAMINATION Class Attendance Policy (Maintained by the Education Policy Committee. Resolution 2018-1 (https://facultygov.unc.edu/les/2016/02/Resolution-2018-1-Absence- Policy5.pdf), passed on February 9, 2018; updated March 22, 2023) This policy applies only to University approved class absences (listed below). For nal examination absences see the Policy on Final Examinations. Regular class attendance is a student obligation. Students are responsible for all of their work, including assessments, tests, and written work, and for all class meetings. If a course instructor chooses to take attendance and sees that a student misses three or more consecutive class meetings or misses more classes than the course instructor thinks advisable, the instructor may report the facts to the student's advisor and/or academic dean. No right or privilege exists that permits a student to be absent from any class meetings, except for these University approved absences: 1.Authorized University activities: The University Approved Absence Ofce (UAAO) FAQs for to University approved absences 2.Disability/religious observance/pregnancy, as required by law and approved by Accessibility Resources and Service (https:// ars.unc.edu/ ) and/or the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Ofce (https://eoc.unc.edu/what-we-do/accommodations/ ) (EOC) 3.Signicant health condition and/or personal/family emergency as approved by the Ofce of the Dean of Students (https:// odos.unc.edu/ ), Gender Violence Service Coordinators, (https:// Opportunity and Compliance Ofce (https://eoc.unc.edu/ what-we-do/accommodations/ ) (EOC). Instructors may work with students to meet attendance needs that do not fall within University approved absences. For situations when an absence is not University approved (e.g., a job interview, illness/ flu, or club activity), instructors are encouraged to work directly with students to determine the best approach to missed classes and make-up assessments and assignments. The University's policy regarding University approved absences as well as the instructor's course-level policies are communicated to students via the instructor's course syllabus on the rst day of class. Students are encouraged to communicate with their instructors early about potential absences and are reminded that they are bound by the Honor Code (p. 752) when making a request for a University approved absence. Notication of University Approved Absences 1.Authorized University Activities: Students acting as ofcial representatives of the University who are participating in University- sanctioned activities (e.g., student government congresses, ofcialathletic competitions, music competitions, academic conferences, etc.) will be granted a University approved absence. Request for approval of an absence due to participation in a University-sanctioned activity must be sent by the program sponsor or other responsible University ofcial to the University Approved Absence Ofce (https://attendance.unc.edu/ ) which will verify the validity of the request. The program sponsor, or other responsible University ofcial, is responsible for contacting the University Approved Absence Ofce (https://attendance.unc.edu/ ) to request a University approved absence for University-sanctioned activity, when possible at least two weeks in advance of the date(s), or as soon as possible if the date(s) occurs within the rst two weeks of the semester, or within the rst two days of a summer session. This policy applies to fall, spring, and summer terms. The University Approved Absence Ofce communicates the University approved absence to the course instructor prior to the date(s) of the scheduled absence(s). The request may be for a single activity or a series of activities, but it must include the student name and date of the event, the date and time when the student is expected to be absent, and the date and time that the student is expected to return to class. 2.Accommodations for disability/religious observance/pregnancy, as required by law: a.Accessibility Resources and Services veries University approved absences for students by their ofce. ARS contacts those students' instructors directly. b.Religious Observance: Pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 116-11(3a), students are authorized at least two University approved absence(s) per academic year for religious observance/ practices required by their faith. Students who wish to request University approved absences for religious observance required by their faith should review the University's Policy on Religious Accommodation and follow the procedure set out in that policy for requesting such absences. After an absence is approved under that policy, the University Approved Absence Ofce communicates the University approved absence to the course instructor(s) prior to the date(s) of the schedule absence(s). Students are responsible for contacting the Religious Accommodations Advisory Committee to request a University approved absence for religious observance at least two weeks in advance of the date(s), or as soon as possible if the date(s) occurs within the rst two weeks of the semester. This policy applies to fall, spring, and summer terms. Primary holy days for religious observance are noted on a web- based interfaith calendar (http://www.interfaithcalendar.org). The Web-based calendar should not be interpreted as an exhaustive list of holy days that the University will recognize for purposes of religious accommodations. c.Pregnancy and Related Medical Conditions: Students who wish to request University approved absences for pregnancy and related medical conditions should review the University's Policy on Pregnant and Parenting Students and should contact the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Ofce (https:// eoc.unc.edu/ what-we-do/accommodations/ ) for approval. After an absence is approved under that policy, the University Approved Absence Ofce will communicate the University Approved Absence to the course instructor(s) prior to the date(s) of the schedule absence(s). 3.Signicant health condition and/or personal/family emergencies as approved by the Ofce of the Dean of Students (https://University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 745 odos.unc.edu ), Gender Violence Service Coordinators (https:// womenscenter.unc.edu/resources/gender-violence-services/), eoc.unc.edu/ what-we-do/accommodations/ ). Once the Ofce of the Dean of Students, Gender Violence Service Coordinators, and/ or the EOC has approved the information, they will then request that the University Approved Absence Ofce issue a University approved absence notication to the student's instructor(s). The University Approved Absence Ofce will inform the course instructor in advance if the reason for the University approved absence is planned, or as soon as possible if the reason for the absence was not foreseen. Instructors will not receive further explanation or clarication of University approved absences beyond notication from the University Approved Absence Ofce. Make-up Coursework and Assessment All students with University approved absences will be treated fairly and equitably, regardless of the reason for the absence. Instructors will provide reasonable alternatives that permit course objectives and learning outcomes to be met. Alternatives may include a make-up exam, alternative assessment, an additional paper or project of equivalent intellectual effort, an electronically-mediated participation opportunity, a due date extension, or other option that allows students to demonstrate what they have learned without being penalized for the University approved absence. It is a University expectation that instructor be prudent, fair, and equitable when a students misses an assessment due to a University approved absence. Course policies should avoid inequities, including discrepancies in preparation time for in- class versus make-up exams, missed opportunities to take and learn from an assessment, and policies that penalize students who must use their dropped grade option for a University approved absence. The Undergraduate Testing Center (http://testingcenter.web.unc.edu/) provides a secure, proctored environment for administration of makeup assessments, tests, and exams for undergraduate and graduate courses throughout each term. There are regularly scheduled session times each week in addition to the Center's traditional use during nal exams time. Please see the center's web site for more information and instructions as well as teaching and learning resources provided by the Center for Faculty Excellence (https://cfe.unc.edu/). Appeals Given the swift and cumulative nature of a semester, an instructor should contact a student with a preliminary alternative plan within three business days of receiving notication of a University approved absence, or sooner if the absence takes place during a summer term. The student must respond to the instructor within two business days of receiving the alternative plan and discuss details with the instructor. After receiving the nal alternative plan from the instructor, if a student feels that a reasonable alternative was not provided, they may submit an appeal within three business days to the instructor's chair or the chair's designee. At any time, a student may le a report alleging that the University has failed to provide reasonable accommodations for the student's religious beliefs, disability, or pregnancy or related medical condition pursuant to the University's Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment and Related Misconduct (https://eoc.unc.edu/our-policies/ ppdhrm/ ) (PPDHRM). The student may le a report under the PPDHRM following an unsatisfactory appeal determination by the instructor's chair or the chair's designee. Alternatively, the student may bypass theUniversity Approved Absence Ofce appeals process altogether and proceed directly to ling a report under the PPDHRM. If a student rst les a report under the PPDHRM, the University Approved Absence Ofce's appeals process will be stayed until a determination has been made under the PPDHRM. Final Examinations (Maintained by the Education Policy Committee. Resolution 2017-5, passed on April 21, 2017; Resolution 2017-5.1, passed on May 15, 2017) This policy applies to all undergraduate courses across the University. Undergraduate courses taught on campus must include a nal assessment of students' mastery of course material (i.e., nal examination) unless the provost grants an exception. A traditional nal examination is administered at a predetermined time as specied in the ofcial nal examination schedule (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic- calendar/ ), and takes place at a designated location in Chapel Hill. Any other type of nal examination is considered nontraditional. The nal examination schedule, announced prior to the beginning of the semester, sets the day and time for each examination. No examination may start later than 7:00 p.m. Once having been established, the schedule cannot be changed. Traditional nal examinations must be held at the day and time shown on the schedule unless an exception is granted as described below. Only the provost can grant exceptions to the scheduled day or time of a traditional examination, after review and approval by the appropriate department head and the dean. No examination (except for laboratory sections) may be held at a time other than that specied in the general schedule except with the advance approval of the provost. A course instructor may, due to highly unusual circumstances, petition for a change in the examination schedule. The instructor must submit the request in writing to his or her chair no later than the last day of late registration for that term, and it must be cleared by the chair and the appropriate dean (e.g., Associate Dean, Academic Advising) before consideration by the provost. If the petition is approved, the course instructor assumes responsibility for making special arrangements to give the examination to any student who has a schedule conflict as a result of the change. This process only applies to requests to change a day or time for an individual section. Requests to combine all sections of a specic course into one nal exam day and time (regardless of the number of sections involved), is considered a request for a Common Hour exam and has an earlier deadline for submission. Requests for all common hour exams must be cleared by the chair or appropriate dean and approved by the provost. Requests for common hour exams must be made to the registrar the rst week of February for fall semester nal examinations and the rst week of September for spring semester nal examinations. There is no exception to this deadline. No graded quizzes or exams (excluding in-class presentations) may be given during the last ve days of the semester (last two days of the session for summer school) before the beginning of the nal examination period. For a standard three-credit-hour course, the University has a required three-hour nal examination period, which includes 180 minutes of instruction in each semester (see UPM #29 - Denition of a Credit Hour (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/policies-procedures/746 Attendance, Grading, and Examination university-policy-memorandums/upm-29-denition-of-a-credit-hour/)). Thus, the University requires instructors to provide a full three hours of instruction for nal assessment purposes (e.g., written nal examination, presentations, portfolio review, performance, review and evaluation, or some combination of these assessments). It is up to the discretion of the instructor of record to determine the form, content, and function of the nal examination (e.g., whether it is cumulative; whether it is a three- hour exam or a shorter exam preceded or followed by a period of review; etc.). A traditional nal examination should not exceed a period of three hours. Only examinations requiring an exceptional portion of practical work should be longer than three hours (e.g., student teaching). Chairs (i.e., heads of instructional units) must give permission for faculty members to use nontraditional examinations. Examples of nontraditional examinations include those requiring more than three hours to complete; or other nal assessments such as a portfolio of a semester's work, a nal project, or a take-home examination. For multidisciplinary and cotaught courses, permission to give a nontraditional examination must be granted solely by the chair of the instructional unit in which the course is based. Even when faculty members have permission to administer nontraditional nal examinations, the scheduled examination period must be utilized for instructional hours. The chair should submit to their academic dean's ofce an annual summary of the exceptions that were granted. Students who are absent from an examination receive a course grade of AB (absent), which is equivalent to F (zero quality points), or FA (absent and failing regardless of performance on the nal examination). When students are unable, for reasons clearly beyond their control, to take a traditional nal examination at the scheduled time, they can be excused only by the director of Campus Health Services or their academic dean (who can issue an \"examination excuse\"). An absence may be excused for severe health problems leading to the student's placement on the Inrmary List by either Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services, for signicant personal or family circumstances, for religious observances required by the student's faith, for a scheduling conflict involving multiple examinations at the same time, or when a student has three or more nal examinations scheduled in 24 hours. In cases of illness, personal or family emergency, or religious observance, additional documentation may be required by the dean. Primary holy days for religious observances are noted on a Web-based interfaith calendar site (http://www.interfaith-calendar.org/). Students are responsible for providing the course instructor and the dean a written request for an excused absence from a nal exam for a religious observance or for a scheduling conflict involving multiple examinations no later than the last day of classes. Students must be given the opportunity to make up nal exams missed due to an excused absence. For any University undergraduate courses offered entirely online or via other distance modalities, exams will be offered and must be completed during the scheduled nal examination period, but requirements concerning the time of day and place of the exam will be appropriate to the course's mode of delivery. Self-paced courses are exempt from both the time and place requirements of the exam policy and the requirement that exams be held during the scheduled nal examination period. Campus Health Services Students who are seriously ill during the time of their nal examination(s) (including complications related to pregnancy) should consult Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services about having their names entered on the Final Exam excuse list. In some cases, outpatient treatment can also result in a student's name being enteredon the list. Students on the Final Exam excuse list may obtain an ofcial permit from the Ofce of the University Registrar to take the nal examination to remove a grade of AB. They must make arrangements with their course instructor to take the nal examination and provide the instructor with their ofcial permit. If students are treated at Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services but do not appear on the list, they should see the dean of their college as soon as possible. Academic Dean If students know in advance that they must miss one or more nal examinations because of illness, religious observance, or other serious problems, they should notify in writing both the course instructor and the dean of the school in which they are enrolled no later than the last day of classes. If this is not possible, they should see their dean as soon after the fact as possible. For students in the College of Arts and Sciences, only the associate dean for advising (or designee) is authorized to issue examination excuses for reasons other than three exams in 24 hours or two exams at the same time. For other students, only the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled has that authority. The dean may require documentation of a student's religious observance, illness, or problems. Assuming that a student did not take a nal examination for one of the reasons previously cited, the dean will issue an ofcial examination excuse, which the student must present to the course instructor when arrangements are made for a suitable time to take the nal examination. A student who has three nal examinations scheduled by the Ofce of the University Registrar within a 24-hour period or two scheduled at the same time may request to his or her dean's ofce for permission to have one of the scheduled examinations rescheduled. In the College of Arts and Sciences, requests for exam excuses are reviewed by professional staff in Academic Advising via an online request form (https://eef.oasis.unc.edu/ ). In the event that one of the scheduled examinations is a common nal examination for a multiple-section course, that examination is the one to be rescheduled. Students who have secured an examination excuse or an ofcial permit and who transmit the document to the instructor or the instructor's chair or dean must be granted permission to take the exam at an alternate time, although students will need to arrange a mutually convenient time with the instructor. Except when the provost has provided an exception in writing, the exam will be taken at a time subsequent to the regularly scheduled exam, though no later than the end of the following semester. The nal examination in any course may be taken only by regularly enrolled members of the class whose registration has been certied and by students certied to be eligible to take a special examination in that course. The certifying authority is the Ofce of the University Registrar. Each student is required to sign a full and explicit Honor Code pledge certifying that he or she has neither given nor received aid during the examination. Grading System Permanent Letter Grades A letter-grade and plus/minus system for evaluating academic performance is employed for all undergraduates. Each letter grade corresponds to a number of grade points. Each letter-graded course receives a numerical value of quality points (quality points equal grade points times semester credit hours per course) to use in determiningUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 747 a student's average (per credit hour) in a particular term and to nd a student's cumulative grade point average (per credit hour). A = 4.0 B- = 2.7 D+ = 1.3 A- = 3.7 C+ = 2.3 D = 1.0 B+ = 3.3 C = 2.0 F = 0.0 B = 3.0 C- = 1.7 To determine the grade point average for a term, rst determine the total quality points earned in the term by multiplying the number of grade points awarded for each course by the course's assigned number of semester credit hours and adding the resulting quality points earned for each course in the term. Then divide the total quality points earned in the term by the number of semester credit hours attempted (for letter grades) in the term. Example Course Grade Grade Pointsx Credit Hours= Quality Points Course A C+ 2.3 x 3.0 = 6.90 Course B B- 2.7 x 3.0 = 8.10 Course C B 3.0 x 4.0 = 12.00 Course D C- 1.7 x 3.0 = 5.10 Course E A- 3.7 x 1.0 = 3.70 Course F F 0.0 x 1.0 = 0.00 Course G A 4.0 x 3.0 = 12.00 Total quality points earned:47.80 Total graded hours:18.0 Term grade point average:47.80 \u00f7 18.0 = 2.656 Permanent grades are dened as follows: A Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development. The A grade states clearly that the student has shown such outstanding promise in the aspect of the discipline under study that he/she may be strongly encouraged to continue. B Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development. The B grade states that the student has shown solid promise in the aspect of the discipline under study.C A totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development. The C grade states that while not yet showing any unusual promise, the student may continue to study in the discipline with reasonable hope of intellectual development. D A marginal performance in the required exercises demonstrating a minimal passing level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development. The D grade states that the student has given no evidence of prospective growth in the discipline; an accumulation of D grades should be taken to mean that the student would be well advised not to continue in the academic eld. F For whatever reasons, an unacceptable performance. The F grade indicates that the student's performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content. A grade of F should warrant questioning whether the student may suitably register for further study in the discipline before remedial work is undertaken. Grades earned and semester hours attempted at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the University grade point average. Records of progress are kept by this institution on all students. Students can access ofcial semester grades in ConnectCarolina at the end of the term. Questions about access to student ofcial grades or grade reporting should be directed to the Ofce of the University Registrar. Temporary Grades (IN and AB) and FA Grades Any student who ceases to attend a class without ofcially being dropped or withdrawn may receive a temporary grade of AB or IN or a permanent grade of FA. Students who do not complete all requirements in a course by the end of the semester, but who could pass the course if they did, receive a temporary grade of IN (incomplete) or AB (absent from the nal exam) in place of a permanent letter grade. Grades of IN and AB do not affect grade point average. Students who do not complete the course requirements within a specied period of time are assigned permanent F* grades on their academic transcripts by the Ofce of the University Registrar. The instructor must report the grade of AB for any student who did not take the nal examination and who, by taking the nal examination, could pass the course. This AB grade later converts to an F* unless the student arranges to take the nal examination before the last day of nals of the next regularly scheduled semester (fall or spring). If the student cannot pass the course regardless of a nal examination performance, the instructor must report the grade FA. The grade of FA (cannot pass the748 Attendance, Grading, and Examination class) is a permanent failing grade. A grade of F may be assigned instead of a temporary grade or a grade of FA when a nal examination is not required in the course. The grade IN may only be assigned by an instructor to a student who took the nal examination in a course but did not complete some other course requirement (including signing the honor pledge) and who, by virtue of completing that missing work, might pass the course. Unless removed before the last day of nals of the regularly scheduled semester (fall or spring) following its assignment, an IN converts to an F*. Absence from a nal examination may be ofcially excused only by the student's dean or the director of Campus Health Services or Counseling and Psychological Services. Please see \"Final Examinations\" above for information about nal examination excuses. Important Rules and Procedures Pertaining to AB and IN Grades The decision to report an IN grade is solely the responsibility of the course instructor; however, a student may present proper justication for the instructor's consideration. Temporary grades should be cleared by completing the work outstanding, preferably no later than the start of the following semester. The deadline for clearing a temporary grade of AB or IN is the last day of nals for the next regularly scheduled semester or the instructor-provided deadline, whichever is earlier. If students intend to remove IN or excused AB grades, they should not ofcially enroll in the course(s) during the next semester or summer session. If recommended by the course instructor, a student may attend by ofcially auditing a part of that instructor's section of the course or another instructor's section of the same course in which the temporary grade was awarded. If a student enrolls in a course in which a temporary grade has been previously received, the second enrollment is taken as evidence that the student could not or is not permitted to remove the temporary grade. This results in replacing the temporary grade by F* after the deadline for removing the temporary grade. The grade earned during the second enrollment is also reported on the student's academic transcript and is used along with the F* grade in the computation of a cumulative grade point average. Other Grades and Notations A notation of BE (By-Examination) is entered in the grade column of academic transcripts if students are awarded credit for a course as a result of evaluation by departmental, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or SAT II Subject Test examinations. BE credit confers credit hours and can be used to fulll General Education requirements. For rst-time, rst-year students entering UNC-Chapel Hill in fall 2009 or thereafter, no more than two courses (six to eight credit hours) of BE credit can be applied to a major and no more than one course (three to four credit hours) of BE credit can be applied to a minor in the College of Arts and Sciences. BE credit may not be used to satisfy cumulative grade point average requirements for majors or minors. A notation of NG (no grade) is not used by individual instructors but rather is assigned by the Ofce of the University Registrar when a permanent grade is pending a judicial review by the Honor Court. A notation of PL (placement) is entered in the grade column of academic transcripts if students are awarded exemption for a course as a result ofan evaluation that would ordinarily place them in a succeeding course. PL does not confer credit hours. There are some courses for which only a grade of PS (pass) or F (fail) can be awarded. For most other courses, students may opt to take a class on a Pass/Fail basis (http://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/ registration-enrollment-withdrawal/). A grade of SP (satisfactory progress) may be used in the rst course of a departmental undergraduate honors program. The honors program runs through two semesters, and a nal grade is not reported until completion of the second course. When the nal grade is reported, the previously assigned SP grade must be changed to the appropriate permanent letter grade by an ofcial grade change form. Credit hours are awarded for the rst honors course only after a letter grade replaces the SP grade. An SP grade is not computed in the grade point average. A notation of W (withdrawn) is entered in the grade column of academic transcripts if students are permitted by their school to drop a course after the eighth week of classes or proportional equivalent for summer terms and other nonstandard enrollment periods. This notation is automatically entered unless the student's academic dean species otherwise. When a course is dropped between the second and eighth week of classes, a grade of WC (withdrawal by choice) shall be recorded and used internally for tracking and reporting purposes. For external purposes, a withdrawal by choice is equivalent to the W notation. Once recorded, a WC cannot be rescinded unless it is determined the student withdrawal was due to extenuating circumstances. A notation of XF is entered to indicate that a student has not passed a course as the result of an Honor Court violation. The grade of XF can be replaced by a nal grade of F if the student follows prescribed steps to remediate the violation. A blank space or a grade of NR (not reported) is shown in the grade column when the instructor has not submitted the ofcial grade for the student. Repeating Course Enrollments See Registration, Enrollment, and Withdrawal (p. 738). Grades Earned at Other Institutions With the exception of courses taken via interinstitutional registration (p. 738), grades earned and semester hours attempted at other institutions are not included in the computation of a grade point average at the University. A grade point average earned at another university may not be used to restore academic eligibility; however, academic hours earned at another university may be used to restore academic eligibility if the student is lacking only credit hours and has a satisfactory grade point average. Special rules regarding transfer courses apply; see Transfer of Credit (http://catalog.unc.edu/admissions/undergraduate/) and Academic Eligibility (p. 750). Grade Appeals The grades of H, HP, P, LP, L, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, PS, F, FA, F*, and numerical grades in the Law School are considered permanent grades. Once reported, the instructor's grade report may not be changed except under certain conditions. For a grade change to be considered, it must be based upon one or more of the following grounds and upon allegation that the ground or grounds cited influenced the grade assignment to the student's detriment:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 749 Arithmetic or clerical error Arbitrariness, possibly including discrimination or harassment based on the race, color, gender, national origin, age, religion, creed, disability, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of the student Personal malice Student conduct cognizable under the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance A grade appeal must be made no later than the last day of classes for the succeeding fall or spring semester. Grade Appeals Correcting a Clerical or Arithmetical Error An instructor who has reported an incorrect grade for a student because of an error in calculating the grade, or in entering it on the ofcial grade roster, may change the grade to one of the other letter grades, provided this change is made no later than the last day of classes of the succeeding fall or spring semester. Grade changes are submitted online using the Grade Change Request process, with electronic approvals required by the instructor, the department chair, and student's dean's ofce. Other Grade Appeals Any student who protests a course grade shall rst attempt to resolve this disagreement with the instructor concerned. (As explained in the preceding paragraph, an instructor may change a permanent grade only when a clerical or arithmetical error is involved.) Failing to reach a satisfactory resolution, the student may appeal the grade in accordance with the procedures outlined below. Such appeal must be made no later than the last day of classes of the succeeding fall or spring semester. Students should present the appeal in writing to the dean of their school (students in the College of Arts and Sciences must submit it in writing to the associate dean for advising). The dean will refer the appeal to the administrative board of his/her school, which will meet to consider whether the student has offered sufcient grounds for referring the appeal to the chair of the department concerned. If the administrative board determines that further review by the academic department is appropriate, the department chair will then appoint a committee to consider the appeal and will make a recommendation to the administrative board based on the committee's ndings. The administrative board will make the nal decision, and no change of grade will be made except as a result of the decision by the board. The chair will report such decision to change the grade to the Ofce of the University Registrar.750 Academic Standing ACADEMIC STANDING Academic Eligibility Policy For students in the undergraduate career, the University's academic eligibility policy species the minimum standards of academic performance required for continued enrollment. These standards apply to undergraduate students enrolled in courses during or after the fall 2016 semester. Degree-Seeking Programs To guide students toward timely degree completion, the University maintains academic eligibility standards. These standards are reviewed at the end of fall, spring, summer I, and summer II terms. These standards determine academic status for each undergraduate in a degree-seeking program. Academic status indicates eligibility to enroll in any course in any term including summer. Students must check their academic status in ConnectCarolina at the end of each enrolled fall, spring, or summer term. Academic status is determined through four standards of satisfactory academic progress: 1.Grade Point Average. A cumulative UNC-Chapel Hill grade point average of at least a 2.000 is required. 2.Completion Rate . Students must successfully complete at least 2/3 of cumulative attempted credit hours. By-Exam (BE) and credits transferred in to UNC-Chapel Hill count as both attempted and completed hours. Withdrawals, temporary grades including AB, IN, or SP, and failed courses count as attempted hours but not completed hours. Completed Hours/Attempted Hours=Completion Rate. 3.Cumulative Hours Passed*. To enroll in courses, students must have earned the following: After one full-time semester: 9 academic hours After two full-time semesters: 24 academic hours After three full-time semesters: 36 academic hours After four full-time semesters: 51 academic hours After ve full-time semesters: 63 academic hours After six full-time semesters: 78 academic hours After seven full-time semesters: 93 academic hours Students are expected to complete their degree within a maximum of eight full-time semesters. Transfer students (who transfer in the UNC- Chapel Hill equivalent of two or more semesters, see \"Calculation of Transferred Semesters Based on the Number of Transfer Hours (p. 730)\") may enroll in up to 10 total semesters. Students who enter as rst years are required to apply for a ninth or tenth semester. For information about the application process, students in professional schools must contact their professional school dean, and students in the College of Arts and Sciences must contact the Academic Advising Program (http:// advising.unc.edu ). *Part-time students are excluded from this standard. 4. Maximum Time Frame.Students must complete their degree within 180 attempted credit hours. There are four academic statuses : good standing, warning, suspension, and probation.Students who meet each of the four standards at the end of an enrolled term will have an academic status of good standing . Students who begin an enrolled term in good standing but do not meet each of the four standards at the end of that enrolled term will receive an academic status of warning . Students with a status of warning may enroll in courses and must complete an academic intervention plan (http:// studentsuccess.unc.edu/warning/ ). A student who begins an enrolled term with a status of warning and falls short of the standards at the end of that enrolled term will earn an academic status of suspension . Students with an academic status of suspension cannot enroll in any courses in any terms. Students with an academic status of suspension have two options: a. Appeal for probation . Students granted academic probation by appeal must complete an academic intervention plan (http:// studentsuccess.unc.edu/academic-probation-3/). Students denied probation by appeal can pursue option b. b. Spend a term engaging in study, work, or wellness activities away from UNC-Chapel Hill. These opportunities could include coursework at another institution, employment, volunteer work, or healthcare or wellness activities. During this time students should reflect on their academic path, development, choices, and actions. Students should also implement strategies that will enhance their effectiveness upon return to the University. After a term away from the University, students who have engaged in study, work, or wellness activities may appeal to return to the University on probation. Students appealing after a term or longer away from the University must include documentation of their experiences while away such as a transcript from another institution, a letter from an employer, or a letter from a healthcare provider. These documents must convey evidence of the student's readiness to return to the University. A student who begins an enrolled term with a status of probation and falls short of the standards at the end of that enrolled term will earn an academic status of suspension . Students with an academic status of suspension have two options (see above). Repeats, Withdrawals, and Incompletes Attempted hours include all those in which a student is enrolled as of the end of the second week of each fall or spring term (the 10th day of the term, generally known as the \"census date\"). Students may drop a course until the 10th day of the term. Dropped courses do not count in attempted hours. The summer schedule is similar to fall/spring but is determined according to the summer calendar. Credit hours that are dropped or withdrawn prior to the census date are not considered attempted; credit hours that are dropped or withdrawn after the census date are considered attempted. Repeated courses affect grade point average and Completion Rate. Transfer hours do not affect grade point average. Transfer hours are added to both completed hours and attempted hours in the Completion Rate calculation. Courses with temporary grades of IN or AB do not affect grade point average. If a grade of IN or AB is converted to a passing grade, grade point average will be recalculated accordingly.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 751 Withdrawn courses do not affect grade point average. Withdrawn courses are NOT considered a successful completion, though, and will adversely affect Completion Rate. Failed courses influence grade point average. A failed course will also adversely affect Completion Rate, counting as attempted hours but not completed hours.

A non-degree-seeking student with a 2.000 or higher cumulative grade point average will be in good standing and eligible to enroll in courses. If a non-degree-seeking student falls below a 2.000 cumulative grade point average, the student will be assigned a status of alert. A non-degree-seeking student who begins a term with a status of alert and does not raise his or her cumulative grade point average to 2.000 or higher at the end of the term will have an academic status of ineligible and will not be permitted to enroll in courses. Non- degree-seeking students with a status of ineligible may appeal to Digital and Lifelong Learning. Appeals Students may, under extraordinary circumstances, present an appeal in writing (or online for students in the College of Arts and Sciences) to the dean of their school (for students in the College of Arts and Sciences, this is the associate dean for advising). The dean will refer the appeal to the administrative board for his/her school. Calculation of Transferred Semesters Based on the Number of Transferred Credit Hours See the Credit and Evaluation (p. 730) section of the catalog. Additional Information for Students with an Academic Status of Suspension If students earn 15 or more transfer semester credit hours for courses taken at other institutions cumulatively over the fall or spring semesters before applying for readmission to the University, a calculation will be made as to how many semesters the student is regarded as having completed, based on the number of hours accepted for transfer credit. The resulting tally of total semesterscompleted will determine requirements for restoring academic eligibility. Students should consult their academic advisor if they are considering taking classes at another institution. Grades do not transfer, and credit hours accumulated through enrollment in fall and spring semesters at other schools can affect the number of remaining semesters that students have left to complete their degree requirements at UNC-Chapel Hill. Students who attend another institution (summer, fall, or spring), and who apply for readmission must have at least a 2.000 (C) average in work at the other institution. Students who have a housing assignment or contract for the following semester should either cancel their application/contract or notify the University's Department of Housing and Residential Education of their intention to restore academic eligibility before the following semester begins. Students who are inactive during a semester because of ineligibility (or other reasons) must apply for readmission before registering for a full- time term. Removing AB or IN Grades For information about completing courses with grades of AB (absent from the nal examination) or IN (incomplete), see the grading system information (p. 744).752 Honor Code HONOR CODE The Honor Code The Honor System forms a bond of trust among students, faculty, and administrators. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill operates under a system of self-governance, as students are responsible for governing themselves. As such, our University is transformed into a powerful community of inquiry and learning. The Honor Code embodies the ideals of academic honesty, integrity, and responsible citizenship, and governs the performance of all academic work a student conducts at the University. Acceptance of an offer of admission to Carolina presupposes a commitment to the principles embodied in our century-old tradition of honor and integrity. Mutual Responsibilities of the Faculty and Students Academic work is a joint enterprise involving faculty and students. Both have a fundamental investment in the enterprise and both must share responsibility for ensuring its integrity. In relation to the Honor Code, therefore, specic responsibilities of the faculty which parallel the responsibilities of the students have been formally adopted by the Faculty Council. Responsibilities of the Faculty 1.Awareness: To assure that community-wide expectations regarding academic integrity are understood and communicated, and that students are held accountable for conforming their conduct to such expectations. 2.Communicating Expectations and Administering Examinations: To assist students in complying with their responsibilities relating to academic integrity, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should Use good judgment in setting and communicating clear ground rules for academic work conducted under their supervision. Require students to sign the honor pledge as a condition of submitting academic assignments. Take steps to prevent unauthorized access to examinations during development, duplication, and administration. Avoid reusing prior examinations in whole or in part to the extent possible. Take all reasonable steps consistent with physical classroom conditions to reduce the risk of cheating during the administration of examinations. Maintain proper security during the administration of examinations, including as appropriate overseeing distribution and collection of examinations and proctoring the examination session. 3.Oversight: In the event of student misconduct that appears to violate the requirements of the Honor Code, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should Report to the appropriate Student Attorney General any instance in which the instructor has reasonable basis to conclude that a student under the faculty member's supervision has engaged in academic dishonesty or substantially assisted another to do so in connection with academically related work. In the instructor's discretion, notify the student of the instructor's intention to report the suspected academic dishonesty and permit the student to provide relevant further information if the student chooses to do so.Refrain from taking unilateral punitive action as to a student rather than reporting conduct in suspected violation of the Honor Code. Cooperate with representatives of the Honor System in conducting necessary investigation, providing testimony or other evidence, recommending appropriate sanctions, or otherwise bringing the matter to prompt conclusion. 4.Involvement: To bring to bear requisite faculty judgment regarding the nature and importance of academic integrity, and to nourish a strong campus-wide understanding and commitment to associated intellectual and personal values, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should Explore issues of integrity in connection with instructional activities where relevant and appropriate. Encourage their academic units to take matters of academic integrity seriously, become informed regarding related problems and advisable means of preventing problems from arising, and provide requisite training and support to instructional personnel. Participate upon request as part of educational initiatives, faculty advisory panels, and University Hearing Boards designed to create, nurture, and enforce high standards of academic integrity within the University community. Responsibilities of Students To ensure effective functioning of an Honor System worthy of respect in this institution, students are expected to 1.Conduct all academic work within the letter and spirit of the Honor Code, which prohibits the giving or receiving of unauthorized aid in all academic processes. 2.Consult with faculty and other sources to clarify the meaning of plagiarism, to learn the recognized techniques of proper attribution of sources used in the preparation of written work, and to identify allowable resource materials or aids to be used during examination or in completion of any graded work. 3.Sign a pledge on all graded academic work certifying that no unauthorized assistance has been received or given in the completion of the work. 4.Comply with faculty regulations designed to reduce the possibility of cheating-such as removing unauthorized materials or aids from the room and protecting one's own examination paper from the view of others. 5.Maintain the condentiality of examinations by divulging no information concerning an examination, directly or indirectly, to another student yet to write that same examination. 6.Treat all members of the University community with respect and fairness. 7.Report any instance in which reasonable grounds exist to believe that a student has given or received unauthorized aid in graded work or in other respects violated the Honor Code. Such report should be made to the Ofce of the Student Attorney General, the Ofce of the Dean of Students, or other appropriate ofcer or ofcial of their college or school. 8.Cooperate with the Ofce of the Student Attorney General and the defense counsel in the investigation and hearing of any incident of alleged violation, including the giving of testimony when called upon. Procedure for Reporting Members of the University community who wish to report possible violations of the Honor Code should contact the Ofce of StudentUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 753 Conduct at (919) 962-0805 or ll out the online form (https:// studentconduct.unc.edu/report-violation-ofce-student-conduct/). The Ofce of Student Conduct will review the report and refer it to the appropriate Student Attorney General for action.754 University Policies UNIVERSITY POLICIES Regulations and Policies The personal conduct of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (\"University\" or \"UNC-Chapel Hill\") is subject to the moral and legal restraints found in any law-abiding community. Additionally, the Honor Code is a positive force for good citizenship. University regulations are not specications for acceptable conduct or detailed lists of offenses subject to penal action. They are intended to provide information about systematic procedures and equitable decisions in many situations involving individual students and ofcers of the University. Code of the University of North Carolina Section 502D(3) -Subject to any policies or regulations of the Board of Governors or of the Board of Trustees, it shall be the duty of the chancellor to exercise full authority in the regulation of student affairs and student conduct and discipline. In the discharge of this duty, delegation of such authority may be made by the chancellor to faculty committees and to administrative or other ofcers of the institution, or to agencies of student government, in such manner and to such extent as may by the chancellor be deemed necessary and expedient. In the discharge of the chancellor's duty with respect to matters of student discipline, it shall be the duty of the chancellor to secure to every student the right to due process. Appeals from these disciplinary decisions are allowable only on the following grounds: 1.a violation of due process, or 2.a material deviation from the Minimum Substantive and Procedural Standards for Student Disciplinary Procedures, Section 700.4.1 of the UNC Policy Manual. Where the sanction is suspension or expulsion, an appeal may be made to the Board of Trustees. No appeal to the president or Board of Governors is permitted. Whistleblower Policy The purpose of this policy is to encourage individuals to report possible wrongful conduct to an appropriate authority so that prompt, corrective action can be taken by the University and to protect reporting individuals from any retaliation for reporting wrongful conduct. Please see the full text of the Whistleblower Policy (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/ Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=131868) on the University's policy website (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/Home/). Religious Accommodation Policy The University is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment that is respectful of the religious beliefs and practices of all members of the University community. As part of this commitment, the University will make good faith efforts to provide reasonable religious accommodations to individuals covered by this policy whose sincerely held religious beliefs and practices conflict with a University policy, procedure, or other academic or employment requirement unless such an accommodation would create an undue hardship. The University is committed to diversity and nondiscrimination and supports the employment of all qualied individuals, regardless of religious afliation or beliefs. This commitment is in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its accompanying regulations, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Guidelines onDiscrimination Because of Religion, and North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 116-11(3a). Please see the full text of the Religious Accommodation Policy (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet/? ID=131709 ) on the University's policy website (https://policies.unc.edu/ TDClient/2833/Portal/Home/). Alcoholic Beverages Possession and use of alcoholic beverages is substantially regulated by federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. Within this legal framework, the University's Alcohol Policy (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/ Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=132458) sets out the conditions under which alcoholic beverages may be used on University property. According to North Carolina law Generally, persons 21 or older may purchase or consume alcoholic beverages and may possess alcoholic beverages at their homes or temporary residences. It is against the law for any person under 21 to purchase or possess any alcoholic beverage. (General Statute 18B-302) It is against the law for anyone to sell or give any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 or to aid or abet such a person in selling, purchasing, or possessing any alcoholic beverage. (General Statute 18B-302) No alcoholic beverages may be sold by any person, organization, or corporation on a college campus except as permitted by North Carolina General Statutes, Sect. 18B-1006 (a). According to Chapel Hill ordinance 3-3 (https://library.municode.com/ nc/chapel_hill/codes/code_of_ordinances/?nodeId=CO_CH3ALBE), it is against the law for anyone to possess any open container of alcohol on streets, sidewalks, alleys, or any other property owned or controlled by the Town of Chapel Hill. In addition to following the law, the University's Alcohol Policy sets out special rules about alcohol for University employees and for students and student organizations. For University employees, the Procedure for Requesting Permission to Serve Alcoholic Beverages at University- Sponsored Events (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/ KB/ArticleDet/?ID=138011) describes how University Departments and Units may request permission to serve alcohol at University- sponsored events. For University students and student organizations, the Procedures for Adjudication and Response to Student and Student Organization Violations of the UNC-Chapel Hill Alcohol Policy (https:// policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=138012) describes the procedural rights, administrative process, sanctions, and appeal process for students and student organizations accused of violating the University's Alcohol Policy. The Ofce of the Dean of Students will provide copies of the policy and procedures and assistance in understanding their full implications. The text of the policy and procedures can also be accessed on the University's policy website (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/Home/). Illegal Drugs Policy The University's Illegal Drugs Policy (https://policies.unc.edu/ TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=132140) addresses education, counseling, and rehabilitation to help all members of the University Community avoid involvement with illegal drugs. The policy also describes enforcement and penalties, consistent with state and federal law, to eliminate illegal drugs from the University community. Please seeUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 755 the full text of the Illegal Drugs Policy on the University's policy website (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/Home/). Commercial Activities Commercial exchanges, including selling or soliciting for the sale of goods or services by any person on the campus of the University is prohibited except as provided for in the Facilities Use Policy (https:// policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=131343). Emergency Evaluation and Action Committee Policy and Procedures In keeping with the long tradition of student self-governance at the University, the chancellors of the University have delegated a portion of their authority in matters of student discipline to a student judicial system that functions in accordance with The Instrument of Student Judicial Governance. From time to time, however, the University is faced with situations involving behavior of applicants for admission, who are not yet within the jurisdiction of the student judicial system, and situations involving students that require a University response because they pose some danger to the University and/or its processes but that are not cognizable under the Instrument. Occasionally emergency situations arise in connection with student behaviors, which require a faster response than the student judicial system's procedures can provide. To address all of these situations and to fulll the University's obligation to provide a safe campus, the Emergency Evaluation and Action Committee has been established. The full text of the committee's policies and procedures (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/ KB/ArticleDet/?ID=132459) is on the University's policy website. (https:// policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/Home/) Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act Information compiled under the federal Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act is available on request from the Department of Athletics Business Ofce.

Improper Relationships between Students and Employees On March 15, 1996 (updated July 1, 2007), The University of North Carolina Board of Governors adopted a system-wide policy (300.4.1) that prohibits amorous or sexual relationships between faculty or staff employees and 1.students they evaluate or supervise by virtue of their teaching, research, administrative, or other employment responsibility and 2.students who are minors below the age of 18. The policy also states that faculty or staff employees may not supervise or evaluate students to whom they are related by blood, law, or marriage. The full Improper Relationships Between Students and Employees Policy (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet/? ID=131764 ) based on the UNC Board of Governor's policy is available on the University's policy website (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/ Portal/Home/). Veterans' Educational Benets Students who expect to use their veterans' educational benets must contact the Veterans' Services Assistant in the Ofce of the University Registrar, located in the Student and Academic Services Building North. Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress to be eligible for VA educational benets. Students who are not eligible at the end of the term will not be eligible for veterans' educational benets in subsequent terms until they regain their eligibility. For further information, please visit the Ofce of the University Registrar's web page on Veteran Affairs (https://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/veteran-affairs/). Military Tuition Benet As a member of the armed services, the North Carolina National Guard or a military dependent, if you do not qualify as a North Carolina resident for tuition purposes, you may still be eligible to pay a reduced tuition rate if you meet the eligibility requirements for the Military Tuition Benet (N.C. General Statute 116-143.3).756 University Policies Note: The benet only determines the amount of tuition you pay. You must still qualify academically for admission.

Posthumous and Memorial Degree In the unfortunate event of a recently enrolled student death, the University may award a degree posthumously or a memorial degree of achievement to the next of kin of the decedent.The following criteria are used to determine awarding a degree posthumously and it is included in the ofcial degree count. Detailed information on the criteria for awarding of a posthumous degree or memorial degree of achievement are in UPM#13 Authorized Degrees (https://registrar.unc.edu/academic- services/policies-procedures/university-policy-memorandums/upm-13- authorized-degrees-major-elds-in-each-degree-and-assigned-code- numbers/ ), Major Fields in Each Degree, and Assigned Code Numbers .Undergraduate Students Upon the recommendation of the Dean of Students Ofce in conjunction with the Dean's Ofce of the student's academic college/school, a posthumous degree may be awarded to a deceased undergraduate student if the student was in good academic standing and at least 90 percent of academic requirements for earning the degree are already completed. This is typically in the last two semesters or year of study for undergraduate degrees. Graduate and Professional Students Upon the recommendation of the Dean of Students Ofce in conjunction with the Dean's Ofce(s) of the student's academic college/school(s), a posthumous degree may be awarded to a deceased graduate or professional student if the student was in good academic standing and signicant progress had been made toward academic requirements for earning the degree. For graduate and professional degrees this can vary but generally the following considerations apply: For degrees requiring a#research or other creative/practicum activity, the student must have#completed all course and other requirements pursuant to the degree and must#have been near completion of the dissertation/thesis/substitute product; and the student's committee#must have determined the scholarship to be substantial work and worthy of the#degree. For degrees requiring primarily coursework, at least 90 percent of academic requirements for earning the degree are already completed. This is typically in the last two semesters or year of study. In cases where requirements for awarding a doctorate have not been met, a master's degree could be awarded if those requirements have been satised and if supported by the student's committee. Memorial Degree of Achievement If requirements for awarding the degree posthumously are not met, the University may issue a memorial degree of achievement. This is neither recorded as an ofcial degree nor included in the ofcial degree count. The Dean of Students Ofce , in conjunction with the academic college/ school of the student, issues this memorial degree of achievement#to honor the memory of the deceased student's contributions to the UNC- Chapel Hill academic community. Certicate of Achievement In circumstances when awarding a degree is not appropriate, the University can issue a certicate of achievement recognizing a former student . The Dean of Students ofce determines if a situation warrants issuing this recognition . This is neither recorded as an ofcial certicate nor included in the ofcial certicate count. Residence Status for Tuition Purposes Under state law, North Carolina residents are eligible for a lower tuition rate to state universities, including UNC-Chapel Hill. In order to qualify as residents for tuition purposes, students must have established legal residence (or domicile) in North Carolina and maintained that legal residence for at least twelve (12) months prior to their classication as residents for tuition purposes. Each student is classied as an in-state or out-of-state resident upon admission.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 757 If you believe that you qualify as a North Carolina resident for tuition purposes, you may apply for in-state resident status by following the instructions provided by your admissions ofce. Continuing students who believe they may now qualify as a resident for tuition purposes may apply through the North Carolina Residency Determination Service (RDS) (https://ncresidency.cfnc.org/). For additional information about the UNC-Chapel Hill residency requirements and procedures, please see the Ofce of the University Registrar's web page on Residency (https:// registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/residency/). Tuition Waiver for Family Members of Deceased or Disabled Emergency Workers Certain family members of emergency workers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty may become eligible for tuition-free enrollment. For additional information about the UNC-Chapel Hill emergency worker tuition benets, please see the Ofce of the University Registrar's web page on Emergency Worker Tuition Benets (https://registrar.unc.edu/ academic-services/residency/emergency-worker-tuition-benets/). Policies and Guidelines for a Cooperative Learning Environment Teaching and learning occur simultaneously through a partnership between instructor and student. Instructors share knowledge, experience, and ideas with their students. Students process these thoughts, generate new ones, and share them with their teachers and classmates. In most cases, students and instructors communicate clearly and effectively. However, misunderstandings do occur. In an attempt to foster a positive academic environment, the Faculty Council, upon recommendation of the Educational Policy Committee, establishes the following policies and guidelines. The Faculty Council resolves: Part I. Policies Section 1. The Faculty Council recognizes and afrms the following policies. This recognition is not to be interpreted as precluding modication of any policy by the appropriate authority. The Honor Code . The faculty should inform students of the provisions of the honor code and be aware of their own responsibilities specied in the honor code. Faculty responsibilities are stated in the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance. Student Grievance Policy and Procedures. According to UNC-Chapel Hill Student Grievance Committee procedures, students may le a grievance against a UNC-Chapel Hill employee, including faculty, EHRA non-faculty, staff, and student employee (when acting in the role of employee) when there is a violation of one of the following: a.The UNC-Chapel Hill Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment and Related Misconduct, Including Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment, Sexual Violence, Interpersonal Violence and Stalking (https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/ Portal/KB/ArticleDet/?ID=132487); b.The Americans with Disabilities Act (https://www.ada.gov/); c.Title IX (http://eoc.unc.edu/our-policies/state-and-federal-laws/ title-ix-and-vawa/), which prohibits exclusion from participation on the basis of sex;d.Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (https:// accessibility.unc.edu/policies/), which outlaws discrimination on the basis of a handicap; or e.The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which allows students to challenge the content of their educational records. Copies of these policies can be obtained from the Ofce of the Dean of Students (https://odos.unc.edu/ ). They contain information about how to le a grievance. A grievance based on incidents that occurred more than six months before the complaint was led will not be considered. Student Access to Academic Records\u2014Protection against Improper Disclosure. As stated in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, students may have access to their full academic records. Individuals who are, or have been, in attendance at UNC-Chapel Hill may inspect and review their education records. Otherwise, education records are subject to condentiality requirements as specied by law and may not be disclosed improperly. Requests for recommendations imply that the student has given consent to the disclosure of information related to ability and performance. Judgments of ability and character may be provided under appropriate circumstances, normally with the knowledge or consent of the student. \"Education records\" are those records directly related to a student that are maintained by an educational institution. Particular University policy provisions are found in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Policies and Procedures under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 . Appealing a Grade . The University has systems for appealing a grade. The exact procedures vary among the academic units. Students should consult with their dean or department chairperson to obtain information about grade appeal procedures. See the section on \"Grade Appeals\" (p. 748) in this catalog. Part II. Guidelines Section 2. The Faculty Council endorses the following guidelines for the faculty- student relationship. This endorsement shall not be construed as faculty legislation, is not intended to establish a contractual undertaking by the University or any individual, and shall not constitute the basis for civil action in a court or a claim in any administrative or judicial body of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Clear Denition of Potential Honor Code Violations. In an attempt to avoid unintended misunderstanding, instructors should clearly state what is acceptable in their classes. When study aids such as computers are allowed, the instructor is responsible for explaining what constitutes proper use of these items. These rules should be established at the beginning of the course and should not be changed without giving students proper notice. Assignment of Graded Work during the Last Week of the Semester. Instructors may not assign graded work during the last week of classes unless the course syllabus clearly states that such an assignment will be given. Suggested Classroom Procedures. In general, instructors are strongly encouraged to follow the guidelines for course design and classroom procedures recommended by the Center for Faculty Excellence. When students enter into a learning relationship, they have certain needs and expectations. They are entitled to information about course procedures, attendance policy, content, and goals. Instructors should provide a syllabus that describes the course and methods of758 University Policies evaluation. Particular attention should be paid to several areas of special concern to students, including provision of reserve readings and grading policy. Evaluated assignments should be returned to the students within a reasonable amount of time. Since part of the purpose of such assignments is to provide feedback, students should be given time to assess and to learn from their mistakes. Ideally, such assessment would take place while the relevant topics are still fresh in their minds. Extra credit, if offered, should be announced publicly and made available to the entire class. Students Should Have Freedom of Expression. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study. They are responsible, however, for learning the content of any course of study in which they are enrolled. Incorrect facts and poorly supported arguments or opinions inevitably have an impact on grades. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the freedom of the faculty to assign grades according to appropriate academic standards. Responsibilities of Students and Teachers. Just as students ought to expect instructors who are knowledgeable and well-prepared, so should teachers expect their students to be motivated, eager to learn, and actively engaged in class. It is the responsibility of teachers to make their courses serious intellectual experiences for themselves and for their students. It is the responsibility of students to take seriously the courses in which they enroll. Good teachers need good learners. Students should understand that they are members of a community of scholars, and membership in such a community is not a passive activity. To be full participants in the educational community and to maximize the educational value of a class, preparation before class is necessary. Proper class preparation involves obtaining course materials as they are needed and completing assignments as they are due. Full participation in a class requires regular attendance, arriving on time and remaining until class conclusion, and active involvement in the work of the class. Students should also consider the extent of their own involvement in a class in assessing the educational value of the class. Recording Classes Best Practices The following information was posted to the Catalog on 8/18/2020 and distributed to faculty, instructors, and teaching assistants. The recommendations were developed by the Ofce of the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost. 1.Indicate on syllabi and on the departmental learning management system or website that classes may be recorded, noting that recordings will only be made available to students enrolled in the classes recorded. 2.When practicable, notify students and any guest speaker when a class is actually recorded. This notication may be provided verbally by the instructor or electronically through the online learning management system or telecommunication service used. It is advisable to make a more substantial notice during one of the initial classes, and then simply have a way to note that the class is being recorded during other classes in a more routinized way. 3.Ensure recordings are only made available to the students enrolled in the classes recorded. A recorded classroom lecture should not be used for any purpose except to meet the educational objectives of that particular class. Should the department or instructor wish to use recordings for any other purpose, the department should contact the Ofce of University Counsel.4.Prohibit students from making individual recordings of the class in any format without prior consent from the instructor and the school or department. 5.Prohibit students from sharing or distributing recordings obtained from the University or elsewhere. 6.Develop processes for how your department will record, store, and distribute such recordings. Consider whether to encourage or require all faculty to record all classes routinely. Consider whether certain classes include student discussion of sensitive or personal topics that may require further controls on recording. Consider recording options that best protect students' privacy (e.g., if practicable depending on the mode of instruction, audio- only recording or video that only displays the instructor and class materials without showing students' faces). Consider IT security practices and ways of providing recordings to students that minimize the risk of further disclosure (e.g., providing a non-downloadable version on the learning management system rather than sending it as an attachment in an email). Consider the process and specic circumstances by which enrolled students may make requests to record the class privately. Consider limiting student recordings to audio-only recordings. Example Language for Syllabus or Other Communication to Students The University may record meetings of this class for educational purposes. These recordings will be shared only with students enrolled in the course for purposes of academic instruction only. Your instructor will communicate to you how you may access any available recordings. Unauthorized student recording of classes on personal devices or on any other format is prohibited. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact Accessibility Resources & Service (https://ars.unc.edu/ ). Other students must obtain express permission from the department to record the class, and the University will only grant such permission in extraordinary circumstances in which the student otherwise lacks access to a recording made by the University or instructor. Students shall not copy, reproduce, or distribute any recordings of their classes, and students shall delete any recordings at the conclusion of the course. Any violation of these prohibitions or restriction on the making, use, copying, or distribution of recording of classes shall constitute an honor code violation. Example Language for Instructor This class is being recorded for educational purposes only, and the recordings may only be made available to students enrolled in this class. Any use of a recording of this class by a student shall be for educational purposes only. Students may not record this class on their own, in any format, without prior express authorization from the University and may not copy, reproduce, or distribute any recording that they access.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 759 Out-of-State Disclosures for Distance Education Programs Disclosure for Indiana Residents Enrolled in UNC- Chapel Hill Distance Education Programs The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is authorized by The Indiana Board for Proprietary Education, 101 W.

Any person desiring information about the requirements of the act or the applicability of those requirements to the institution may contact the Council at P.O. Box 43430, Olympia, WA 98504-3430. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act As a general rule, under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), personally identiable information may not be released from a student's education records without his or her prior written consent. To learn more about FERPA, please visit these links: UNC-Chapel (https://registrar.unc.edu/academic- services/uncferpa/)760 Transcripts TRANSCRIPTS Transcripts of Record A statement of ofcial academic record includes all signicant recorded information concerning the student's admission, classication, and scholarship. No partial or incomplete scholastic record will be given. The student's transcript notes his or her academic eligibility status. A statement of honorable dismissal will not be granted to students whose conduct and character would not entitle them to remain enrolled at the University or whose transcripts contain a notation of any probation, suspension, or other temporary restriction imposed for unsatisfactory conduct and still in force when the statement is made. The University does not release an ofcial transcript unless tuition, fees, and other obligations due the University have been paid. Students may order a transcript electronically through the link in their ConnectCarolina Student Center. This process provides an electronic authorization that allows the Ofce of the University Registrar to release the transcript at the student's request. Students may inspect their academic records at the Ofce of the University Registrar, Student and Academic Services Building North. For more information on how to request a transcript, please visit the Ofce of the University Registrar's website (http:// registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/transcripts-certications/order-a- transcript/ ). Policy on Awarding of Undergraduate Degrees and Transcript Notations The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will award only one bachelor's degree to a student, regardless of a possible second-major declaration, and will not admit or award a degree to a student who has already earned a bachelor's degree through another school of the University or at another college. Undergraduates in the professional schools in the Divisions of Academic Affairs and Health Affairs may earn a second major (not a second degree) in the College of Arts and Sciences or another professional school, but the rst major must be in the professional school. Exception: a student may earn a second bachelor's degree in one of several health profession schools of the University after receiving a bachelor's degree if the student is admitted to the professional school. Students pursuing two major elds of study for the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree earn only one degree and receive only one diploma. Both the diploma and the ofcial transcript will indicate the degree and the two majors. Students completing the requirements for both a bachelor of science degree and a bachelor of arts degree earn only the bachelor of science degree and receive only that diploma. Students completing the requirements for both a bachelor of arts degree and a bachelor of ne arts or bachelor of music degree earn only the bachelor of ne arts or bachelor of music degree and receive only that diploma. Note that these students must complete General Education requirements pertinent to the bachelor of arts as well as all requirements for the bachelor of ne arts or bachelor of music degree. Both the diploma and the ofcial transcript will indicate the degree (with its major) and the second major. Related Policies Under no circumstances can a second undergraduate degree be awarded in Academic Affairs after one has been earned in Health Affairs. In therare instance that an undergraduate student completes the requirements for an undergraduate degree and a graduate degree at the same time, the two degrees cannot be awarded at the same graduation. The undergraduate degree must be awarded rst, and the graduate degree awarded at a subsequent degree award date. Students who apply to graduate on a given degree award date, but who must complete requirements (such as courses with grades of IN or AB) after that degree award date, must reapply to graduate on a degree award date that follows the actual completion of requirements. Coursework taken after the degree award date cannot be used to change a degree already awarded, or to complete retroactively a degree, or to add retroactively an additional major or minor. Adjustments may be made to a transcript only for one year following the date of graduation. Grade appeals, for instance, can be initiated after graduation. Courses with temporary grades not affecting graduation (AB or IN) can be completed after the date of graduation and the grade point average changed accordingly; however, the student's status at the time of graduation is not affected. Graduation with distinction or highest distinction is based only on the grade point average at the time that the degree is ofcially conferred and posted on the academic transcript, and may not be awarded retroactively. Students who neglect to declare a second major or a minor at the time of graduation may request that the dean's ofce verify that the requirements had been satised at the time of graduation. In such cases, indication of the second major or minor can be added to the transcript within one year after the graduation date. Loan Deferments and Certication/ Verication of Enrollment Status The Ofce of the University Registrar provides conrmation of student enrollment data to nancial institutions, organizations, or agencies requiring proof of registration. Students can order an enrollment certication online through their ConnectCarolina Student Center. Additional information about ordering a certication (http:// registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/transcripts-certications/ enrollment-certication/) is available online or by calling (919) 962-3954.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate Catalog 761 TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID Student Finances Billing Policies Charges for tuition and fees, on-campus housing, and meals are assessed on a semester basis. Billing statements will only be available online through the ConnectCarolina Student Center. Students are responsible for accessing their statements online and insuring they are paid on time. Any past due charges will result in a hold on registration and transcripts. Students must pay past due balances from prior terms before they will be allowed to register for future semesters. Students registering after the rst tuition bill of the semester must either prepay tuition and fees or provide documented eligibility of nancial aid to the Ofce of the University Cashier. Students who are receiving nancial aid are eligible to request a student aid deferment to extend their payment due date until after the initial nancial aid disbursement of the semester. Deferments (https:// cashier.unc.edu/payment-options/nancial-aid/) can only be requested in ConnectCarolina by the student before the due date on the rst bill of each semester. It is extremely important for students to refer to the Ofce of the University Cashier website (http://cashier.unc.edu/) prior to each term for announcements and up-to-date information, and to follow instructions concerning payment/deferment due dates to avoid registration cancellation. Tuition and Fees Tuition and fees (http://cashier.unc.edu/tuition-fees/) for each academic year, including detailed information about the mandatory student fees, (http://cashier.unc.edu/tuition-fees/student-fees/) are published on the Ofce of the University Cashier website. Additional fees such as incoming student, special laboratory, and other designated program and course fees also may be charged. A late registration fee of $20 is charged for registration on or after the rst day of class for a term. Proxy and Authorized User Access Federal law (FERPA (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/ uncferpa/#details-0-0)) restricts access to student information. Proxy and/or Authorized User Access (https://ccinfo.unc.edu/give- proxyauthorized-users-access-information-2-2/) is for anyone the student authorizes to access and/or discuss the student account. Only authorized users have access to view the billing statements and make payments online. Payment Options Payments can be made in person at the Ofce of the University Cashier, through the mail, or by check or credit card online. For up-to-date information on payment options, please visit the payments section (http://cashier.unc.edu/payment-options/) of our website. Our returned check fee is $25. Each student is responsible for payment of his or her University charges. If a third party sponsor will be paying the charges, the Ofce of the University Cashier must receive a written authorization from the thirdparty well in advance so that a separate invoice can be sent to the proper agency or organization in order to ensure timely payment. Financial Aid Refunds The Ofce of the University Cashier encourages students who are receiving nancial aid in excess of tuition, fees, housing, and meal plan costs to sign up for eRefunds (https://cashier.unc.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/259/2016/05/setting-up-an-electronic-refund-account-for- student-account-refunds.pdf) as soon as possible. Excess funds from the account will be deposited to either a checking or savings account at the student's bank. Students should also promptly update their eRefund information if there are any changes to their banking information. Drop/Withdrawal Policies for Tuition and Fees The last day to reduce a course load for credit on a student's nancial account is the tenth day of the semester, commonly referred to as the \"census date.\" Dropping the only course a student is registered for requires an ofcial withdrawal. In case of withdrawal from the University, tuition and fees will be prorated according to the withdrawal refund calendar posted on the Important Dates (http://cashier.unc.edu/tuition-fees/important-dates/) section of our website for that semester. The last date for credit on a student's nancial account for withdrawal is nine weeks after the rst day of classes for the fall and spring semesters. If a student drops the only course he or she is taking, this constitutes a withdrawal from the University. Tuition Guarantee Program Under a North Carolina state law effective fall 2016, students classied as North Carolina residents for tuition purposes in undergraduate degree programs at UNC system schools are eligible for xed (or guaranteed) tuition for up to eight consecutive semesters (or ten semesters, if enrolled in an approved ve-year program). Further information about the Tuition Guarantee Program can be found on the website for the Ofce of the University Registrar (http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/ policies-procedures/student-rights/guaranteed-tuition/). Scholarships and Financial Aid For Undergraduates The University works to keep Carolina affordable for all students. Scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study funds are offered to help eligible students who cannot afford the full cost of attendance. Detailed information on scholarships and student aid can be found on the Ofce of Scholarships and Student Aid website (https:// studentaid.unc.edu/ ). You are also welcome to email aidinfo@unc.edu .

University Scholarships and Grants Undergraduate students are considered for university funded scholarships and grants, which do not have to be repaid, based on a detailed analysis of family nancial circumstances. This may include home equity, other income, and family assets that may not have been considered in the calculation of federal aid. Institutional scholarship and grant funds are combined with federal aid to provide a total offer of nancial aid based on nancial need. Academic Scholarships Each year, the University offers a limited number of academic scholarships to entering rst-year students. These highly competitive programs recognize academic achievement, leadership, commitment to service, and potential for success at the University. Some of these awards consider a combination of nancial need and academic merit. Because Carolina is a highly selective university, competition for academic scholarships is strong. Very few academic scholarships are awarded each year. There is no separate application for UNC academic scholarships. Selection is based on the information provided in a student's admission application. Academic scholarship nalists will be notied shortly after they are admitted. The Morehead-Cain (http://moreheadcain.org) and the Robertson Scholars (http://robertsonscholars.org) programs are administered by private foundations and do require separate applications.
