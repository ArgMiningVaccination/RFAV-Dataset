This program provides you with easy step-by-step instructions to gently prepare, cleanse, and rebuild your diet to align with, and stay balanced through, the season. This 3-day cleanse is simple and straightforward, and centers around seasonal, anti-inflammatory, eating. The program can be followed any time of year, but it will serve you best between seasons when our bodies already sense transition. While this cleanse is gentle it is not appropriate during menstruation, for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those feeling weak or debilitated. Benefits Cleansing is a vital part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle as it clears Ama (accumulated waste) from our mind and the tissues. Over time, everyday stress, environmental toxins, and processed foods cause toxicity to build up in the body, deposit in the tissues, and compromise our health. Seasonal cleansing helps to clear these accumulations from the body, as well as improve digestion, balance sleep cycles, and foster clarity. Planning If possible, plan your cleanse at a time when you're not too busy. (Is that even possible these days?) If this is unrealistic, plan to begin the program over the weekend to give yourself time to get familiar with the diet. Minimize social engagements and other commitments to allow time to rest. Mark your calendar and make a plan to shop for groceries and other supplies ahead of time. When you begin, you'll want to focus your energy on the process of renewal rather than running around gathering supplies. In the few days leading up, begin to clean up your diet. If you're in the habit of eating processed foods, dairy, sugar, sweets, meat, caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco, try and eliminate these now. The foods you eat will during the program will be easy to digest and help to improve the strength of agni (the metabolic fire). The Cleanse During the program, you'll be eating a simple diet of fruit, oatmeal, kitchari, herbal tea and warm water. Feel free to mix things up: alternate between oatmeal and fruit compote for breakfast, kitchari for lunch and dinner, or choose to eat kitchari for all three meals. It's entirely up to you. While this cleanse is only three days long, the variation is meant to keep you from getting bored. Prepare your meals fresh at whatever time suits you, though it is best to keep meal times the same each day. You may garnish your meals with chutneys, shredded coconut, and even a tiny bit of honey. It is very important to sip warm to hot water throughout the day, each day, for the duration of the cleanse. Think 8 glasses. To simplify, kitchari can be made once in the morning and then warmed up for your other two meals. The cleanse should be at least 3 days (for high Vata types especially), but may be as long as 10 depending on your constitution (stronger Kapha and Pitta types), workload, and how you feel from day to day. Plan to do only light work during the course of the cleanse and only as much exercise as feels appropriate. Yoga is ideal. Light walks, hikes in nature, meditation, and pranayama breathing exercises are also ideal. Sample Day 3: Breakfast: Kitchari Lunch: Kitchari Dinner: Kitchari sip herbal tea and hot water throughout the day Sample Day 3: Breakfast: Apple Compote Lunch: Kitchari Dinner: Kitchari sip herbal tea and hot water throughout the day Sample Day 3: Breakfast: Spiced Oatmeal Lunch: Kitchari Dinner: Kitchari sip herbal tea and hot water throughout the day Transition Days The cleansing period is preceded and followed by a few days of very clean, organic and vegetarian eating with reduced food intake. An emphasis on steamed vegetables are preferred, though vegetable soups and a light quantity of basmati rice and fruit should be included. No animal protein of any kind. The Diet This 3-day program centers around seasonal, anti-inflammatory, and Ayurvedic eating. The menu is balanced, simple, and designed to: Improve sense of energy Support a healthy body weight Promote regular elimination Restore balanced sleep patterns Restore calm to the nervous system Nourish the body during detoxification In general, eat as much as you'd like. You should feel satisfied, but not heavy and full. Garnish kitchari with chutneys (recipes below) and oatmeal with a bit of coconut and honey. Do not forget to sip warm water (8 glasses) throughout the day! If at any point you feel deprived, have a snack of fresh fruit, a handful of raw nuts, or half of an avocado with a squeeze of lime juice and salt. You may also steam your vegetables separately and serve them as a side dish. Recipes Dinacharya In Ayurveda, practicing dinacharya (daily routines) is key to staying healthy. Eating foods that are in season and adjusting our daily routines will accomodate for the time of year and enable us to sync with the natural rhythms of life. Wake early. To minimize heavy kapha qualities in the body and mind, try waking before 6:00 am. Daily Cleanse. Scrape your tongue each morning after brushing your teeth. If you're prone to seasonal allergies in the Spring, using a neti pot a couple of times a week will help to clear out the nasal passages. In the Fall, try applying a few drops of [Nasya Oil](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/lifestyle/how-to-do-nasya/)to lubricate the nasal passages when dry. Hydrate. Sip warm or hot water throughout the day. Hot water increases the digestive fire (agni) resulting in a better breakdown and assimilation of the things we consume. Move it. If you're cleansing, it's recommended that you take things easy. A brisk walk is fine, yoga is fine, but try not to exert too much during these days to allow your body the time to rest and digest. Don't put your body through more than it needs to. If you're not cleansing, however, then get a move on. Get your heart rate up. Try a cardio session, go for a run, or do a vigorous yoga practice between 6:00 and 10:00 am. If you're familiar with [Kapalabhati pranayama](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/yoga/kapalabhati-pranayama/), this is the time of day to practice. The fiery nature will stoke your digestive fire (agni) and prepare the body to remove heaviness that has accumulated. Eat at regular times. When possible, eat at the same time each day. Breakfast between 7:00-9:00am. Lunch between 12:00-1:00pm. Dinner before 7:00pm. Wind down. Relax. Establish a nightly ritual - sip tea, take a bath, read a book. Try and get to bed by 10:00 pm Observances Notice the following throughout the transition and detoxification phases: Drink 5 glasses of plain hot water per day. This is very important! Take hot baths or steamy showers. Steam room at spa or gym is OK. This serves to dilate blood vessels and the subtle channels, thus allowing toxins to be more efficiently removed. During the transitions days eat only basmati rice or quinoa and steamed vegetables. Don't overeat. Avoid all meats, processed foods, frozen foods, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, pizza, honey, caffeine, or cold drinks. Don't fast. Eat if you're hungry, don't if you're not. Again, don't overeat. Avoid strenuous activity. A gentle home yoga practice is perfect. Avoid exposure to the cold, stay warm, especially your head and neck. After the Cleanse After completing the program, your digestive system will have become accustomed to a very clean diet. A slow transition back to your normal routine is recommended. Plan to eat simple, whole foods, gradually adding back in dairy, meats, nightshades, wheat, etc. Listen to your body, it may offer you some insight as to which foods to avoid going forward. You may find that after you break the cleanse you will enjoy eating light for some time. An occasional mini fast with kitchari for a day here and there is suggested in the weeks following the fast. Should you feel an impulse to indulge in questionable foods, a mini fast serves to further break the link with that food. In the days following your cleanse, take some time to reflect on the experience, and your life, so that you may move forward with any new intentions that come up for you. You will feel a deep inner awareness... honor that. Take time to write, dig in the garden, dance around, be creative. You have just given yourself a beautiful gift. Ayurveda recognizes that each person is uniquely different. Follow your own body wisdom. Listen to it's requests. However, do your best to know the difference between a true bodily need and an impulse for something habituated to the mind. Disclaimer Guidelines provided here are general.
