The WHO defines \"comparative assessment of 20 virus characteristics and public health risks\" as primary action in response to the 21 emergence of new SARS -CoV-2 variants . Here, we demonstrate that the Mu variant 22 is highly resistant to sera from COVID -19 convalescents and BNT162b2 -vaccinated 23 individuals. Direct comparison of different SARS -CoV-2 spike proteins revealed that 24 Mu spike is more resistant to serum -mediated neutralization than all other currently 25 recognized variants of interest (VOI) and concern (VOC). This includes the Beta 26 variant (B.1.351) that has been suggested to represent the most resistant variant to 27 convalescent and vaccinated sera to date (e.g., Collier et al, Nature, 2021; Wang et 28 al, Nature, 2021). Since breakthrough infection by newly emerging variants is a 29 major concern during the current COVID -19 pandemic (Bergwerk et a l., NEJM, 30 2021), we believe that our findings are of significant public health interest. Our results 31 will help to better assess the risk posed by the Mu variant for vaccinated, previously 32 infected and na \u00efve populations. 33 .

As of September 2021, the WHO has defined four variant s 37 of concern (VOC) , Alpha (B.1.1.7 ), Bet a (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta 38 (B.1.617.2 and AY lineage s), as well as five variant s of interest (VOI) , Eta (B.1.5 25), 39 Iota Lambda (C.37) , and Mu (B.1.621) .1 40 The Mu variant represents the most recently recognized VOI .1 Until August 41 30, 2021, this VOI was detected in 39 countries ( Table S1 ). The epicenter of the Mu 42 variant is Colombia, where it was first isolated on January 11, 2021 ( GISAID ID: 43 EPI_ISL_1220045 ; Figure 1A and Table S2 ). This country has experienced a huge 44 COVID -19 surge from March to August 2021 that has peaked at 33,594 cases per 45 day ( on June 26, 2021; Figure 1A ). Although the Gamma VOC was dominant during 46 the initial phase, the Mu VOI outcompeted all other variants including the Gamma 47 VOC in May 2021 and has driven the epidemic in Colombia since then ( Figure 1A ). 48 Newly emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants need to be carefu lly monitored for 49 a potential increase in transmission rate, pathogenicity and/or resistance to immune 50 responses. For example, the resistance of VOC/VOIs to humoral immunity elicited 51 by natural SARS -CoV-2 infection or vaccination may allow significant spre ad of the 52 virus in populations that were initially thought to be protected.2 Resistance to COVID - 53 19 convalescent and vaccin e recipient sera can be attributed to a variety of 54 mutations in the viral spike protein.2 The majority of Mu variants harbors the following S3 and S4). These include mutations commonly 57 identified in VOCs: E484K (shared with Beta, Gamma), N501Y (shared with Alpha), 58 P681H (shared with Alpha) and D950N (shared with Delta) ( Table S 5). Of those, the 59 E484K change has been shown to reduce sensitivity towards antibodies induced by 60 natural SARS -CoV-2 infection and vaccination .3,4 61 To assess the sensitivity of the Mu variant to antibodies induced by SARS - 62 CoV-2 infection and vaccination, we generated pseudoviruses harboring the spike 63 proteins of Mu or the other VOC/VOIs. Virus neutralization assays revealed that the 64 Mu variant is 12.4-fold more resistant to sera o f eight COVID -19 convalescents, who 65 were infected during the early pandemic (April -September, 2020 ), than the parental 66 virus (P=0.0078 ; Figure 1B ). Also, the Mu v ariant was 7.6 -fold more resistant to sera 67 obtained from ten BNT162b2 -vaccinated individuals compared to the parental virus 68 (P=0.0020 ; Figure 1C ). Notably, although the Beta VOC was thought to be the most 69 resistant variant to date ,3,4 Mu pseudoviruses were significantly more resistant to 70 convalescent than Beta pseudoviruses 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Thus, the Mu variant shows a pronounced resistance to antibodies 72 elicited by natural SARS -CoV-2 infection and the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Since 73 breakthrough infections are a major t hreat of newly emerging SARS -CoV-2 74 variants ,5 we strongly suggest to further characterize and monitor the Mu variant. 75 .
