All rights reserved Page 1 of 571 The measure specifications contained in this manual are intended for claims -based and registry reporting of individual measures for the 2011 Physician Quality Reporting System (\"Physician Quality Reporting,\" formerly known as Physician Quality Reporting Initiative or PQRI ). Each measure is assigned a unique number. Measure numbers for 20 11 Physician Quality Reporting represent a continuation in numbering from the 20 10 measures . For 2010 PQRI measures that are continuing for ward in the 2011 Physician Quality Reporting System , measure specifications have been updated. In addition to the measure specifications manual, please refer to the \"201 1 Physician Quality Reporting System Implementation Guide\" for additional information essential in assisting eligible professionals ' understanding and submi ssion of measures. This document can be accessed at: http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/15_MeasuresCodes.asp . Measure specifications for measures groups reporting are included in a separate manual , \"2011 Physician Quality Reporting S ystem Measures Groups Specifications Manual ,\" which can be accessed at: http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/15_MeasuresCodes.asp . Eligible Professionals Eligible professional s submitting billable services on Part B claims for allowable Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) charges may report the quality action for selected Physician Quality Reporting quality measure(s). Providers not defined as eligible professional s in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 or the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 are not eligible to participate in Physician Quality Reporting. A list of eligible professional s can be found on the Physician Quality Reporting website at: http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/03_How_To_Get_Started.asp . Frequency and Performance Timeframes The measure i nstructions limit the frequency of reporting necessary in certain circumstances, such as for patients with chronic illness for whom a particular process of care is provided only periodically. Each individual eligible professional participating in 2011 Phys ician Quality Reporting should report according to the frequency and timeframe listed within each measure specification. Denominator Codes (Eligible Cases) and Numerator Quality- Data Codes Quality measures consist of a numerator and a denominator that permit the calculation of the percentage of a defined patient population that receive a particular process of care or achieve a particular outcome. The denominator population is defined by demographic information, certain International Classification of Dis eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM) diagnosis, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ( HCPCS ) codes specified in the measure that are submitted by individual eligible professional s as part of a claim for covered services under the PFS. If the specified denominator codes for a measure are not included on the patient's claim (for the same date of service) as submitted by the individual eligible professional , then the patient does not fall into the denominator population, and the Physician Quality Reporting measure does not apply to the patient. Some measure specifications are adapted as needed for implementation in Physician Quality Reporting in agreement with the measure developer. For example, CPT codes for non- covered services such as preventive visits are not included in the denominator. Also, the denominators for measures groups have been modified to provide common denominator codes for all measures within the group. Physician Quality Reporting measure specifications include specific instructions regarding CPT Category I modifiers, place of service codes, and other detailed information. Each eligible professional should carefully review the measure's denominator coding to determine whether codes submitted on a given claim meet denominator inclusion criteria . 2011 Physician Quality Reporting System (Physician Quality Reporting) Measure Specifications Manual for Claims and Registry Reporting of Individual Measures Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 2 of 571 If the patient does fall into the denominator population, the applicable Q uality Data Codes or QDCs (CPT Category II codes or G-codes) that define the numerator should be submitted to s atisfactorily report quality data for a measure. When a patient falls into the denominator , but the measure specifications define circumstances in which a patient may be appropriately excluded, CPT Cate gory II code modifiers such as 1P, 2P and 3P or G- codes are available to describe medical, patient, system, or other reasons for performance exclusion. When the performance exclusion does not apply, a measure- specific CPT Category II reporting modifier 8P or HCPCS G - code may be used to indicate that the process of care was not provided for a reason not otherwise specified. Each measure specification provides detailed reporting information.

Class IIa - Clopidogrel is recommended when aspirin is absolutely contraindicated. Class III - Dipyridamole. Because even the usual oral doses of dipyridamole can enhance exercise- induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina, it should not be used as an antiplatelet Class I - Aspirin 75 to 325 mg/dl in the absence of contraindicatio ns. Class I - Clopidogrel 75 qd for patients with a contraindication to ASA. (ACC/AHA) Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): Class I - A dose of aspirin, 160 to 325 mg, should be given on day one of AMI and continued indefinitely on a daily basis thereafter. Trials suggest long- term use of aspirin in the postinfarction patient in a dose as low as 75 mg per day can be effective, with the likelihood that side effects can be reduced. Class IIb - Other antiplatelet agents such as dipyridamole, ticlopidine or clopidogrel may be substituted if true aspirin allergy is present or if the patient is unresponsive to aspirin. (ACC/AHA) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: Aspirin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis against early saphenous graft thrombotic closure and should be considered a standard of care for the first postoperative year. In general, patients are continued on aspirin indefinitely, given its benefit in the secondary prevention of AMI. Ticlopidine is efficacious but offers no advantage over aspirin exce pt as an alternative in the truly aspirin- allergic patient. Clopidogrel offers the potential of fewer side effects compared with ticlopidine as an alternative to aspirin for platelet inhibition. Indobufen appears to be as effective as aspirin for saphenous graft patency over the first postoperative year but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Current evidence suggests that dipyridamole adds nothing to the aspirin effect for saphenous graft patency. (ACC/AHA) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Definition: New Episode - Patient with major depression who has not been seen or treated for major depression by any practitioner in the prior 4 months . A new episode can either be a recurrence for a patient with prior major depression or a patient with a new onset of major depression. Numerator Quality -Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily: Acute Treatment with Antidepressant Medication G8126: Patient with new episode of MDD documented as being treated with antidepressant medication during the entire 12 week acute treatment phase OR Acute Treatment with Antidepressant Medication not Completed for Documented Reasons G8128: Clinician docume nted that patient with a new episode of MDD was not an eligible candidate for antidepressant medication treatment or patient did not have a new episode of MDD OR Acute Treatment with Antidepressant Medication not Completed G8127: Patient with new episode of MDD not documented as being treated with antidepressant medication during the entire 12 week acute treatment phase RATIONALE : The consequences of untreated, or inadequately treated, depression are significant; therefore, adherence to antidepressant medi cation is very important. Clinical guidelines for depression stress the importance of effective clinical management in increasing patients' medication compliance, monitoring treatment effectiveness, and identifying and managing side effects. If pharmacological treatment is initiated, appropriate dosing and continuation of therapy through the acute and continuation phases decreases recurrence of depression. Thus, evaluation of length of treatment serves as an important indicator of success in promoting patient compliance with the establishment and maintenance of an effective medication regimen. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 36 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : Successful treatment of patients with major depressive disorder is promoted by a thorough assessment of the patient and close adherence to treatment plans. Treatment consists of an acute phase, during which remission is induced; a continuation phase, during which remission is preserved; and a maintenance phase, during which the susceptible patient is protected against the recurre nce of a subsequent major depressive episode. Patients who have been treated with antidepressant medications in the acute phase should be maintained on these agents to prevent relapse. American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder, 2000 Antidepressants should be continued for at least 6 months after remission of an episode of depression, because this greatly reduces the risk of relapse. (A: At least one randomized controlled trial as part of a body of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation (evidence level -I) without extrapolation) National Institute for Clinical Excellence (UK), Management of Depression in Primary and Secondary Care, 2004 In recent years, major depression has come to be considered a chronic and/or recurrent, rather than an acute illness. This reevaluation of the disorder has inherent treatment implications because patients with major depression tend to exhibit epi sodic recurrence and/or chronic residual symptoms. Considering this, the management of depression can be divided into the acute phase (suppression of symptoms to achieve clinical remission), lasting 8 to 12 weeks, and the maintenance phase (prevention of r elapse/recurrence), lasting 6 months or longer. Clinical management is an important component of pharmacotherapy; and includes a brief session of psychoeducation and supportive strategies. During the maintenance phase after remission of acute symptoms, all patients should continue the antidepressant dose that induced remission for at least 6 months. The relapse rate is 35% to 60% if antidepressants are discontinued in the first 6 months, compared with 10% to 25% in patients who continue medications. The ris k of relapse is particularly high if drug discontinuation occurs in the first few months of response/remission.

RATIONALE : The CT and MRI findings are critical to i nitiating care for the patient with stroke. All CT and MRI reports should address the presence or absence of these three important findings. This documentation is particularly vital in the report of the first imaging study performed after arrival at the hospital (whether or not the patient is admitted) , on which initial treatment decisions will be based.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : Brain imaging is required to guide acute intervention. (Grade A) There is a uniform agreement that CT accurately identifies most cases of intracranial hemorrhage and helps discriminate nonvascular causes of neurological symptoms, e.g., brain tumor. (Grade B) With the advent of rtPA treatment, interest has grown in using CT to identify subtle, early signs of ischemic brain injury (early infarct signs) or arterial occlusion that might affect decisions about treatment. The presence of these signs is associated with poor outcomes. (Adams, ASA, 2003) (Class A) A technically adequate head CT scan is required prior to administration of thrombolytic therapy to exclude brain hemorrhage and nonischemic diagnoses. The baseline CT scan is also sensitive for detection of early signs of cerebral infarction. Subtle or limited signs of early infarction on the CT scan are common even within the first 3 h of stroke evolution. Preliminary data suggest that specific MRI profiles may identify patients who are particularly likely to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. New MRI techniques including perfusion- weighted and diffusion -weighted may detect ischemic injury in the first hour and may reveal the extent of reversible and irreversible injury. In addition, MRI appears to be highly sensitive for identification of acute brain hemorrhage. (Albers, ACCP, 2004) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

There is a significant gap in documentation patterns of the optic nerve for both initi al and follow -up care (Fremont, 2003), even among specialists (Lee, 2006). Examination of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer provides valuable structural information about glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Visible structural alterations of t he optic nerve head or retinal nerve fiber layer and development of peripapillary choroidal atrophy frequently occur before visual field defects can be detected. Careful study of the optic disc neural rim for small hemorrhages is important, since these hemorrhages can precede visual field loss and further optic nerve damage. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : The physical exam focuses on nine elements: visual acuity, pupils, slit -lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), determination of central corneal thickness, gonioscopy, evaluation of opt ic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer, documentation of optic nerve head appearance, evaluation of fundus (through dilated pupil), and evaluation of the visual field.

Specifying the time of administration in the order is critical as available evidence suggests that the drug should be received within one hour before incision for maximum antimicrobial effect. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 57 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The anti -infective drug should ideally be given within 30 minutes to 1 hour before the initial incision to ensure its presence in an adequate concentration in the targeted tissues. For most procedures, scheduling administration at the time of induction of anesthesia ensures adequate concentrations during the period of potential contamination. Exceptions: cesarean procedures (after cross clamping of the umbilical cord); colonic procedures (starting 19 hours before the scheduled time of surgery). (ASHP) Infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minutes before incision. However, when a fluoroquinolone or vancomycin is indicated, the infusion should begin within 120 minutes before incis ion to prevent antibiotic -associated reactions. Although research has demonstrated that administration of the antimicrobial at the time of anesthesia induction is safe and results in adequate serum and tissue drug levels at the time of incision, there was no consensus that the infusion must be completed before incision.

Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 62 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: For most procedures, cefazolin should be the agent of choice because of its relatively long duration of action, its effectiveness agai nst the organisms most commonly encountered in surgery, and its relatively low cost. (ASHP) In operations for which cephalosporins represent appropriate prophylaxis, alternative antimicrobials should be provided to those with a high likelihood of serious adverse reaction or allergy on the basis of patient history or diagnostic tests such as skin testing. The preferred antimicrobials for prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty are cefazolin and cefuroxime. Vancomycin or clindamycin may be used in patients with serious allergy or adverse reactions to -lactams. The recommended antimicrobials for cardiothoracic and vascular operations include cefazolin or cefuroxime. For patients with serious allergy or adverse reaction to -lactams, vancomycin is appropriate, and clindamycin may be an acceptable alternative.

VTE prophylaxis is appropriate for all patients undergoing these procedures regardless of individual patient thromboembolic risk factors. Additional work is needed to determine if a physician- level measure for VTE prophylaxis can be developed to address individual patient thromboembolic risk factors, in addition to procedural risk, without creating data collection burden. Many of these procedures are done in hospitals and ASCs, but quite a few are performed in the physician's office. There are many reasons for the differences in the site of service, including that breast lesions and breast tissue varies considerably. Some women have a small breast and a small lesion that can be expeditiously treated as a minor office procedure done in 20 minutes under local anesthesia. In this instance, the evidence for DVT prophylaxis is simply not present. Other patients have small or large lesions located in difficult positions within a dense complex breast. In this instance, the patients have long procedures under general anesthesia. Both of these instances can occur within the same CPT code. It should be noted that the number of medical exclusions for these codes will likely be much higher than other codes to account for the variation in major and minor procedures within the same CPT code. Duration of VTE prophylaxis is not specified in the measure due to varying guideline recommendations for different patient populations. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Recommend that mechanical methods of prophylaxis be used primarily in patients who are at high risk of bleeding ( Grade 1C +) or as an adjunct to anticoagulant -based prophylaxis ( Grade 2A ). Recommend against the use of aspirin alone as prophylaxis against VTE for any patient group (Grade 1A ). Recommend consideration of renal impairment when deciding on doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, the direct thrombin inhibitors, and other antithrombotic drugs that are cleared by the kidneys, particularly in elderly patients and those who are at high risk for bleeding ( Grade 1C +). Moderate- risk general surgery patients are those patients undergoing a non-major procedure and are between the ages of 40 and 60 years or have additional risk factors, or those patients who are undergoing major operations and are < 40 years of age with no additional risk factors . Recommend prophylaxis with LDUH, 5,000 U bid or LMWH 3,400 U once daily (both Grade 1A). Higher -risk general surgery patients are those undergoing non- major surgery and are > 60 years of age or have additional risk factors, or patients undergoing major surgery who are > 40 years of age or have addit ional risk factors. Recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH, 5,000 U tid or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily (both Grade 1A). Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 74 of 571 Recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all major gynecologic surgery patients ( Grade 1A). For patients undergoing major, open urologic procedures, recommend routine prophylaxis with LDUH twice daily or three times daily ( Grade 1A ). Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, which includes hip and knee arthroplasty and hip fracture repair, represent a group that is at particularly high risk for VTE, and routine thromboprophylaxis has been the standard of care for > 15 years. Elective total hip replacement: routine use of LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted- dose VKA (all Grade 1A ). total knee arthroplasty: routine thromboprophylaxi s using fondaparinux, or adjusted- dose VKA (all Grade 1A ). 1B ). For major orthopedic surgical procedures, recommend that a decision about the timing of the initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis be based on the efficacy -to-bleeding tradeoffs for that particular agent ( Grade 1A ). For LMWH, there are only small differences between starting preoperatively or postoperatively, bot h options acceptable ( Grade 1A ).

It is anticipated that clinicians who treat the hip, spine, or distal radial fracture will submit this measure. Each occurrence of a fracture is identified by either an ICD -9-CM diagnosis code fo r fracture or osteoporosis and a CPT service code OR an ICD -9-CM diagnosis code for fracture or os teoporosis and a CPT procedure code for surgical treatment of a fracture. Patients with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius should have documentat ion in the medical record of communication from the clinician treating the fracture to the clinician managing the patient's on- going care that the fracture occurred and that the patient was or should be tested or treated for osteoporosis. If multiple fract ures occurring on the same date of service are submitted on the same claim form, only one instance of reporting will be counted. Claims data will be analyzed to determine unique occurrences. Documentation must indicate that communication to the clinician m anaging the on- going care of the patient occurred within three months of treatment for the fracture.

Although the fracture may be treated by the orthopedic surgeon, the testing and/or treatment is likely to be under the responsibility of the physician providing on- going care. It is important the physician providing on- going care for the patient be made aware the patient has sustained a non- traumatic fracture. There is a high degree of variability and consensus by experts of what constitutes a fragility fracture and predictor of an underlying problem of osteoporosis. The work group determined that only those fractures, which have the strongest consensus and evidence that they are predictive of osteoporosis, should be included in the measure at t his time. We anticipate that the list of fractures will expand as further evidence is published supporting the inclusion of other fractures. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The most important risk factors for osteoporosis -related fractures are a prior low -trauma fracture as an adult and a low BMD in patients with or without fractures. (AACE) BMD measurement should be performed in all women 40 years old or older who have sustained a fracture. (AACE) The decision to measure bone density should follow an individualized approach. It should be considered when it will help the patient decide whether to institute treatment to prevent osteoporotic fracture. It should also be considered in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for 2 months or more and pat ients with other conditions that place them at high risk for osteoporotic fracture.

RATIONALE: The appropriate timing of administration of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections. Available evidence suggests that although most surgical patients receive a prophylactic antibiotic, many do not receive the drug within one hour before incision as recommended. The anesthesia services included in the denominator are associated with some surgical procedures for which prophylactic parenteral antibiotics may not be indicated. As a result, clinicians should exclude patients from the denominator in those inst ances in which anesthesia services are provided but not associated with surgical procedures for which prophylactic parenteral antibiotics are indicated. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The anti -infective drug should ideally be given within 30 minutes to 1 hour before the initial incision to ensure its presence in an adequate concentration in the targeted tissues. For most procedures, scheduling administration at the time of induction of anesthesia ensures adequate concentrations during the period of potential contamination. Exceptions: cesarean procedures (after cross clamping of the umbilical cord); colonic procedures (starting 19 hours before the scheduled time of surgery). (ASHP) Infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minut es before incision. However, when a fluoroquinolone or vancomycin is indicated, the infusion should begin within 120 minutes before incision to prevent antibiotic -associated reactions. Although research has demonstrated that administration of the antimicrobial at the time of anesthesia induction is safe and results in adequate serum and tissue drug levels at the time of incision, there was no consensus that the infusion must be completed before incision.

DVT prevention is important for all patients who have suffered a stroke or an intracranial hemorrhage and may have decreased mobility. The intent of this measure is to assure that adequate DVT prophylaxis is received for either diagnosis. As noted in the clinical recommendation statements, the appropriate type of prophylaxis differs by diagnosis. Anticoagulants are gener ally contraindicated in patients with intracranial hemorrhage. These patients are still at risk for DVT so they should receive prophylaxis with mechanical devices. Low -dose subcutaneous heparin may be initiated on the second day after onset of the hemorrhage.

Dual x -ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and proximal femur provides reproducible values at important sites of osteoporosis -associated fracture. These sites are preferred for baseline and serial measurements. (AACE) The most important risk factors for osteoporosis -related fractures are a prior low -trauma fracture as an adult and a low BMD in patients with or without fractures. (AACE) BMD testing should be performed on: All women aged 65 and older regardless of risk factors Younger postmenopausal women with one or more risk factors ( other than being white, postmenopausal, and female) Postmenopausal women who present with fractures (NQF) The decision to test for BMD should be based on an individual's risk profile. Testing is never indicated unless the results could influence a treatm ent decision. (NQF) Markers of greater osteoporosis and fracture risk include older age, hypogonadism, corticosteroid therapy, and established cirrhosis. (Level B Evidence) (NQF) The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous such fractures. (NQF) Pharmacologic therapy should be initiated to reduce fracture risk in women with: BMD T -scores below - 2.0 by central dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) with no risk factors BMD T -scores below - 1.5 by central dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) with one or more risk factors A prior vertebral or hip fracture (NQF) The decision to measure bone density should follow an individualized approach.

It is anticipated that clinicians who treat hip, spine or distal radial fractures will submit this measure. Each occurrence of a fracture is identified by either an ICD -9-CM diagnosis code for fracture or osteoporosis and a CPT service code OR a n ICD- 9-CM diagnosis code for a f racture or osteo porosis and a CPT procedure code for surgical treatment of fractures. Patients with a fracture of the hip, spine, or distal radius should have a central DXA measurement ordered or performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed. The manageme nt (DXA ordered or performed or pharmacologic therapy prescribed) should occur within three months of the initial visit with the reporting clinician following the fracture.

Given that the majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in patients with a diagnosis of osteoporosis by bone mass measurement, exclusion of osteoporosis by bone mass testing does not preclude treatment of osteoporosis in a patient with a history of fracture. There is a high degree of variability and consensus by experts of what constitutes a fragility fracture and predictor of an underlying problem of osteoporosis. The work group determined that only those fractures, w hich have the strongest consensus and evidence that they are predictive of osteoporosis, should be included in the measure at this time. We anticipate that the list of fractures will expand as further evidence is published supporting the inclusion of other fractures.

Studies show that patients with a history of myocardial infarction, who have had beta- blocker therapy initiated and continued, have a 20 to 30% reduction in subsequent coronary events, cardiovascular mortality, and all -cause mortality (Yusuf, 1985). In a meta analysis by McGory et al (2005), long- term cardiac mortality and myocardial ischemia were reduced significantly by perioperative beta blockade. Patients maintained on beta- blockers, without complications that might w arrant discontinuation, are good candidates for continuation of beta- blockers through the perioperative period. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Prevention of Postoperative Arrhythmias Class I Preoperative or early postoperative administration of beta -blockers in patients without contraindications should be used as the standard therapy to reduce the incidence and/or clinical sequelae of atrial fibrillation after CABG . (Level of Evidence: B) The use of b- blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitr ates plays a significant role in ensuring that the myocardial oxygen demand does not exceed the supply. Patients well compensated while receiving these agents should be continued on their therapy through the perioperative period. Special attention should be paid to avoiding excess catecholamine effects by the sudden withdrawal of b- blocker therapy. At least one study supports the use of b- blocker immediately prior to surgery: in 1988, Stone and colleagues gave oral b- blockers 2 hours prior to surgery and reported a decrease in frequency of ST segment depression from 28% among control patients to 2% in treated patients. Similarly, in 1987, Pasternack and colleagues reported a reduction from 18% to 3% incidence of acute perioperative myocardial infarction in patients treated with metoprolol immediately prior to and following surgery. More recently, Podesser and colleagues demonstrated in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass procedures that the combination of nifedipine and metoprolol was associated with a lower incidence of ischemic events than nifedipine alone.

All rights reserved Page 118 of 571 CPT II 1110F : Patient discharged from an inpatient facility ( e.g. hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehabilitation facility) within the last 60 days RATIONALE: Medications are often changed while a patient is hospitalized. Continuity between inpatient and on- going care is essential. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: No trials of the effects of physician acknowledgment of medications post -discharge were found. However, patients are likely to have their medications changed during a hospitalization. One observational study showed that 1.5 new medications were initiated per patient during hospitalization, and 28% of chronic medications were canceled by the time of hospital discharge. Another observational study showed that at one week post -discharge, 72% of elderly patients were taking incorrectly at least one medication started in the inpatient setting, and 32% of medications were not being taken at al l. One survey study faulted the quality of discharge communication as contributing to early hospital readmission, although this study did not implicate medication discontinuity as the cause. (ACOVE) First, a medication list must be collected. It is import ant to know what medications the patient has been taking or receiving prior to the outpatient visit in order to provide quality care. This applies regardless of the setting from which the patient came \u2014 home, long- term care, assisted living, etc. The medi cation list should include all medications (prescriptions, over -the-counter, herbals, supplements, etc.) with dose, frequency, route, and reason for taking it. It is also important to verify whether the patient is actually taking the medication as prescribed or instructed, as sometimes this is not the case. At the end of the outpatient visit, a clinician needs to verify three questions: 1. Based on what occurred in the visit, should any medication that the patient was taking or receiving prior to the visit b e discontinued or altered? 2. Based on what occurred in the visit, should any prior medication be suspended pending consultation with the prescriber? 3. Have any new prescriptions been added today? These questions should be reviewed by the physician who compl eted the procedure, or the physician who evaluated and treated the patient. If the answer to all three questions is \"no,\" the process is complete. If the answer to any question is \"yes,\" the patient needs to receive clear instructions about what to do \u2014 all changes, holds, and discontinuations of medications should be specifically noted. Include any follow -up required, such as calling or making appointments with other practitioners and a timeframe for doing so.

It was felt by the Work Group that the error rate in simply not having addressed the issue at all is so much more substantial (Teno 1997) than the risk that an established plan has become outdated that we should not define a specific timeframe at this time. As this measure is tested and reviewed, we will continue to evaluate if and when a specific timeframe should be included. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Advance directives are designed to respect patient's autonomy and determine his/her wishes about future life- sustaining medical treatment if unable to indicate wishes. Key interventions and treatment decisions to include in advance directives are: resuscitation pr ocedures, mechanical respiration, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, dialysis, simple diagnostic tests, pain control, blood products, transfusions, and intentional deep sedation. Oral statements Conversations with relatives, friends, and clinicians are most common form; should be thoroughly documented in medical record for later reference. Properly verified oral statements carry same ethical and legal weight as those recorded in writing. Instructional advance directives (DNR orders, living wills) Written instructions regarding the initiation, continuation, withholding, or withdrawal of particular forms of life- sustaining medical treatment. May be revoked or altered at any time by the patient. Clinicians who comply with such directives are provided legal im munity for such actions.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Spirometry should be performed in all patients suspected of COPD. This is necessary for diagnosis, assessment of severity of the disease and for following the progress of the disease. (ATS and ERS) For the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, spirometry is the gold standard as it is the most reproducible, standardized, and objective way of measuring airflow limitation. FEV 1/FVC < 70% and a postbronchodilator FEV 1 < 80% predicted confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible.

(ATS and ERS) Bronchodilator medications are central to the symptomatic management of COPD. (Evidence A) (NHLBI/ WHO) A combination of a short -acting 2-agonist and an anticholinergic produces greater and more sustained improvements in FEV 1 than either alone and does not produce evidence of tachyphylaxis over 90 days of treatment. (Evidence A) (NHLBI/WHO) In patients with Stage II: Moderate COPD to Stage IV: Very Severe COPD whose symptoms are not adequately controlled with as -needed short -acting bronchodilators, adding regular treatment with a long -acting inhaled bronchodilator is recommended. (Evidence A) NHLBI/WHO) Regular treatment with long -acting bronchodilators is more effective and convenient than treatment with short -acting bronchodilators, but more expensive.

Cytogenetic testing should be performed on the bone marrow of patients with MDS in order to guide treatment options, determine prognosis, and predict the likelihood of disease evolution to leukemia. For acute leukemias: In addition to establishing the type of acute l eukemia, cytogenetic testing is essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities that have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 160 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: For MDS: Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are needed to calculate the degr ee of hematopoietic cell maturation abnormalities and relative proportions, percentage of marrow blasts, marrow cellularity, presence or absence of ringed sideroblasts (and presence of iron per se), and fibrosis. Marrow cytogenetics should be obtained beca use they are of major importance for prognosis (Category 2A Recommendation). (NCCN) The decision to treat patients having marrow blasts in the range of 20% to 30% with intensive AML therapy is thus complex and should be individualized. The clinician should consider such factors as age, antecedent factors, cytogenetics, comorbidities, pace of disease, and performance status (Category 2A Recommendation) . (NCCN) A chromosome abnormality confirms the presence of a clonal disorder aiding the distinction betwe en MDS and reactive causes of dysplasia, and in addition has major prognostic value. Cytogenetic analysis should therefore be performed for all patients in whom a bone marrow examination is indicated. (BCSH) For acute leukemias: The initial evaluation has two objectives. The first is to identify the pathology causing the disease including factors such as prior toxic exposure or myelodysplasia, cytogenetics and molecular markers that may have an impact on chemoresponsiveness and propensity for relapse which may guide choice of treatment. The second objective focuses on patient -specific factors including comorbid conditions that may affect an individual's ability to tolerate chemotherapy (Category 2A Recommendation). (NCCN) Although cytogenetic information i s usually unknown when treatment is initiated in patients with de novo AML, karyotype represents the single most important prognostic factor for predicting remission rate, relapse, and overall survival. Therefore, the importance of obtaining sufficient samples of marrow or peripheral blood blasts at diagnosis for this analysis cannot be overemphasized (Category 2A Recommendation) .

Bisphosphonates can inhibit bone resorption by reducing the number and acti vity of osteoclasts and therefore could \"reduce pain and bone fractures in people with multiple myeloma\". CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Based on published data and clinical experience, the guidelines recommend the use of bisphosphonates for all pati ents with multiple myeloma who have bone disease, including osteopenia. In 10% to 20% of patients with earlier -stage disease who do not have bone disease, bisphosphonates may be considered but preferably in a clinical trial (Category 1 Recommendation). (NC CN) Intravenous bisphosphonates should be administered monthly for patients with MM and lytic disease evident on plain radiographs (Grade A, Level II). It is reasonable to start intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with MM who do not have lytic bone di sease if there is evidence of osteopenia or osteoporosis on bone mineral density studies (Consensus Recommendation, Level N/A). No randomized clinical trials support the use of bisphosphonates in patients with smoldering MM. We believe that bisphosphonates should be used only in the setting of a clinical trial [in these patients] (Consensus Recommendation, Level N/A).

Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 172 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor -positive breast cancer should include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor recurrence. Aromatase inhibitors are appropriate as initial treatment for women with contraindications to tamoxifen. For all other postmenopausal women, treatment options include 5 years of aromatase inhibitors treatment or sequential therapy consisting of tamoxifen (for either 2 to 3 years or 5 years) followed by aromatase inhibitors for 2 to 3, or 5 years (ASCO guidelines include narrative rankings). (ASCO) Patients intolerant of aromatase inhibitors should receive tamoxifen. Women with hormone receptor -negative tumors should not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy (ASCO guidelines include narrat ive rankings). (ASCO) Patients with invasive breast cancers that are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive should be considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, lymph node status, or whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is to be administered (Category 2A). (NCCN) The most firmly established adjuvant endocrine therapy is tamoxifen for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Prospective, randomized trials demonstrate that the optimal duration of tamoxifen appears to be five years. In patients receiving both tamoxifen and chemotherapy, chemotherapy should be given first, followed by sequential tamoxifen. Several studies have evaluated aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal women with early -stage breast cancer (Category 2A).

Despite its importance, a review of Medi care billing data has indicated that the ESRD population had a less than 50% immunization rate for the years 1997 to 1998 and 1998 to 1999. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons aged 65 and older and persons in selected high- risk groups. (B recommendation) (USPSTF) Vaccination is recommended for the following persons who are at increased risk for complications from influenza: adults and children who have required regular medical follow -up or hospitali zation during the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]); (CDC) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

A patient receiving hemodialysis whose Kt/V level is less than 1.2 is not receiving optimal dialysis. This measure assesses whether the treating physician addressed the low Kt/V level. A plan of care (action defined as checking for adequacy of the AV access, increasing the blood flow, increasing the dialyzer size, or increasing the time of dialysis sessions) should be documented by the physician for every time Kt/V is less than 1.2. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Quantifying HD is the first step toward assessment of its adequacy. Fortunately, the intermittent rapid decrease in urea concentration during HD allows a relatively easy measurement of the dose. The delivered dose of HD should be measured at regular intervals no less than monthly (A). (KDOQI TM ) The minimally adequate dose of HD given 3 times per week to patients with K r less than 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 should be an spKt/V (excluding RKF) of 1.2 per dialysis. For treatment times less than 5 hours, an alternative minimum dose is a URR of 65% (A). The target dose for HD given 3 times per week with K r less than 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 should be an spKt/V of 1.4 per dialysis not including RKF, or URR of 70% (A).

HCV is an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic, leading to persistent infec tion. During chronic infection, HCV RNA reaches high levels, generally ranging from 10 5 to 107 international units (IU)/mL, but the levels can fluctuate widely. However, within the same individual, RNA levels are usually relatively stable. (NIH) After init ial exposure, HCV RNA can be detected in blood within 1 to 3 weeks and is present at the onset of symptoms. Antibodies to HCV are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in only 50 to 70 percent of patients at the onset of symptoms, increasing to more than 90 percent after 3 months. The clinical utility of serial HCV viral levels in a patient is predicated on continued use of the same specific quantitative assay that was used in the initial determination of the viral level. While there is little correlation between disease severity or disease progression with the absolute level of HCV RNA, quantitative determination of the HCV level provides important information on the likelihood of response to treatment in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing should be performed in: a. patients with a positive anti -HCV test (Grade II -2); b. patients for whom antiviral treatment is being considered, using a quantitative assay (Grade II -2); c. patients with unexplained liver disease whose anti -HCV test is negative and who are immunocompromised or suspected of having acute HCV infection (Grade II -2). (AASLD) The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection is often suggested by abnormalities in ALT levels and is established by EIA followed by confirmatory determination of HCV RNA.

An early virologic response (EVR), during the first 12 weeks of therapy, is a valuable clinical milestone. In the absence of an EVR, the likelihood of an SVR is 0 -3%. If the only goal of therapy is to achieve an SVR, therapy can be discontinued after 12 weeks if an EVR is not achieved. Potentially, histologic benefit can accrue even in the absence of an SVR; therefore, some authorities treat beyond 12 weeks even in patients who have not achieved an EVR. For documentation of a virologic response at the end of therapy (end- of- treatment response) or an SVR 6 months after completing therapy, a more sensitive quantitative assay with a lower limit of 50 IU/mL, if available, or a qualitative HCV RNA assay is recommended. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Baseline and 12- week monitoring of HCV RNA levels should be performed with the same quantitative amplification assay. An early virologic response (EVR), defined as a 2-log10 reduction in HCV RNA levels during the first 12 weeks of therapy, is a valuable clinical milestone (Category I). (AGA) Clinical and virologic monitoring during therapy should be conducted at intervals ranging from once a month to once every 3 months. Fre quent hematologic monitoring is necessary to identify marked anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone level is indicated to identify hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (Category I).

(ACSCoC) Surgical resection is the primary therapy for most colorectal carcinomas, and the most important prognostic indicators are related to the pathologic findings in the resection specimen. The anatomic extent of disease is by far the most important prognostic fac tor in colorectal cancer. Pathologic staging depends on pathologic documentation of the anatomic extent of disease, whether or not the primary tumor has been completely removed. If a biopsied tumor is not resected for any reason (e.g., when technically unf easible) and if the highest T and N categories or the M1 category of the tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for pathologic classification and staging have been satisfied without total removal of the primary cancer.

This measure is written as a negative measure so that the performance goal is 100%, consistent with the other measures for this condition. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Routine use of a bone scan is not required for s taging asymptomatic men with clinically localized prostate cancer when their PSA is equal to or less than 20.0 ng/mL. (AUA) Patients with a life expectancy > 5 years or symptomatic: A bone scan is appropriate for T1 to T2 disease in the presence of a PSA greater than 20 ng/mL, Gleason score of 8 or higher, clinical stage of T3 to T4, or symptomatic disease. Patients at higher risk of metastatic disease may undergo pelvic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with possible f ine-needle aspiration of enlarged lymph nodes or staging lymph node dissection. Nomograms or risk tables may be used to identify patients with a higher likelihood of having metastatic disease. If the nomogram indicates a probability of lymph node involvement greater than 20% or if the patient is stage T3 or T4, this is recommended as a threshold for doing a staging CT scan or MRI evaluation. For all other patients, no additional imaging is required for staging. (NCCN) ( Category 2A ) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 1 percent of the adult population. Although the course of RA in individual patients is highly variable, most patients with persistent RA develop progressive functional limitation and physical disability. In addition, there is excess mortality and decreased survival among patients with persistent RA compared with the general population. While the prevalence of RA is low, the associated costs are very high over the lifetime of the affected person. Costs of RA amount to approximately 1 percent of the U.S. Gross National Product. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 236 of 571 RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder often characterized by progressive joint destruction and multi -system involvement. RA affects approximately 2.5 million Americans, disproportionately women. There is no cure; consequently, the goal of treatment is to slow the progression of disease, thereby delaying or preventi ng joint destruction, relieving pain and maintaining functional capacity. RA pain is often most effectively managed in the long term by altering the natural history of the active progressive disease with DMARDs, but analgesics and anti -inflammatory drugs also have an important place in pain management. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: RA should be treated as early as possible with DMARDs to control symptoms and delay disease progression. Good Practice Point: All patients with persistent inflammatory joint disease (> 6 -8 weeks duration) already receiving simple analgesics and NSAIDs should be considered for referral for specialist rheumatology opinion and DMARD therapy, preferably within 12 weeks. Early DMARD therapy in RA is important to maintain fu nction and reduce later disability. DMARD therapy should be sustained in inflammatory disease in order to maintain disease suppression. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Subcommittee on Rheumatoid Arthritis Guidelines: Guidelines for the Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The majority of patients with newly diagnosed RA should be started on DMARD therapy within three months of diagnosis. All patients with RA are candidates for DMARD therapy. Although NSAIDs and glucocorticoids may allevi ate symptoms, joint damage may continue to occur and progress. Initiation of DMARD therapy should not be delayed beyond three months for any patient with an established diagnosis who, despite adequate treatment with NSAIDs, has on- going joint pain, significant morning stiffness or fatigue, active synovitis, persistent elevation of the ESR or CRP level or radiographic joint damage. For any untreated patient with persistent synovitis and joint damage, DMARD treatment should be started promptly to prevent or slow further damage. (ACR: Wherever possible, guidelines are evidence- based. However, because significant gaps in knowledge still exist, some recommendations are based on best practices and a consensus of the committee.) Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network: Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis. There is clear evidence from placebo- controlled trials that DMARDs reduce symptoms in RA (as measured by joint pain, swelling and tenderness, and duration and severity of morning stiffness). DMARDs also improve global well being, as assessed by both patients and physicians. It is becoming increasingly clear that DMARDs should be introduced as soon as possible. Protracted benefit may be achieved in RA patients if appropriate DMARD therapy is introduced early. Refer to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

Pneumonia accounts for an estimated 20 percent of nosocomial infections among the elderly, second only to urinary tract infections. The disease burden is large for older adults and the potential for prevention is high. (Ely, E., 1997) Drugs such as penic illin were once effective in treating these infections; but the disease has become more resistant, making treatment of pneumococcal infections more difficult. This makes prevention of the disease through vaccination even more important. (CDC. National Immunization Program \u2014Pneumococcal Disease, 2005) CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services recommends pneumococcal vaccine for all immunocompetent individuals who are 65 and older or ot herwise at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. Routine revaccination is not recommended, but may be appropriate in immunocompetent individuals at high risk for morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal disease (e.g., persons 75 years of age or with severe chronic disease) who were vaccinated more than five years previously. Medicare Part B fully covers the cost of the vaccine and its administration every five years. (United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1998) Pneumococcal infection is a comm on cause of illness and death in the elderly and persons with certain underlying conditions. In 1998, an estimated 3,400 adults aged 65 years died as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 243 of 571 Pneumococcal infection accounts for more deaths than any other vaccine- preventable bacterial disease. (CDC, 2002; Pneumococcal Pneumonia, NIAID Fact Sheet, December 2004.) One of the Healthy People 2010 objectives is to increase pneumococcal immunization levels for the non- institutionalized, high- risk populations to at least 90 percent (objective no. 14.29). While the percent of persons 65 years and older receiving the pneumococcal vaccine has increased, it still remains considerably below the Health People 2010 objective. According to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is used to track performance on year 2010 objectives, in 1998 only 46 percent of adults age 65 years and older report rec eiving the vaccine. The figure was 45 percent based on the 1997 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. (National Center for Health Statistics., 2005; CDC, 1997) A particular strength of this measure is that it provides an opportunity t o compare performance against national, state and/or regional benchmarks, which are collected through nationally organized and administered surveys. At the physician practice level where a patient survey may not be feasible, data collection on pneumonia vaccination status through chart abstraction is a viable option.

For women 40 to 49 years of age mammography can reduce mortality by 17 percent. (AMA, 2003) CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or with out clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1- 2 years for women aged 40 and older. (USPSTF, 2002) The USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12- 33 months significantly reduces mortality from breast cancer. Evidence is strongest for w omen aged 50-69, the age group generally included in screening trials. (USPSTF, 2002) For women aged 40- 49, the evidence that screening mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammography is smaller, than it is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortality benefit for women undergoing mammography at ages 40- 49, but the delay in observed benefit in women younger than 50 makes it difficult to determine the incremental benefit of beginning screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. (USPSTF, 2002) The absolute benefit is smaller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among women in their 40s than it is among older women. (USPSTF, 2002) The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizable to women aged 70 and older (who face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by comorbid disease. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increases along a continuum with age, wher eas the likelihood of harms from screening (false- positive results and Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 246 of 571 unnecessary anxiety, biopsies, and cost) diminishes from ages 40- 70. The balance of benefits and potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age. The precise age at which the potential benefits of mammography justify the possible harms is a subjective choice. (USPSTF, 2002) American Cancer Society: Yearly Mammograms starting at age 40 and continuing for as long as a woman is in good health. (Smith, 2003) American College of Preventative Medicine (ACPM): Low-risk women (no family history, familial cancer syndrome, or prior cancer). There is inadequate evidence for or against mammography screening of women under the age of 50. Women between the ages of 50- 69 should have annual or biennial, high- quality, two - view mammography. Women aged 70 and older should continue undergoing mammography screening provided their health status permits breast cancer treatment. (Ferrini, 1996) Higher -risk women: Women with a family history of pre-menopausal breast cancer in a first-degree relative or those with a history of breast and/or gynecologic cancer may warrant more aggressive screening. Women with these histories often begin screening at an earlier age, although there is no direct evid ence of effectiveness to support this practice. The future availability of genetic screening may define new recommendations for screening high- risk women. (Ferrini, 1996) The American Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American College of Radiology (ACR), all support screening with mammography and CBE beginning at age 40. (AMA, 1999; ACOG, 2000; Feig, 1998) The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), recommends beginning mammography for average- risk women at age 50. (Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination, 1999; AAFP, 2005) AAFP recommends that mammography in high- risk women begin at age 40, and recommends t hat all women aged 40- 49 be counseled about the risks and benefits of mammography before making decisions about screening.

There were an estimated 135,400 new cases and 56,700 deaths from the disease during 2001. Colorectal cancer (CRC) places significant economic burden on the society as well with treatment costs over $6.5 billion per year and, among malignancies, is second only to breast cancer at $6.6 billion per year (Schrag, 1999). Colorectal cancer screening can detect pre- malignant polyps and early stage cancers. Unlike other screening tests that only detect disease, colorectal cancer screening can guide removal of pre-malignant polyps, which in theory can prevent development of colon cancer. Three tests are currently recommended for screening: fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 249 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: During the past decade, compelling evidence has accumulat ed that systematic screening of the population can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. Three randomized, controlled trials demonstrated that fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), followed by complete diagnostic evaluation of the colon for a positive test , reduced colorectal cancer mortality (Hardcastle et al., 1996; Kronborg; 1996). One of these randomized trials (Mandel et al., 1993) compared annual FOBT screening to biennial FOBT screening, and found that annual screening resulted i n greater reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. Two case control studies have provided evidence that sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality (Selby et al., 1992; Newcomb et al., 1992). Approximately 75% of all colorectal cancers arise sporadi cally (Stephenson et al., 1991). Part of the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening is mediated by the removal of the precursor lesion \u2014an adenomatous polyp (Vogtelstein et al., 1988). It has been shown that removal of polyps in a population can reduc e the incidence of colorectal cancer (Winawer, 1993). Colorectal screening may also lower mortality by allowing detection of cancer at earlier stages, when treatment is more effective (Kavanaugh, 1998). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published an updated recommendation for colorectal cancer screening in 2008. The guideline strongly recommends that clinicians screen men and women ages 50 to 75 years of age for colorectal cancer (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends not screening adult s age 85 and older due to possible harms (D recommendation). The appropriateness of colorectal cancer screening for men and women aged 76 to 85 years old should be considered on an individual basis (C recommendation). While the approved modalities vary for patients 50 to 75 years old, the USPSTF found there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and fecal DNA (fDNA) testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer for all patients (I statem ent).

(Scott J.G., D. Cohen, B. Dicicco- Bloom, 2001) About 80 percent of antibiotics prescribed for acute respiratory infections in adults are unnecessary, according to CDC prevention guidelines. In adults, antibiotics are most often (65- 80 percent) prescribed for acute bronchitis, despite its viral origin. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic drug resistance, which is of public health concern due to the dimi nished efficacy of antibiotics against bacterial infections, particularly in sick patients and the elderly.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: AACE/ACE, ADA, and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO ): Recommend that a dilated eye examination be performed on patients with diabetes during an initial assessment and at least annually thereafter. (AACE/ACE, 2002; ADA, 2004; AAO, 1998; Hammond, 1998) American Association Clinical Endocrinologists and A merican College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE): Recommend that the annual eye examination be performed as part of a retinal module. The module includes test of visual acuity (Snellen chart); funduscopic examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) test. The AAC E/ACE recommends that diabetic patients should be under the care of an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy. AACE/ACE further believes that a dilated eye exam should only be done by an MD/DO. (AACE/ACE, 2002) American Diab etes Association (ADA): Patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 3 -5 years after the onset of diabetes. In general evaluation for diabetic eye disease is not necessary before 10 years of age. However, some evidence suggests that the prepubertal duration of diabetes may be important in the development of microvascular complications; therefore, clinical judgment should be used when applying these recommendations to individual patients. (Level of Evidence: B) Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after diabetes diagnosis. (Level of Evidence: B) Subsequent examinat ions for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowledgeable and experienced in diagnosing the presence of diabetic retinopathy and is aware of its management. Examination will be requir ed more frequently if retinopathy is progressing. This follow -up interval is recommended recognizing that there are limited data addressing this issue. (Level of Evidence: B) Seven standard field stereoscopic 30\u00b0 fundus photography is an accepted method f or examining diabetic retinopathy. (ADA, 2004) American Academy of Ophthalmology ( AAO): Recommends that diabetic patients should be under the care of an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinopathy. Ophthalmologists with specializ ed knowledge and experience in managing the disease are best able to detect and treat serious disease. Stereoscopic photographs offer an advantage over nonstereoscopic photographs, and the traditional \"seven stereo fields\" provide the most complete coverag e. (AAO, 1998; Hammond, 1996) American Geriatrics Society (AGS): Dilated eye examinations should be performed every two years at a minimum, and more often if there are additional risk factors for diabetic eye disease or evidence of age- related eye disease.

All rights reserved Page 263 of 571 CLINICAL RECOM MENDATION STATEMENTS: American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE): Recommends that the initial assessment should include a urinalysis, test for microalbuminuria and creatinine clearance. The renal complication module should be performed annually and includes a test for microalbuminuria and creatinine clearance (AACE/ACE, 2002). American Diabetes Association (ADA): A test for the presence of microalbumin should be performed at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Micr oalbuminuria rarely occurs with short duration of type 1 diabetes; therefore, screening in individuals with type 1 diabetes should begin after 5 years' disease duration (Level of Evidence: E). However, some evidence suggests that the prepubertal duration of diabetes may be important in the development of microvascular complications; therefore, clinical judgment should be exercised when individualizing these recommendations. Because of the difficulty in precise dating of the onset of type 2 diabetes, such screening should begin at the time of diagnosis. After the initial screening and in the absence of previously demonstrated microalbuminuria, a test for the presence of microalbumin should be performed annually (ADA, 2004). Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by three methods: 1) measurement of the albumin- to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection 2) 24-h collection with creatinine, allowing the simultaneous measurement of creatinine clearance 3) timed (e. g. 4- h or overnight) collection - the anal ysis of a spot sample for the albumin- to-creatinine ratio is strongly recommended. The role of annual microalbuminuria assessment is less clear after diagnosis of microalbuminuria and institution of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiote nsin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy and blood pressure control. Many experts recommend continued surveillance to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease. National Kidney Foundation (NKF): Individuals at increased risk, but found not to have chronic kidney disease, should be advised to follow a program of risk factor reduction, if appropriate, and undergo repeat periodic evaluation (NKF, 2003). A comparative analysis of recommendations and evidence in diabetes guidelines from 13 countries (including the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Medical Association) found there was agreement among the guidelines that ACE inhibitors should be recommended to patients with hypertension and renal disease (Burgers, 2002). The ADA also recommends that for the treatment of both micro- and macroalbuminuria, ARBs should be used except during pregnancy (ADA, 2005).

Hypertension is common in patients with CKD, and if hypertension is left untreated, it will speed the progression of the disease. Recent research has shown that during office visits, approximately 20% to 30% of CKD patients do not have their blood pressure measured. Additionally, if the CKD patient is has an anemia/ESA visit, they are even less likely to have their blood pressure measured. In these patient s, recent research has shown that 75% do not have their blood pressure measured at an anemia/ESA visit. Patients with CKD should have their blood pressure measured at each office visit so that changes can be identified and treatment initiated as soon as it is necessary. Blood pressure control is important in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. By slowing the progression of the disease, quality of life is improved for the patient, and it results in a longer period of time before a patient requires renal replacement therapy. Patients with chronic kidney disease should have a lower target blood pressure (< 130/80) than other patients with hypertension. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Blood pressure should be measured at each health encounter. (Grade A) (NKF 2004) If a patient has GFR 30 ml/min/1.73m 2, then his/her blood pressure should be checked with every clinic visit. (Grade A) (RPA 2002) If a patient has a GFR 30 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2, and if blood pressure is determined to be elevated (systolic > 130 mmHg OR diastolic > 80 mmHg), then s/he should receive intensified antihypertensive therapy (Grade B). (RPA, 2002) Patients with CKD should be considered in the \"highest -risk\" group for CVD for implementing recommendations for pharmacologi cal therapy, irrespective of cause of CKD (Grade A). (NKF, 2004) Target blood pressure for CVD risk reduction in CKD and diabetic/nondiabetic kidney disease should be < 130/80 mmHg (Grade B).

Additionally, these patients should also have their Hb level checked at least monthly. Given that Hb levels vary for each patient due to numerous factors, it is necessary to monitor Hb level closely in order to make the individualized treatment decisions required in maintaining Hb level in the target ran ge. There is no evidence of benefit from ESA therapy when Hb levels are maintained at greater than 13.0 g/dL. Maintaining Hb at higher levels may result in potential harm to the patient, as well as incur unjustified cost. Evidence linking increased risks f or patients with CKD and higher Hb levels were for target Hb levels greater than 13.0g/dL. The intention of this measure is not to suggest that the goal of ESA treatment is to reach an achieved Hb of 13.0 g/dL. Rather, as a patient safety measures, it is t o realize that patients who reach Hb levels higher than 13.0 g/dL are at increased risk for adverse events, and that these elevated Hb levels need to be addressed by adjusting ESA dosage. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 273 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The frequency of Hb monitoring in patients treated with ESAs should be at least monthly. (Opinion) (NKF 2006) The Hb target is the intended aim of ESA therapy for the individual patient with CKD. In clinical practice, achieved Hb results vary considerably from Hb target. Selection of the Hb target and selection of the Hb level at which ESA therapy is initiated in the individual patient should include consideration of potential benefits (including improvement in the quality of life and avoidance of transfusion) and potential harms including the risk of life- threatening adverse events). (Clinical Practice Recommendation) (NKF 2007) In dialysis and nondialysis patients with CKD receiving ESA therapy, the selected Hb target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL. (Clinical Practice Recommendation) (NKF 2007) In dialysis and nondialysis patients with CKD receiving ESA therapy, the Hb target should not be greater than 13.0 g/dL. (Clinical Practice Guideline; Moderately Strong Evidence) (NKF, 2007) The initial ESA dose and the ESA dose adjustments should be determined by the patient's Hb level, the target Hb level, the observed rate of increase in Hb level, and clinical circumstances. (Opinion) (NKF 2006) ESA doses should be decreased, but not necessarily held, w hen a downward adjustment of Hb level is needed.

All rights reserved Page 276 of 571 RATIONALE: The widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) in the United States is inevitable. EHRs will improve caregivers' decisions and patients' outcomes. Once patients experience the benefits of this technology, they will demand nothing less from their providers. Hundreds of thousands of physicians have already seen these benefits in their cli nical practice. (Blumenthal et al, 2010) Health care experts, policymakers, payers, and consumers consider health information technologies, such as electronic health records and computerized provider order entry, to be critical to transforming the health care industry. Information management is fundamental to health care delivery. Given the fragmented nature of health care, the large volume of transactions in the system, the need to integrate new scientific evidence into practice, and other complex inform ation management activities, the limitations of paper -based information management are intuitively apparent . Health care is growing increasingly complex, and most clini cal research focuses on new approaches to diagnosis and treatment. In contrast, relativ ely little effort has been targeted at the perfection of operational systems, which are partly responsible for the well -documented problems with medical safety. Safe care now requires a degree of individualization that is becoming unimaginable without comp uterized decision support. Multiple studies now demonstrate that computer -based decision support can improve physicians' performance and, in some instances, patient outcomes. In the past decade, the risk of harm caused by medical care has received increasi ng scrutiny. The growing sophistication of computers and software should allow information technology to play a vital part in reducing that risk \u2014 by streamlining care, catching and correcting errors, assisting with decisions, and providing feedback on per formance. Given the large potential risks and benefits as well as the costs involved, this article includes an analysis of what is known about the role and effect of information technology with respect to safety and consider s the implications for medical c are, research, and policy. (Bates et al, 2003) The need for clinical information systems to provide high- quality, safe care is a well recognized fact. This need was well publicized by Dr. Ed Wagner in his \"Chronic Care Model\" as one of the key elements to provide high- quality care. To quote from the Improving Chronic Care Web site, \"Effective chronic illness care is virtually impossible without information systems that assure ready access to key data on individual patients as well as populations of patient s. A comprehensive clinical information system can enhance the care of individual patients by providing timely reminders about needed services and summarized data to track and plan care. At the practice population level, they identify groups of patients needing additional care, as well as facilitate performance monitoring and quality improvement efforts.\" To be able to take advantage of many of the more advanced applications of health information technology, the facility must first implement an EMR and use it to document patient encounters.

Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one- quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45- 60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. Other forms of neuropathy may also play a role in foot ulcerations. Motor neuropathy resulting in anterior crural muscle atrophy or intrinsic muscle wasting can lead to foot deformities such as foot drop, equinus, and hammertoes. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems - such as amputations and numbness - compared with 10% of nondiabetics. Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Recognizing important risk factors and making a logical, treatment -oriented assessment of the diabetic foot requires a consistent and thorough diagnostic approach using a common language. Without such a method, the practitioner is more likely to overlook vital information and to pay inordinate attention to less critical points in the evaluation. A useful examination will involve identification of key risk factors and assignment into appropriate risk category. Only then can an effective treatment plan be designed and implemented.

Shoe trauma, in concert with loss of protective sensation and concomitant foot deformity, is the leading event precipitating foot ulceration in persons with diabetes. Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one- quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45- 60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic.

Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The multifactorial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers is evidenced by the numerous pathophysiologic pathways that can potentially lead to this disorder. Among these are two common mechanisms by which foot deformity and neuropathy may induce skin breakdown in persons with diabetes. The first mechanism of injury refers to prolonged low pressure over a bony prominence (i.e., bunion or hammertoe deformity). This generally causes wounds over the medial, lateral, and dorsal aspects of the fo refoot and is associated with tight or ill -fitting shoes.

BMI is calculated either as weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared multiplied by 703, or as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters square d. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides a BMI calculator table at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm . (AHRQ Preventive Guidelines 2009) Elderly BMI - Most experts suggest use of a higher BMI threshold for underweight elderly individuals, compared to what is used for the general population (Chernoff, Cook, Mahan). International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology defines underweight in persons >65 years of age as a BMI of <23. This BMI value is one indicator of malnutrition when forming a nutrition diagnosis for the elderly population (American Dietetic Association). A BMI of <23 classifies an older adult (older than age 65) as underweight and may require nutrition intervention. Calculated BMI - Requires that both the height and weight are actually measured. Values merely reported by the patient cannot be used. Follow -up Plan - Proposed outline of treatment to be conducted as a result of abnormal BMI measurement. Such follow -up can include documentation of a future appointment, education referral, (such as, a registered dietician, nutritionist, occupational therapy , primary care physician, exercise physiologist, ment al health professional, surgeon, etc. ) prescription/administration of medications/dietary supplements, etc. Not Eligible/Not Appropriate for BMI Measurement - Patients can be considered not eligible in the following situations: There is documentation in the medical record that the patient is over or under weight and is being managed by another provider If the patient has a terminal illness - life expectancy less than 6 months If the patient refuses BMI measurement If there is any other reason documented in the medical record by the provider explaining why BMI measurement was not appropriate Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Further, the report revealed that the overall self -reported obesity prevalence in the United States was 26.7 percent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from 2007 to 2009 among adults aged 18 years or older (CDC, 2010). Obesity continues to be a public health concern in the United States and throughout the world (Flegal, et al, 2005; Ogden, et al, 2007)). In the United States, obesity prevalence doubled among adults between 1980 and 2004 (Flegal , et al, 2002; Ogden, et al, 2006). Obesity is associated with increased risk of a number of conditions, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and certain cancers, and with increased risk of disability and a modestly elevated risk of all- cause mortality. With obesity on the rise, the medical community anticipates an increase in the complications of obesity, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, degenerati ve arthritis, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis, gallbladder disease and others.

All rights reserved Page 285 of 571 Results from the 2005- 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that an estimated 32.7 percent of U.S. adults 20 years and older are overweight, 34.3 percent are obese and 5.9 percent are extremely obese. Although prevalence of adults in the U.S. who are obese is still high, with about one- third of adults obese in 2007- 2008, although new data suggest that the rate of increase for obesity in the U. S. in recent decades may be slowing (Flegal, et al, 2010). In 2000, obesity was responsible for an estimated 400,000 deaths, compared to 300,000 in 1990 (Flegal, et al, 2005). Obesity places second only to smoking as the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. In addition, obesity is a significant contributor to premature death. In Caucasians ages 20 to30 with a BMI >45 kg/m2, it has been estimated that obesity decreases life expectancy by 13 years in men and 8 years in women (Fontaine, e t al, 2003). Poor nutrition or underlying health conditions can result in underweight. Results from the 2003- 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), using measured heights and weights, indicate that an estimated 1.8% of U.S. adult s are underweight. (Source: The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Health E -Stat. Prevalence of Underweight Among Adults: United States, 2003- 2006, Accessed September 15, 2010 at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/underweight/underweight_adults.htm . A tremendous gap still exists between our knowledge of malnutrition and its sequelae and our actions in preventing and treating it. To date professionals in various disciplines have applied their own approaches to solving the problem. Yet the causes of mal nutrition are multi -factorial and the solutions demand an integration of knowledge and expertise from the many different disciplines involved in geriatric care. Older people have special nutritional needs due to age and disease processes. Elderly pati ents with unintentional weight loss are at higher risk for infection, depression and death. The leading causes of involuntary weight loss are depression (especially in residents of long- term care facilities), cancer (lung and gastrointestinal malignancies) , cardiac disorders and benign gastrointestinal diseases. Medications that may cause nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, dysgeusia and anorexia have been implicated. Polypharmacy can cause unintended weight loss, as can psychotropic medication reduction (e.g., by unmasking problems such as anxiety). In one study it was found that a BMI of less than 22 kg per m2 in women and less than 23.5 in men is associated with increased mortality. In another study it was found that the optimal BMI in the elderly is 24 to 29 kg per m2. (Huffman, G. B., Evaluation and Treatment of Unintentional Weight Loss in the Elderly, American Family Physician, 2002 Feb, 4:640- 650). Ranhoff, et al (2005), identified through an observational study that using a BMI<23, resulted in a positive screen for malnutrition (sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.71), giving 0.75 correctly clas sified subjects. Thus leading to the recommendation that a score of BMI<23 should be followed by MNA -SF when the aim is to identify poor nutritional status in elderly . In 1998 the medical costs of obesity were estimated to be as high as $78.5 billion, with roughly half financed by Medicare and Medicaid (Finkelstein, et al, 2009). This analysis presents updated estimates of the costs of obesity for the United States acr oss payers (Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers), in separate categories for inpatient, non- inpatient, and prescription drug spending. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 286 of 571 Finkelstein, et al (2009), found that the increased prevalence of obesity is responsible for almost $40 billion of increased medical spending through 2006, including $7 billion in Medicare prescription drug costs. We estimate that the medical costs of obesity could have risen to $147 billion per year by 2008. Ma, et al (2009) performed a retrospective, cross -sectional analysis of ambulatory visits in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 and 2006. The study findings on obesity and office -based quality of care concluded the evidence is compelling that obesity is underappreciated in office -based physician practices across the United States (Ma, et al, 2009). Many opportunities are missed for obesity screening and diagnosis, as well as for the prevention and treatment of obesity and related health risks, regardless of patient and provider characteristics (Ma, et al, 2009). A Web search of the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse on the key words of BMI, body mass index, produced four measures, all focused on possible follow -up for overweight and obesity for a broader age r ange and/or related to a specific disease/condition. There were no measures that focused on underweight or a follow -up plan. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Although multiple clinical recommendations addressing Obesity have been developed by professio nal organizations, societies and associations , two recommendations, which exemplify the intent of the measure and address the numerator and denominator , have been identified. The US Preventive Health Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2003) recommends that cli nicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese adults (Level Evidence B) . Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) (2009) Prevention and Management of Obesity (Mature Adolescents and Adults) provides the following guidance: Calculate the body mass index; classify the individual based on the body mass index categories. Educate patients about their body mass index and their associated risks. (Annotation #1; Aim #1) Weight management requires a team approach. Be aware of clinical and community resources. The patient needs to have an ongoing therapeutic relationship and follow -up with a health care team. Weight control is a lifelong commitment , and the health care team can assist with setting specific goals with the patient. (Annotations #10, 13; Aim #4) There are no current clinical recommendations addressing Underweight or Unintentional Weight Loss in the elderly population that have been developed by professional organizations, societies or associations.

Two- thirds of physician visits result in writing at least one prescription (Stock, et al, 2009). Chronically ill patients are increasingly being treated as outpatients, many of whom take multiple medications requiring close monitoring (Nassarella, et al, 2007). Since 2002, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ambulatory care visits secondary to adverse drug events. The Nati onal Scorecard for U.S. Health System Performance identified increased utilization of ambulatory care services and demonstrates that inadequate medication reconciliation often leads to poor safety. Adverse drug events prove to be more fatal in outpatient settings (1 of 131 outpatient deaths) than in hospitals (1 of 854 inpatient deaths) (Nassarella, et al, 2007). According to the Commonwealth Fund report (2010) about 11 to 15 of every 1,000 Americans visit a health care provider because of adverse drug ev ents in a given year, representing about three to four of every 1,000 patient visits during 1995 to 2001. The total number of visits to treat adverse drug events increased from 2.9 million in 1995 to 4.3 million visits in 2001. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 289 of 571 Community -dwelling individu als in the U.S. made ambulatory care visits for the treatment of adverse drug events (VADEs ) at a rate of 3.3 to 4.0 per 1,000 visits, or 10.9 to 15.3 per 1,000 population during 1995- 2001 (Zhan et al. 2005). Fields, et al (2005) concluded adverse drug events (ADE) in the ambulatory setting substantially increase the healthcare costs of elderly persons and estimated costs associated with adverse drug events among older adults in the ambulatory setting were $1,983 per case. The Commonwealth Fund (2010) ident ified implications based on previous studies of ADEs in ambulatory care (Gandhi et al. 2003; Gurwitz, et al. 2003) and the assumption can be generalized to the data, 11 percent to 28 percent of the 4.3 million VADEs in 2001 might have been prevented with i mproved systems of care and better patient education, yielding an estimate of 473,000 to 1.2 million potentially preventable VADEs annually. Further, assuming the average cost of treating a preventable ADE is $1,983 the potential cost - savings that could be achieved by reducing VADEs would be $946 million to $2.4 billion. In the Institute for Safe Medication Practices White Paper (2007), the American Pharmaceutical Association identified that Americans spend more than $75 billion per year on prescription a nd nonprescription drugs. Unnecessary costs include: improper use of prescription medicines due to lack of knowledge costs the economy an estimated $20 -100 billion per year; American businesses lose an estimated 20 million workdays per year due to incorrec t use of medicines prescribed for heart and circulatory diseases alone; failure to have prescriptions dispensed and/or renewed has resulted in an estimated cost of $8.5 billion for increased hospital admissions and physician visits nearly one percent of th e country's total health care expenditures. In 2005, the rate of medication errors during hospitalization was estimated to be 52 per 100 admissions, or 70 per 1,000 patient days. Emerging research suggests the scope of medication-related errors in ambulat ory settings is as extensive as or more extensive than during hospitalization. Ambulatory visits result in a prescription for medication 50 to 70% of the time. One study estimated the rate of ADEs in the ambulatory setting to be 27 per 100 patients. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2005, in the United States 701,547 patients were treated for ADEs in emergency departments and 117,318 patients were hospitalized for injuries caused by an ADE. Individuals aged 65 years and older are more likely than any ot her population group to require treatment in the emergency department for ADEs. Critical patient information, including medical and medication histories, current medications the patient is receiving and taking, and sources of medications, is essential to the delivery of safe medical care. However, interruptions in the continuity of care and information gaps in patient health records are common and significantly affect patient outcomes. Consequently, clinical judgments may be based on incomplete, inaccurate , poorly documented or unavailable information about the patient and his or her medication regimen.

In 2005, the Agency for Healthcare Quality ( AHRQ ) reported data on adults age 65 and over who received potentially inappropriate prescription medicines in the calendar year, by race, ethnicity, income, education, insurance status, and gender. The disparities were identified as follows : older Asians were more likely than older Whites to have inappropriate drug use (20.3% compared with 17.3%); Older Hispanics were less likely than older non- Hispanic Whites to have inappropr iate drug use (13.5% compared with 17.6%); Older women were more likely than older men to have inappropriate drug use (20.2% compared with 14.3%); there were no statistically significant differences by income or education. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: After a comprehensive and thorough search of Cochrane Library, National Quality Measures Clearing House, and relevant specialty society web sites, it was identified a relevant clinical recommendation, which addresses the intent, numerator and denominator of this measure is not available for reference. However, the following supportive documents from various specialty associations and organization's recognize the importance and need for this process to occur consistently in safe clinical practic e. In 2007, the American Medical Association published The Physician's Role in Medication Reconciliation, which identified the best medication reconciliation team as one that is multidisciplinary and --in all settings of care--will include physicians, phar macists, nurses, ancillary health care professionals and clerical staff. The team's variable requisite knowledge, skills, experiences, and perspectives are needed to make medication reconciliation work as safely and smoothly as possible. Team members may h ave access to vital information or data needed to optimize medication safety. Because physicians are ultimately responsible for the medication reconciliation process and subsequently accountable for medication management, physician leadership and involvement in all phases of developing and initiating a medication reconciliation process or model is important to its success.

The provisions from the National Pain Care Policy Act 2009 (H.R. 756/S660) incorporated into the Health Care Reform Bill includes: Mandating an Institute of Medicine conference on pain to addres s key medical and policy issues affecting the delivery of quality pain care; Establishing a training program to improve the skills of health care professionals to assess and treat pain; and, Enhancing the pain research agenda for the National Institute of Health (NIH). The American Pain Associations (2009) identified pertinent facts related to the impact of pain as follows: 76.5 million Americans suffering from pain. Pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. It is the number one reason people seek medical care. Uncontrolled pain is a leading cause of disability and diminishes quality of life for patients, survivors, and their loved ones. It interferes with all aspects of daily activity, including sleep, work, social and sexual relations. Under -treated pain drives up costs - estimated at $100 billion annually in healthcare expenses, lost income, and lost productivity - extending length of hospital stays, as well as increasing emergency room trips and unplanned clinic vis its. Medically underserved populations endure a disproportionate pain burden in all health care settings. Disparities exist among racial and ethnic minorities in pain perception, assessment, and treatment for all types of pain, whether chronic or acute. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 295 of 571 There are no current estimates of the total cost of poorly controlled pain in today's dollars. Viewed from the perspective of health care inflation (more than 40% during the past decade) ( President's Council of Economic Advisors , 2009), the NIH statistics (1998) ($100 billion annually in health care utilization and lost productivity for those in the workforce, and $86 billion annually for just one diagnosis, Martin, et al, 2008) make it likely that the total U.S. spending on pain is at least comparable to the costs associated with other chronic illnesses. The annual costs associated with pain are probably at least as high as the estimated annual cost of $174 billion that is attributed to diabetes (The Mayday Fund, 2009). More needs to be known about the economic impact of chronic pain. But even in the absence of adequate data, it is clear the enormous pain- related costs represent both a great challenge and an opportunity in terms of improving the quality and cost - effectiveness of care (The Mayday Fund, 2009) . The prevalence of pain has a tremendous impact on business, with an estimated annual cost of $61.2 billion in lost productive time. Studies show that most of the pain- related lost productive time occurs while employees are at work and is in the form of reduced performance. The cost of pain is an enormous burden on today's society, particularly to employers (American Academy of Pain Medicine, 2010). Stewart et al (2003) identified almost thirteen percent of the total workforce experienced a loss in produc tive time during a two- week period due to a common pain condition: 5.4% for headache; 3.2% for pain; 2.0% for other musculoskeletal pain. Green (2003) identified pain to be widely recognized as an undertreated health problem in the general population. Failure to assess pain is a critical factor leading to undertreatment. In September 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that a pproximately 80 percent of the world population has either no or insufficient access to treatment for moderate to severe pain. Chronic pain\u2014commonly defined as pain persisting longer than six months \u2014affects an estimated 70 million Americans and is a tragically overlooked public health problem (USDHHS, 2006). Significant gaps exist in the provision of effective quality pain care (Green, 2003; Green, 2006; Freeman, et al, 2000). Findings of the Mayday Fund Pain Committee (2009) identified chronic pain treatment needs major reforms to enhance assessment, increase access to the right care, improve quality and equitable care, and cut costs. Initiatives to address the huge public health problem of unrelieved chronic pain should be part of any discussion on refor ming the health care system to enhance access and reduce costs. While national attention has become increasingly focused on health disparities, less attention has been given specifically to inequities in pain care (APS, 2002; IOM, 2002). Bonham (2001) identified the reasons for deficiencies in pain management included cultural, societal, religious, and political attitudes, including acceptance of torture. There are clear variations in the way pain is assessed and managed among all minority populations (Gr een, 2003; Green, 2006; Freeman, et al, 2000). Significant gaps exist in the provision of effective quality pain care due to the lack of research and medical training focused on pain care disparities (Green, 2003; Green, 2006; Freeman, et al, 2000).

Most chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women; however, women's pain complaints tend to be poorly assessed and undertreated (Green, 2003). A growing body of research reveals even more extensive gaps in pain assessment and treatment among racial and ethnic populations, with minorities receiving less care for pain than non- Hispanic whites (Green, 2003; Green, 2006; Todd, et all, 2004; Todd, et al 2007). Differences in pain care occur across all types of pain (e.g., acute, chronic, cancer -related) and medical settings (e.g., emergency departments and primary care) (Green, 2003; Green, 2006; Todd, et al 2007). Even when income, insurance status and access to health care ar e accounted for, minorities are still less likely than whites to receive necessary pain treatments (Green, 2003; Green, 2006; Paulson, et al, 2007). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement chronic pain guidelines was chosen because they address the key factors of the plan of care, pain assessment, and outcomes, are based on a very broad foundation of evidence, and addresses a wide range of clinical conditions. Chronic pain assessment should include determining the mechanisms of pain through documentation of pain location, intensity, quality and onset/duration; functional ability and goals; and psychological/social factors such as depression or substance abuse. ( Annotations #2, 3, 12; Aim #2) A patient -centered, multifactorial, comprehensive care plan is necessary, one that includes addressing biopsychosocial factors. Addressing spiritual and cultural issues is also important. It is important to have a multidisci plinary team approach coordinated by the primary care physician to lead a team including specialty areas of psychology and physical rehabilitation.

All rights reserved Page 298 of 571 Definitions: Screening - Testing done on people at risk of developing a certain disease, even if they have no symptoms. Screening tests can predict the likelihood of someone having or developing a particular disease. This measure looks for the test being done in the practitioner's office that is filing the code. Standardized Tool - An assessment tool that has been appropriately normalized and validated for the population in which it is used. Some depression screening tools include: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI or BDI -II), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES -D), Depression Scale (DEPS), Duke Anxiety -Depression Scale (DADS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), GDS - Short Version, Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), The Zung Self -Rating De pression Scale (SDS), and Cornell Scale Screening (this is a screening tool which is used in situations where the patient has cognitive impairment and is administered through the caregiver). Follow -Up Plan - Proposed outline of treatment to be conducted as a result of clinical depression screen. Such follow -up must include further evaluation if screen is positive and may include documentation of a future appointment, education, additional evaluation and/or referral to a practitioner who is qualified to dia gnose and treat depression, and/or notification of primary care provider. Not Eligible/Not Appropriate - A patient is not eligible if one or more of the following conditions exist: Patient refuses to participate Patient is in an urgent or emergent situatio n where time is of the essence and to delay treatment would jeopardize the patient's health status Situations where the patient's motivation to improve may impact the accuracy of results of nationally recognized standardized depression assessment tools. For example: certain court appointed cases Patient was referred with a diagnosis of depression Patient has been participating in on- going treatment with screening of clinical depression in a preceding reporting period Severe mental and/or physical incapacity where the person is unable to express himself/herself in a manner understood by others.

In primary care settings, the point prevalence of major depression ranges from 5 to 9 percent among adults, and up to 50 percent of depressed patients are not recognized. Depressive disorders are also relatively common in younger persons, wi th estimated prevalence of 0.8 to 2.0 percent in children and 4.5 percent in adolescents. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force compared the effects of integrated recognition and management depression screening programs with \"usual care\" in community primar y care practices. Results showed significantly improved patient outcomes. The National Center for Policy Analysis and the U.S. Surgeons General, among others, estimate the direct and indirect costs of depression to American businesses ranging from $36.2 billion to $80 billion annually. Major depression is \" ranked second only to ischemic heart disease in magnitude of disease burden in established market economies\" and \"is the leading cause of disabilit y (measured by the number of years lived with a disabling condition) worldwide among persons age 5 and older.\" Murray CJL, Lopez AD, eds. The Global Burden Of Disease And Injury Series, Volume 1: A Comprehensive Assessment Of Mortality And Disability From Diseases, Injuries, And Risk Factors In 1990 And Projec ted To 2020 . Cambridge, MA: Published by the Harvard School of Public Health on behalf of the World Health Organization and the World Bank, Harvard University Press, 1996. Despite the high prevalence and substantial impact of depression, detection and tre atment in the primary care setting have been suboptimal. Studies have shown that usual care by primary care physicians fails to recognize 30% to 50% of depressed patients. Because patients in whom depression goes unrecognized cannot be appropriately treate d, systematic screening has been advocated as a means of improving detection, treatment, and outcomes of depression. Compared with usual care, screening for depression can improve outcomes, particularly when screening is coupled with system changes that help ensure adequate treatment and follow -up.

All rights reserved Page 300 of 571 A search of the literature in PubMed concerning social workers and depression screening showed nothing to indicate that these practitioners are routinely screening their patients for depression. A search of the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse database found no depression screening measures that address Medicare eligible patients and there was only one measure from the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement addressing screening for patients aged 18 years and older with suspected major depressive disorder. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: USPSTF recommends screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow- up. Small benefits have been observed in studies that simply feed back screening results to clinicians. Larger benefits have been observed in studies in which the communication of screening results is coordinated with effective follow- up and treatme nt. (Evidence: B) The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care used the rigorous USPSTF 2002 systematic review to update their recommendations regarding depression screening. The Canadian task force arrived at the same practice recommendations as USP STF. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

This measure is intended to determine whether or not CKD patients received an influenza immunization during the flu season. It is anticipated that clinicians providing care for pat ients with CKD will submit this measure. Measure Reporting via Claims: ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes, and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator.

Additionally, it is estimated that fewer than 20% of all patients in high risk groups receive a flu vaccine each year. Patients with CKD need to be vaccinated yearly in order to decrease morbidity and mortality related to influenza and its complications. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Vaccination with TIV (trivalent inactivated flu vaccine) is recommended for the following persons who are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza, or at higher risk for influenza- associated clinic, emergency department, or hospital visits: adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus). (CDC, 2007) In any given year, the optimal time to vaccinate patients cannot be determined because influenza seasons vary in their timing, and more than one outbreak might occur in a single community in a single year. (CDC, 2007) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 303 of 571 In general, health- care prov iders should begin offering vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available and if possible, by October. (CDC, 2007) Vaccine efforts should continue throughout the season, because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza might not occur in certain communities until February or March. The majority of adults have antibody protection against influenza within 2 weeks after vaccination. (CDC, 2007) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Follow- up for skin examination and surveillance is an important aspect in the management of patients with a current diagnosis or a history of melanoma. The presence of a recall system, whether it is electronic or pa per based, enables providers to ensure that patients receive follow -up appointments in accordance with their individual needs. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Skin examination and surveillance at least once a year for life is recommended for all melanoma patients, including those with stage 0 in situ- melanoma. Frequency of dermatologic surveillance should be determined individually, based on risk factors, including skin type, family history, presence of dysplastic nevi, and history of non- melanoma skin cancers. Clinicians should also consider educating patients about monthly self -exam of their skin and lymph nodes. (NCCN) For patients with stage IA melanoma, a comprehensive H&P (with specific emphasis on the regional nodes and skin) should be performed every 3 to 12 months as clinically indicated. For patients with stage IB -III melanomas, a comprehensive H&P (with emphasis on the regional nodes and skin) should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 3 years; then every 4 to 12 months for 2 years; and ann ually (at least) thereafter, as clinically indicated.

Counseling can be discussed with all patients with AMD, even those who do not meet the criteria for the AREDS formulation, patients who are smokers (beta- carotene can increase the risk for cancer in these patients) or other reasons why the patient would not meet criteria for AREDS formulation as outlined in the AREDS. The ophthalmologist or optometrist can explain why these supplements are not appropriate for their particular situation. Also, given the purported risks associated with antioxidant use, patients would be informed of the risks and benefits and make their choice based on valuation of vision loss vs. other risks. As such, the measure seeks to educate patients about overuse as well as appropriate use.

Scientific basis for counseling regarding use of AREDS formulation for patients with AMD Antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements help to reduce the rate of progression to advanced AMD for those patients with intermediate or advanced AMD in one eye. From the same AREDS study, there is no evidence that the use of antioxidant vitamin and m ineral supplements for patients with mild AMD alters the natural history of mild AMD. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 312 of 571 At the same time, published meta analyses have raised an issue as to the presence of an elevated mortality risk among patients taking elements similar to parts of the AREDS formulation (and elevated risk among smokers). As such, patients need to know of their individualized risk profile for taking the AREDS formula AND the potential benefits, so that they can make their OWN individual decision as to whether or not to t ake the AREDS formulation. This indicator thus seeks to directly enhance the provider -patient relationship to apply the results of level 1 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a manner that accommodates the needs of each individual patient in a patient -centered manner, rather than a paternalistic approach of either recommending or withholding treatment. 2. Evidence of gap in care. Antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements help to reduce the rate of progression to advanced AMD for those pati ents with intermediate or advanced AMD in one eye. From the same AREDS study, there is no evidence that the use of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for patients with mild AMD alters the natural history of mild AMD. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATE MENTS: Patients with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye should be counseled on the use of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements as recommended in the Age- related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) reports.

Scientific basis for intraocular pressure (IOP) control as outcomes measure (intermediate) Analyses of results of several randomized clinical trials all demonstrate that reduction of IOP of at least 18% (EMGT, CIGTS, AGIS, CNTGS) re duces the rate of worsening of visual fields by at least 40%. The various studies, however, achieved different levels of mean IOP lowering in realizing their benefit in patient outcomes, ranging from 18% in the \"normal pressure\" subpopulation of EMGT to 42 % in the CIGTS study. (Level I studies) As such, an appropriate \"failure\" indicator is to NOT achieve at least a 15% IOP reduction. The rationales for a failure indicator are that 1) the results of different studies can lead experienced clinicians to believe that different levels of IOP reduction are appropriate; 2) to minimize the impact of adverse selection for those patients whose IOPs are more difficult to control; and 3) because each patient's clinical course may require IOP reduction that may vary fro m 18 to 40+%. In addition, \"...[s]several population based studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of POAG as well as the incidence of POAG, increases as the level of IOP increases. These studies provide strong evidence that IOP plays an important rol e in the neuropathy of POAG. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that reduction in the level of IOP lessens the risk of visual field progression in open- angle glaucoma. In addition, treated eyes that have a greater IOP fluctuation are at increased risk of progression. Intraocular pressure is the intermediate outcome of therapy used by the FDA for approval of new drugs and devices and, as noted above, has been shown to be directly related to ultimate patient outcomes of vision loss. As such, failure to achieve minimal pressure lowering, absent an appropriate plan of care to address the situation, would constitute performance whose improvement would directly benefit patients with POAG.

Evidence for gap in care Based on studies in the literature reviewing documentation of IOP achieved under care, the gap could be as great as 50% or more in the community of ophthalmologists and optometrists treating patients with primary open- angle glaucoma. Based on loose criteria for control, IOP was controlled in 66% of follow -up visits for patients with mild glaucoma and 52% of visits for patients with moderate to severe glaucoma. Another study of a single comprehensive insurance plan suggested that a large proportion of individuals felt to require treatment for glaucoma or suspect glaucoma are falling out of care and are being monitored at rates lower than expected from recommendations of published guidelines. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The initial target pressure selected should be at least 20% lower than the pretreatment IOP, depending upon the clinical findings. Further reduction of the target IOP is often also justified by the severity of existing optic nerve damage, the level of the measured pretreatment IOP, the rapidity with which the damage occurred, and other risk factors. In general, the more advanced the damage, the lower the initial pressure should be (Level A: III Recommendation). Please note that the American Optometric Association's (AOA) 2002 guideline on Open- angle Glaucoma was not rev iewed during the development of this measure prior to the public comment period and therefore is not presented here verbatim. Review of the AOA guideline subsequent to initial measure development indicates that the recommendations in the AOA guideline are consistent with the intent of the measure. As such, the intent of this measure is to have this indicator apply to both optometrists and ophthalmologists (and any other physician who provides glaucoma care); the use of \"ophthalmologists\" only in the precedi ng verbatim section reflects the wording in the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice pattern.

(Yasmeen et al., 2003A) Mammogram assessment category of \"probably benign\" is coupled with a recommendation for short -interval follow -up (typically 6 months), resulting in economic and emotional consequences for the women that receive them. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Do not use Category 3 in interpreting screening examinations. (ACR, 2003) All the published studi es emphasize the need to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation before making a probably benign (Category 3) assessment; hence it is inadvisable to render such an assessment when interpreting a screening examination. (ACR, 2003) The use of Cate gory 3, probably benign, is reserved for findings that are almost certainly benign.

This modality is extremely sensitive for detecting skelet al abnormalities, and numerous studies have confirmed that it is considerably more sensitive than conventional radiography for this purpose. However, the specificity of bone scan abnormalities can be low since many other conditions may mimic tumor; therefore, it is important that radionuclide bone scans are correlated with available, relevant imaging studies. Existing imaging studies that are available can help inform the diagnosis and treatment for the patient. Furthermore, correlation with existing radiographs is considered essential to insure that benign conditions are not interpreted as tumor. While there are no formal studies on variations in care in how often correlation with existing studies is not performed, there is significant anecdotal information from physicians practicing in the field that there is a gap in care and that correlation is not occurring frequently when images are available. Literature suggests that as many as 30% of Radiology reports contain errors, regardless of the imaging modalit y, Radiologists experience, or time spent in interpretation. Evidence has also suggested that Radiology reports are largely non- standardized and commonly incomplete, vague, untimely, and error -prone and may not serve the needs of referring physicians. Ther efore, it is imperative that existing imaging reports be correlated with the Nuclear Medicine bone scintigraphy procedure to ensure proper diagnosis and appropriate patient treatment.

Patients who have an AV fistula as their permanent vascular access for dialysis have fewer complications, such as infection. However USRDS data shows that only 35% of male and 15% of female hemodialysis patients have an AV fistula compared to 50% of male and 60% of female hemodialysis patients that have a long- term catheter as their vascular access. By improving the rate of which AV fistulas are used, morbidity and mortality due to complications of other types of permanent vascular access will decrease. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : 1.3 Patients should have a functional permanent access at the initiation of dialysis therapy. 1.3.1 A fistula should be placed at least 6 months before the anticipated start of HD treatments.

Although the clinical guidelines and supporting evidence calls for an evaluation of many factors, it was felt that for the purposes of measuring performance and facilitating implementation this initial measure must be limited in scope. For this reason, the work group defined an evaluation of balance and gait as a core comp onent that must be completed on all patients with a history of falls as well as four additional evaluations - at least one of which must be completed within the 12 month period. Data elements required for the measure can be captured and the measure is acti onable by the physician. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Older people who present for medical attention because of a fall, or report recurrent falls in the past year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance should be offered a multifactorial falls risk assessment. This assessment should be performed by a health care professional with appropriate skills and experience, normally in the setting of a specialist falls service. This assessment should be part of an individualized, multifactorial intervention.

Al though no specific data is available, in its practice accreditation reviews, the American College of Radiation Oncology has found that radiation dose limits to normal tissues are included in the patient chart less frequently than reviewers expected. While dose constraint specification is an integral part of IMRT, it is not required for 3D conformal radiation therapy. Patients treated with 3D conformal radiation therapy are often subjected to dose levels that exceed normal tissue tolerance, and precise speci fication of maximum doses to be received by normal tissues represent both an intellectual process for the physician during radiation treatment planning, and a fail -safe point for the treating therapists. In most circumstances where facilities require speci fication of radiation dose limits to normal tissues prior to initiation of therapy, policies and procedures exist that prohibit exceeding those limits in the absence of written physician approval. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: \"The cognitive process of treatment planning requires the radiation oncologist to have knowledge of the natural history of the tumor to be treated and to determine the tumor site, its extent, and its relationship with adjacent normal tissues. This process is based on considerat ion of the history, physician examination, endoscopy, diagnostic imaging, findings at surgery, and histology. When ionizing radiation is to be used, the radiation oncologist must select beam characteristics and/or radionuclide sources, method of delivery, doses, and sequencing with other treatments. The sequencing with other treatments should be coordinated in collaboration with medical and surgical oncologists. The radiation oncologist determines the dose to be delivered to the tumor, limiting doses to cr itical structures (emphasis added) , and the fractionation desired.\" (ACR 2004) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Numerator Quality -Data Coding Options for Reporting Satisfactorily : Conventional CEA with Patch G8524: Patch closure used for patient undergoing conventional CEA OR If patient is not eligible for this measure because a conventional CEA was not performed, report: G8525: Clinician documented that endarterectomy patient did not receive conventional CEA OR Conventional CEA Performed without Patch G8526: Patch closure not used for patient undergoing conventional CEA, reason not specified RATIONALE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can be performed in the conventional manner, in which a longitudinal arteriotomy is used to expose the plaque for subsequent endarterectomy, or with the eversion technique, in which the artery is transected and everted for plaque removal. With conventional endarterectomy, multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of patching to reduce postoperative stroke and prevent recurrent stenosis. With conventional endarterectomy, multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of patching to reduce postoperative stroke and prevent recurrent stenosis (Ref 1- 10). In a systematic review of this question, Bond et al concluded that patch angioplasty was associated with a reduction of stroke risk (P=.004), ipsilateral stroke (P=.001), stroke or death perioperative occlusion (P=.0001) and recurrent stenosis during long- term follow -up (P<.0001) (Ref 11). This report conclu ded that patching should be performed during conventional CEA. There does not appear to be any difference or advantage among various types of patches (autogenous vein, polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene, or bovine pericardium). Because eversion CEA invol ves a transverse closure, it does not require patching. In fact a Cochrane review based on multiple randomized studies have shown that eversion CEA is comparable in outcome to conventional CEA with patching in terms of stroke, death, and recurrent stenosis .

All rights reserved Page 353 of 571 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: There are no current practice guidelines concerning use of patch during conventional CEA, but such guidelines are currently being prepared by the Society for Vascular Surgery. The VSGNNE uses carotid patching during conventional CEA as a quality indicator in its reports to regional centers. A 2007 analysis of nearly 3000 conventional CEAs performed in VSGNNE showed that the use of patching varied from 60% to 100% (mean 90%) among 11 hospitals. This demonstrates potential for improvement even for a group of surgeons where this result is known. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

The most common bacteria involved are S. aureus including increasingly more common methicillin r esistant Staph (MRS). For CABG only outcomes 1997- 1999 the STS dataset reported 0.63% deep sternal wound infection rate in 503,478 records. A report from an academic hospital reported 1.9% deep surgical site infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance [CDC NNIS] criteria) in 1,980 patients undergoing isolated CABG or CABG+ procedures from 1996- 1999. The Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group reported an incidence rate for mediastinitis of 1.25% and noted a marked increase in mortality during the first year post -CABG and a threefold increase during a 4- year follow -up period. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Several risk factors for sternal wound infection have been identified that can be optimized with good care practices: prophylactic antibiotics within 1 hour before incision time (odds ratio 5.3) [see antibiotic timing process measure] and avoiding elevated blood glucose levels (odds ratio 10.2). Surveillance for surgical site infect ions is a critical hospital function to monitor infection control practices and direct improvement activity.

All rights reserved Page 374 of 571 RATIONALE: Stroke is a devastating complication after coronary bypass surgery. The 1999 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines indicate that adverse cerebral outcomes are observed in ~6% of patients after bypass surgery equally divided between 2 types: 1) associated with major, focal neurological defects, stupor or coma and 2) evidence of deterioration in intellectual function. Type 1 deficits occur in ~3% of patients and is responsible for 21% mortality. Reports in the literature on postoperative stroke incidence are difficult to compare because the conditions included in the term \"stroke\" vary. A standardized definition of stoke will provide common language to compare stroke incidence and evaluate management strategies for reducing this devastating complication. Reported rates of postoperative cerebral dysfunction range from 0.4% to 13.8% following c oronary operations. Complications for patients undergoing emergent CABG or valve surgery were greater than the complication rate for patients undergoing elective CABG or valve surgery. As bypass times increased, so did the incidence of stroke. When bypass time was 90 to 113 minutes, OR=1.59, p=0.022 and when bypass time was >114 minutes, the OR was 2.59, p<0.001. Outcomes are better when patient age is younger and with beating- heart surgery rather than on- pump surgery. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The 1999 ACC/AHA guidelines describe strategies for reducing the risk of postoperative stroke such as an aggressive approach to the management of patients with severely diseased ascending aortas identified by intraoperative echocardiographic imaging, prevention or aggressive management of postoperative atrial fibrillation, delay of bypass surgery in the case of a left ventricular mural thrombus or a recent, preoperative CVA and preoperative carotid screening. Patients should carefully be screened for cerebrovascular disease to help prevent stroke and its associated morbidities. Use of beta- adrenergic antagonists was associated with a lower incidence of stroke in patients undergoing elective CABG (OR=0.45; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.83; p=0.016). Use of antiplatelet agents within 48 hours of surgery is associated with a decreased risk of stroke (OR=0.51, p=0.01). Increased use of beating- heart surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to a lower prevalence of stroke following cardiac surgery and thus improve pat ient outcomes.

Some degree of Acute Renal Dysfunction (ARD) occurs in about 8% of patients following CABG, and dialysis -dependent renal failure occurs in 0.7% to 3.5% of patients receiving CABG. The latter is associated with substantial increases in morbidity, length of stay, and mortality (odds ratios for mortality range from 15 to 27) . ARD is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and length of stay in an ICU following surgery. In addition, Acute Renal Failure occurs i n 1.5% of patients undergoing any type of cardiac surgery. There has been a substantial increase in postoperative morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with this relatively common complication, regardless of whether or not this incidence varies much between providers, and there are implications of even a modest decrease in its incidence. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Acute renal failure following CABG is an intermediate outcome measure for mortality since this complication is independently associ ated (OR=27) with early mortality following cardiac surgery, even after adjustment for comorbidity and postoperative complications.

Cumulative evidence and randomized trials indicate that patients with a previous MI live longer if they are on beta blockers. For many years, patients were taken off beta- blocker medications in preparation for surgery. Evidence from the STS National Database demonstrated that beta blocker use is safe and effective in many CABG patients previously thought to be at high risk for adverse events of beta blocker therapy (women, elderly, diabetes, congestive heart failure). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database reported an increase in use of preoperative beta blockers during the time period 1996 (50% use) and 1999 (60% use). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Beta blockade reduces atrial fibrillation complications following CABG.

All rights reserved Page 384 of 571 RATIONALE: Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease. Events such as acute myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery identify patients with the disease, but acute therapy is not sufficient for optimal long- term outcomes. In post -bypass pat ients, atherosclerosis continues to progress in the native circulation and develops at an accelerated rate in saphenous vein bypass grafts. Management of the chronic disease is critically important in patients with atherosclerosis, such as those undergoin g CABG. The advantages of adherence to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association \"Get with the Guidelines\" program are discussed in a recent article, which also demonstrates both variation in quality and opportunity for improvement (38 % compliance with guidelines before program implementation, 98.4% compliance thereafter). The article also discusses educational and process measures used by a major medical center to achieve compliance. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Compliance rates for patients receiving personalized follow -up for lipid management over two years were significantly better than in the control group. Lipid lowering in coronary heart disease has been demonstrated distinctively through three trials (CLAS, post -CABG, and CARE) to delay the progression of atherosclerosis and/or reduce deaths, and non- fatal MI following bypass surgery. Aggressive (low -density lipoprotein [LDL]) cholesterol -lowering treatment (target <85 mg/d l) was correlated to a slower rate of disease progression (31%) after 4- 5 years in comparison to the control group, which was comprised of patients receiving moderate lipid- lowering treatment (target <130 to 140 mg/dl).

(CDC/ACIP, 2008) Children and adolescents at high ris k for influenza complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routinely vaccinating all children and adolescents. Recommendations for these children have not changed. Children and adolescents at higher risk for influenza complication are those: aged 6 months -4 years who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) who are immunos uppressed (including immunosupp ression caused by medication or by human immunodeficiency virus) (CDC/ACIP, 2008) All children aged 6 months -8 years who have not received vaccination against influenza previously should receive 2 doses of the vaccine the first influenza season they are vaccinated. The second dose should be administered 4 or more weeks after the initial dose. (CDC/ACIP, 2008) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

All patients being considered for biologic DMARD should receive a tuberculin skin test, even if the patient has previously received the BCG vaccination. Test results, in addition to patient risk for TB and other tests, should be used to assess the patient's risk for latent TB infection. This is a patient safety measure. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The American College of Rheumatology's updated Recommendations for the use of nonbiologic and biologic therapies in RA recommend routine tuberculosis screening to identify latent TB infection (LTBI) in patients being considered for therapy with biologics. The evidence for TB testing is based on a documented higher incidence of TB following ant -TNF therapy. To begin, clinicians should ask all RA patients being considered for biologic DMARDs about their potential risk fac tors for TB infection (see below) and, irrespective of prior Bacillus -Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination, use a Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) as a diagnostic aid to assess their patient's probability of latent TB infection. In addition to the ACR recommendat ions, guidelines from the British Society for Rheumatology have consistent recommendations. There have been a large number of cases of tuberculosis (TB) reported in association with the use of infliximab, and studies that demonstrate a significantly higher rate of TB in patients on this treatment compared with controls. Cases of TB have also been reported in association with etanercept and adalimumab. Reactivation of latent TB is highest in the first 12 months of treatment, so particular vigilance is requir ed during this time. With infliximab, the majority of cases occurred within three cycles of treatment, with a median of 12 weeks after starting treatment, suggesting reactivation of latent TB as the main factor predisposing to TB in these cases. The follow ing are the British Society for Rheumatology's recommended guidelines for patients with RA: Prior to commencing treatment with anti -TNF, all patients should be screened for TB in accordance with the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. Active TB need s to be adequately treated before anti -TNF therapy can be started; prior to commencing anti -TNF therapy, consideration of prophylactic anti -TB therapy (as directed by the BTS guidelines) should be given to patients with evidence of potential latent disease (past history of TB treatment or abnormal chest X-ray raising the possibility of TB) after consultation with a local TB specialist; all patients commenced on anti -TNF therapies need to be closely monitored for TB.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Several indices to measure RA disease activity have been developed each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Evidence- based guidelines require clear definitions of disease activity to make rational therapeutic choices, but it is not possible or appropriate to mandate use of a single disease activity score for the individual physician, and different studies have used different definitions. Therefore, the TFP was asked to consider a combined estimation of disease activity, which allowed reference to many past definitions. With these instruments as our guide, we rated RA disease activity in an ordinal manner as low, moderate, or high, as previously requested by the CEP.

Assessments of functional limitations are used to assess prognosis and guide treatment and therapy decisions. Functional status should be assessed at the baseline and each follow -up visit, using questionnaires such as the ACR's Classification of Functional Status in RA or the Health Assessment Questionnaire or an assessment of activities of daily living. Regardless of the assessment tool used, it should indicate whether a functional decline is due to inflammation, mechanical damage, or both, as treatment strategies will vary accordingly. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The management of RA is an iterative process, and patients should be periodically reassessed for evidence of disease or limitation of function with significant alteration of joint anatomy. Baseline evaluation of disease activity and damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis through evaluation of functional status or quality of life assessments using standardized questionnaires, a physician's global assessment of disease activity, or patient's global assessment of disease activity. The initial evaluation of the patient with RA should document symptoms of active disease (i.e., presence of joint pain, duration of morning stiffness, degree of fatigue), functional status, objective evidence of disease activity (i.e., synovitis, as assessed by tender and swolle n joint counts, and the ESR or CRP level), mechanical joint problems, etc. At each follow up visit, the physician must assess whether the disease is active or inactive.

Occasionally, findings of the joint examination alone may not adequately r eflect disease activity and structural damage; therefore, periodic measurements of the ESR or CRP level and functional status, as well as radiographic examinations of involved joints should be performed. It is important to determine whether a decline in fu nction is the result of inflammation, mechanical damage, or both; treatment strategies will differ accordingly.

However, long- term use of glucocorticoids, especially at high doses, should be avoided, due to the potential health complications. Monitoring length and dose of glucocorticoid treatment for patients with RA is integral to making other clinical decisions. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The 1993 American College of Rheumatology guidelines acknowledge the importance of the use and the tracking of glucocorticoid as a RA symptom reliever. The benefits of low -dose systemic glucocorticoids, however, should always be weighed against their adverse effects. The adverse effects of long -term oral glucocorticoids at low doses are protean and include osteoporosis, hypertension, weight gain, fluid retention, hyperglycemia, cataracts, and skin fragility, as well as the potential for premature atherosclerosis. These adverse effects should be considered and should be discussed in detail with the patient before glucocorticoid therapy is begun. For long term disease control, the glucocorticoid dosage should be kept to a minimum. For the majority of patients with RA, this means equal or less than 10 mg of prednisone per day.

Over the past ten years there has been an increase in elder abuse, which is not being picked up and reported to appropriate authorities. The reasons for underreporting are two-fold: health care professionals don't ask patients if they are being abused and patients don't tell, for fear of retaliation by their caregivers. In the American Psychological Association's \"Elder Abuse and N eglect: In Search of Solutions,\" found on their website, it is reported that every year an estimated 2.1 million older Americans are victims of physical, psychological, or other forms of abuse and neglect and that for every reported case of elder abuse and neglect, it is estimated that there may be as many as five unreported cases. Recent research suggests that elders who have been abused tend to die earlier than those who are not abused, even in the absence of chronic conditions or life threatening disease. It is difficult to obtain accurate information on the extent of elder abuse and neglect in the United States. Studies often focus on reports of selected populations and many cases are unreported. Victims may be embarrassed, intimidated and overwhelmed by the situation. They may be fearful of reprisals or unaware of the availability of help. In some cases, victims may be unable to report maltreatment or do not realize that they are being maltreated. Finally, health professionals may Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 411 of 571 ignore the signs and symptoms of elder maltreatment because they are unaware of the extent of the problem and uncomfortable with the responsibility of further assessment and action. The extent to which elder maltreatment affects the health care system is largely unknown. Common clinical findings associated with maltreatment include bruises, lacerations, abrasions, head injury, fractures, dehydration, and malnutrition. These injuries commonly result in hospitalization. In one descriptive study that tracked the emergency departm ent utilization of known elderly victims of physical abuse identified through adult protective services, 114 individuals had 628 emergency department visits during a 5- year window surrounding the referral; 30 percent of these visits resulted in hospital admission. (Institute of Medicine 2002) Studies do indicate that the effects of elder maltreatment increase the medical needs of victims. One longitudinal study of elderly victims of maltreatment documented a threefold increased risk of death in the 3- year period following maltreatment, after adjusting for comorbidity and other factors that predict death in older cohorts (Lachs 1998). In addition, maltreatment may exacerbate or interfere with the treatment of other medical and psychosocial conditions. For example, angina pectoris, emphysema, diabetes mellitus, and arthritis are much more challenging to treat in an abusive environment (Lachs 1997). No studies of the costs associated with these increased medical needs have been published. (Institute of Medicine 2002) Website searches of the National Quality Measures Database (NQMC) using the keywords Elder Abuse and Elder Neglect resulted in 9 measures. The measures only pertain to intimate partner violence and not the broader topic of elder maltreatment. One measure was focused on preventive counseling on violence and abuse, which is not the measure focus. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Every clinical setting should have a protocol for the detection and assessment of elder maltreatment. This may be a nar rative, a checklist, or some other type of standardized form that enables all providers in that practice setting to rapidly assess for elder maltreatment and document it in a way that allows clinicians to look at patterns over time.

All rights reserved Page 413 of 571 NUMERATOR: Patients with a documented current functional outcome assessment using a standardized tool AND a documented care plan Definitions: Standardized Tool - An assessment tool that has been appropriately normalized and validated for the populat ion in which it is used. Examples of tools for functional outcome assessment include, but are not limited to, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland Morris Disability/Activity Questionnaire (RM), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Functional Outcome Assessm ent - Questionnaires designed to measure a patient's limitations in performing the usual human tasks of living. Functional questionnaires seek to quantify symptoms, functional and behavior directly, rather than to infer them from less relevant physiological tests. (Mercy guideline, pg. 143) Current - A patient having a documented functional assessment within the previous 30 days. Functional Outcome Deficiencies - Impairment or loss of physical function related to neuromusculoskeletal capacity, including but not limited to, restricted flexion, extension and rotation, back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Care Plan - A care plan is an ordered assembly of expected or planned activities, including observations goals, servic es, appointments and procedures, usually organized in phases or sessions, which have the objective of organizing and managing health care activity for the patient, often focused upon one or more of the patient's health care problems. Care plans may include order sets as actionable elements, usually supporting a single session or phase. Also known as Treatment Plan.

Chiropractors can utilize the standardized tools to help establish patient centered treatment goals and objective evaluation of achievement of treatment goals if done more fr equently. The benefits are also cited by the American College of Physicians (Nelson and Wasson1994) such as: detecting, quantifying, and identifying the source(s) of decreased functional capacity; guiding management decisions; guiding the efficient use of resources; improving the prediction of the course of chronic disease; and improving patient outcomes: symptoms, mortality, satisfaction with care, function, and quality of life. Although the benefits of utilizing standardized functional assessment outcome tools are known, they are not typically utilized and instead information is gathered only by patient interview. The use of outcome assessment is imperative for the practicing clinician as a means to document health status and improvement (van Hemert 1998) . Goertz (1994) identified the importance of using a self -report questionnaire as a means of obtaining a functional health status assessment. Through use of a questionnaire, communication is increased between the physician and patient by focusing not only on location and severity of a specific condition but also on how the condition is affecting the patient's physical and emotional health status. Questionnaires, which measure pain level (visual analog scale), patient satisfaction, or functional assessment ( Oswestry) take little time and are valid and reliable (Liebenson 1995). Use of a standardized tool to assess functional status provides a consistent approach in demonstrating the patient's status and response to treatment. A recent unpublished review of t he literature found more than 50 references to the use of functional health status assessment tools in evaluating chiropractic spinal manipulation. Among those most commonly identified were the Oswestry Pain Disability Index (ODI), Roland Morris Disability /Activity Questionnaire (RM), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). While there is a strong scientific basis for the use of outcome assessment in evaluating the impact of chiropractic manipulative procedures, these tools have not yet been widely incorporated into the clinical setting as a quality benchmark. A review of the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse revealed no same or similar measures. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Functional questionnaires seek to quantify symptoms, function and behavior directly, rather than to infer them from less relevant physiological tests. Clinicians contemplating the use of functional instruments should be aware of differences between them and be able to choose the most appropriate assessment for their specific situation.

The timing of follow -up colonoscopy should be tailored to the number, size, and pathologic findings of the adenomatous polyps removed. The time interval for the development of malignant changes in adenomatous polyps is estimated at 5 to 25 years (ICSI, 2006). A randomized controlled trial of 699 patients showed that after newly diagnosed adenomatous polyps have been removed by colonoscopy, follow -up colonoscopy at three years detects important colonic lesions as effectively as follow -up colonoscopy at both one and three years. (ICSI, 2006) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 422 of 571 Performing colonoscopy too often not only increases patients' expos ure to procedural harm, but also drains limited resources that could be more effectively used to adequately screen those in need. Recent evidence from four surveys indicated that postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy in the United States is frequently p erformed at intervals that are shorter than those recommended in guidelines (Rex et al, 2006). Some endoscopists in these studies performed colonoscopy in patients with only small hyperplastic polyps or a single tubular adenoma at one year. These surveys u nderscore the importance of measuring intervals between examinations in continuous quality improvement programs. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Patients with one to two small (1 cm) tubular adenomas with only low -grade dysplasia should undergo follow -up colonoscopy no earlier than five years later. Patients with advanced adenomatous lesions or >3 adenomas should have repeat colonoscopy in three years as long as all visualized polyps were completely removed, the colonoscopy was completed up the cecum, and the colonic preparation was adequate. A shorter interval of follow -up is recommended in those patients with numerous adenomatous (>10) polyps and in those whom the colonoscopy was incomplete or the preparation was inadequate. After a surveillance colon oscopy has normal results, repeat examinations should be done at five- year intervals. Patients with large, sessile adenomatous lesions removed in a piecemeal fashion should have a repeat examination within two to six months to exclude and remove any remnant polypoid tissue.

The degree of compression must be modified when mixed venous/arterial disease is confirmed during the diagnostic work -up. Intermittent pneumatic pressure (IPC) can be used with or without compress ion dressings and can provide another option in patients who cannot or will not use an adequate compression dressing system. (Level I) (WHS, 2006) Compression therapy heals more venous leg ulcers than no compression therapy as well as decreases the healin g time. High compression is more effective than low compression, but there are no differences in the effectiveness of the different types of products available for high compression. (Level A) (WOCN, 2005) Compression options: Elastic compression bandage h eals more than inelastic compression (Grade A) Multi -layer (2, 3, or 4 layers) sustained, elastic high- compression bandage (Grade A) Elastic high -compression stockings to heal venous ulcers (Grade A) Elastic multiple -layer high- compression stockings to heal venous ulcers (Grade A) Duke Boot or Unna Boot + elastic compression (Grade A) Gradient compression better than uniform compression (Grade C) Short stretch bandage (Grade A) Unna boot zinc paste impregnated bandage (Grade A) Intermittent pneumatic compression (Grade A) Non-elastic compression Circaid [or similar (Grade B) Sequential (AAWC, 2005) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

Numerator Options: IV t- PA initiated within three hours ( 180 minutes) of time last known well (G8600) OR IV t-PA not initiated within three hours ( 180 minutes) of time last known well for reasons documented by clinician (e.g., patient enrolled in clinical trial for stroke, patient admitted for elective carotid intervention) (G8601) OR IV t-PA not initiated within three hours ( 180 minutes) of time last known well , reason not specified (G8602) RATIONALE: The administration of thrombolytic agents to carefully screened, eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke has been shown to be beneficial in several clinical trials. These included two positive randomized controlled trials in the United States; The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Studies, Part I and Part II. Based on the results of these studies, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV r- TPA or t-PA) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke when given within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. A large meta- analysis controlling for factors associated with stroke outcome confirmed the benefit of IV t - PA in patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset. While controversy still exists among some specialists, the major society practice guidelines developed in the United States all recommend the use of IV t- PA for eligible patients. Physicians with experience and skill in stroke management and the interpretation of CT scans should supervise treatment. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : Intravenous r -TPA (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg) is recommended for selected patients who may be treated within 3 hours of onset of ischemic stroke (Class 1, Level of Evidence A) (AHA/ASA). For eligible patients (see inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below), we recommend administration of IV t -PA in a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg), with 10% of the total dose given as an initial bolus and the remainder infused over 60 min, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Class 1, Grade 1A) (ACP).

Scientific basis for measuring visual acuity outcomes after cataract surgery The only reason to perform cataract surgery (other than for a limited set of medical indications) is to improve a patient's vision and associated functioning. The use of a 20/40 visual acuity threshold is based on several considerations. First, it is the level for unrestricted operation of a motor vehicle in the US. Second, it has been consistently used by the FDA in its asses sment for approval of IOL and other vision devices. Third, it is the literature standard to denote success in cataract surgery. Fourth, work by West et al in the Salisbury Eye Study suggests that 20/40 is a useful threshold for 50th percentile functioning for several vision- related tasks. Most patients achieve excellent visual acuity after cataract surgery (20/40 or better). This outcome is achieved consistently through careful attention through the accurate measurement of axial length and corneal power and the appropriate selection of an I OL power calculation formula. As such, it reflects the care and diligence with which the surgery is assessed, planned and executed. Failure to achieve this after surgery in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions that would impact the success of the surger y would reflect care that should be assessed for opportunities for improvement. The exclusion of patients with other ocular and systemic conditions known to increase the risk of an adverse outcome reflects the findings of the two published prediction rul e papers for cataract surgery outcomes, by Mangione et al and Steinberg et al. In both papers, the presence of comorbid glaucoma and macular degeneration negatively impacted the likelihood of successful outcomes of surgery. Further, as noted in the prior i ndicator, exclusion of eyes with ocular conditions that could impact the success of the surgery would NOT eliminate the large majority of eyes undergoing surgery while also minimizing the potential adverse selection that might otherwise occur relative to t hose patients with the most complex situations who might benefit the most from having surgery to maximize their remaining vision.

Evidence of a gap in care This is an outcome of surgery indicator of direct relevance to patients and referring providers. The available evidence suggests that cataract surgery achieves this in between 86 and 98% of surgeries in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions (this indicator). While small, the volume of cataract surgery in the US of over 2.8 million surgeries suggest s that the impact could affect more than 100,000 patients per year. Because of the exclusion of comorbid ocular conditions, one would expect performance on this indicator to be as high as possible, with significantly lower rates suggestive of opportunities for improvement. The ASCRS National Cataract Database reported that at 3 months postoperatively, 85.5% of all patients had a 20/40 or better best -corrected visual acuity, 57.2% of patients had 20/25 or better postoperative best -corrected visual acuity, and 74.6% of patients were within \u00b1 1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Based on 5,788 responses, the mean visual function index score at 3 months postoperatively was 70.3% compared with 55.0% preoperatively. (The score is based on a scale of 0 to 100, w ith 0 indicating an inability to perform any of the activities.) The European Cataract Outcome Study reported for 1999 that 89% of patients achieved a postoperative visual acuity of 0.5 or more (20/40 or better), the average induced astigmatism was 0.59 D, and 86% of patients had an induced astigmatism within \u00b1 1.0 D. The AAO National Eyecare Outcomes Network (NEON) database also found similar rates of success, with an improvement in visual acuity in 92.2% of patients and improvement in VF -14 in over 90% of patients.33 Best -corrected visual acuity of 20/40 was achieved by 89% of all NEON patients and 96% of NEON patients without preoperative ocular comorbid conditions. Seventy -eight percent of patients were within \u00b1 1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Ni nety-five percent of patients reported being satisfied with the results of their surgery. Patients who were dissatisfied with the results of their surgery were slightly older and more likely to have ocular comorbidity.

INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be calculated each time a procedure for non- complicated cataracts is performed during the reporting period. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of services provided for the patients receiving uncomplicated cataract surgery . Note: This is an outcomes measure and can be calculated solely using registry data. For patients who receive the cataract surgical procedures specified in the denominator coding, claims should be reviewed to determine if any of the procedure codes listed in the numerator were performed within 30 days of the date of cataract surgery. Patients who have any of the listed comorbid conditions in the exclusion criteria should be removed from the denominator, and not considered as having a complication within 30 days following cataract surgery. Measur e Reporting via Registry: ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes , CPT codes and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality -data codes have been provided for registry only measures for use by registries that utilize claims data. It is not necessary to submit these codes for registry -based submissions. There are no allowable performance exclusions for this measure. Do not report this measure via claims.

Scientific basis for assessing short -term complications following cataract surgery. Complications that may result in a permanent loss of vision following cataract surgery are uncommon. This short -term outcomes of surgery indicator seeks to identi fy those complications from surgery that can reasonably be attributed to the surgery and surgeon and which reflect situations which - if untreated - generally result in significant avoidable vision loss that would negatively impact patient functioning. Fur ther, it seeks to reduce surgeon burden and enhance accuracy in reporting by focusing on those significant complications that can be assessed from administrative data alone and which can be captured by the care of another physician or the provision of addi tional, separately coded, post -operative services. Finally, it focuses on patient safety and monitoring for events that, while hopefully uncommon, can signify important issues in the care being provided. For example, the need to reposition or exchange an I OL reflects in part \"wrong power\" IOL placement, a major patient safety issue. In order to achieve these ends, the indicator excludes patients with other known, pre- operative ocular conditions that could impact the likelihood of developing a complication. Based on the results of the Cataract Appropriateness Project at RAND, other published studies, and one analysis performed by on national MCO data base, the exclusion codes would preserve over 2/3 of all cataract surgery cases for analysis. Thus, this prov ides a \"clean\" indicator that captures care for the large majority of patients undergoing cataract surgery. 2. Evidence for gap in care. The advances in technology and surgical skills over the last 30 years have made cataract surgery much safer and more effective. An analysis of a single company's database (commercial age MCO) demonstrated that the rate of complications found for this indic ator was approximately 1 to 2%. Nevertheless, as noted above, the occurrence of one of these events is associated with a significant potential for vision loss that is otherwise avoidable. Furthermore, with an annual volume of 2.8 million cataract surgeries in the US, a 2% rate would mean that over 36,000 surgeries are accompanied by these complications (2/3 of 56,000 surgeries). A synthesis of the literature published prior to 1992 found weighted mean complication rates among all patients undergoing cataract surgery of 0.13% for endophthalmitis, 0.3% for bullous keratopathy, 3.5% angiographically demonstrated CME, 0.7% for retinal detachment, and 1.1% for IOL dislocation. Bullous keratopathy and CME are not included in this indicator because they are conditions that are almost always temporary and resolve without additional intervention through additional procedures and associated care in this population of patients without prior known ocular conditions.

All rights reserved Page 446 of 571 Additional studi es similarly demonstrate the low occurrence of complications, including many that are temporary in nature and without a significant impact on patient outcomes. A national survey of over 100 hospitals from 1997 to 1998 found the following results on 18,454 patients 50 years old or older. Seventy -seven percent of these patients had surgery performed by phacoemulsification. Rates for events that occurred during surgery were 4.4% for posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss, 1.0% for incomplete cortical cleanup, 1.0% for anterior chamber hemorrhage and or collapse, and 0.77% for iris damage. Short -term (within 48 hours) perioperative complications included corneal edema ned lens material (1.1%). A retrospective study from New Zealand of 1,793 consecutive patients undergoing phacoemulsification reported a rate of 1.8% for posterior capsule rupture and a rate of 1.2% for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

Even mild hypothermia (1- 2\u00b0C below normal) has been associated in randomized trials with a number of adverse consequences, including: i ncreased susceptibility to infection, impaired coagulation and increased transfusion requirements, cardiovascular stress and cardiac complications, post anesthetic shivering and thermal discomfort. Whether the benefits of avoiding hypothermia in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) outweigh potential harm is uncertain, because known complications of CPB include cerebral injury, which may be mitigated by mild hypothermia. Therefore, patients undergoing CPB are excluded from the denominator populat ion Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 450 of 571 for this measure. Several methods to maintain normothermia are available to the anesthesiologist in the perioperative period; various studies have demonstrated the superior efficacy of over -the-body active warming (e.g., forced air, warm -water garments , and resistive heating blankets). Data elements required for the measure can be captured and the measure is actionable by the physician. Existing hospital -level measures for this topic were consulted and, to the extent feasible, harmonization between physician - and hospital -level measurement was achieved. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Preoperative patient management Assessment : Identify patient's risk factors for unplanned perioperative hypothermia. Measure patient temperature on admission. Deter mine patient's thermal comfort level (ask the patients if they are cold). Assess for other signs and symptoms of hypothermia (shivering, piloerection, and/or cold extremities). Interventions : Institute preventive warming measures for patients who are normothermic (normothermia is defined as a core temperature range from 36\u00b0C -38\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F -100.4\u00b0F)). A variety of measures may be used, unless contraindicated. Passive insulation may include warmed cotton blankets, socks, head covering, limited skin exposure, ci rculating water mattresses, and increase in ambient room temperature (minimum 68\u00baF - 75\u00baF). Institute active warming measures for patients who are hypothermic (defined as a core temperature less than 36\u00b0C). Active warming is the application of a forced air convection warming system. Apply appropriate passive insulation and increase the ambient room temperature (minimum 68\u00baF -75\u00baF). Consider warmed intravenous (IV) fluids. (ASPAN) Intraoperative patient management Assessment : Identify patient's risk factors for unplanned perioperative hypothermia. Determine patient's thermal comfort level (ask the patients if they are cold). Assess for other signs and symptoms of hypothermia (shivering, piloerection, and/or cold extremities). M onitor patient's temperature intraoperatively. Intervention : Implement warming methods. (ASPAN) Maintenance of body temperature in a normothermic range is recommended for most procedures other than during periods in which mild hypothermia is intended to provide organ protection (e.g., during high aortic cross- clamping).

Though critically important, cancer stage is not always documented in the medical record. This measure is intended to be reported at least once per 12 month reporting period. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: A simple classification scheme, which can be incorporated into a form for staging and can be universally applied, is the goal of the TNM system as proposed by the AJCC. Thus, examination during the surgical procedure and histologic examination of the surgically removed tissues may identify significant additional indicators of the prognosis of the patient (T, N, and M) as different from what could be discerned clinically before therapy. Because this is that pathologic (pTNM) classi fication and stage grouping (based on examination of a surgically resected specimen with sufficient tissue to evaluate the highest T, N, or M classification), it is recorded in addition to the clinical classification. It does not replace the clinical class ification. Both should be maintained in the patient's permanent medical record...It is intended to provide a means by which this information can readily be communicated to others, to assist in therapeutic decisions, and to help estimate prognosis. (Joint Com mittee on Cancer 2002) A central component of the treatment of breast cancer is full knowledge of extent of disease and biological features. The need for and selection of various local or systemic therapies are based on a number of prognostic and predicti ve factors. These factors include tumor histology, clinical and pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor, axillary node status, tumor hormone receptor content, tumor HER2 status, presence or absence of detectable metastatic disease, patient comorbid conditions, patient age, and menopausal status.

Requiring that stenosis calculation be based on a denominator of distal internal carotid diameter or, in the case of duplex ultrasound, velocity measurements that have been correlated to angiographic stenosis calculation based on distal internal carotid diameter, makes the measure appli cable to both imaging and duplex studies. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: ......the NASCET method of calculating stenosis measurement should be employed when angiography is used to correlate US findings. (Grant et al., SRU, 2003) For patients with sympt omatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis > 70%, as NASCET criteria, the value of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been clearly established from the results of 3 major prospective randomized trials: the NASCET, the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Program. Among symptomatic patients with TIAs or minor strokes and high- grade carotid stenosis, each trial showed impressive relative and absolute risk reductions for those randomized to surgery. For patients with carotid stenosis < 50%, these trials showed that there was no significant benefit of surgery. (Sacco, ASA, 2006) It is important to consider that the degree of carotid stenosis in ECST was measured differently than that in NASCET. The degre e of carotid stenosis is significantly higher if calculated by the NASCET Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 455 of 571 rather than the ECST method. In summary, it appears that patients with a recent TIA or nondisabling stroke with ipsilateral carotid stenosis benefit from surgery if the stenosis is > 50% as measured by the NASCET method; however, this benefit appears to be less pronounced in women. Recently symptomatic patients with > 70% stenosis as measured by the NASCET method can expect a far greater benefit from carotid endarterectomy.

A comprehensive 2- dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler flow studies has been identified as the single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with heart failure. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with HF to assess LVEF, LV size, wall thickness, and valve function. Radionuclide ventriculography can be performed to assess LVEF and volumes. Radionuclide ventriculography can be performed to assess LVEF and volumes.

All rights reserved Page 469 of 571 The most frequent and serious complications of uncontrolled hypertension include coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, ruptured aortic aneurysm, renal disease, and retinopathy. The increased risks of hypertension are present in individuals ranging from 40 to 89 years of age. For every 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic increase in BP, there is a doubling of mortality from both IHD and stroke (JNC -7, 2003). Better control of BP has been shown to significantly reduce the probability that these undesirable and costly outcomes will occur. Thus, the relationship between the measure (control of hypertension) and the long- term clinical outcomes listed is well established. In clinical trials, antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions in stroke incidence (35- 40%), 2003). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : The U.S. Preventi ve Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older. The JNC -7 indicates that treating systolic BP and diastolic BP to targets that are <140/90 mmHg is associated with a decrease in CVD complicatio ns.

Total cholesterol in general and LDL level specifically, is the leading indicator for management of these patients. Treatments include limits on dietary fat and cholesterol, or in certain cases, cholesterol lowering medications. A 10% decrease in total cholesterol levels (population wide) may result in an estimated 30% reduction in the incidence of CHD (CDC, 2000). Based on data from the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults: Less than half of persons who qualify for any kind of lipid- modifying treatment for CHD risk reduction are receiving it. Less than half of even the highest -risk persons, those who have symptomatic CHD, are receiving lipid -lowering treatment. Only about a third of treated patients are achieving their LDL goal; less than 20% of CHD patients are at their LDL goal. (2002) Several studies have shown that reducing high lipid levels will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These studies include the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, the Framingham Heart Study, the Oslo Study Diet and Anti -smoking Trial, the Helsinki Heart Study, the Coronary Drug Project, the Stockholm Ischemic Heart Study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, and Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial.

If a high- risk person has high triglycerides or low HDL- C, consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL- lowering drug. When triglycerides a re >200 mg/dL, non- HDL-C is a secondary target of therapy, with a goal 30 mg/dL higher than the identified LDL- C goal.

Aspirin use reduced the number of strokes by 20%, MI by 30%, and other vascular events by 30% (Weisman, 2002) . Also, aspirin treatments have been shown to prevent 1 cardiovascular event over an average follow -up of 6.4 years. This means that on average in a 6.4 year time period the use of aspirin therapy results in a benefit of 3 cardiovascular events prevented p er 1000 women and 4 events prevented per 1000 men (Berger, 2006). Even for patients with peripheral arterial disease, aspirin has been shown to reduce CHD in people (Kikano, 2007). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : The U.S. Preventive Services Task For ce (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians discuss aspirin chemoprevention with adults who are at increased risk (5- year risk of greater than or equal to 3 percent) for coronary heart disease (CHD). Discussions with patients should address both the potential benefits and harms of aspirin therapy. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 478 of 571 The USPSTF found good evidence that aspirin decreases the incidence of coronary heart disease in adults who are at increased risk for heart disease. They also found good evidence that aspirin increases the i ncidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and fair evidence that aspirin increases the incidence of hemorrhagic strokes. The USPSTF concluded that the balance of benefits and harms is most favorable in patients at high risk of CHD (5- year risk of greater than or equal to 3 percent) but is also influenced by patient preferences. USPSTF encourages men age 45 to 79 years to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestin al hemorrhage. They encourage women age 55 to 79 years to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in ischemic strokes outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The ADA recommends use aspirin therapy (75- 162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albumi nuria). AHA/ACC: Start aspirin 75 to 162 mg/d and continue indefinitely in all patients with coronary and other vascular disease unless contraindicated. ICSI: Aspirin should be prescribed to all patients with stable coronary disease. If a patient is aspi rin intolerant, then use clopidogrel. VA/DoD: Ensure that all patients with ischemic heart disease or angina symptoms receive antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 81- 325 mg/day). For patients who require warfarin therapy, aspirin may be safely used at a dose of 80 mg/day. If use of aspirin is contraindicated, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) may be used. AHA/ASA: The use of aspirin is recommended for cardiovascular (including but not specific to stroke) prophylaxis among persons whose risk is sufficiently high for the be nefits to outweigh the risks associated with treatment (a 10- year risk of cardiovascular events of 6% to 10%). ACCP: For long -term treatment after PCI, the guideline developers recommend aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/day. For long- term treatment after PCI in pati ents who receive antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel or warfarin, the guideline developers recommend lower -dose aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/day. For patients with ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, the guideline developers recommend early aspirin therapy, 160 to 325 mg/day.

However, because of the cost of screening and the variability of prevalence of these infections, decisions about routine screening for these infections should be based on epidemiologic factors (including prevalence of infection in t he community or the population being served), availability of tests, and cost. (Some HIV specialists also recommend type- specific serologic testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 for both men and women.)

All rights reserved Page 486 of 571 RATIONALE: A 2000 literature review investigated the rates of HIV prevalence in U.S. patients with syphilis. Data from the thirty studies identified and analyzed for the review revealed that HIV prevalence is high among patients infected with syphilis. The mean rate for HIV -infection among patients with syphilis was 15.7 (with an interquartile range of 13.6- 21.8). This study would indicate that identifying and treating HIV among patients with syphilis (and vice versa) is an important goal for health systems (Blocker, 2000). Another study investigated the effect of syphilis infection on the health of patients infected with HIV. HIV viral loads and CD4 cell counts were analyzed for 52 patients in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas for three time periods: before syphilis infection, during syphilis infection and after syphilis treatment). When compared to levels before syphilis infection, HIV viral loads were significantly higher during syphilis infection. Patients' CD4 cell counts were also significantly lower dur ing syphilis infection than before syphilis infection (Buchacz, 2004). This study further supports the need to identify and treat syphilis infection among HIV -infected patient . Currently, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the Health Resourc es and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America/HIV Medicine Association recommend that all HIV -infected patients should be screened annually for syphilis. However, according to data collect ed for 3,840 HIV -infected patients within the Veterans Affairs system, only 74% had been screened for syphilis (serum RPR or VDRL) in the past year. The same study reports data from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), the only national probability sample of HIV -infected persons, which indicates that only 49% of participants had been screened for syphilis (Korthius, 2004). These data would indicate that there is indeed room for improvement. Data from the HIVQual Continuous Quality Program also indicates that there is room for improvement. According to data from 2006, the median rate for syphilis screening among patients infected with HIV/AIDS was 86%. It is important to note that these rates represent only those Title III and IV grantees that are participating in the HIVQUAL Project, a continuous quality improvement project sponsored by the Ryan White Division of Community Based Programs and managed by the New York State Department of Health AIDS institute. Nationwide rates are likely to var y (and be lower) than the rates reported by HIVQUAL. (NYSDOH AIDS Institute, 2007). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Because many STDs are asymptomatic, routine screening for curable STDs (e.g., syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia) should be performed a t least yearly for sexually active persons. (CDC, 2006) Screening for STDs should be repeated periodically (i.e., at least annually) if the patient is sexually active or if earlier screening revealed STDs.

The results of the assessment may impact the choice of treatment and disposition. Disorders of communication (i.e., problems with speaking, listening, reading, writing, gesturing, and/or pragmatics) and related cognitive impairments may occur in as many as 40% of post -stroke patients. The most common communication disorders occurring after stroke are aphasia and dysarthria. Rapid spontaneous improvement is common, but early evaluation can identify communication problems and monitor change. If indicated, intervention can hel p maximize recovery of communication abilities and prevent learning of ineffective or inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Goals of speech and language treatment are to (1) facilitate the recovery of communication, (2) assist patients in developing strategies to compensate for communication disorders, and (3) counsel and educate people in the patient's environment to facilitate communication, decrease isolation, and meet the patient's desires and needs. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Aphasic stroke patients should be referred for speech and language therapy. Where the patient is sufficiently well and motivated, aim for minimum of two hours per week. (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network).

Appropriate patients (with reasonable cognition and language skills) should be considered for alternative or augmentative communication. Patients with communication difficulties should be monitored and assessed regularly to determine appropriateness for speech and language therapy. An appropriate treatment program with a system for monitoring progress should be in place for any individuals receiving speech- language therapy. In developing a communication program, consideration for premorbid communic ation style, underlying cognitive deficits, environmental context, social needs, and necessary communication aids should be given.(Royal College of Medicine and the British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine) Where achievable goals can be identified, and continuing progress demonstrated, patients with communication difficulties should be offered an appropriate treatment program, with monitoring of progress. The program should: take into account the patient's premorbid communication style and any underlying cognitive deficits; give the opportunity to rehearse communication skills in situations appropriate to the context in which the patient will live/work/study/socialize after discharge; include the family and caregivers in developing strategies for optimum communication within the immediate social circle; and consider the need for communication aids including gesture drawing, communication charts and computerized systems.(Royal College of Medicine and the British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine) The speech and language therapist will be involved in all cases where there are communication problems following stroke.(Republic of South Africa Department of Health; Stroke Foundation of South Africa) People with aphasia following stroke should be referred to a speech and language therapist for assessment and appropriate management of their communication difficulty.

The results of the assessment may impact the choice of treatment and disposition. Impairments in cognitive functioning are common after a stroke. In particular, impairments in attention, memory, and executive functioning (i.e., integrating multiple and complex processes) can be especially disabling. The treatment of cognitive deficits through cognitive remediation designed to reduce deficits can be approached in a variety of ways. Cicerone and colleagues completed a comprehensive review of the evidence- based literature for cognitive remediation for both traumatic brain i njury (TBI) and stroke. The review revealed a large number of randomized control trials (RCTs) in a variety of areas of cognitive functioning and provided comprehensive guidelines for cognitive rehabilitation specific to these populations. There is support for cognitive remediation of deficits in both the acute and post - acute phases of recovery from stroke and TBI, although some of the improvements were relatively small and task -specific. Some benefits were specific to the TBI population, although it seem s reasonable to extend some of these results to the stroke population.

INSTRUCTIONS: This measure is to be reported once per episode of treatment for all patients with late effects of CVD who are treated for a motor speech deficit by a speech- language pathologist (SLP) during the reporting period. Only patients who had at least two visits in the reporting period will be counted in the denominator for this measure. This is an outcome measure, and its calculation requires reporting of the patient's score (see below under numerator) on the measure at the a dmission to and discharge from SLP treatment for motor speech . The admission score is noted by the SLP at the conclusion of the first treatment session, and the discharge score at the conclusion of the final treatment session for motor speech. Measure Reporting via Registry: ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, CPT codes , and patient demographics are used to identify patients who are included in the measure's denominator. The listed numerator options are used to report the numerator of the measure. The quality -data codes have been provided for registry only measures for use by registries that utilize claims data. It is not necessary to submit these codes for registry -based submissions. There are no allowable performance exclusions for this measure. Do not report this measure via claims.

Discharge - The conclusion of the final treatment session for motor speech by an SLP, regardless of whether the patient is also being discharged from the facility and/or other SLP services. Patient's Score - LEVEL 1: The individual attempts to speak, but speech cannot be understood by familiar or unfamiliar listeners at any time. LEVEL 2: The individual attempts to speak. The communication partner must assume responsibility for interpreting the message, and with consistent and maximal cues, the patient can produce short consonant -vowel combinations or automatic words that are rarely intelligible in context. LEVEL 3: The communication partner must assume primary responsibility for interpreting the communication exchange. However, the individual is able to produce short consonant -vowel combinations or automatic words intelligibly. With consistent and moderate cueing, the individual can produce simple words and phrases intelligibly, although accur acy may vary. LEVEL 4: In simple structured conversation with familiar communication partners, the individual can produce simple words and phrases intelligibly. The individual usually requires moderate cueing in order to produce simple sentences intell igibly, although accuracy may vary. LEVEL 5: The individual is able to speak intelligibly using simple sentences in daily routine activities with both familiar and unfamiliar communication partners. The individual occasionally requires minimal cueing to produce more complex sentences/ messages in routine activities, although accuracy may vary and the individual may occasionally use compensatory strategies. LEVEL 6: The individual is successfully able to communicate intelligibly in most activities, but some limitations in intelligibility are still apparent in vocational, avocational, and social activities. The individual rarely requires minimal cueing to produce complex sentences/messages intelligibly. The individual usually uses compensatory strategies when encountering difficulty. LEVEL 7: Th e individual's ability to successfully and independently participate in vocational, avocational, or social activities is not limited by speech production. Independent functioning may occasionally include the use of compensatory techniques. Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association.

The results of t he assessment may impact the choice of treatment and disposition. Disorders of communication (i.e., problems with speaking, listening, reading, writing, gesturing, and/or pragmatics) and related cognitive impairments may occur in as many as 40% of post -stroke patients. The most common communication disorders occurring after stroke are aphasia and dysarthria. Rapid spontaneous improvement is common, but early evaluation can identify communication problems and monitor change. If indicated, intervention can help maximize recovery of communication abilities and prevent learning of ineffective or inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Goals of speech and language treatment are to (1) facilitate the recovery of communication, (2) assist patients in developing st rategies to compensate for communication disorders, and (3) counsel and educate people in the patient's environment to facilitate communication, decrease isolation, and meet the patient's desires and needs. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Recommend that the clinician use standardized, valid assessments to evaluate the patient's stroke-related impairments and functional status and encourage patient's participation in community and social activities.

Patient's Score - LEVEL 1: Individual is not able to swallow anything safely by mouth. All nutrition and hydration is received through non- oral means (e.g., nasogastric tube, PEG). LEVEL 2: Individual is not able to swallow safely by mouth for nutrition and hydration, but may take some consistency with consistent maximal cues in therapy only. Alternative method of feeding required. LEVEL 3: Alternative method of feeding required as individual takes less than 50% of nutriti on and hydration by mouth, and/or swallowing is safe with consistent use of moderate cues to use compensatory strategies and/or requires maximum diet restriction. LEVEL 4: Swallowing is safe, but usually requires moderate cues to use compensatory strategies, and/or the individual has moderate diet restrictions and/or still requires tube feeding and/or oral supplements. LEVEL 5: Swallowing is safe with minimal diet restriction and/or occasionally requires minimal cueing to use compensatory strategi es. The individual may occasionally self-cue. All nutrition and hydration needs are met by mouth at mealtime. LEVEL 6: Swallowing is safe, and the individual eats and drinks independently and may rarely require minimal cueing. The individual usually self -cues when difficulty occurs. May need to avoid specific food items (e.g., popcorn and nuts), or require additional time (due to dysphasia). LEVEL 7: The individual's ability to eat independently is not limited by swallow function. Swallowing would be safe and efficient for all consistencies. Compensatory strategies are effectively used when needed.

All rights reserved Page 515 of 571 RATIONALE: Dyspha gia, an abnormality in swallowing fluids or food, is common, occurring in about 45% of all stroke patients admitted to the hospital. It can seriously affect the patient's quality of life and potentially lead to death. It is associated with severe strokes a nd with worse outcome. The presence of aspiration may be associated with an increased risk of developing pneumonia after stroke. Malnutrition is also common, being present in about 15% of all patients admitted to the hospital, and increasing to about 30% over the first week after stroke. Malnutrition is associated with a worse outcome and a slower rate of recovery. Assessment of dysphagia by personnel who are not adequately trained in the anatomy and physiology of swallowing is often times problematic. Tr aditionally, SLPs receive formal training in oropharyngeal anatomy and physiology. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Treatment outcome studies have provided evidence that compensatory strategies designed to have an immediate effect on the swallow (i.e., postural changes or diet manipulation) can improve swallowing safety and efficiency. Postural techniques eliminated aspiration on thin liquids in 75 to 80% of dysphagi c patients. Likewise, data are beginning to emerge that demonstrate the utility of pharyngeal muscle strengthening exercises for improving swallowing physiology. Treatment approaches improve nutritional status and hydration, and reduce morbidity from pneumonia. The speech -language pathologist's intervention in swallowing disorders helps contain medical costs by reducing the length of hospital stays, decreasing the need for non oral feedings, reducing nutritional problems, and decreasing expenses associated with pneumonia and other pulmonary complications. (American Speech- Language- Hearin g Association) Recommend that the clinician use standardized, valid assessments to evaluate the patient's stroke- related impairments and functional status and encourage patient's participation in community and social activities. Recommend that the standardized assessment results be used to assess probability of outcome, determine the appropriate level of care, and develop interventions . (US Department of Veterans' Affairs; endorsed by the American Heart Association) Recommend that the dysphagic str oke patient receive both direct swallowing treatment and management by the SLP, when available, when a treatable disorder in swallow anatomy or physiology is identified. (US Department of Veterans' Affairs; endorsed by the American Heart Association) The speech and language therapist will be involved in all cases where there are communication problems following stroke. Such therapy should include augmentative communication systems in cases where intelligible speech is not a reasonable goal. The role of the speech therapist includes diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders. (Republic of South Africa Department of Health; Stroke Foundation of South Africa) Any person with an abnormal swallow should be seen by a speech and language therapist, who shoul d assess the person further and advise the person and staff on safe swallowing techniques and strategies and the consistency of diet and fluids.

There is a perception that radiologic studies are being administered for grade 0 and grade I melanoma that are clinically unnecessary and create economic burden to the patient and payer. While diagnostic imaging is also inappropriate for patients with higher stages of melanoma as well, this measure is a first step in addressing the over -utilization of diagnostic imaging studies in patients with melanoma. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The panel unanimously agreed that no specific search for occult visceral metastases, with either chest x-ray or blood work, is necessary in patients with 0 and IA melanoma. This National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendation is consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus guidelines, (2006). Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) m ay be performed for all patients to evaluate specific signs or symptoms. For patients with IB -II melanomas, a baseline chest x - ray is optional because this test in insensitive for detecting clinically occult distant disease in the lungs. (NCCN, 2006).

Moreover, many American women do not receive mammograms at recommended intervals, as illustrated by a multiyear study of mammography utilization in a large screening center at Massachusetts General Hospital. The study found that more than half of women who received a mammogram in 1992 had few er than five mammograms during the subsequent 10 years (the expected number if following a 2- year screening interval), and that only 6 percent received annual mammograms during the entire 10 years (Blanchard, K., Colbart JA, Puri D, et al., 2004). The use of patient reminders is associated with an increase in screening mammography and is currently recommended based on the results of a systematic review of studies conducted by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Nass S, Ball J, eds., 2005). Enco uraging the implementation of a reminder system could therefore help to reverse the trend and lead to an increase in mammography. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1- 2 years for women aged 40 and older. (B Recommendation) (USPSTF, 2002). Asymptomatic women 40 years of age or older should have an annual screening mammogram. (ACR, 2003) . The Task Force [on Community Pr eventive Services] recommends client reminders to increase breast cancer screening on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines. The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. (A Recommendation) (USPSTF, 2003) During new patient encounters and at least annually, patients in general and mental healthcare settings should be screened for at -risk drinking, alcohol use problems and illnesses, and any tobacco use. (NQF, 2007) All patients should be asked if they use tobacco and should have their tobacco- use status documented on a regular basis. Evidence has shown that clinic screening systems, such as expanding the vital signs to include tobacco status or the use of other reminder systems such as chart stickers or computer prompts, significantly increase rates of clinician intervention.

National guidelines advocate the evaluation of left ventricular systolic function as the single most important diagnostic test in the management of all patients with heart failure (Hunt, 2005). Despite these recommendations, left ventricular systolic function is not evaluated in a substantial proportion of eligible older patients hospitalized with heart failure (Jencks, 2000). CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS : In patients with HF, an assessment of left ventricular systolic function with 2- dimensional echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography is recommended.

For lung and esophageal cancer, the patient's functional status or performance status (PS) is a key determinant of not only the patient's ability to undergo therapy, but also the patient's prognosis. PS is a general measure of a pati ent's physiologic status, taking into account the cancer and its associated effects along with other concurrent medical problems, such as cardiac or pulmonary disease. Preoperative assessment of PS provides a standardized measure to compare patient and treatment outcomes in order to provide continuing quality improvement. Review of the current STS General Thoracic Database identified a 10% gap in recording for PS in patients undergoing major pulmonary resection for cancer. Remediation of this gap should decrease the morbidity and mortality rates for these procedures by reducing the number of high- risk patients inappropriately selected to undergo surgery. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: We identified 3 preoperative factors that were associated with an increased risk of pulmonary complications: age, spirometric v alues, and PS. Others have demonstrated that advanced age and preoperative respiratory dysfunction are associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. It may be intuitively apparent that the factors we identified are predictive of the relative risk of development of pulmonary complications. The benefit of this analysis does not lie in the uniqueness of our observations. Instead, it directs the clinician to focus on a few specific factors and provides the ability to quantitate the relative effect of these factors before making treatment recommendations.

DENOMINATOR: All patients aged 18 years and older undergoing major anatomic lung resection Denominator Criteria ( Eligible Cases): Patients aged 18 years on date of encounter AND Patient encounter during the reporting period had a pulmonary function test performed within 12 months prior to a major anatomic lung resection Numerator Options : Pulmonary function test performed within 12 months prior to surgery ( 3038F) OR Documentation of medical reason(s) for pulmonary function test not being performed within 12 months prior to surgery ( 3038F with 1P) OR Pulmonary function test not performed within 12 months prior to surgery, reason not otherwise specified ( 3038F with 8P) Version 5.3 03/ 31/2011 CPT only copyright 2010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved Page 562 of 571 RATIONALE: Evaluation of lung function for patients having thoracic surgery, for patients having thoracotomies, for patients having surgery in which the chest is opened and in patients with respiratory disease, eg esophagectomy, lung excision or resection is vital to determine what treatment is needed, safe and effective. Evaluation of lung function for patients being considered for lung cancer resection is critical to assessing suitability for resection and prediction of post -operative lung function. Review of the 5000 lobectomies recorded in the current STS Gener al Thoracic Database identified a significant gap with respect to preoperative pulmonary function testing; it was missing in 22% of patients undergoing resection for lung cancer. Remediation of this process gap should improve quality by reducing inappropri ate selection of high- risk patients for surgery. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: \"Lung function tests were considered to be appropriate for patients undergoing spinal surgery, for ASA grade 3 patients having thoracic surgery, for patients having thor acotomies and for surgery in which the chest is opened in patients with respiratory disease, e.g. esophagectomy, lung excision or resection (Chest, 2003) ASA grade 3 - A patient with severe systemic disease ASA grade 4 - A patient with severe systemic dise ase that is a constant threat to life Preoperative tests: The use of routine preoperative tests for elective surgery In patients being considered for lung cancer resection, spirometry should be performed. If the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is >80% predicted normal or >2 L, the patient is suitable for resection including pneumonectomy without further evaluation. If the FEV1 is >1.5 L, the patient is suitable for a lobectomy without further evaluation. Level of evidence, fair; benefit, subst antial; grade of recommendation, B. (National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2003) In patients being considered for lung cancer resection, if either the FEV1 or DLCO are < 80% predicted, postoperative lung function should be predicted through additional testing.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS: Nonpharmacological therapy is recommended and may include weight reduction, decreased sodium and alcohol intake and exercise (Williams MA, Fleg JL, Ades PA, et al., 2002). Selection of pharmacological therapy should be based on the presence of comorbidities, severity of hypertension, presence of risk factors and target organ damage (Williams MA, Fleg JL, Ades PA, et al., 2002). Frequent follow -up visits are recommended (WHO, 2002). After initiation of the initial therapy, a follow -up visit is recommended within 1- 2 months, to assess hypertension control, patient compliance to treatment and adverse effects [Level I Recommendation, Level -C Evidence] (Chandler JM, Connito D, Demme RA, et al., 1999).
