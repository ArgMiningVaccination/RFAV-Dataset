Special attention is currently paid to naturally pre-designed sca olds found in skeletons of marine sponges, which represent a renewable resource of biomaterials. Here, an innovative approach to the production of mineralized sca olds of natural origin is proposed. For the rst time, a method to obtain calcium carbonate deposition ex vivo, Mar.

Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 2 of 26 using living mollusks hemolymph and a marine-sponge-derived template, is specically described. For this purpose, the marine sponge Aplysin aarcheri and the terrestrial snail Cornu aspersum were selected as appropriate 3D chitinous sca old and as hemolymph donor, respectively. The formation of calcium-based phase on the surface of chitinous matrix after its immersion into hemolymph was conrmed by Alizarin Red staining. A direct role of mollusks hemocytes is proposed in the creation of ne-tuned microenvironment necessary for calcication ex vivo. The X-ray di raction pattern of the sample showed a high CaCO 3amorphous content. Raman spectroscopy evidenced also a crystalline component, with spectra corresponding to biogenic calcite. This study resulted in the development of a new biomimetic product based on ex vivo synthetized ACC and calcite tightly bound to the surface of 3D sponge chitin Keywords: chitin; sca [ 1] urgently requires large-scale 3D cell/tissue-manufacture technologies, to create biologically active 3D sca olds. Consequently, 3D sca olds must possess biological, immunological, physicochemical, structural and mechanical cues at nanoscale, microscale and macroscale levels. Mostly articially fabricated or prefabricated sca olds must be bio- and eco-compatible [ 2] and should be suitable to support optimal cell growth, di erentiation and proliferation [ 3], with the nal goal of developing corresponding soft and hard tissues on request. Recent focus in biomedicine has been concentrated on non-articial, naturally prefabricated [ 4] skeletal structures of marine origin [ 5-11] that serve as examples of \"marine biomimetics\" [ 12]. This trend is well represented in the book by Choi and Ben-Nissan entitled Marine-Derived Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering Applications [13]. We completely agree with the statement of Professor Pierfrancesco Morganti that \"the use of natural polymers in substitution to the petrol-derived ones seems the best way to produce skin-friendly healthy tissues and, slowing down the increased plastics production and waste, to try to save the Earth's environment equilibrium and biodiversity\" [2]. Special attention is currently paid to naturally pre-designed sca olds found in skeletons of diverse marine sponges, which represent unique renewable resources for the sustainable development of novel 3D biomaterials [ 14-19]. The main players in this eld are marine demosponges (phylum Porifera: class chitin-based [ 23-34] 3D skeletal constructs, respectively. Traditionally, it is mostly arthropods' chitin that is recognized as the biological material suitable for application in biomedicine (for review, see [ 35-39]). Due to its biocompatibility, chitin is applied in dermocosmetics [ 2,40-43] and as wound-dressing biomaterial [ 44-46]. Therefore, reports concerning the successful clinical application of chitin in the form of dressings and membranes [ 47-51] are of crucial interest. Recently, Fang et al. [ 52] reported a method for producing 3D wound-dressing sponges made of quaternary chitin /partially deacetylated chitin nanobers. Obtained material exhibited instant water /blood-triggered expansion and superabsorbent capacity. Moreover, authors proved such chitinous 3D sponges attract and stimulate blood cells /platelets, promoting blood coagulation and display superior hemostatic performance to traditional hemostatic materials [52]. The discovery of chitin in the skeleton of Cambrian demosponge Vauxia gracilenta (Walcott, verongiids, conrmed a million-years-long success of sponges belonging to the order Verongiida, with respect to naturally optimized architecture of their chitinous, robust, ber-based, microporous skeletons. The content of chitin in verongiids is species-dependent and ranges between 5% and 70% [ 4,24,27,29,30]. One of the most important advantages of sponge chitin, in contrast to traditionally used chitin sources, such as fungi [ 54], coralline algae [ 55], mollusks [ 56], corals [ 57],Mar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 3 of 26 insects, spiders and crustaceans [ 58-61], is the size of sponges: they can reach up to 2 m in diameter (i.e., the elephant ear sponge Ianthella basta (Pallas, 1766)) [ 27,62], or up to 1.5 m length, as with the Caribbean stove-pipe sponge Aplysina archeri (Higgin, 1875) used in this study (Figure 1). Furthermore, verongiid sponges can be successfully cultivated under marine farming conditions [ 63-67] and possess the unique ability to regenerate their skeletal tissues up to 12 cm per year [62]. Mar. Drugs 2020 , 18, x 3 of 27 corals [57], insects, spiders and cr ustaceans [58-61], is the size of sponges: they can reach up to 2 meters in diameter (i.e., the elephant ear sponge Ianthella basta (Pallas, 1766)) [27,62], or up to 1.5 meter as with the Caribbean stove-pipe sponge Aplysina archeri (Higgin, 1875) used in this study (Figure 1). Furthermore, verongiid sponges can be successfully cultivated under marine farming conditions [63-67] and possess the unique abi lity to regenerate their skeletal tissues up to 12 cm per year [62]. Figure 1. The giant Caribbean stove-pipe sponge Aplysina archeri (Demospongiae, Verongiida: Aplysinidae) produces up to 1.5-meter- long skeletal tubes (of inner diameter 10 cm) made of mineralized chitin [4]. This image was made by V.N. Ivanenko, on June 12, 2017, in the coastal waters of Cura\u00e7ao (Playa Marie Pampoen; 12\u00b005'24\"N, 68\u00b054'19\"W; depth 21 m). Following the discovery of chitin content in sp onges in 2007 [68,69], the first reports on the applications of 3D sponge-derived chitin scaffolds in tissue engineering appeared in 2010 [25,70]. Our scaffolding strategy [53,71] is based on the application of naturally prefabricated 3D chitinous scaffolds of poriferan origin as one of the forms of decellularized matric es [72]. Previously, we reported that the decellularized 3D and [76,77] can selected human bone- marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells [77]). Human chondrocytes [25,70], as well as cardiomyocytes [34], also showed good growth and proliferation features in experiments using 3D chitinous scaffolds isolated from the cultivated demosponge A. aerophoba . It is well recognized that special multifunctional cells circulating in molluscan hemolymph, known as hemocytes, are crucial players in moll usk shell formation and re pair processes [78-81]. These cells are responsible not only for calcium and bicarbonate ions transport but, due to a suitable microenvironment, also for biomineral crystal formation directly in the cell [82]. Consequently, such observations allowed us to create a methodological trend based on the development of calcium carbonate crystals deposition ex vivo by living mo llusks hemolymph, using external templates [80,83-85]. For this purpose, both 3D chitinous scaffolds from sponge and terrestrial snail Stylommatophora: Helicidae) (Figure 2) were used as an appropriate matrix and as the hemolymph donor, respectively. This mollusk is used as escargot meat and slime for cosmetic applications; thus, mollusks possess a high industrial potential as the most common breeding species on specialized farms\u2014helicultures [86]. Figure 1. The giant Caribbean stove-pipe (Demospongiae, Verongiida: Aplysinidae) produces up to 1.5-m-long skeletal tubes (of inner diameter \u001410 cm) made of mineralized chitin [ 4].

Principal schematic view of non-lethal manual extraction of C. aspersum hemolymph and its application for ex vivo biomineralization, using 3D chitinous scaffolds isolated from sponges with respect to obtain both amorphous and microcrysta lline calcium carbonate phases (see also Figure 14). The aim of this paper is to use, for the first time, 3D chitin scaffolds isolated from the giant verongiid demosponge A. archeri (Figure 1) for molluscs hemolymph-associated biomineralization ex vivo. This experimental study was additionally motivated by the fact that both amorphous and crystalline phases (i.e., calcite) of calcium carbonates are known to be bio-compatible [87-89], biodegradable [90-92] and osteoinduc tive substrates for tissue engineering of bones and other hard tissues [93-105]. 2. Results The tube-like body (Figure 1) of the demosponge A. archeri represents a unique, naturally predesigned, hierarchically structured fibrous constr uct (Figures 3 and 4). Such tubular constructs can be up to 150 cm long, with an inner diameter of up to 10 cm (for morphological details, see [106- 109]). The color of the live sponge ranges from lavender through gray to brown; however, air-dried sponges turn reddish-brown (Figure 3) (see al so [4]). Recently, we unambiguously showed the chitinous origin of A. archeri skeletal tubes [4]. The chitin content of A. archeri skeleton reaches ~5% by weight [4]. Consequently, now, we take the liberty of suggesting that such chitinous constructs represent the longest tubular chitin known. This un ique source of pre-designed microporous chitin has a distinct advantage for practical applications: researchers, according to their aims, can use selected fragments (Figure 4) of specific size fr om the hard skeletal tube. For example, the long fragment of the tube can be fixed (Figure 3D) so th at only the lower part is the subject for treatment (Figure 3A,B,C) with respect to the isolation of pure chitin scaffold (Figure 3F and Figure 6). For the isolation of ready-to-use chitinous scaffold (Figure 6), we used the standard alternating alkaline-acid-based treatment [24], which took in this case up to four days at room temperature. During this procedure, the presence of intercon nected inner channels located within skeletal microtubes could be well-visualized (Figure 5). Following this simple treatment, the tube-like skeleton of A. archeri was completely demineralized, cell- and pigment-free, mechanically flexible (Figure 6A) and transparent. Figure 2.

For example, the long fragment of the tube can be xed (Figure 3D) so that only the lower part is the subject for treatment (Figure 3A-C) with respect to the isolation of pure chitin sca old (Figure 3F and Figure 6).Mar.

In step I, water-soluble salts were removed by pretreatment of the sponge skeleton with distilled water in the beaker placed on a magnetic stirrer ( A) for 6 h. Afterward, in step II, the sponge was treated with 2.5 M of NaOH solution during 24 h, for deproteinization and depigmentation ( B). In step III, the 3D scaffolds were treated with 20% acetic acid for 24 h, to remove resi dual calcium and magnesium carbonates, followed by washing with distilled water up to pH 6.8 ( C). Steps II and III were repeated twice to obtain tubular scaffolds ( D,E), which were cut off from the sponge and used for further studies ( F). Figure 3.

The microstructure of skeletal fibers was characterized by us previously [4]. Figure 5. Alternating treatment of skeletal fibers of A. archeri , using alkali and acid solutions, leads to the visualization of inner channels (arrows) located within fibers ( A,B). Such channels are responsible for capillary activity of these cons tructs with respect to water and ot her liquids. For details, see [4]. Figure 4. Decellularized chitinous skeleton of selected fragment of A. archeri (A) possesses anatomizing 3D microporous architecture ( B) due to the presence of naturally mineralized, rigid bers ( C,D). The microstructure of skeletal bers was characterized by us previously [4]. For the isolation of ready-to-use chitinous sca old (Figure 6), we used the standard alternating alkaline-acid-based treatment [ 24], which took in this case up to four days at room temperature. During this procedure, the presence of interconnected inner channels located within skeletal microtubes could be well-visualized (Figure 5). Following this simple treatment, the tube-like skeleton of A. archeri was completely demineralized, cell- and pigment-free, mechanically flexible (Figure 6A) and transparent. Recently, we reported [ 4] that 3D microtubular chitin of A. archeri sponge can function as an e ective capillary system with respect to model liquids such as methylene blue dye, crude oil and pig blood. Consequently, there are all the necessary preconditions to suggest that 3D chitinous sca old isolated in this study can also function as liquid delivery construct [ 28] for the cell-growth medium, which could be, for example, optimized for the cultivation of hemocytes of mollusks origin. Herein, for the rst time, we show how short-term cultivated C. aspersum hemocytes interact with the 3D chitinous sca olds isolated from marine sponge A. archeri (Figure 7). According to Yoshino and co-authors [ 110], hemocytes cultured in vitro , without any additional culture medium, are able to survive for two to three days, and this was further conrmed by our results. The presence of hemocytes in the hemolymph of C. aspersum snail was shown by using eosin and methylene blue staining, according to the protocol of Grandiosa et al. [ 111]. At 24 h following the contact of hemolymph with sponge chitin, the formation of hemocytes clusters (see Figure 7C,D) at chitinous sca olds became quite visible. Then, 48 h after the contact, hemocytes clusters enlarged in size (see Figure 8).Mar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 7 of 26 Mar. Drugs 2020 , 18, x 6 of 27 Figure 4.

After purification, a translucent tube- like chitinous scaffold derived from A. archeri (see Figure 3) remains stable enough, but flexible after being saturated with water ( A). It takes over the shape of respective hard surface, fo r example, this glass tube. The 3D architecture of the scaffold made of interconnected microtubes is very visible, using digital stereo microscopy ( B,C). The porosity of such scaffold ranges between 300 and 800 \u00b5m. Recently, we reported [4] that 3D microtubular chitin of A. archeri sponge can function as an effective capillary system with respect to model li quids such as methylene blue dye, crude oil and pig blood.

The presence of hemocytes in the hemolymph of C. aspersum snail was shown by using eosin and methylene blue staining, according to the protocol of Grandiosa et al. [111]. At 24 hours following the contact of hemolymph with sponge chitin, the formation of he mocytes clusters (see Figure 7C,D) at chitinous scaffolds became quite visible. Then, 48 hours after the contact, hemocytes clusters enlarged in size (see Figure 8). Figure 6.

Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 8 of 26 Mar. Drugs 2020 , 18, x 8 of 27 Figure 7. Light microscopy imagery. Characteristic a ggregates of hemocytes present in isolated hemolymph of C. aspersum snail was observed both without ( A) and using eosin and methylene blue staining ( B) on the glass slide. The formation of hemocytes-based clumps before ( C) and after staining by eosin and methylene blue ( D) became visible on the surface of A. archeri chitinous scaffold 24 h after the immersion in hemolymph. Two hemocytes ty pes could be distinguishe d after staining: most dominant granulocytes (yellow arrow) and single hyalinocytes (violet arrow). Our results indicated that hemocytes attached to the surface of external chitinous matrix. Most of the distinguished hemocytes were represented by granulocytes visible in light microscopy images (Figure 7B,D). Aggregation of hemocytes is natural and has been observed in 27 preparations of chitinous scaffolds immersed in hemolymph. He mocytes are capable of ameboid movement, and they demonstrate the formation of nodules and positi ve chemotactic behavior in response to foreign substances. The appearance of long pseudopodia branching on the surface of tested chitinous material was visualized (Figure 7). Alizarin Red S staining confirmed the presence of calcium-rich deposits located on the chitin fibers (green arrow, Figure 8B,C), as well as on the cluster of disintegrated granulocytes, after 48 hours (see Figure 8). It is possible that both the immune response of hemocytes and the disintegrations of their calcium-rich cytoplasm are crucial for biomineralization ex vivo . Thus, the formation of calcium-based phase on the surface of chitinous matrix after its immersion into hemolymph of C. aspersum snail can be easily confirmed by using Alizarin Red S staining (Figure 9). However, this raises an intrig uing question regarding th e nature of these calcium- containing granular deposits, which theoretically contain calcite, aragonite and vaterite, as well as amorphous calcium carbonate, according to previous reports [82,112,113].

Characteristic aggregates of hemocytes present in isolated hemolymph of C. aspersum snail was observed both without ( A) and using eosin and methylene blue staining ( B) on the glass slide.

Round white-colored clusters ( A) of disintegrating hemocytes appeared 48 h after chitin immersion into the hemolymph isolated from C. aspersum snail (Figures 2 and 14). Calcium-rich cytoplasmic dense microparticles (arrows) within the disintegrating granulocytes became visible after staining with Alizarin Red S on the chitinous fiber ( B), as well as on the surface of the hemocytes cluster ( C). Figure 8. Stereo microscopy imagery of hemocyte clusters formed on the bers of A. archeri chitinous sca olds. Round white-colored clusters ( A) of disintegrating hemocytes appeared 48 h after chitin immersion into the hemolymph isolated from C. aspersum snail (Figure 2 and Figure 14). Calcium-rich cytoplasmic dense microparticles (arrows) within the disintegrating granulocytes became visible after staining with Alizarin Red S on the chitinous ber ( B), as well as on the surface of the hemocytes cluster (C). Thus, the formation of calcium-based phase on the surface of chitinous matrix after its immersion into hemolymph of C. aspersum snail can be easily conrmed by using Alizarin Red S staining (Figure 9). However, this raises an intriguing question regarding the nature of these calcium-containing granular deposits, which theoretically contain calcite, aragonite and vaterite, as well as amorphous calcium carbonate, according to previous reports [82,112,113]. We assumed that calcite was likely to be the biomineral formed ex vivo by hemocytes on the surface of 3D chitinous sca olds (Figure 9C,D), and so we carried out the initial analysis of deposits, using fluorescence microscopy. The results obtained (Figure 10) clearly show a high similarity of red auto-fluorescence between calcite standard [ 114,115] and microgranular deposits formed after biomineralization ex vivo, using C. aspersum hemolymph. To analyze the obtained biomineral with respect to calcite composition, we used traditional analytical techniques, such as X-ray di raction analysis (XRD) (Figure 11), FTIR (Figure 12) and Raman (Figure 13) spectroscopy.Mar.

However, the formation of granular calcium-based deposits on chitin surface ( C) after biomineralization ex vivo is quite visible when using digital light microscopy due to the intensive red coloration ( D) with the same stain. We assumed that calcite was likely to be the biomineral formed ex vivo by hemocytes on the surface of 3D chitinous scaffolds (Figure 9C,D), and so we carried out the initial analysis of deposits, using fluorescence microscopy. The results obtained (Figure 10) clearly show a high similarity of red auto-fluorescence between calcite standard [114,115] and microgranular deposits formed after biomineralization ex vivo, using C. aspersum hemolymph. To analyze the obtained biomineral with respect to calcite composition, we used traditional analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) (Figure 11), FTIR (Figure 12) and Raman (Figure 13) spectroscopy. Figure 9. Isolated 3D chitinous sca olds from A. archeri prior to ex vivo biomineralization with C. aspersum hemolymph ( A) became slightly violet after Alizarin Red S staining ( B). However, the formation of granular calcium-based deposits on chitin surface ( C) after biomineralization ex vivo is quite visible when using digital light microscopy due to the intensive red coloration ( D) with the same stain. The X-ray di raction pattern of the sample is represented in Figure 11 C. It shows the characteristics of a sample with a high amorphous content (big hump at 2 \u0012\u001920\u000e). Superimposed, a set of peaks being characteristic for Calcite-CaCO 3(ICDD #04-012 \u00000489) were found. The pattern still shows two unidentied peaks (2 \u0012\u001927\u000e, 2\u0012\u001933\u000e), none of which provides evidence for the presence of a second CaCO 3modication (Aragonite, Vaterite or the structures containing crystal water). According to the database search, these two peaks may originate from a crystallized organic component in the system. XRD analysis (Rietveld renement) pointed to the di erences between the measured lattice parameters and the database entry. The rened lattice parameters are a =(4.973 corresponding to a shrunk lattice.Mar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 11 of 26 Mar. Drugs 2020 , 18, x 11 of 27 Figure 10. Both calcite mineral standard ( A) and the mineral phase observed after ex vivo biomineralization of 3D chitin scaffold, using hemolymph of C. aspersum snail ( C), possess very similar features with respect to their auto-fluorescence [116] ( B,D, respectively). The X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample is represented in Figure 11 C. It shows the characteristics of a sample with a high amorphous content (big hump at 2 20\u00b0). Superimposed, a set of peaks being characteristic for Calcite-CaCO 3 (ICDD #04-012 0489) were found. The pattern still shows two unidentified peaks (2 27\u00b0, 2 33\u00b0), none of which provides evidence for the presence of a second CaCO 3 modification (Aragonite, Vaterite or the structures containing crystal water). According to the database search, these two pe aks may originate from a crystallized organic component in the system. XRD analysis (Rietveld re finement) pointed to the differences between the measured lattice parameters and the database entry. The refined lattice parameters are a = (4.973 \u00b1 0.001) \u00c5 001) \u00c5 (database: c = 17.058 \u00c5), corresponding to a shrunk lattice. Figure 10.

The results of ATR-FTIR analysis of the chitinous sca old used in this study before and after ex vivo biomineralization are represented in Figure 12. Both spectra show a characteristic split for -chitin, such as amide I at 1633 cm\u00001(see orange and blue lines). This band corresponds to the presence of stretching vibrations from intermolecular (C such bands as amide II characteristic intense band at 898 cm\u00001(C-O-C bridge as well as -glycosidic linkage) additionally conrmed the presence of -chitin [ 24]. A sharp peak visible at 873 cm\u00001(red arrow) clearly indicated that calcium carbonate as calcite polymorph (monohydrocalcite) [ 117-120] appeared on the chitinous sca old after ex vivo biomineralization using hemolymph isolated from C. aspersum (see Figure 12). The results obtained by employing Raman spectroscopy clearly showed (Figure 13) that the spectrum recorded for crystals obtained after ex vivo biomineralization corresponds to the spectra acquired for the biogenic calcite [ 121,122]. The most intensive band, with the maximum near 1083 cm\u00001, corresponds to \u00171 symmetric stretching vibrations CO 32\u0000of calcite [ 121,123], where the peak detected at 1433 cm\u00001is related to CO 32\u0000\u00172asymmetric stretching vibrations [ 124]. Additional evidence of calcite polymorph presence is provided by the bands at 711 and 279 cm\u00001. These two peaks are related to \u00174 in-plane bending vibrations of CO 32\u0000and vibrational modes of calcite, respectively [ 124].

Discussion It is recognized that \"the construction of no vel polymer materials via physical approaches and green technology from raw chitin is a sustainable pathway and beneficial to the green development\" [58]. However, this approach is connected with nu merous preparative steps, including, for example, mechanochemical disassembly, particulate leaching, gas foaming, thermally induced phase separation, electrospinning, dissolution of chitin in special liquids [122,125,126], and its supercritical drying [127]. Alternatively, diverse fractions of flakes, powders and nano forms of chitin (i.e., nanowhiskers, nanofibrils and na nocrystals) [128-130] can be obtained from and deproteinated crustaceans' chitin. Such scaffoldin g strategies [131], howe ver, are connected with technological difficulties and other disadvantages which can be a critical weakness in terms of cost and future clinical use [132]. Figure 13. Raman spectrum of the mineral phase obtained on the surface of 3D chitinous sca old after ex vivo biomineralization mediated by snail hemolymph. 3. Discussion It is recognized that \"the construction of novel polymer materials via physical approaches and green technology from raw chitin is a sustainable pathway and benecial to the green development\" [ 58]. However, this approach is connected with numerous preparative steps, including, for example, mechanochemical disassembly, particulate leaching, gas foaming, thermally induced phase separation, electrospinning, dissolution of chitin in special liquids [ 122,125,126], and its supercritical drying [ 127]. Alternatively, diverse fractions of flakes, powders and nano forms of chitin (i.e., nanowhiskers, nanobrils and nanocrystals) [ 128-130] can be obtained from demineralized and deproteinated crustaceans' chitin. Such sca olding strategies [ 131], however, are connected with technologicalMar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 14 of 26 di\u000eculties and other disadvantages which can be a critical weakness in terms of cost and future clinical use [132]. As mentioned in the introduction, marine verongiid sponges produce practically ready-to-use 3D constructs made of microtubular, mechanically robust, yet flexible sca olds, which are very well applicable for the cultivation of diverse human cells. However, would they be equally as good sca olds for hemocytes of invertebrate origin? The hemolymph of mollusks, including terrestrial snails, is mostly composed of water and contains hemocyanins, diverse inorganic ions, metabolites, lectins and enzymes, as well the of cells (i.e., blastocytes, hyalinocytes and granulocytes) [ 133-136] known as hemocytes. over 95% of circulating hemocytes, are 9-50 \u0016m in size, have an irregular nucleus and cytoplasm containing numerous granules [ 137]. On a flat surface, they exhibit ameboid motion and are able to form visible pseudopodia. These cells are capable of phagocytosis and its more complex forms, requiring collective participation of many granulocytes: encapsulation and nodulation [ 113]. Furthermore, granulocytes of the Pinctada fucata were reported to contain numerous calcium-rich vesicles and crystals serving as calcium pool [113]. Molluscan in vitro cell culture systems have a huge impact on our understanding of their complex physiological processes, functions and relation between tissue-specic cells [ 110]. Our study represents the rst data concerning the ability of C. aspersum hemocytes to grow on chitinous matrices principally (Figure 7) and, furthermore, to build clusters (Figure 8). These phenomena may be explained as follows. Firstly, hemocytes are cells responsible for immune responses [ 138-141] recognizing sponge a-chitin as a foreign body. Nodulation in terrestrial snails is a multi-stage process, requiring the presence of many granulocytes. This process is initiated by the contact of the granulocyte with a foreign substance. As a result of degranulation occurring in the granular cytoplasm, chemotaxis-related substances are released. They, in turn, attract other hemocytes to the site where the foreign matter is encapsulated by many layers of granulocytes (Figure 7). Moreover, this site becomes a condensation center of calcium ions present in hemolymph, as well as the ones released from cytoplasm of hemocytes. A second explanation could be related to biomineralization. Previously, chitin within mollusk shells has been detected, next to proteins, being a part of organic membrane, which appears during shell repair or formation [ 81,142,143]. It is possible that hemocytes identify chitinous matrix as a substituent of this membrane. In the literature, we can nd undeniable evidence concerning active participation of hemocytes in calcication in vivo [80-82,144,145]. For example, Kapur and Sen Gupta (1970) [ 146] described such a membrane as a specialized sca old for the granulocytes, which lose their identity, leaving free nuclei and organic matter, and deposit their calcium-rich granules from cytoplasm. In this case, the organic membrane acts as a crystal's nucleation center. Similar explanations are to be found in numerous papers by Abolins-Krogis, who conducted studies on terrestrial snails from the Helix genus [79,144,147,148]. Biomimetic materials displaying the complexity of biominerals are articially di \u000ecult to prepare [ 149], even though numerous in vitro attempts have been carried out previously [ 150-156]. Our results are in a good agreement with recently published data demonstrating that chitin-CaCO 3 and porous chitin-CaCO 3sca olds facilitated hMSCs attachment following cell osteogenic di erentiation. However, such chitin sca olds were prepared by dissolving crustaceans chitin flakes in LiCl /dimethylacetamide, following by gel formation and freeze-drying [ 157]. In contrast, the experimental results reported in this study unambiguously show a new biomimetic direction to apply already naturally prefabricated [ 18] 3D chitinous sca olds of poriferan origin as templates for both the growth of mollusk and hemocytes and the functionalization of the surface of chitin bers with respect to the formation of amorphous and crystalline (calcite) calcium carbonate-based layers. Our approach is based on ready-to-use 3D sca olds of sponges' origin hence only the size of already naturally predesigned pores could be a limiting factor. However, this can be neglected due to the ability of hemocytes not only to attach to the surface of individual chitin bers, but also to build large-size clusters located between bers that possess biomineralization activity (Figure 8).Mar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 15 of 26 Thus, our study resulted in the development of a new biomimetic product, utilizing mollusk hemocytes, which is based on ex vivo synthetized ACC and calcite tightly bound to the surface of sponge chitin used as 3D sca old. The outlook of this biomimetic direction includes numerous open questions concerning the role of hemocytes in the creation of a ne-tuned microenvironment [ 158] which is necessary for calcication ex vivo. Without doubt, the mechanisms and kinetics of this kind of biomineralization should be investigated, in addition to carrying out further studies on mechanical properties of developed mineralized sca olds aimed at practical application in biomedicine, in the near future. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Sample Location and Collection 4.1.1. Aplysina archeri Sponges The Caribbean sponges were collected and preserved (in 96% ethanol) as hosts of symbiotic invertebrates in the Bay of Pigs of Cuba (coordinates: 22\u000e07'15.9\"N, Van a commercial heliculture farm from the central part of Poland (Snails Breeder\u2014Hodowla \u00b4Slimak \u00f3w, Maszyce, Poland). Snails were maintained in a glass aquarium, at room temperature. As food, lettuce, carrots and apples were used. Moreover, cuttlebone of Sepia o \u000ecinalis cuttlesh was given to snails as calcium carbonate enrichment (CaCO 3) in the diet. The snails were kept moist throughout the experimental period with wet humus. Animal rights statement is not required. 4.2. Isolation Procedure 4.2.1. Isolation of Chitinous Sca olds from the A. archeri Demosponge Skeleton The procedure for the isolation of chitin-based sca olds from verongiid sponges, as reported by us [24], was followed here. In brief, it was performed accordingly to the following steps: (I) sponge skeleton was washed three times with distilled water in the vessel on a magnetic stirrer, to remove water-soluble compounds, for 6 h (Figure 3A). Afterward, the water was changed (step II) with 2.5 M of NaOH, at 37\u000eC, for 24 h, for deproteinization and depigmentation (Figure 3B). This step was then followed by (step III) treatment with 20% CH 3COOH at 37\u000eC, for a period of 24 h, to remove residual calcium and magnesium carbonates and then washing in distilled water up to pH 6.8. Steps II and III were repeated two times, to obtain colorless tubular sca olds (Figure 3D-F). The purity of isolated chitin sca olds has been proved according to standard analytical procedures as described previously [4]. 4.2.2. Nonlethal Isolation of the Hemolymph from the C. aspersum Snail For hemolymph collection, the modied nonlethal intravital method described in Polish patent P .410296 and article [ 159] was used. The shell surface of the selected C. aspersum snail was cleaned with 70% ethanol. After that, a piece of shell was removed, and 3 h later, about 1000 \u0016L of hemolymph was isolated from an individual of C. aspersum by main-vessel puncture, using a sterile syringe and needle [ 159] (see Figure 14). Twelve hours post-isolation, an organic lm was observed in the site of removed shell fragment, which was fully mineralized within the next few days [ 160]. During the nextMar. Drugs 2020 ,18, 123 16 of 26 three months after the procedure, the snails used in this study did not show any visible changes in their physiology or in behavior. Mar. Drugs 2020 , 18, x 17 of 27 Figure 14. Nonlethal extraction of the hemolymph from cultivated C. aspersum snail, using syringe (A). Initially, the shell of the snail was disrupted me chanically by using a scalpel, with the aim of obtaining around 5 mm \u00d7 5 mm large shell-free surface. After this procedure, the location of the main \"blood\" vessel becomes visible ( B) and accessible to use a needle for the hemolymph extraction ( A). 4.3. Ex Vivo Biomineralization of the A. archeri Chitinous Scaffolds A square fragment (10 \u00d7 10 mm) of selected chitinous scaffold (Figure 10) was immersed in hemolymph of C. aspersum for one hour and then placed on a sterile slide, until completely dried, at room temperature. The procedure was replicated five times. The described technique aimed to simulate biomineralization of organic matrix by snail hemolymph under natural conditions via mimicking of physicochemical effects reported for shell regeneration of terrestrial snails previously [161,162]. Obtained in this way, mineral phases deposited on chitinous matrix were characterized, as represented below. 4.4. Short-Term Cultivation of Hemocytes on Chitinous Matrix For short-term cultivation of hemocytes, about 0.5 mL of the hemolymph was isolated, using the method described above, and placed in a 2 mL Eppe ndorf tube. Selected fragment of chitinous matrix was immersed in the hemolymph, at room temperature, for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. To prevent possible contamination with bacteria streptomycin (1 00 \u00b5g/mL) and penicillin (60 \u00b5g/mL) have been used [163]. 4.5. Characterization of Obtained Materials 4.5.1.

Figures were prepared, using the GNU Image Manipulation Program GIMP and Microsoft O \u000ece tool PowerPoint 2016. 4.5.2. Digital, Light and Fluorescence Microscopy The obtained samples were observed, using an advanced imaging and measurement system consisting of Keyence VHX-6000 digital optical microscope and the swing-head zoom lenses VH-Z20R (magnication up to 200 \u0002) and VH-Z100UR (magnication up to 1000 \u0002). The light and fluorescence microscope modes were performed with a BZ-9000 (Keyence) microscope. Eosin and Methylene Blue Hemavet (Kolchem) as the combination of eosin and methyl blue dyes. Previously, this stain was successfully used for hemocytes detection and characterization [ 111,164,165]. Hemolymph cell monolayers (HCMs) were prepared by spreading the drop of hemolymph on sterile glass slide and drying it at ambient temperature. Staining was also used to detect hemocytes settled on chitinous sca old (see Figure 7). 4.5.4. Alizarin Red S Staining Ex vivo mineralized chitinous sca olds were stained with Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) and compared with that of native A. archeri chitin as isolated. For the staining procedure, 40 mM of Alizarin Red S (pH 8.3) was used for staining of the samples, during 30 min, at room temperature (for details see [ 165]). Stained samples were washed with distilled water ve times, to eliminate the unattached Alizarin Red S, as well as mineral particles which were not tightly attached to the surface of chitin bers. Calcium deposits were detected as orange-red color particles, using digital microscopy. 4.5.5. Fluorescent Microscopy Analysis Materials in this study were observed with a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan), in fluorescent and light microscopy mode. Calcite mineral standard was purchased from the International of spectroscopy techniques were used for the qualitative characterization of obtained mineralized sca olds, as well as pure chitin isolated from A. archeri .
