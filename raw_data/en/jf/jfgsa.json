Within Harmonized Aromatherapy for Seasonal Wellness, Shanti Dechen shows us how we can mindfully integrate aromatherapy into each season to enhance our emotional, mental and physical wellness. Harmonized Aromatherapy for Seasonal Wellness does not merely cover the use of essential oils. Utilizing her decades of experience and insights into botanicals and natural healing modalities (see the About the Author section below), Shanti provides a helpful overview - and definitions/recipes where appropriate - into using herbs, flower essences, carrier oils, infused/macerated oils, essential oils and hydrosols. She helps the reader understand the benefits of each and how/when to best use them. She also provides a helpful overview of self-care. Each seasonal chapter builds on the preceding chapter in guiding the reader towards using the most beneficial herbs, oils, essences and hydrosols, and she offers a lovely selection of helpful recipes within each section. Although the information presented is powerful, Shanti's writing style is friendly, inviting, compassionate and easy-to-read. She provides numerous relevant and inspirational quotes plus many color photos that complement each of the sections and chapters.
