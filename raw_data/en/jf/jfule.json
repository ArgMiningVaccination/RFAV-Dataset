That's the sound of thousands of ticks rubbing their little legs together in anticipation. Ticks tend to reemerge once temperatures rise above 45 degrees. They're fans of warmth and moisture and - fun fact - can even sense the body temperatures of potential hosts. Many pet parents have questions about how to spare their dogs and cats - and the rest of their family - from being a potential lunch for creepy crawlies. Most prevention strategies implement pesticides in spot-on, oral, or collar forms - a necessary compromise in biting insect-infested areas. But these products often have their own unwanted side effects which can even rival the disease and allergic reactions caused by the pests, themselves! Thankfully, multi-layered [natural remedies for ticks](https://www.doylestownveterinaryhospital.com/blog/protect-your-dog-from-ticks-naturally/) and fleas are available if you know where to look. And if you happen to be in Doylestown, PA, acclaimed pet shop [Dogs and Cats Rule](https://www.dogsandcatsrule.com/) is one of those places. \"Customers are always looking for a natural alternative,\" store manager Vince Fahringer says. \"And our customers know to expect that from us.\" In the world of all-natural remedies for ticks and fleas, Vince says two brands, in particular, stand out: Earth Animal and Wondercide\u00ae. Both, he says, take the place of traditional ingestible and topical treatments that contain pesticides viewed by many as containing potentially toxic and cancer-causing chemicals. \"Earth Animal is one of our best-selling [supplements for dogs](https://www.doylestownveterinaryhospital.com/blog/omega-supplements-for-dogs/) and cats because it's so effective,\" Vince says. The brand is [the brainchild of Drs. Bob and Susan Goldstein](https://earthanimal.com/inside-earth-animal/our-family/), pioneers in the field of holistic and integrative veterinary medicine who endeavor to sustain the symbiotic relationship between humans, animals, and the earth. Vince spotlights one of the brand's best-sellers: Dr. Bob Goldstein's Nature's Protection has been on the market for many years, impressing with a two-step protocol that safeguards the entirety of our pets. \"A cedar and peppermint oil-based herbal collar offers external protection, in addition to a shampoo and a spray that are also used externally,\" Vince says. \"But the most important part of the program is the daily herbal internal powder.\" Containing a unique blend of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that support the immune system, the herbal powder - says Vince - is fed to dogs or cats daily, protecting them from the inside out by literally changing their odor. \"It prevents fleas, ticks, and other biting insects,\" Vince says. \"When they smell it, they won't try and bite. At the same time, if they do, the product bitters the blood of our animals, and therefore the biting insect does not attach.\" While some customers choose to use one component of the protocol over another situationally (Northeasters, for instance, may choose only the external collar during extended cold snaps), Vince says the line is most effective when all steps are integrated simultaneously. \"There's nothing else like this product in the marketplace,\" he says. \"I've used this program for 9 years with my dog, and I've never had a problem with it. It's truly a great alternative. It's easy to use. You just feed it daily and just repeat the process.\" \"You need the other components to really ward off biting insects,\" Vince says. Going All Natural Natural remedies for ticks and fleas are growing in popularity, and with plenty of good reasons. Not only are parasites known to develop resistance to traditional products containing pesticides - prompting pharmaceutical companies to constantly develop new formulas - but these products have previously been associated with any number of ailments, from liver and kidney disease to respiratory distress to nervous system disorders and cancer. What's more - traditional flea and tick controls, including chews, although approved for animal use and consumption, need to be kept off of human skin, out of the reach of small children, and more. There's no big secret as to why. That being said: even \"natural\" products can occasionally cause reactions in our pets, particularly cats. Pet parents should always test products on a small area of their animal's skin. If localized inflammation results or lethargy or vomiting occurs, it's always wise to discontinue use and consult your veterinarian. For their part, Dogs and Cats Rule is happy to help customers who are seeking safe, effective, and natural remedies for ticks and fleas. As Vince puts it: \"You can speak volumes about a product when you use it and it "}
