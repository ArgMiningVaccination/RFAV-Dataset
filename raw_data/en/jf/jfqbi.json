The program was created in 2015 to increase neighborhood safety and promote senior physical activity. The senior program provides community safety trainings, safe neighborhood escort services, and safe street crossings. UCSF and USF students have participated in creating needs assessments and data collection to inform programming. Previous surveys have explored seniors' perceptions of safety in the neighborhood and how TSP volunteers can be best utilized to promote safety. Purpose: Assess knowledge of and perspectives about the TSP Senior Program among seniors who live and/or access services in the Tenderloin. Methods: A pilot eight-item survey was created in collaboration with TSP staff and subsequently administered at the San Francisco Senior Center during the breakfast hour. Both paper surveys and Google form surveys on an iPad were used, with students recording participant responses. A Cantonese-speaking staff member interpreted for participants who were primary Cantonese speakers. Per the suggestion of Senior Center staff, fruit was purchased to serve as an incentive for participation. Results: A total of 18 seniors participated in the pilot survey. The majority (83.3%) reported walking in the Tenderloin everyday but only 27.8% of respondents recognized a picture of the TSP Corner Captains. Perceptions of the role of the Corner Captains varied among respondents. However, when presented with the statement \"I feel safe when I see this group in the Tenderloin,\" 10% strongly agreed, 50% agreed, and 40% neither agreed nor disagreed. Conclusions: Our pilot experience showed seniors were receptive to the survey during their meal time. Although we brought incentives in the form of fruits (tangerines and nectarines), we found that most seniors were happy to answer the surveys. The surveys were administered using an in-person volunteer to administer the questions, allow for clarification, if needed, and record the responses. We had a combination of hard copies and electronically collected surveys. We found electronically collected surveys were more efficient. Recommendations: A larger scale administration of the survey should be undertaken in order to get more comprehensive results. Based on our pilot survey, we recommend administration of the survey at senior centers using an in-person volunteer. We recommend collecting survey information electronically using any mobile device, such as iPads or cell phones. Administration of the survey can also be undertaken on the street, as seniors walk about the neighborhood. We recommend administering the survey on days or times in which the safe passage senior program is not in effect. However, we recommend using volunteers wearing affiliated attire to administer the survey and record the responses. Finally, results should be presented back to the senior centers to keep them engaged and thank them for participating. Project Title: Tenderloin Cleanliness Project Capstone Tenderloin Community Benefit District (TLCBD) is a non-profit organization aiming to increase the usability, livability, and sustainability in the Tenderloin neighborhood in San Francisco through programming focused on safety and cleanliness. Results of the TLCBD Cleaning Survey conducted the summer of 2014 with businesses and residents showed low performance in waste/sidewalk washing and best performance in litter and graffiti removal. Respondents reported widely that cleaning improved safety. The Larkin Street Association conducted a survey in 2016 of 150 area merchants showing that 71% reported cleanliness as a pressing concern related to safety. In efforts to address cleanliness, TLCBD partnered with the Clean Team (Block by Block) in May 2017 in order to increase access to services of pressure washing, litter collection, and graffiti removal. Objectives: - Develop a baseline assessment tool (survey) for merchant perspective's on cleanliness - Analyze cleanliness data from 311 (city data) and Clean Team - Disseminate findings and develop next steps with TLCBD Methods: - Goal Setting: Met with TLCBD leadership to develop goals and scope of project scope - Data Analysis: Researched past survey data on Tenderloin cleanliness and explored 311 and Clean Team data - Tool Development: Created open-ended survey and administered jointly with TLCBD community liaison in order to inform creation of final survey - Final Deliverable: Based on key informant survey, developed final cleanliness survey with suggested administration plan Results: Themes from the four Key Informant Surveys included: - Cleanliness is an issue of concern for Tenderloin merchants - Lack of cleanliness detracts customers and hurts business - Merchants appreciate current services but feel that they are insufficient to have a lasting impact due to degree of uncleanliness in the Tenderloin - Merchants recognize larger related issues that need to be addressed such as homelessness and drug activity to have a larger impact on cleanliness From 311 and Clean Team data, we gathered that despite profound Clean Team services such as 30 tons of trash pick-up, over 600 blocks power-washed, over 3000 graffiti removals, and nearly 5000 sharps retrieved, there was an overall increase in 311 reporting in the neighborhood in the three months following the initiation of the Clean Team pilot. Conclusion: The merchant community identifies cleanliness as a pertinent issue in the Tenderloin and the community is motivated to address it. The diversity of stakeholders (merchants, residents, and City) will require incremental and intentional collaboration. The Clean Team is providing relevant services to fill a gap, but further advertisement and expansion of the services are needed. Next steps will include administering survey and diving deeper into ways to engage stakeholders such as the City into the efforts. Project Title: Destiny Arts: Impacting Health Through the Movement Arts Capstone Students: Cohen SJ, De La Torre KM, Martinez A, Ocegueda JA Summary: Destiny Arts Center (DAC) provides creative youth development to young people based in movement arts. DAC serves 3000-4000 students each year through its school based programs and arts center in North Oakland. Programming includes placing teaching artists in 25+ schools, after school classes, summer camps, and a competitive youth performance company. Charged with the question \"How does Destiny Arts Center impact health?\" we spent four weeks learning about the program through participation in school-based and afterschool programming, observations of performance company auditions, and interviews with key stakeholders. We then developed a health impact model supported by a robust literature review. The ultimate aim of this partnership was to increase DAC's ability to apply for health oriented grants. Our health impact model breaks down the work of DAC into three main arenas: building positive social environments, creative youth development, and improving mental health. These arenas intersect and influence each other while contributing to improved health outcomes broadly and specifically by mitigating adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Through our literature review we examined how positive social environments build positive relationships and provide the space for the development of social capital which impact stress response, health behaviors, and contribute to decreased risk of chronic conditions like obesity, hypertension. We delved into how youth development, which is bound up in resiliency training, contributes to healthier decision making, community engagement and mitigates the toxic stress of ACEs and their myriad health consequences. Additionally, we underscored how the programming of DAC promotes, the development of reliable social ties, internal locus of control, self-control, and self esteem improves mental health outcomes and positions itself to decrease rates of depression, anxiety, and addiction. Finally, we examined the evaluation tools that DAC has used at its school-based sites to link the questions students answer to the arenas we identified. We identified a resource with additional, validated questions to enhance the existing survey's ability to evaluate the most salient levers associated with downstream health outcomes. A standard visit to the pediatrician may not reveal all the health benefits of DAC, but the work that DAC does in the arenas we identify have lifelong implications for the health of its participants. We strongly believe that DAC's emphasis on positive environments, youth development, and mental health have powerful health outcomes that benefit its participants and the wider community. We encourage DAC to use this health impact model to advocate for funding from foundations and grantors more traditionally associated with healthcare organizations. To make a more robust case for itself, we recommend that DAC use revised survey questions and track results longitudinally. Project Title: Demonstration Project @ UC Hastings Everybody Needs Nature Capstone Students: Elizabeth J., Gianna L., Ashwin B., Joana L. ABSTRACT Background. Started in 2009, Demonstration Gardens (DG) at UC Hastings is an environmental literacy and advocacy program based out of San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood that offers a variety of program activities including gardening, park activation, teaching through puppetry, and the arts. Through their Garden Stewardship program, participants re-entering the working world receive a stipend to care for a legacy collection of plants and trees that was initially built during the HIV epidemic. DG is also currently working on \"Everybody Needs Nature\" (ENN), a cross-disciplinary multi-agency environmental health and justice research project which investigates health impacts within vulnerable populations related to access to the natural world in dense urban neighborhoods of the Tenderloin and SOMA in San Francisco (District 6). Purpose. As medical students, our community engagement project aimed to help with the initial stages of the ENN research, which poses the question: How does sustained access to nature within the urban environment affect individual health and community resilience? The purpose of our work was to inform DG's ENN research with a health perspective, allow community members involved with DG to interact with the health care system in their neighborhood environment, and to share with other medical students in the PRIME-US program about multiple approaches to community healing and resilience. Methods. First, background information and a needs assessment were collected at initial meetings with the Program Director. Second, we participated in DG programming activities to build rapport with community members and gain understanding of DG's impact on their lives. Third, a collaborative approach was taken to determine deliverables, which included the production of a video highlighting interviews of DG's participants and a literature review on the health impact of exposure to urban green space. Results. A 7-minute video was produced, which featured interviews with the director and 3 participants who described how working in the garden through DG's Garden Stewardship program and through DG's partnership with the Community Justice Center improved their overall health. The literature review resulted in a 6-page report summarizing key studies that demonstrated the association between exposure to the nature in various forms and health benefits on the individual and community level. The video can be accessed at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGrK_vemoD0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGrK_vemoD0) Conclusions. The project demonstrated a successful model of university-community partnership to promote structured inquiry into a community-driven research question and the richness of utilizing community engagement to inform research practices. The project reinforced the concept that access to nature improves health on multiple levels through individual testimonies from participants in the DG program and review of the scientific literature. Furthermore, the Demonstration Gardens is an example of how communities can be empowered to heal themselves from structural trauma. Recommendations. Future work includes creating surveys based on the literature review to measure the health impact of access to nature among community members exposed to DG programming and broader vulnerable communities in the Tenderloin neighborhood. Both Building upon and disseminating the video testimonials of DG participants to potential funders would increase financial and institutional support for their environmental justice work. MS1's - Group Project- Fresno's Health Pipeline Program: Dr.'s Academy and Jr Dr.'s Academy Each year our 1st year PRIME-US students partner with UCSF Fresno Latino Center for Medical Education and Research (LaCMER) Doctor's and Junior Doctors Academy. The Doctor's and Junior Doctors Academy are programs based in both middle and high school campuses in Fresno and led by Dr. Katherine Flores. The mission of these programs is : To nurture the development of future doctors and allied health professionals who can deliver culturally sensitive and appropriate health services to the ethnically diverse population of Fresno County, through a supportive and academically rigorous educational program for middle school and high school students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. Each year LaCMER holds a large conference to encourage the students to pursue careers in the health professions. A key component of the conference is the parent/care giver engagement. Parents/caregivers participate in workshops focused on science education and higher education and pathways to careers in the health field. Our 1st year PRIME-US students participate this annual pre-health conference in multiple ways. The student developed and led an educational session on the anatomy and function of the lungs, asthma, and air pollution for middle school students and their parents/caregivers. The session included a didactic lesson, the building of individual lung models, and the examination of healthy and unhealthy lung specimens. The PRIME-US students also participated in mentoring sessions with high school student and their parents/caregivers. Students shared their personal stories and experiences navigating higher education and answered questions that parents/caregivers and students had about college applications, financial aid, and being away from family. In the last workshop, the students had the opportunity to meet with Fresno State College students enrolled in the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP). The PRIME-US students answered questions about their paths to medical school, why they chose medicine, and how to navigate the medical school application process successfully Alexis Velasquez Alexis partnered with the nonprofit, Mi Mentor. See: [https://www.mimentor.org/](https://www.mimentor.org/) This nonprofit's goals are to develop and support innovative mentorship opportunities that inspire the next generation of healthcare leaders for underserved communities. One of the co-founders and original leaders of Mi Mentor was Mayra Cruz, a PRIME-US student who graduated in 2018. Alexis's project brought together participants from Mi Mentor and the UCSF Latino Medical Student Association to mentor and support those interested in applying to medical school. They held an event to share interview best practices, specifically around the MMI interview system that many medical schools use in their admissions processes. The event included conducting a focus group of mentees to identify areas of program and event improvement. Alexis also documented the key learnings and tools from this event and put them on a shared internet platform for other volunteers and mentors to use in the future. Bernie Lim and Nicole Carvajal Bernie and Nicole created a supplemental curricular program called, the Freedom School. The program was created to fill a gap in traditional western medical training that often does not include diverse perspectives. The program was open to students in the UCB-UCSF Joint Medical Program, UCB School of Public Health and UCSF School of Medicine. The Freedom School seeks to: (1) create a community and healing space for women of color and individuals dedicated to the intersections of critical theory, intersectional identities, and health justice for all (2) integrate critical race theory/social justice into medical education and public health practice (3) educate and engage in other forms of healing (non-Western and indigenous) that are prevalent among communities of color and/or marginalized communities The programming focused on learning from the experiences and history of health of women of color -- many of whom are oftentimes marginalized from discourse about health -- for exploring the bridges among intersectional identities, public health, and medicine. Medicine and public health oftentimes only convey \"broken narratives\" of women of color. Instead, the participants in the Freedom School discussed the history and centered the lived experiences of women of color as central teaching points that have been and will be foundational to envisioning a more inclusive medicine and public health practice. The Freedom School also partnered with local community based organizations and clinics to learn about different health service delivery models through the lens of the tenets of the Freedom School. Daniela Brissett Daniela partnered with a collaborative of student organizations including \"Students for Choice\" (School of Nursing and School of Medicine chapters) and nonprofit organizations including La Casa De Las Madres, Planned Parenthood, and the Roat\u00e1n Peer Health Exchange to host a fundraiser and informational session at UCSF. With donations from Planned Parenthood SF, UCSF Student Health, and La Casa de Las Madres this collaborative offered health education materials on family planning and health relationships; condom and family planning option models were used. They also provided nexplanon (an implantable contraceptive device) and condoms free of charge. Representatives from Student Health and La Casa de Las Madres were present to discuss their services and aid in educating students about available contraceptive methods. Zesemayat (Zesee) Mekonnen Zesee partnered with the Health Careers Academy, Samuel Merritt College, and Madison Park Business and Arts High School. Madison Park High School is located in an under resourced community, East Oakland; 100% of the student body qualifies for reduced or free lunch. Samuel Merritt College is a health sciences institution that offers degrees in nursing, [ occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistant, and podiatric medicine](https://www.samuelmerritt.edu/programs). The mission of the project was to bring the programming of the Health Careers Academy, which provides mentorship, engaging health curriculum, and exposure of the health careers, to high school students. The specific aims of this collaboration were to educate students about science, public health, and medicine through human body organ systems education and clinical correlates, as well as, to model a diverse range of health-related career pathways. Zesee coordinated PRIME-US and UCB Joint Medical Students to participate as mentors to the Madison Park students and facilitate the HCA programing. For their final culminating project the high school students presented an aspect of health that they had researched and learned about to the UCB Joint Medical Program, faculty, students and staff. Lee Lemus and Brenly Rowland Lee and Brenly partnered with Lightning Bolt, a grassroots collective empowering vulnerable and under resourced communities to prepare for natural and political disasters. This collective and project included various local public health education advocates in delivering an educational event. Their project was to hold an education session for the community about the opioid epidemic and life-saving interventions. Since the spike in opioid overdoses there is an increasing and critical need for community education on the topic. They shared education about how to obtain and administer the life-saving and highly effective over-the-counter intervention of naloxone (or Narcan), a chemical that reverses the effects of opioids. Fiona Ng Fiona partnered with the medical students who are members of the UCSF White Coats for Black Lives chapter and the WISE Health Program. White Coats for Black Lives is a medical student group that aims to end racism and violence and WISE is a local nonprofit. Together they provided health education services to community members of the [Dr. George W. Davis Senior Center](https://bhpmss.org/dr-george-w-davis-senior-center/) in the Bayview district in San Francisco. Focus groups were used to assess the interest of the seniors. The educational sessions covered STIs, consent, sexual problems impacting aging bodies, the intersection of faith and romantic relationships, and nutrition. The group reached out to local health focused non-profit organizations in the neighborhood to assist in facilitating health education workshops and peer discussion sessions for the seniors. The goals for the sessions were to improve community health by disseminating knowledge about STI prevention, but also\u2014and more importantly\u2014to empower these older community members to feel more comfortable talking to their healthcare providers about age-related sexual changes, and learning about ways to engage in healthy relationships in their older years. Workshops on nutrition were shared as well. The focus was on health as not just the absence of disease, but rather as physical, mental, and social well-being. The emphasis was to promote healthy, and fulfilling relationships\u2014either platonic or romantic\u2014that can greatly improve one's overall well-being. PRIME-US Community Projects 2007-2017 Through community-based project work, PRIME-US students learn about strategies for working directly with underserved communities; provide direct service to these communities; and acquire skills to assist in project development, implementation and evaluation. Skills include community assessment, cultural humility, partnering with community organizations, advocacy and leadership. These projects are supported in part by a grant from The California Wellness Foundation (2007-2014), Hearst Foundations (2015-2016), and Koret Foundation (2016-2019). PRIME Community Projects 2016-2017 PRIME MS1's Group Project: Fresno- Outreach Pipeline Program Each year our 1st year PRIME students participate in UCSF Fresno Latino Center for Medical Education and Research (LaCMER) Doctor's and Junior Doctors Academy and Health Careers Opportunities Program annual pre-health conference. The Doctor's and Junior Doctors Academy are programs based in both middle and high school campuses in Fresno and led by Dr. Katherine Flores. The mission of these programs is : To nurture the development of future doctors and allied health professionals who can deliver culturally sensitive and appropriate health services to the ethnically diverse population of Fresno County, through a supportive and academically rigorous educational program for middle school and high school students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. The HCOP program is based on the Fresno State University Campus and has the same mission. Each year LaCMER holds a large conference to encourage the students to pursue careers in the health professions. This conference also includes and supports the parents of the students in order to empower them to help their children to achieve their dreams of becoming health care professionals. In February 2017, our PRIME students revised and delivered an interactive workshop called: \"Breath Easy: All about the Lungs which included teaching, model building, and pathology specimen examination. Topics covered included lung anatomy and function, asthma pathophysiology and triggers, and pollution effects on air quality. This workshop was designed for middle schoolers and their parents. In another session, the students also offered their advice and shared their experiences with higher education with high school parents. Their final session was to mentor a group of Fresno State HCOP students. They answered questions about their paths to medical school and why they chose medicine. Final year Capstone student projects: Each fall our final year Capstone students do community engaged projects with community partners in San Francisco who have identified a valuable project need that PRIME-US students could fulfill. Students are required to provide oral presentations and written reports to their community partners and to the PRIME-US program. The abstracts are listed below. (Full reports are available upon request.) Project Title: Tenderloin Safe Passage: A Year in Review PRIME-US Mensah, Hai the first comprehensive, community-driven effort to address neighborhood-wide street safety in the Tenderloin. The Tenderloin is home to an estimated 4,000 children under the age of 18 and a high concentration of service providers. Currently, TLSP serves several hundred children in the district, connecting 5 area schools and approximately 25 service providers (afterschool centers, housing sites, and nonprofit organizations). Each afternoon TLSP volunteers, called Corner Captains, ensure children can walk safely from corner to corner on their way from school to their after-school programs. TLSP also provides street safety trainings to parents and children and community members, as threats to safety poses a public health problem - causing children chronic stress, fear, and actual injury, and harassment. TLSP has reached a critical juncture in its development. While there is great demand for and interest in TLSP's service to the Tenderloin's children and families, as an entirely volunteer program, TLSP is challenged to provide - and increase- those services reliably. In order to meet the ongoing and growing demands of neighborhood residents, TLSP's steering committee, a volunteer coalition of neighborhood program leaders, has determined to undergo a rigorous strategic planning and evaluation process. Purpose: To compile, organize, and present data from Aug 2015-2016 gathered from Corner Captains (through the Yammer app) to 1) assess efficacy of safe passage's intervention, 2) illustrate location of incidents (including drug use, loitering, and feces) 3) determine which corners had the most traffic and the most incidents 4) gather qualitative data regarding corner captain's attitudes toward their work and 5) organize data regarding youth's perceptions of the safe passage project. Data is intended to be comprehensible to varied audiences, including stakeholders, corner captains, and potential fundraisers. Methods: Using an iterative process, shared goals between TSP and PRIME students were reached through weekly meetings. Deliverables were presented at each weekly meeting for discussion, goal re-orientation, and refinement until a final product was finished. Deliverables included quantitative analyses of surveys filled out by corner captains regarding safety and negative activity. Simple descriptive analyses and one-way t-tests were used to assess differences in safety perception before and after TSP patrol. Geomapping of negative activity locale was performed to visualize geolocations of negative activity on the TSP blocks. Results: Overall, analysis of TSP data showed that negative activity globally decreased by 20% across all patrol areas. Youth perceptions of TSP also indicate that they feel \"happy and safe\" whenever TSP corner captains are present in their neighborhood. Specific roles of students included: Michael - Descriptive and one-way analyses of survey data, presentation preparation, and data presentation; Angela - Coordinating communication, descriptive analyses of survey data, presentation and data preparation; Hai - One-way analyses of survey data and geomapping of negative activity, presentation and data preparation. Conclusions: Safe passage reduced negative activity at the most high traffic corners by over 20%. Corner captains unanimously felt they had a positive impact in the neighborhood. Safe passage corner captains were recognized very often by youth, who reported overwhelmingly that corner captains made them feel \"happy and safe'\". Deliverables: - TLSP presentation given to the community 10/19/16 - TLSP presentation turned over to Kate - Recommendations (as below) - $500 for program support: Kate will purchase new signs Project Title: 3rd Street Youth Center and Clinic PRIME-US Capstone students: Elaine Lee, Walid Hamud-Ahmed, and Daniel Herrador Community Partner: 3rd Street Youth Center and Clinic Project Abstract: Background: 3rd Street Youth Center and Clinic (3rd Street) is a local non-profit agency in the Bayview Hunter's Point committed to providing comprehensive healthcare services and youth-oriented programming in order to keep youth healthy and prepared for future educational and vocational endeavors. Three UCSF Program in Medical Education- Urban Underserved (PRIME-US) students collaborated with 3rd Street in order to meet four identified objectives to further the mission and current projects currently underway by the organization. Purpose: The purpose of this project was to assist 3rd Street to meet four objectives: 1) Conduct a focus group with their youth to identify health topics the youth wished to explore further, 2) Teach how to create a podcast to explore these identified health topics, 3) Organize a healthcare student panel and 4) connect 3rd Street with at least one other UCSF-affiliated organizations for ongoing outreach and mentorship. All four objectives were met within the course of one month (October 2016). Methods and Results: The focus group was conducted in an interactive style where the youth participated in an activity in which they wrote down which health topics they felt were important to share with their friends and community. The participants were then split into three smaller groups, and within these groups, each group selected one health topic to as a subject for their podcast. The creation of the podcast was done by first providing a brief overview of the structure of a podcast, and then each member of the group was an assigned a role based on their interests. The UCSF students, who assisted with recording, research, and editing as needed, supervised the groups. 3rd Street will distribute the podcasts once finished, and certain students have expressed interest in creating future podcasts, for which they can use the podcasting manual created by the UCSF students. The healthcare panel was composed of three medical students, two recent nursing graduates, and a pharmacy student. The participants and panelists primarily conducted the panel in a Q&A style after a brief introduction. The 3rd Street youth were provided with the panelists' contact information so they could follow up with further questions or concerns. PRIME-US, along with MIMS and HealthLink have agreed to work with 3rd Street to include their participants in future programming, mentoring outreach, and health programming. Conclusions and Recommendations: Lessons learned with working with organization include how to work closely with a community organization that has their own deliverables, mission, and deadlines. Additionally, the students gained vital skills on how to engage with youth and young adults 12-24 years of age. One specific challenge was working with youth of varying English language proficiency as well as interest in creating a podcast. Our recommendations include continuing to solicit interests and health topics from the youth at 3rd Street to ensure any future programming is relevant to their interests. We would also recommend further student panels, ideally with a larger variety of healthcare professionals to expose the youth to a wider variety of careers within health care. For future podcasting teaching sessions, more time would be helpful in ensuring the students are given sufficient time to grasp the concepts of how to create and record a podcast. Project Title: Evaluation of a Community Clinic Volunteer Program PRIME-US Capstone students: Rand Dadasovich, Tara Gonzalez, Women's Community Clinic Project Abstract: Background: The Women's Community Clinic is a volunteer-run organization founded nearly 20 years ago to provide affordable and accessible health care services to Bay Area women and girls and plays a critical role in the health care safety net system in San Francisco. Since its inception, the clinic has used an innovative volunteer-based business model, the core of which is the volunteer health worker program. This program increases community capacity by helping local women gain the skills and experience to successfully transition to careers in health care. Purpose: Despite its success, the organization has experienced rapid growth and change because of the ACA and is seeking to evolve its volunteer program. The clinic enlisted medical students from UCSF to evaluate the clinic's volunteer health worker program and screening process with the goal of increasing volunteer diversity and sustaining volunteer involvement in the organization. Methods: We administered 10 in-person interviews and collected data from an additional 12 participants online using a standardized survey developed in collaboration with clinic staff and previous UCSF PRIME-US students. Five in-person interviews were conducted with Clinical Services Coordinators (CSCs) and five in-person interviews were conducted with Health Educators (HEs). Interviews were conducted at a local cafe and took approximately 20-45 minutes. Volunteers were recruited through emails sent by clinic staff. In-person interview participants were compensated with $20 Safeway gift cards for their time. Participants in the online survey were entered into a raffle to win one of two $20 Safeway gift cards. Results: Overall, there was very high level of satisfaction among volunteers, with similar levels of satisfaction among CSCs and HEs. Of the 22 total volunteers surveyed both in-person and online, 95% rated their satisfaction with the volunteer program as mostly satisfied or very satisfied. Eighty-two percent of volunteers surveyed felt their training was either totally adequate or mostly adequate. The most common training request was for improved training on the electronic resources. All volunteers felt competent in their role by the 6-month mark, with the majority feeling component by month 3. Roughly, half of respondents reported that they would be interested in a longer time commitment at the clinic. A minority of respondents identified significant challenges facing the health worker program, including a lack of diversity among the volunteer pool and concern about how an increased time commitment would disproportionately affect volunteers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Recommendations: Our results suggest that the Women's Community Clinic volunteer health worker program is highly successful and may benefit from minor changes in its recruitment and screening process to increase volunteer diversity. We recommend adding a question about experience working with diverse communities to the volunteer application. Current volunteers recognize the importance of the Western Addition Health Training program and desire more opportunities to engage with this program. We recommend engaging volunteers in the conversations about diversity that staff are already having through the creation of a working group. Consider making any increase to the volunteer commitment optional as an increased commitment may make the volunteer program less accessible to marginalized communities. One alternative to increasing the volunteer commitment would be to assign shifts that are more frequent in the first month in the role to decrease time to achieve competency in role.

PRIME Community Projects 2015-2016 Olivia Park, Jolene Kokroko Olivia and Jolene developed a project with one of PRIME's longstanding community partners, Youth Creating Change (YCC). YCC is a youth development program for high school students from vulnerable communities in San Francisco. The program focuses on engaging the youth in dialogue about the social determinates of health in their communities. The project goals were developed in collaboration with the youth participants. The PRIME-US student leaders facilitated a series of health related workshops on topics that the students identified as key areas of interest and concern. These workshops were highly interactive and involved reading assignments, small group discussion, and guest speakers. YCC students were asked to do preparatory work on each health topic; they researched the topic, reflected on their personal experience and understanding of the topic, and, then, shared with one another in group discussion and reflection. The final project was an art exhibit of photography, drawings, and T-shirts with silk-screened original designs at a professional art gallery in the Mission District, The Incline Gallery. The YCC students did a Photovoice project through which the YCC students utilized photography to explore health disparities in their own neighborhoods in San Francisco. They learned how to do T-shirt silk screening in partnership with another non-profit. Then, Olivia and Jolene mentored the YCC students in how to curate an art exhibit\u2014from mounting and displaying artwork, creating accompanying exhibit guides, and setting prices for their artwork.

The clients represent a diverse community of individuals, many of whom are homeless, uninsured, and/or living with complex health needs. This project is a pilot initiative designed to create a new robust communications and referral program between the Suitcase Clinic and Lifelong Medical Care, a community health center. The goal is to offer direct support to Suitcase Clinic clients wanting to access comprehensive and longitudinal primary care services. The medical students collaborated with undergraduate volunteers and Ameri-Corp members to offer clients of the Suitcase Clinic caseworkers to encourage making and keeping appointments at Lifelong. They are also conducting a needs assessment of clients to identify barriers to comprehensive and consistent access to primary care. Jolene Kokroko Jolene partnered with one of PRIME's community partners, Huckleberry Youth Wellness Academy (YWA).

Jolene brought the high student participants to UCSF to hear from a panel of medical students, participate in an anatomy lesson of the lungs and attend a campus tour. The goal was to expose them to UCSF and offer a glimpse into the medical student's educational experience. Adrienne Kennedy Adrienne also partnered with Huckleberry Youth Wellness Academy (YWA) to design a longitudinal tutoring program for high school students interested in health professions careers. Adrienne arranged for a group of medical students to tutor the high school students after school regularly throughout the school year in science, math and other topics of challenge for the students. Final year Capstone students: Each fall our final year Capstone students do community engaged projects with community partners in San Francisco who have identified a valuable project need that PRIME-US students could fulfill. Students are required to provide oral presentations and written reports to their community partners and to the PRIME-US program. The abstracts are listed below. (Full reports are available upon request.) Addressing Health Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Quality Improvement Partnership between Southeast Health UCSF School of Medicine, Program in Medical Education for the Urban Underserved Community partner: Dr. Keith Seidel, Medical Director, Southeast Health Center Project Abstract Background: The Southeast Health Center (SEHC) is a primary care clinic run by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), located within Bayview-Hunter's Point, one of the most isolated and underserved areas of San Francisco. Despite recent demographic shifts in San Francisco, SEHC continues to serve a low-income, majority African American patient population. Most SEHC patients have public health insurance; 20% of SEHC patients are homeless. Purpose: Within San Francisco as a whole, 79% of adults ages 50-75 have been properly screened for colorectal cancer (CRC); in contrast, only 52% of patients (and 48% of African American patients) were properly screened at SEHC over the past year. The current study was designed to investigate underlying causes of these low screening rates and propose interventions to address these disparities. Evaluation: This study involved two data collection methods: 1) a telephone survey of patients (n=40) who had received a FIT test within an 8 week period and had not yet returned the test for evaluation, and 2) a focus group discussion with medical assistants (MEAs) at SEHC. Survey results were analyzed quantitatively and the focus group discussion was analyzed qualitatively to identify key themes. Recommendations: This study's findings support a 3-pronged approach to address disparities in CRC screening at SEHC, including: 1) enhancing current outreach and follow up efforts, 2) piloting a \"CRC Awareness Month\" at SEHC, and 3) conducting further research and collaboration with key stakeholders to address downstream structural barriers affecting CRC screening. Strengthening the Volunteer Role within a Team Based Care Clinic PRIME-US Capstone Students: Ben Hayes, Nick Orozco, Kerri Rice Community Partner/Project Supervisor: Kemi Role, Director of Workforce and Outreach at Women's Community Clinic Project Abstract Since its opening Women's Community Clinic has used an innovative volunteer-based business model to provide affordable health care services to Bay Area women and girls. Expansion of the clinic to include primary care services and adoption of electronic health records has made the front desk volunteer role (CSC) more complex and demanding. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the current role of CSC's and make recommendations to improve upon this role given recent changes. 13 semi-structured interviews were conducted, 12 staff and 1 CSC, to illicit satisfaction with the current CSC role and training. Systematic thematic analysis was conducted to determine major themes across all interviews. Three main areas for improvement emerged, and included increased community building between CSC's and staff, providing means of longitudinal training and feedback for CSC's, and eliciting expectations of CSC's at the beginning of their commitment and meeting these expectations. Trauma-Informed Training for Tenderloin Safe Passage PRIME-US Tenderloin Safe Passage: Kate Robinson, Program Director Project Abstract For our PRIME capstone project, we worked with an organization in the Tenderloin called Safe Passage to create a trauma-informed curriculum for the staff and Corner Captains. This need arose from the prevalence of daily exposure to trauma that the Safe Passage staff and other members of the Tenderloin community have experienced and witnessed. Additionally, we updated a trauma resource guide to provide to Safe Passage for community residents needing additional support. In carrying out these projects, we constantly solicited feedback and made revisions based on input in order to best serve the organization. We faced a few challenges during our project. Most notable was the short timeframe that we were given to work with a new organization, but we faced this challenge by taking the time to get to know the organization through meetings, discussions, and debriefs, as well as observations of Corner Captains of the organization in the field, allowing us an opportunity to see and hear first-hand the role of the Corner Captains and the challenges they face. Our work on this project was successful due to a clear concrete discussion of our goals and the items we would produce, assistance from our PRIME director, and drawing upon our own experiences in trauma-related research. Our recommendations to Safe Passage include presentation of the Corner Captains' trauma-informed principles that they generated during the workshop to Safe Passage's leadership, training of the Corner Captains to teach the curriculum to community members, incorporating self-care into debriefing sessions, recruiting students and community members to improve the curriculum, and translating all materials into Spanish. Tenderloin Safe Passage: Senior Safety PRIME-US Community Partner/Project Supervisor: Kate Robinson, Program Director, Tenderloin Safe Passage There is a clear association between perceived safety, high neighborhood crime, and adverse health outcomes among senior populations. In no other community is this more apparent than in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, where nearly 6000 low-income seniors reside. Tenderloin Safe Passage (TSP) is a community-based, grassroots organization dedicated to making the Tenderloin neighborhood a safer place for children and seniors. In October 2015, TSP partnered with the UCSF PRIME-US medical students to develop a senior safety needs assessment, which will be used to determine which interventions are needed to improve senior's perceptions of safety in the Tenderloin. For the senior safety needs assessment, the main TSP goal is to answer: How do we improve senior's perceptions of safety in the Tenderloin? For the PRIME-US Capstone Project, a group of five PRIME-US medical school students worked together with TSP to address two major objectives: - To provide statistical support for a preliminary survey of senior safety needs that was conducted. - To create a new senior safety needs survey that is based on validated questions from the literature, is user-friendly for seniors taking the survey and for staff who will analyze survey results. New Latthivongskorn, Miguel Linares New and Miguel developed an evening seminar open to the entire UCSF community to share information about the experience of undocumented students and the effects of being undocumented on health and healthcare access. The evening presentations included members of a local immigrant rights advocacy program that shared current policy reform efforts, a UCSF researcher, a panel of current undocumented students and further policy updates from New. The goal was to inform future health care professionals on health and healthcare inequities for this underserved community and to educate them about the advocacy efforts taking place to promote health equity. Additionally, health professions students were educated about ways in which health care providers can participate in advocacy and policy. Yakira Teitel Yakira developed a project with La Clinica Martin Barro, a student run free clinic. The clinic's patients are primarily uninsured, day laborers, monolingual Spanish speaking, and immigrants. Student volunteers from San Francisco State University and UCSF School of Medicine care for the clients. The project used art as a medium to engage the clinic's participants and community members in discussions about health in their community. Yakira negotiated a site for a public mural. She led a process of dialogue and painting with volunteers and clinic participants to create a model community mural that tells the stories of Latino immigrants who live and work in San Francisco's Mission District. By telling their stories through imagery in a public space, the mural aims to shine a light on issues affecting Latino immigrants, including health disparities, while also celebrating triumphs, resilience and humanity. The mural can be seen on the side of the restaurant, La Palma: Mexicatessan, on Florida at 24th Street. PRIME MS1's Group Project: Fresno- Outreach Pipeline Program Each year our 1st year PRIME students participate in UCSF Fresno Latino Center for Medical Education and Research (LaCMER) Doctor's and Junior Doctors Academy annual pre-health conference.
