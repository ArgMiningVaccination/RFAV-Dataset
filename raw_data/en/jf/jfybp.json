Within DHS, the Family Services Administration (FSA) provides protection, intervention, and supportive services to meet the needs of vulnerable adults, youth and families experiencing or at risk of homelessness. C.1.2 In the District, more than 7,000 men, women, and families with children experience homelessness on any given night -- sleeping outside, in a shelter or in transitional housing. While the District as a whole continues to grow and prosper, we also face high levels of economic inequality. We have lost a significant portion of our affordable housing stock, rent prices have risen dramatically, and many families are finding it increasingly difficult to survive on wages that are not keeping pace with the cost of l iving. C.1.3 In response to the District's homeless crisis, the Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH) developed a strategic plan to guide the District's efforts. Homeward DC lays out a bold vision for ending homelessness based on local and national evidence of what is working.1 This comprehensive, data -driven plan provides concrete steps to make homelessness in the District rare, brief, and non- recurring by 2020. Mayor Bowser supported the plan and called for historic investments in proven strategie s - including homelessness prevention, affordable housing, permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing. C.1.4 Ending homelessness as we know it today does not mean no one will ever experience a housing crisis again. Changing economic realities, the unpredictabi lity of life, and unsafe or unwelcoming family environments may create situations w here residents are temporarily homeless. However, we can change how we respond to households in crisis. The District's plan lays out a roadmap for transformi ng our homeless ser vices system into an effective crisis response system by preventing housing loss wherever pos sible, quickly stabilizing and safely sheltering individuals that do become homeless, and quickly facilitating the connection back to permanent housing and community support networks. C.1.5 A major goal of the plan is to reduce the length of time households stay in shelter.2 The District has made meaningful progress towards reducing home lessness among families through 1 The complete plan can be accessed online at http://ich.dc.gov/page/homeward -dc-ichstrategic -plan- 2015 - 2020. 2 Homeward DC sets forth the goal that by 2020, any household experiencing housing loss will regain housing within an average of 60 days or less. Given current lengths of stay in shelter are much longer, the expectation for Provider s under the current solicitation is t o work towards reducing shelter stays through effective programming, prevention and diversion services, and linkage to community -based supports, with the goal of transition ing families to housing within 90 days or less. 24 successful prevention initiatives. However, average lengths of stay in shelter are still too long, and do not currently meet the targets in Homeward DC . The new STFH model presents an opportunity to provide service delivery in a small, service enriched setting that will support faster transitions to permanent housing. Provider s selected through this solicitation will be expected to implement effective programming consistent with housing first strategies designed with the goal to support families regain housing in 90 days or less. C.1.6 Creating smaller, safer places for families to stabilize and receive the supports they need during a housing crisis is essential to reforming our crisis response system. In the Fall of 2018, the District will be closing DC General Family Sh elter (\"DC General\"), a former hospital that has served as the District's largest family shelter for seven years. Each day, DC General houses approximately 250 families experiencing homelessness. But DC General is out of date, and its size, scale and current conditions create an environment ill -suited for providing effective programming and services to support families to transition back into permanent housing. C.1.7 Each Short Term Family Housing (STFH) site will accommodate no more than 50 families. They will be small, safe and clean with private rooms, and will give families a dignified place to stay until they get back to a place they can call home. Through this solicitation, DHS will select Provider s to operate programs at each STFH site. Each building has places for children of all ages to play and do homework. Buildings are equipped with age - appropriate outdoor and indoor recreational space, study rooms and computer labs, a health and wellness room for medical services, space for enrichment programming, and a dining room where meals will be provided daily. The STFH sites will also provide families with private living quarters with small refrigerators and access to other food storage and preparation spaces, as well as onsite laundry facilities. C.1.8 To help minimize the length of time families experience homelessness, the STFH sites will also include a variety of onsite services and connection to offsite res ources. Services available onsite will include assessment, linkage to shelter diversion services and emergency housing assistance programs (e.g., rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and targeted affordable housing), case management, 24- hour staf fing and security, housing navigation assistance, early childhood screening and liaison to schools, transportation, health care, child care, and financial and budget management counseling. C.1.9 Provider s will also provide and/or partner with other community -based organizations to offer additional services on site such as: health and wellness programs, mentoring and tutoring, and enrichment activities for children and parents. Connection to community -based supports is an important aspect of this s ervice model, as these supports may continue after a family exits emergency shelter, thus easing the family's transition into permanent housing. Provider s will therefore be responsible for connecting residents to offsite mainstream services that meet their needs and help them transition to permanent housing, including employment, training and education services (including linkages to the TANF Employment Program), child care, behavioral health, legal and public benefit supports, and primary health care. 25 C.1.10 As part of the plan to close DC General, the District has worked closely to engage community members at every step of the process, including through launching community Advisory Teams for each site composed of key stakeholders from both the government and surrounding community. These Advisory Teams are working with community residents to develop Good Neighbor Agreements (GNA) for each of the STFH sites. These GNAs will articulate mutual expectations of common courtesy, safety, and respect between t he Provider for each site and all persons living in the neighborhood (both those living in the STFH site and those in the vicinity). Provider s selected through this solicitation will take a leading role in continuing to partner with community stakeholders through participation on the Advisory Teams and working closely with DHS and the community to address any neighborhood concerns.
