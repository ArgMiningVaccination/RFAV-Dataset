The ACT Public Health Regulation 2000 (the Regulation) was developed to help control the spread of vaccine preventable and other communicable diseases in primary schools, preschools and child care centres. At the time of enrolment into child care, preschool or primary school, the Regulation requires parents to provide two copies of their child's immunisation history to the school or child care director. This information will help identify those children most vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases and will assist health authorities in protecting all children in the event of a vaccine preventable disease occurrence in a school, preschool or child care setting. If a situation occurs where a child in one of these settings has a vaccine preventable disease, the child care centre coordinator or teacher must be able to quickly access immunisation histories and determine who has not been immunised. If there is a case of a vaccine preventable disease, and your child has not been fully immunised for that disease, they may be excluded from school or child care for a period of time. What is an Immunisation Record? An immunisation history is a written record of the immunisations that your child has received and the date that they received them. Valid immunisation histories are either: a signed and dated Immunisation Record (known as the \"Blue Book\" in the ACT) an Immunisation History Statement provided by the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) You cannot provide an immunisation history that has been completed by yourself. If you are providing the original or transcribed immunisation history (other than an AIR history), it must be dated and signed by: a medical practitioner, or a registered nurse (e.g. Child Health Nurse, Practice Nurse), or a registered midwife, or an enrolled nurse, or a person authorised by the ACT Chief Health Officer.3 health.act.gov.au Where do I find my child's immunisation history? The Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) is a national register that records vaccinations given to people of all ages in Australia. You can obtain an AIR Immunisation History Statement for your child by calling 1800 653 809 or through your myGov account online. The original immunisation record is usually kept in the personal health record book (the \"Blue Book\"). These books are usually given to parents at the time of their child's birth. You should take your child's personal health record book with you to all immunisation appointments so that your child's immunisation history can be updated. What if my child's immunisation record is from interstate? Immunisation histories from other states or territories within Australia are also acceptable and may be given directly to the primary school, preschool or child care centre. The schedule and the brand of vaccine used may vary between states and territories. Please check with AIR to verify that your child's immunisations are up to date. What if my child's immunisation record is from overseas? Overseas immunisation schedules often differ from the Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) and your child may require extra vaccinations to be up to date with the Australian schedule. If your child was immunised overseas, you will need to have your child's overseas immunisation history transcribed onto the AIR. A medical practitioner, registered nurse, registered midwife, enrolled nurse, or a person authorised by the ACT Chief Health Officer may transcribe overseas immunisation histories.4 ACT Immunisation Requirements Once your child's overseas immunisation history has been transcribed, you can obtain an AIR Immunisation History Statement by calling AIR on 1800 653 809 or through your MyGov account online. A copy of your child's AIR Immunisation History Statement can then be provided to the primary school, preschool or child care centre. For more information about having your child's overseas immunisation record transcribed please speak to your doctor, practice nurse, child health nurse or call the Health Protection Service, ACT Immunisation Information Line on 5124 9800. What if I don't provide an immunisation history for my child? If you do not provide your child's immunisation history then your child will be recorded as being not fully immunised by the primary school, preschool or child care centre. If there is a case of a vaccine preventable disease at the school or child care centre, your child may be excluded from school or child care for a period of time or until the evidence of immunisation (in an approved form) is provided, or until the risk to your child has passed. Please call the ACT Immunisation Information Line on 5124 9800 for further information. Does this mean my child has to be immunised? No. Immunisation is not compulsory. However, if there is a case of a vaccine preventable disease at the school or child care centre, and your child has not been fully immunised for that disease, they may be excluded for a period of time. If your child has a medical condition which prevents them from being immunised, your doctor will need to complete an 'AIR Immunisation Medical Exemption' form and submit it to the AIR. The form can be obtained by calling the AIR on 1800 653 809 or downloaded from the AIR website at: www.humanservices.gov.au/health-professionals/forms/im011 . You will need to provide a letter stating your child has a medical exemption to the school or child care centre.5 health.act.gov.au Is homeopathic \"immunisation\" recognised? No. Homeopathic \"immunisation\" has not been shown to work as an alternative to conventional immunisation in preventing vaccine preventable diseases. Only conventional immunisation produces measurable immune responses against vaccine preventable diseases. The National Health and Medical Research Council consider a homeopathically \"immunised\" child to be not immunised. Homeopathic substances may be used in conjunction with conventional immunisation if desired, but not as an alternative. Where can I go to have my child immunised? Childhood immunisations can be administered in general practice by your doctor or practice nurse. Please phone your practice to make an appointment. The Women, Youth & Children - Community Health Programs run Maternal and Child Health (MACH) immunisation clinics for children under six years of age. To make an appointment at a MACH clinic, call the Community Health Intake (CHI) line on 5124 9977. What immunisations should my child have received? To be fully immunised for primary school, preschool or child care your child needs to have received all vaccines recommended for their age as part of the NIP. The vaccinations recommended on the NIP at the time of printing this booklet are listed in Table 1. As there are changes made to the NIP from time to time, you are encouraged to speak with your immunisation provider, call the ACT Immunisation Information Line on 5124 9800 or visit health.act.gov.au/our-services/immunisation for the most up to date information about the recommended schedule.6 ACT Immunisation Requirements TABLE 1.

If your child is not fully immunised and has been in contact with someone with a vaccine preventable disease outside of the school or child care community they may need to be excluded from school or child care for a period of time. You should seek medical advice and inform the school principal or child care centre coordinator that your child has come into contact with someone with a vaccine preventable or infectious disease. What should I do if my child has been diagnosed with a vaccine preventable or infectious disease? If your child has been diagnosed with a vaccine preventable or infectious disease they may need to be excluded from school or child care for a period of time regardless of whether they are immunised or not. You must inform the school principal or child care coordinator as soon as possible so the school can take any necessary action to protect other children. Personal hygiene measures such as hand washing, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, covering weeping sores, not sharing food or drinks and not attending school when ill or suffering from diarrhoea are important means of limiting the transmission of a number of common infectious conditions. For more information about vaccine preventable or infectious diseases and exclusion periods please see Table 3 of this booklet or contact the Health Protection Service Communicable Disease Control Surveillance Unit on 5124 9213. The Regulation requires children with the following conditions or children who have been in contact with the following conditions, to be excluded from child care, preschool or primary school for the periods specified in Table 3.9 health.act.gov.au TABLE 3.
