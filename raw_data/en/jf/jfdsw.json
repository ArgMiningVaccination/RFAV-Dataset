BACKGROUND On October 4, 2021, the Division issued an Administrative Regulation (CIA.AR COVID -19 Vaccinations), which requires employees, contractors, on -site partners and volunteers in Division buildings to either be fully vaccinated unless they have an exemption on the basis of a protected legal g round or participate in regular rapid testing to verify that they are COVID -19 negative. The administrative regulation does not apply to Trustees, as they are elected officials and not Division employees, contractors, on -site partners or volunteers. At the November 30, 2021, public Board meeting, the Board passed a motion to adopt a COVID -19 vaccinatio n policy for Trustees based on the Division's Administrative Regulation CIA.AR COVID -19 Vaccinations. On December 14, 2021, a first draft of Board Policy CI.BP COVID -19 Vaccination Policy for Trustees was presented to Caucus for feedback. Following recent changes to provincial testing availability and requirements the draft Board Policy CI.BP COVID -19 Vaccination Policy for Trustees went to Caucus on January 18, 2022, for further discussion. The decision to introduce this policy is based on current health advice from public health authorities and medical experts. Medical professionals and public health authorities continue to remind Albertans that being fully vaccinated is the best way to protect our families, communities, ourselves and the health care system. Scientific evidence clearly supports the efficacy and safety of COVID -19 vaccinations. Data from the World Health Organization, Health Canada and Alberta Health Services supports the need for high levels of immunization as a key factor in mitigating t he risk of COVID -19. 2 Recommendation Report RELATED FACTS Board Policy CI.BP COVID -19 Vaccination Policy for Trustees was developed with input from the Director, Board and Superintendent Relations, Strategic Division Supports, General Counsel and Human Resources.

The purpose of the policy is to support safe learning and working environments by outlinin g expectations to ensure Trustees are vaccinated or participating in rapid testing. The policy aims to appropriately balance individual and collective rights and responsibilities of the Board. In addition, the policy supports and aligns with the Board's on going direction to ensure safety in the context of COVID -19. More detailed guidance on protocols and processes to implement the policy are provided through additions to the Trustees' Handbook. Additions to the Trustees' Handbook include details on declarat ion of vaccination status, exemption requests, testing and documentation requirements and monitoring and oversight.
