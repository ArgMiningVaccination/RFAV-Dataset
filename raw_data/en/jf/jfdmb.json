However, there is sparse research on the reasons for such differences. This paper investigates the reasons for geographical differences in CAM use bycomparing CAM users from four geographical areas (major cities, inner regional, outer region, rural/remote) acrossa range of health status, healthcare satisfaction, neighbourhood and community factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,427 participants from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 's Health (ALSWH) conducted in 2009. Results: The average total cost of consultations with CAM practitioners was $416 per annum and was highest for women in the major cities, declining with increasing distance from capital cities/remoteness (p < 0.001). The average total cost of self-prescribed CAM was $349 per annum, but this did not significantly differ across geographical areas. The increased use of CAM in rural and remote areas appears to be influenced by poorer access to conventional medical care (p < 0.05) and a greater sense of community (p < 0.05) amongst these rural andremote residents. In contrast to the findings of previous research this study found that health status was notassociated with the differences in CAM use between urban and non-urban areas. Conclusion: It appears that a number of factors influence the different levels of CAM use across the urban/non- urban divide. Further research is needed to help tease out and understand these factors. Such research will help support health care policy and practice with regards to this topic. Background Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is an umbrella term that refers to a broad group of healthcare systems, therapeutic practices and products (includingacupuncture, chiropractic, naturopathy, herbal medicine and yoga) that are not traditionally associated with the conventional medical profession [1]. Large scale surveyssuggest that CAM is increasing in popularity in NorthAmerica, Australia and Europe in recent years [2-5] andsuch trends have generated much interest and debateamong health professionals and policy-makers [6].In recent years, an evidence-base that describes and evaluates CAM use has gradually emerged [7]. However,many of the available studies have focused on the use ofCAM in metropolitan settings or amongst general popu-lations [e.g. 3]. Although there is a growing interest in a geographical-perspective in CAM research focusing upon the dynamics of wellbeing, health practices and spatiallocations [7-9], there is a lack of research examiningCAM use in rural areas or the characteristics of CAMusers across urban and non-urban residence [10]. Thisomission is perplexing as previous studies indicate thatthe prevalence of CAM use in rural and remote regionsis higher than in urban areas [5,11-18]. One explanation put forward to account for differences in CAM use across the urban/non-urban divide has been * Correspondence: jon.adams@uts.edu.au 1Faculty of Nursing Midwifery and Health, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleAdams et al .BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:85 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/85 \u00a9 2011 Adams et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Meanwhile, some work appears to high-light the critical role of a strong sense of neighbourhood and the strength of community network referral as well as localised beliefs regarding folk remedies in accountingfor higher CAM consumption rates in non-urban areas[13,17,27-30]. In addition, t here is evidence that women living in rural areas have a higher incidence of chronicillness and lower self-rated health status than womenliving in metropolitan areas [4,5,11,31-33]. Unfortunately, beyond these initial commentaries and early studies we still have little data to help explain differ-ences in urban and non-urban CAM use. In response,this paper reports the findings of a survey comparing thecharacteristics of female CAM users living in urban andnon-urban settings in Australia. The survey provides thefirst large-scale empirical comparison of a national sam-ple of CAM users across rural and urban residence.Based on the study findings, the paper seeks to account for differences in urban/non-urban CAM use and address the gap in our understanding of CAM consumptionacross geographical areas. Methods Sample This research was a sub-study of the Australian Longi-tudinal Survey of Women' sH e a l t h( A L S W H ) .T h e ALSWH was designed to investigate multiple factorsaffecting the health and well being of women over a 20-year period. Relevant ethical approval was gained fromthe Human Ethics Committee at the University ofQueensland and University o f Newcastle, Australia. Women in three age groups were randomly selectedfrom the national Medicare database [34] and invited bymail to participate. The focus of this study is women from the 1946-51 cohort aged 45-50 when the study started in 1996. At survey 1, 14,779 consented to parti-cipate and the respondents were shown to be broadlyrepresentative of the national population of women inthe target age group, with some overrepresentation ofwomen with higher levels of education and underrepre-sentation of women who have English as a second lan-guage [35]. For this sub-study, 2,120 women who had indicated in survey 5 (2007) that they consulted a CAM practitioner were mailed a questionnaire, of thesewomen 1,800 (85%) returned completed questionnaires.From the 1,800 respondents, 1,427 women indicatedthat they still consult a CAM practitioner and it is thesewomen that were included in the analyses for the cur-rent study.Area of Residence The address of usual residence at each survey for eachwoman in the ALSWH has been geo-coded and allocatedan ARIA+ remoteness score according to the AustralianStandard Geographical Classification (ASGC) released in2001 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics [36]. The ASGC classification categorises areas of residence regional ','remote ' and 'very remote 'based on road distance from a locality to the closest service centre. The participants of this study were categorised into 4 areas of residence: major cities (ARIA+ score: regional (>0.20-2.40), categories of'remote 'and 'very remote 'were combined in the analysis as the numbers of participants from these two areas weresmall. The sample consisted of 429 women from major cities, 437 women from inner regional areas, 470 women from outer regional areas, and 91 women from remote orvery remote areas. Measures of health status Women were asked how often they had sought help for alist of 24 symptoms (such as back pain, severe tiredness,depression, anxiety) in the previous twelve months. Women were also asked whether they had been diagnosedwith any of 21 chronic medical conditions (such as dia-betes, arthritis, heart disease, hypertension, breast cancer).The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Quality of Life questionnairewas used to produce a measure of health status and qualityof life [37]. Results of the SF-36 were reported in eightsubscales [37]. The scores were standardised to a mean of50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores repre- senting better health [38]. Use of CAM The women were asked if they had consulted with a range of CAM practitioners or used a range of self-prescribedCAM for their own health in the previous 12 months. Thelist of CAM practitioners incl uded: spiritual health therapist, traditional Chinese medicine thera-pist, aromatherapist, Ayurveda practitioner, music thera-pist. The list of self-presc ribed CAM included: meditation/yoga, aro-matherapy oils, Chinese medicine, prayer/spiritual healing.The women were also asked about the sources they used(e.g. family/relatives, friends/colleagues, internet) to obtain information regarding the CAM they consumed. The women were asked whether they inform their doctor orpharmacist before/after using CAM. They were also askedto estimate the total cost of their consultation(s) withAdams et al .BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:85 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/85Page 2 of 8CAM practitioner(s) and if applicable, the total cost of self-prescribed CAM used during the previous 12 months. Neighbourhood safety and satisfaction Validated questions regarding neighbourhood safety andneighbourhood satisfaction come from the Healthy Com- munities Survey in Tasmania [39]. The questions asked about feelings concerning neighbours and neighbourhood,to assess the impact of neighbourhood connectedness onhealth and well being. Our questionnaire duplicated thoseof the Tasmanian study, with minor differences in wordingof two items and omission of the response category of 'not applicable '. Neighbourhood connectedness was assessed using 13 items with higher scores reflecting greater satis- faction and greater safety [for more detail see 40]. Sense of community Questions regarding sense of community came from the Sense of Community Index 2 (SCI-2) [41] which is a mod-ified version of the widely used Sense of CommunityIndex in the social sciences [42]. The SCI-2 contains 25 items, where a higher total score reflects a greater sense of community. Previous application of SCI-2 has shown this measure to be reliable [41]. Rating of health care providers/services The women were asked to rate their level of satisfactionwith various aspects of conventional health care providers(such as access to a female GP, hours when a GP is avail-able, outcomes of medical care) and CAM providers (such as availability of CAM practitioners, ease of seeing CAM practitioner of one 's choice). Each aspect was rated via a 5 point Likert scale, where 1 = excellent and 5 = poor.The women were also asked if they agreed with a series ofstatements regarding CAM (e.g. CAM is more naturalthan conventional medicine, CAM is a better preventivemeasure than conventional medicine). Each statement wasrated via a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree. Statistical analyses Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and, when appropri- ate, the Bonferroni-Dunn t-test for multiple comparisons, were used to compare the area of residence variableagainst continuous variables. Chi-square tests and, whenappropriate, pairwise post-hoc chi-square tests with Bon- ferroni adjustment, were used to compare the area of resi- dence variable against categorical variables. All analyseswere conducted using the statistical software SAS 9.1. Results Of the 1,427 women who consulted a CAM practitionerin the previous 12 months, 43.6% consulted one CAMpractitioner, 29.8% consul ted two CAM practitioners,13.5% consulted three CAM practitioners, and 13.1%consulted four or more different CAM practitioners. Themost common CAM practitioners consulted were mas-sage therapists (n = 912; 63.9%), 215; 15.1%). (90.5%) women who used a self-pre- scribed CAM in the previous 12 months. Specifically, 32.7% used one form of self-prescribed CAM, 26.9% usedtwo different forms of self-prescribed CAM, 16.5% usedthree different forms of self-prescribed CAM, and 14.4%used four or more different forms of self-prescribed CAM.The most common self-prescribed CAMs used were vita- prayer/spiritual 341; 23.9%), 334;23.4%), Chinese medicine (n = 101; 7.1%). Table 1 shows a comparison of area of residence against measures of CAM use, neighbourhood satisfaction andsafety, sense of community, and health status. The averagenumber of consultations with practitioners from different CAM modalities was highest in major cities and declined with increasing levels of rurality. However, this differencewas not statistically significant. The average total cost ofconsultations with CAM practitioners was $416 perannum and was highest for women in major cities, declin-ing with increasing levels of rurality (p < 0.001). The aver-age number of different self-prescribed CAM used by thewomen did not differ between areas of residence and nor did the average total cost of self-prescribed CAM ($349 per annum). There were no statistically significant differences between areas of residenc e and the average number of symptoms or diagnoses. In terms of SF-36 quality of lifemeasures (data not shown), only one of the eight dimen-sions, physical functioning, was statistically different acrossthe areas of residence (p < 0.001). That is, women in major cities had better physical functioning than women in rural areas, particularly women from outer regional areas. For these CAM users, there was a statistically significant difference in the mean valu es for neighbourhood safety (p < 0.005) with women from major cities feeling saferthan women from inner regional areas, outer regionalareas and remote or very remote areas. There were alsostatistically significant dif ferences between area of resi- dence and sense of community (p < 0.0001). Specifically,in comparison to women in inner regional areas, outerregional areas and remote or very remote areas, women inmajor cities had a poorer total sense of community (p <0.05). There was no significant difference between areas ofresidence and neighbourhood satisfaction. Comparisons of area of resid ence against information sources for CAM, information sharing about CAM use,Adams et al .BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:85 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/85Page 3 of 8attitudes towards CAM, and satisfaction with health care are provided in Table 2. There is a statistically significantassociation between the use of family or relatives as aninformation source for CAM and area of residence (p < 0.005). Specifically, a greater percentage of women from remote or very remote areas use family or relatives as aninformation source for CAM compared to women fromouter regional areas (p < 0.05). Similarly, a greater percen-tage of women from major cities use family or relatives asan information source for CAM compared to womenfrom outer regional areas (p < 0.05). As shown in Table 2, obtaining information about CAM from family and relatives or from friends and colleagueswas more common among those women living in citiesand remote areas than women living in regional areas (p <0.05). Obtaining CAM information from the internet orfrom a doctor was most common among women living inmajor cities (p < 0.05). Obtaining information from a massmedia source was most common among women living inremote areas (p < 0.05). There were no significant differ- ences by area for obtaining in formation from partners, books or magazines, pharmacists, allied or CAM practitioners. Women from remote or very remote areas were the least likely to report satisfaction with access to servicesand to some aspects of the qual ity of those services (i.e.hours of GP availability, number of GPs available, choiceof GP & delay in seeing a GP, amount of informationsharing with GP) (Table 2). Overall, satisfaction withaccess to medical practitioners and with quality of service was highest among women from major cities. There were no differences by geographical area in regards to satisfac-tion with the quality of GP care provided, the amount oftime spent in consultation with a GP, GP technical skills,or the outcomes of medical care. Moving across the geographical spectrum from urban to remote residence, the level of availability, access toCAM practitioners and information about CAM all appear to decrease (Table 2). Women from major cities were significantly more likely to report availability ofCAM services, ease of seeing a CAM practitioner of theirchoice and access to information about CAM comparedto women from all other areas. Less than half of thewomen living in remote areas and around half of thoseliving in regional areas reported satisfactory access toCAM services, compared with 70-75% of those living in major cities who reported such satisfactory access. Discussion This is the first large-scale study to compare a national sample of CAM users across urban and non-urban resi-dence in Australia.

Although the interpreta-tion of results is limited by the fact that the health careutilisation data is self-reported by the participants andopen to recall bias or errors, such a limitation is by faroutstripped by the insight gained through collecting and analysing a large, nationally-representative sample of CAM users. Specifically, the findings that a substantialpercentage of participants consulted with more than onetype of CAM practitioner (56%) and used more than oneform of self-prescribed CAM (67%) are consistent with theresults of previous studies on the general CAM population[2,3]. These findings confirm that CAM consumption hasbecome a mainstream health care activity in Australia asin other Western countries [7]. As there is a lack of empirical testing of accounts for higher CAM use in rural areas, this study provides aunique opportunity to creat e an evidence base for asses- sing the adequacy of proposed explanations (the higherincidence of chronic illness and lower self-rated healthstatus among women living in rural areas, poor access/low satisfaction with conventional health services in non-urban regions, and a stronger sense of neighbourhoodand the strength of community network referral inTable 2 Comparisons of area of residence against information sources for alternative medicine, information sharing about alternative medicine use, and satisfaction with health care Characteristic Major Cities Inner Regional Outer Regional Remote/Very Remote p-value (n = 429) (n = 437) (n = 470) (n = 91) %% % % Information source for alternative medicine Family/relatives (% yes)BF39 34 30 45 0.0044 Partner (% yes) 10 10 12 16 0.2131 Friends/colleagues (% yes)AB47 39 37 45 0.0207 Internet (% yes)A11 5 8 8 0.0255 Book or magazine (% yes) 29 27 30 33 0.5665 Mass media (% yes)AEF14 9 10 20 0.0071 Doctor (% yes)AB33 26 23 25 0.0047 Pharmacist (% yes) 13 14 14 13 0.9603 Allied health worker (% yes) 5 3 5 7 0.4137 CAM health practitioner (% yes) 25 29 25 20 0.1905 Satisfaction with health care(% good/very good/excellent)Access to specialists ABCDE91 83 69 60 <0.0001 Access to a GP who bulk billsAC57 46 51 44 0.0074 Access to a female GPABC76 66 62 59 <0.0001 Hours when GP is availableBC72 66 60 58 0.0023 Number of GPs you have to choose fromABCDEF79 67 59 42 <0.0001 Ease of seeing the GP of your choiceABCD70 60 52 49 <0.0001 How long you wait to get a GP appointmentABC69 53 49 47 <0.0001 Quality of care provided by your GP 91 92 89 86 0.1478 Amount of time for a GP consultation 80 77 74 73 0.1209 Amount of information sharing by GPBCDE83 83 76 69 0.0005 The outcomes of your medical care 87 85 82 80 0.1553 The technical skills of your GP 92 94 88 90 0.0506 Availability of CAM practitioners in your communityABCDEF79 71 56 38 <0.0001 Ease of seeing the CAM practitioner of choiceBCDEF75 69 53 42 <0.0001 Access to information about CAMBCDE70 64 51 44 <0.0001 Astatistically significant difference between major cities and inner regional (p < 0.05).

In contrast to previous research findings illustrating an association between poor health and CAM use [4,5,11,31],this study found no significant differences in the healthstatus of CAM users across geographical regions. This result casts some doubt on the role of health status as an influence on women 's CAM use across the urban/non- urban divide. However, the association between health sta-tus and geographical CAM use is a complex issue as thereis evidence that the association between poor health andincreased CAM use may vary depending on the frequencyand length of CAM consumption [43]. It is recommendedthat further studies be conducted to explore this issue in more depth. The study findings provide evidence of a link between access to conventional heal th care and the adoption of CAM, with poor access to such health services predicting higher CAM use in non-urban regions. In particular, thestudy identifies significant differences between urban andnon-urban CAM users in terms of their satisfaction withaccess to specialists, hospitals, after-hours care, female GPs or bulk billing GPs. The results also suggest a decrease in satisfaction with access to all these servicesand practitioner types with increasing levels of remoteness.Together these findings provide support to the claim thata lack of access to and/or patient dissatisfaction with con-ventional health practitioners play an important role inaccounting for the higher use of CAM in rural or remoteareas [19-23]. However, it is important to note that the level of satisfaction with access to CAM practitioners was also poorer in non-urban regions. Cleary, further researchis required to examine access and satisfaction with healthcare across regions. If a link does exist between CAM useand lack of access to affordable, quality conventionalhealth care, then CAM may constitute a health care safetynet for non-urban patients that have hitherto escaped thefocus of providers and policymakers. An understanding of CAM use in these settings may provide valuable insight for planning and improving the coordination of care andcollaborations between existing resources in non-urbanhealth care systems [10,24,25]. The results of this survey also shed further light on the role of a sense of neighbourhood and community net-work in shaping CAM consumption trends across theurban/non-urban divide. The findings indicate that although the participating CAM users in major cities feel safer in their neighbourhood, they also have a poorersense of community than their counterparts living inregional and remote areas. Having a stronger sense ofneighbourhood implies that people living in non-urbanregions have closer personal relationships and are morelikely to share experiences and provide informationamong each other [44-46]. This falls in line with ourfinding that women from remote and very remote areasrely heavily on family, relatives and the mass media assources of CAM information and provides further sup-port to the claim that a stronger sense of neighbourhoodand social connectedness helps facilitate or proliferatethe use of CAM in rural regions. Our results confirm previous research findings suggesting that geographical factors influence how people acquire and receive infor-mation about CAM [47,48]. Further in-depth qualitativeresearch is needed to examine the nature of CAM infor-mation seeking and sharing as well as communitynetwork referral systems in rural locations [13,17,27-29,49,50]. The study found no significant difference in the average number of CAM practitioner consultations or any differ-ence in the consumption of self-prescribed CAM acrossresidence (urban, rural and remote). However, the resultsreveal that the amount users spend on CAM consulta-tions does decline with increasing levels of rurality. Onepossible explanation for this difference is the variationsin consultation fees across urban/non-urban regions (with practitioners chargi ng less in non-urban areas). Ultimately, this expense issue requires further researchalong the lines of economic analysis of CAM practitionerfees/patterns of practice, and qualitative research examin-ing the intricacies of women 's experiences, perceptions and motivations for CAM consumption. Conclusions This study is the first large-scale research undertaken to compare CAM users across urban and non-urban resi- dence in Australia. In addition to improving our under-standing of CAM consumption across geographical areas,the study findings also help identify the factors that influ-ence the different levels of CAM use across the urban/non-urban divide. When considered as a whole, the study findings suggest a need to investigate further possible influences beyond user attributes or values to account for differences in the use of CAM across urban/non-urban residence. Thisincludes an examination of the influences of informalcommunity networks, local cultural beliefs and closercommunity ties on the use and knowledge of CAM.Further research is needed to help tease out and under-stand these aspects of CAM consumption and the find-ings from such research will help support health care policy and practice with regards to this topic.
