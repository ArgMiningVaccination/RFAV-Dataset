But considering most people in the U.S. don't eat enough nutrient-rich produce each day, multivitamins can assist in scoring more essential vitamins and minerals, said [Julie Garden-Robinson, Ph.D., RD](https://www.ndsu.edu/hnes/faculty_and_staff/julie_garden_robinson/), to Insider. While women have [more specific nutritional needs](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-womens-multivitamins) \u2014 like more iron when they're menstruating \u2014 men's vitamin and mineral needs don't fluctuate much aside from age, and even then, just barely, [C. Michael White, PharmD](https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/), told Insider. [Garden-Robinson](https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/publications/food-nutrition/do-you-need-a-dietary-supplement) added that although you'll find men's vitamins targeted at \"over 50\" multivitamins have the DV necessary for any man at any age, which is why we only have three categories in this guide. But finding a clean multivitamin with an accurate label and complete nutritional profile isn't always easy. Multivitamins aren't regulated by the FDA \u2014 meaning no governing body confirms label accuracy or safety \u2014 so it's hard to know which are pure and effective. Below are the three best currently available based on research and insight from medical experts about how to target an array of different nutritional needs. You'll also find more detail on [who should take a multivitamin](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-mens-multivitamins#who-should-consider-a-multivitamin-4), [what kind of nutrients are important](https://www.insider.com/#what-to-look-for-and-other-faqs-6), and [other FAQs](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-mens-multivitamins/#what-to-look-for-and-other-faqs-6), at the bottom of this guide.

McKnight, MD](https://health.tamu.edu/experts/jason-mcknight.html), a family medicine physician and clinical assistant professor at Texas A&M College of Medicine, confirmed each vitamin is still within acceptable DV ranges.

White said this is a distinction made that ensures what's on the label is contained in the supplement. Pros: Vegan, subscription model with free shipping for easy refills, free of gluten and major allergens, no artificial colorants or synthetic fillers, good for brain and heart health, infused with mint for freshness, USP-verified Cons: Not found in stores, not yet lab tested Because people who follow a vegan diet don't eat animal products, they have different supplementation needs. A 2016 [study](https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2488034) in the Journal of Osteopathic Medicine found it was common for vegans to be deficient in vitamin B12, calcium, iron, vitamin D, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids.

Its mission is to \"bring foundational health into focus,\" with its men's supplement specifically formulated to boost brain and heart health and promote normal immune and muscle function. Aside from being completely vegan, the capsules are void of gluten and allergens. Ritual operates with a subscription model that sends a new bottle to your door each month. [Ritual](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_011119_best-multivitamins-for-men-20&h=be965ac44f44503e499826990f505b4c458b33aa59430ac413bf6b763ef8431d&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f420b6&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fbest-mens-multivitamins&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fritual.com%2Fproducts%2Fessential-multivitamin-for-men&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) was not yet tested by Consumer Labs, but it is [USP-verified](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_011119_best-multivitamins-for-men-20&h=715ac3d7fbbd4198810a59be052113a1d07d714636921b395b405791be72558a&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f420b6&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fbest-mens-multivitamins&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fritual.com%2Farticles%2Fis-ritual-usp-verified&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false). This confirms it contains exactly what it lists on the label, including safe nutrient levels, no harmful substances like heavy metals and pesticides, and is suitable to be broken down and digested. People who follow a strict diet, like vegans and vegetarians, should check nutrient levels and potential deficiencies with their doctor. Likewise, people who are underweight, elderly, who don't get enough sun exposure, or who have a [chronic medical condition](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm) (like heart disease, certain cancers, diabetics, autoimmune disorders, and individuals who had gastric bypass surgery) should consider taking a multivitamin, said [Uma Naidoo](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18123/Umadevi-Naidoo), MD, director of Nutritional & Lifestyle Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Most men over 50 years [of age] do not need supplements to maintain good health \u2014 only those with underlying issues with their diet, absorption of nutrients, or underlying diseases,\" White offered. Moreover, Garden-Robinson notes there can be risks with over-supplementation. She and Dr. Naidoo said taking too much vitamin A may lead to liver damage, while excess calcium may increase the risk for urinary stone formation. An abundance of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and nausea, too.
