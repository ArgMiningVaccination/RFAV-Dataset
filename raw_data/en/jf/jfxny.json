This integrated system of care uses a range of therapies including art, music, eurythmy (movement therapy), massage and counselling as well as anthroposophic and allopathic medicines. Rigorous external evaluation of this system has started with a recently published study.1 Five of the seven centres participating in the study are NHS general practices and the other two receive referrals from primary and secondary care. The study is qualitative in design and aims to systematically characterise the methods, organisation delivery and impact on patients of anthroposophic medicine. The study captured patient and practitioner experiences of wholeness and healing as well as those of symptoms and disease. It provides a context in which quantitative methods that are appropriately designed and targeted can now be applied. Whilst we applaud the dedication of a whole issue of the BMJ to integrated medicine, in the rush to integrate let us avoid methodological traps that reduce holistic approaches to human caring to a bag of tools for orthodox medicine.
