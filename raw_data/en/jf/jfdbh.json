ISBN: 978-0-473-19867 -1 2 Foreword The health needs of our communities are changing and consequently the capacity and capability of healthcare teams also needs to change. One of the key components for improving health is the concept of self-management, particularly for the prevention and optimal management of l ong-term conditions. While well developed in some pockets or organisations across the country, overall knowledge, unde rstanding and uptake of self -management programmes by both service users and health care practitioners remains low with minimal adoption across the broader health system. Development of the toolkit One of the recurring re quests from participants at a se ries of regional Self -Management Master Classes in June 2009 sponsored by New Zealand's Ministry of Health , and workshops since is for a self-management toolkit. Health practitioners want a practical guide and resource to help them apply self -management principles within their clinical work. The Auckland District Health Board sponsored this project and worked with Health Navigator NZ to develop a toolkit . While some of the programmes listed will only be available for the local Auckland population, we hope most of the resources and toolkit will be applicable to health providers and teams throughout New Zealand. The methodology included: A limited literature review to identify key themes from the literature with regard to implementing self - management with in primary care Identifying relevant toolkits from other countries, regions and disciplines Establish ment of a review group to guide project planning, toolkit development and content An environmental scan to identify existing self -care programmes, tools and resources within local communities, regionally and nationally. Contacting organisations and services to supply programme information Reviewing and analysing identified programmes for their quality, self -management basis, accessibility and appropriaten ess for high needs populations Consultation with a range of stakeholders and experts Wide sector input through design and analysis of an online survey to over one hundred clinicians across the country - including some people who are competent self -manager s of long term conditions . On-going review and revision of serial drafts This toolkit provides practical tools, resources, programme information and examples to help teams apply evidence and knowledge -based approaches to self -management support. Over ti me, it is hoped this toolkit can be localised for different regions of the country as well as updated, revised and refined to become an essential guide to self -management support for healthcare teams throughout New Zealand. This is a work in progress and we welcome your comments and sugges tions for continued improvement and refinement of this toolkit. Through resources and training such as this, the Health Navigator Charitable Trust hopes to contribute to Shared knowledge - shared responsibility - shared care.

Key PrinciplesKey principles for improving chronic care including : Chronic Care Model, self -management support and health literacy Resources & ProgrammesLearn about resources & programmes: Generic & condition specific self -management programmes & resources Issue -specific resources for patients and wh nau ToolsPractical tools, skills and approaches to: Improve communication & support behaviour change Implement self -management in your practice 8 SECTION 1: KEY PRINCIPLES 9 Chapter 1 : Background - Context, Key Principles and Concepts A brief guide to drivers for health system reform, and key principles and concepts for self-management and self -management support 1 Background 2 The Chronic Care Model 3 Person centred care and self -management 4 Self-management support 5 Health literacy 6 Shared decision making 7 Cultural competence \u00a9 Reflection Graphics 1 10 1.1: Background Health challenge of the 21st century Accordingly to the World Health Organisation, epidemiological evidence has overwhelmingly identified long -term conditions as the health challenge of the 21st century. Within New Zealand, long - term conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory conditions, cancer, arthritis and mental health conditions are a major contributor to persisting health disparities with Ma ori and Pacific peoples experiencing significant premature morbidity and mortality for all these conditions . Long -term conditions1 account for: 91% of all deaths in New Zealand1 (Table below) 70-78% of all healthcare spending. 11 Global Call to Action Such is the challenge of long -term conditions (also known as non-communicable diseases or chronic disease ) that the United Nations held a health summit in September 2011. This is only the 2nd United Nations summit in history to focus on global health (the first was on HIV/AIDs). Dr. Margaret Chan, Director - General of WHO, said medical professionals had long been aware of the \"ominous\" trend of non -communicable diseases that encircled the globe. \"We plead for lifestyle changes and strict tobacco legislations,\" she said. Calling non-communicable diseases \"a slow -motion disaster,\" she declared : \"These are the d iseases that break the bank\". The impact of long -term conditions is now of major global significance and there is an urgent need for cost - effective and evidence -based prevention, self -management and treatment strategies. The alarming picture of pervasi ve unhealthy lifestyle changes of whole populations is of great concern because of the predictable adverse impact on the health of communities and countries. This was highlighted by the World Health Organisation in their 2002 World Health Report: Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life, but like most countries, health promotion and public health advertising performs poorly and has low expenditure compared to the food, beverage and entertainment industries. Growing Burden of Long -Term Conditions Over 6 out of 10 adults (66%) and 1 in 3 children having or having had a long -term condition diagnosed by a doctor as expected to last 6 months or more.1 Diabetes is estimated to cause between 1200 - 1600 deaths per year, many of these premature especially in Mori and Pacific peoples. Many of these conditions have common risk factors including reliance on processed foods with excessive salt, fat and sugar , physical inactivity, smoking and excessive alcohol intake . The proportion of the population aged 65 years or over is expected to double within the next 50 years and the elderly have high rates of comorbidity and disability. The rates of disability within our com munity are high at 25% of 45 -64 year olds, and more than 50% of people aged 65 years and over. 1 Ministry of Health. 2008. A Portrait of Health. Key Results of the 2006/7 New Zealand Health Survey. Wellington. Four Common Risk Factors: 1.Unhealthy diet 2.Physical inactivity 3.Smoking 4.Excessive alcohol \"These are the diseases that break the bank\". Dr Margaret Chan, Director -General of World Health Organisation 12 1.2 The Chronic Care Model To help address these elements, multiple models and frameworks for improving chronic care have arisen. One useful and evidence -based model is the Chronic Care Model developed by Wagner and colleagues in the 1990s. This model identifies the essential elemen ts of a health care system that encourage high -quality chronic disease care. These elements or pillars are: 1. the community, 2. the health system, 3. self-management support, 4. delivery system design, 5. decision support and 6. clinical information systems. Under each pillar , a range of evidence - based change concepts can be chosen to guide quality improvement work. Over time, organisations effectively addressing the elements of this model have been able to move from reactive, episodic care to prepared, proactive teams working in partnership with informed activated patients/families and communities with significant improvements in health. The C ounties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) model shown above has the original 6 pillars of the Wagner model but has added cultural competency and a more expanded perspective to align more closely with the New Zealand Health system. Of the six pillars , Professor Ed Wagner has commented that self -management support is the most important, yet is frequently overlooked or underdeveloped. Self -management support was also identified by the Institute of Medicine as one of three important strategies for improving quality of care. It is also a key part of the paradigm shift the WHO has called for f rom clinician centred -care to truly patient -centred care. For more information about implementing self -management and working with the chronic care model go to the chapter 'Implementing self -management' in this toolkit. What we've learned... \"What's most important is at the bottom of the model... Patient needs are related to specific roles that effective practice teams have mastered\" Ed Wagner, New Zealand 2011 13 Key Resources Improving Chronic Illness Care The McColl Institute is a non -profit organisation focused on quality improvement and research for chronic care. Their website, Improving Chronic Illness Care includes an extensive array of information, tools and resources to support organisations and pra ctice teams. Visit the website at: www.improvingchroniccare.org Institute f or Healthcare Improvement (IHI) The IHI is another key organisation known internationally for being an excellent source or resources, tools and programmes to support chronic care & transformational change. One IHI programme adopted by a number of NZ organisations is The Triple A im. The NZ version as stated by the Quality & Safety Commission is : 1. Improve the health of the population; 2. Enhance the patient experience of care (including quality, access, and reliability); and 3. Reduce, or at least control, the per capita cost of care Visit the website at www.ihi.org References Ministry of Health. 2004. Population Ageing and Health Expenditure: New Zealand 2002 -2051.

This section provides a high level description of these constructs. Self -Management Self-management refers to the tasks that someone with a long -term con dition and their whnau or social network undertake s to live well. It includes: Having and using knowledge and improving understanding of the condition and/or its management Actively sharing in decision -making with health professionals, significant others and/or carers and other supporters Monitoring and managing signs and symptoms of the condition(s) Managing the impact of the condition on physical, emotional, occupational a nd social functioning Living healthier day to day by taking action to address risk factors and promote health by focusing on prevention and early intervention Adopting a self -management care plan agreed and negotiated in partnership with health profession als, significant others and/or carers and other supporters Having access to, and confidence in, the ability to use support services. (Based on Flinders Human Behaviour & Health Research Unit: Principles of Self -Management) \u00a9 Reflection Graphics 2 and Health Navigator 15 Self-Management Support (SMS) Self-manag ement support is the assistance caregivers or health professionals give patients with chronic disease in order to encourage daily decisions that improve health -related behaviours and clinical outcomes. Self-management support can be viewed in two way s: as a portfolio of techniques and tools th at help patients choose healthy behaviours; a nd a fundamental transformation of the pa tient-caregiver relationship into a collaborative partnership.2 Effective self -management support is about attitudes and action. Support for people managing a disease or long -term condition includes: Improving Health Literacy by - o giving patients inform ation in a way they can understand; o patients giving practitioners information and asking questions shared decision -making teaching and learning generic and/or disease -specific skills setting goals - based on the patient's preferences and priorities negoti ating & supporting healthy behaviour change training and learning problem -solving skills assisting with the emotional impact of having a chronic condition or living with someone who has a long-term condition Support navigation of community services and other resources providing care that is coordinated, planned, proactive and flexible to fit with a person/whanau's other commitments and pressures healing relationships with a healthcare team that enables regular and sustained follow -up Active Support works best Providing information is helpful, but it is not sufficient: without the confidence and skills to use information . Information alone will not lead to better health outcomes . Methods that improve people's activation and self - efficacy are the most effective ways of improving self -management and supporting healthy behaviour change. 2 De Silva, D. (2011) Evidence: Helping people help themselves. The Health Foundation 2011 Diagram describes levels of patient activation Source: Prof Judy Hibbard, University of Oregon http://personcentredcare.health.org.uk/resources/introduction -self-management -support . 16 In the provision of self -management support the patient is no longer be the passive recipient of care but an activated self -manager of their condition. AND.... The clinician is no longer simply an expert who tells the patient what to do, but a professional skilled in enabling people living with a long -term condit ion to change their behaviour. Characteristics of Successful Self -Management Support Von Korff et al in 1997 and Battersby and Lawn 2009 identified five key evidence -based elemen ts for collaborative self -management support and conclude with the import ant observation that \"these elements make up a common core of services for chronic illness care that need not be reinvented for each disease.\" Five key elements Active and sustained follow -up Patients are contacted at specified intervals to monitor health status, identify potential complications, and check and reinforce progress in implementing the care planSelf-management training & support services Patients have access to services that teach skills needed to carry out medical regimens, guide health behaviour changes, and provide emotional supportTargetting, goal setting & planning Patients and providers focus on a specific problem, set realistic objectives, and develop an action plan for attaining those objectives in the context of patient preferences and readinessCollaborative definitions of problems Patient -defined problems are identified along with medical problems diagnosed by physiciansAssessment of self -management learn what the client knows, their actions , strengths and barriers 17 Evidence for self -management Self-management is a key component for improving health outcomes, particularly for the prevention and optimal management of long -term conditions. From a range of reviews, t here is good evidence that increased self -management support can: Improve adherence to treatment regimes Improve shared decision -making Improve communication and coordination Reduce hospitalisations and after hours visits Improve health outcomes and quality of life Reduce health disparities when targeted to high needs populations Leads to patients feeling more in control Result in increa sed confidence and self -efficacy Lead to improved wellbeing and reduced depression and anxiety . A recent review by the Health Foundation in the UK (Helping People Help Themselves) has set out to answer questions such as, why should our role change to support self -management? What is the evidence that self-management support works . \"From this review, the general components that have been found to work well to support self -management include: involving people in decision making emphasising problem solving developing care plans as a partnership between service users and professionals setting goals and following up on the extent to which these are achieved over time promoting healthy lifestyles and educating people about their conditions and how to self - manage motivating people to self -manage using targeted approaches and structured information and support helping people to monitor their symptoms and know w hen to take appropriate action helping people to manage the social, emotional and physical impacts of their conditions proactive follow up and providing opportunities to share and learn from other service users. \" Most healthcare reform focuses on supply. Self-management support initiatives are important because they are some of the few approaches have the potential to reduce the demand side of the equation. ....The attitudes and skills of healthcare providers can have a significan t effect on the extent to which people feel engaged and supported and this is an area in need of further exploration .\" 18 Recommended Resources Health Navigator NZ For a list of systematic reviews, reports and literature about self -management, visit www.healthnavigator.org.nz/library/bibliography Alleviating the Burden of Chronic Conditions in NZ Literature review and reports looking at long -term conditions and related services within District Health Boards.

High prevalence - Over 50% of the adult NZ population are likely to have some difficulties with health literacy. Recent results from the 2010 Korero Marama: Health Literacy and Maori report confirm that, on average, New Zealanders have poor health literacy skills; up to 80% of Maori men and 75% of Maori women had poor health literacy skills and are at risk of adverse outcomes Premature mor bidity and mortality - Low health literacy has been shown to be an independent risk factor for poorer health, increased complications and hospitalisations and dying younger than one's peers. (American Medical Association) difficulties with health literacy can result in difficulty accessing health care, following instructions from a clinician, and medication errors. (Safeer, 2005) Safety issues - A study showed only 35% of people with basic or below basic health literacy could correctly demonstrate how they would take their me dications when asked, \"Show me how many pills you would take in one day.\" The instructions on the bottle said \"Take two tablets by mouth twice daily.\" (Davis 2006). Low health literacy is an independent risk factor for premature mortality (American Medic al Association) Costs: Low health literacy cost countries billions of dollars per year. In the US, this is estimated to be between $106 billion to $238 billion each year. This represents between 7% and 17% of all personal health care expenditures. (George Washington University Medical Center School of Public Health and Health Services) Hidden problem - Shame and embarrassment are very common responses for people with limited health literacy and people regularly report going to extraordinary efforts to hid e and cover up any reading or comprehension difficulties. While reading ability is related, there are many other factors that contribute to health literacy so you cannot assume based on education or occupation. It is estimated that nearly half of our ad ult population are likely to have some difficulties with health literacy: This may translate to practical difficulties such as understanding appointment letters, forms, educational resources and medication instructions. It also has major implications for informed consent, health inequalities, patient safety and quality of care.

Shared Decision Making What is shared decision making? Shared decision making is at the core of person -centred care; where people are supported to make informed decisions about and effectively manage their own health and care, and where their individual needs, values, preferences, abilities and goals are respe cted. It has a sligh tly different purpose than self -management support in that it is an activity that supports patients to make a specific decision , for example, whether or not to take a pa rticular medication whereas self -management support supports patie nts to confidently make daily informed decisions and take actions about their health and healthcare. Shared decision making involves a \" health professional and person working together to consider evidence -based clinical information about tests, treatment o ptions, likely benefits and outcomes, and potential risks and then choosing, in collaboration, the course of treatment, management or support that best fits the person's informed preferences . It recognises and brings together the clinical knowledge, skills and experience of the health professional, and the person's own knowledge, health related experience, values and preferences. What are the benefits of shared decision making? Evidence suggests that shared decision making improves health professionals' c ommunication with people. It also improves people's overall experience of care, including improving knowledge about their condition and treatment options, involvement in care and self - confidence in their own knowledge and self-care skills However, there is mixed evidence around whether it improves concordance with treatment unless a behaviour modification component and robust follow -up is included. Decision Aids Decision aids are handouts, audio tapes, videos or online resources that are designed to help patients understand the advantages and disadvantages of various treatment or decision options. There is good evidence that they can be helpful as it is very difficult to remember all the key points to discuss with every patient/client about every important treatment decision.

Cultural competence is now also required under the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 , with each professional regulatory body setting standards of cultural competence for their members. Providing cultural competent care is also fundamental to the successful implementation of a self -management approach, as care must start with respect and a cknowledgement of the person's values, beliefs and preferences. Right 1 of the HPCAA is the right to be treated with respect: (1) Every consumer has the right to be treated with respect. (2) Every consumer has the right to have his or her privacy respected. (3) Every consumer has the right to be provided with services that take into account the needs, values and beliefs of different cultural, religious, social and ethnic groups, including the needs, values and beliefs of Mori.\" Cultural competence includes the righ t to be treated with respect with regard to: Ethnicity, gender, spiritual beliefs, sexual orientation, lifestyle, age social status or perceived economic worth. Elements of cultural competence for Maori Health The four key elements to cultural competence when treating a Mori patient and their whnau3 are: 1. Attitudes A culturally competent health professional should be open to trying to engage and learn; be prepared to ask patients about their preferences and follow their lead; and will attempt to enter into, and understand, the patient's world. 2. Awareness A culturally competent health professional should also be aware of potential judgements and prejudices based on skin colour and appearance; be aware of Mori cultural expectations around consultations and personal interaction; and be aware of the importance of pronunciation (and when in doubt, ask the patient for help). 3. Knowledge A culturally competent health professional will be aware of Mori history, have some knowledge and a respect of Mori culture. 4. Skills The skills that a culturally competent health professional should have include; the ab ility to ask about the patient's background and heritage; the ability to involve whnau; the ability to ensure that the patient understands what is being planned; and the ability to seek advice and the capacity to develop the connections through which this can happen. 3 BPAC Article August 2011 - Building cultural competence: the Medical Council's direction.

It is an approach that places families/whnau at the centre of service delivery, requiring the integration of health, education and social services and is improving outcomes and results for New Zealand families/whnau. Introduced in 2010, Whnau Ora is driven by a focus on outcomes: that whnau will be self -managing, living healthy lifestyles, participating fully in society, economically secure, successfully involved in wealth creation, cohesive, resilient and nurturing. In order to achieve this , services providers and agencies are re quired to work differently to centre their focus on whnau. In 2010 Twenty -five provider collectives were selected to develop Programmes of Action to deliver Whnau Ora services. These collectives represented more than 150 individual organisations across New Zealand . Whnau Ora has now been in the DHB Annual Plans for two years and continues to be a government priority in 2014/15. DHBs are expected to continue support the local Te Puni Kkiri -led Whnau Ora provider collectives and take steps towards improv ing service delivery within these providers, and supporting the building of mature providers. (Ministry of Health 2014) For more information about your local Whanau Ora Collective contact your PHO. 26 Collaborative Care Planning Care planning is the process of proactively developing a structured, comprehensive plan by the patient and their significant others, carers & health professionals(s). It defines problems, goals, actions, timeframes & accountability of all involved to preve nt complications & deterioration of long -term health conditions. (Battersby 2007) Fundamental to care planning is the principle of patient -centred care which places the patient as the focus of any healthcare provision. The focus is on the needs, concerns , beliefs and goals of the patient rather than the needs of the systems or professionals. The patient feels understood, valued and involved in the management of their condition. Patients are empowered by learning skills and abilities to gain effective control over their lives versus responsibility resting with others. (Michie, Miles & Weinman, 2003) A care plan typically includes: Mutually agreed list of problems Patient defined goals Medical management, including medications Prioritised action plan/interventions/steps/tasks - based on SM needs of patient and their carer Crisis or contingency planning with written information re early warning signs/red flags & action to take Who is responsible for what with sharing of responsibility Key action p lan in person's preferred language Time for review & follow up Key principles of personalised care planning Continuous process resulting in an overarching care plan that is regularly reviewed A holistic, systematic approach based upon the person/whanau's strengths, values and aspirations and puts their goals, choices and lifestyle wishes in the centre of the process Is a dynamic process of discussion, negotiation, decision making and review that takes place between the indi vidual and the professional - who have an equal partnership Is planned, proactive and anticipatory with regular follow up and emergency planning for crisis episodes The person should be encouraged to have an active role in their care, be provided with in formation or signposting to enable informed choices and supported to make their own decisions within a guidance of managed risk Assessment and care planning views the person 'as a whole' supporting them in all their needs and individual diverse roles, inc luding family, parenting, relationships, housing, employment, leisure and education. Information about support networks, including peer support, carers and family support groups is included Results in an overarching, single care plan that is owned by th e person but can be accessed by those providing direct care. 27 Figure 1: Potential benefits of personalised care planning The figure above outlines some of the key benefits of personalised care planning. Care planning can range from very simple and brief for someone with mild disease or risk factors through to comprehensive, multidisciplinary care planning for someone with severe disease or a life limiting condition . Click here for practical resources to assist with Collaborative Care Planning . Benefits of care planning Improved coordinatio n & communica tion person /whanau centred & holistic improved wellbeing (biopsychos ocial) satisfaction & quality of life confidence, independ - ence & functioning timely & shared decisions medication adherence Reduced acute demand & duplication knowledge & crisis planning 28 Individually and collectively we need to consider what we do at every encounter with the health system to assist clients to develop their knowledge, personal skills, self -efficacy (confidence), motivation and resources to manage their health as optimally as possible. Sharing knowledge - sharing responsibility for health - shared care 29 SECTION 2: RESOURCES & PROGRAMMES Use the information in Chapters 2 & 3 to develop your knowledge and s kills in self - management support , to practice in ways that support self -management and to learn about a range of community and other self -management programmes . Add your own resources in too. 30 Chapter 2: Generic self -management skills, resources & programmes Self-management skills can be learnt and will i ncrease a person and wh nau's ability to proactively manage their health condition s. This can improve quality of life, sense of control, confidence lev els, and health outcomes. 1 Generic S elf-management skills for patients /clients 2 The Self Care Toolkit 3 Stanford Model - Self Management Programmes \"Attending the self -management programme was one of the best things I've done. It has made such a difference and my health has been so much better.\" (Stanford Self -Management Programme Course participant) Stanford leaders enjoying a group activity 31 2.1: Self -management skills for patients Evidence has shown that what we do as health professionals can strongly influence (positively or negatively) a patient's abil ity to self -manage their health . This section includes tools, skills and resources we can start using to help our patients /clients have more confidence, knowledge and specific skills to improve their health and wellbeing. There are five main areas of self -care and self -management support. Five areas of self -care - some ideas to get started 1. Information Needs to be trustworthy, accurate, culturally and linguistically appropriate, relevant to New Zealand Try to individualise and tailor to a person's situation Find useful information, tools, self -help books, online media and videos at www.healthnavigator.org.nz Use existing skills in a team working practice including nurse coordinator, health psychologist, occup ational therapist, physiotherapist, podiatrist and pharmacist. 2. Skills and knowledge training Refer patients to self -management courses (see page 33) Education one -on-one, in groups, with whnau Consider people's learning style - visual, auditory or kinesthetic Use structured problem solving (template in appendices ) e-therapy - broad range of online programmes 3. Tools and self - monitoring devices Scales, blood pressure monitors SMART Phones - texting support programmes, health and goal setting apps Pedometers + goal setting can be useful Peak flow meters & Blood glucose monitoring - when appropriate Tele-monitoring - wide range of options developing 4. Healthy lifestyle choices Referral to Green Prescription Learn about local nutrition programmes HVAZ - Healthy Village Action Zone - Programme in Pacific churches across Auckland DHB region Community Gardens Smoking Advisors Sports clubs Tai chi in parks 5. Support networks Social support is essential - encourage people to build and strengthen their own support network s among neighbours, friends, family and interest groups. Support groups and helplines can be very helpful - visit www.healthnavigator.org.nz/self -management/support - networks One of the areas we have the greatest challenge with in long -term condition management is supporting patients t o make positive behaviour change and healthier lifestyle choices. This includes aspects of 32 medication adherence and health literacy , lifestyle factors and is impacted by financial, social, environmental, psychological, cultural and educational factors. The traditional medical approach es of advising or telling people what to do doesn't work as well anymore. Attitudes have changed, expectations are different, cultural and social pressures are different. Likewise giving people lots of information, using fear tactics or our traditional style of patient education rarely change s behaviour. (View Thomas Goetz TedMed talk ) What is more effective is sharing the decision -making, teaching people self -management skills (such as communication skills, problem solving, goal setting, action planning) and focusing on approaches that improve engagement, activation , motivation and self-efficacy . Fortunately these skills can be effectively taught by allied health providers and peer leaders. Therefore b uild a team with broader roles, skills and stronger connections with community groups and local resources. Self-management skills There a re a number of self -management skills patients or clients can learn. These can be taught in the clinic, by peers (through peer support or buddy schemes), through self -help books , phone support , via online programmes or by referring patients to self -managem ent programmes. Self-management skills that can be learnt include: Decision -making and sharing in decision -making Problem solving Goal setting Action planning Improving communication with health professionals Utilising resources within one's community such as walking groups, local swimming pool s Fatigue and pain management Interpersonal skills Scheduling & p acing Relaxation Managing voices Adoption of healthier lifestyle behaviours such as healthier nutrition and increased physical activity Growing vegetables Tips for remembering medications Positive affirmations Peer support Many of these skills are valuable life skills . People that have learned self -management skills ha ve improved their communication skills and relationships , returned to work and improved their social wellbeing. \u00a9 Reflection Graphics 3 33 2.2: The Self Care Toolkit and the Pain Toolkit \"...for people with persistent health conditions\" Pete Moore, patient & author This is a great resource to share with your patients or clients . It was developed by Pete Moore, a patient living with chronic pain, asthma and osteoarthritis in the UK with support from health professionals and has proven so popular; the re is now an accompanying website and 1 day workshops . The purpose of the booklets and website are to support patients to become proactive in managing their own health. It is particularly useful for patients who do not wish to participate in 'formal' class es or programmes. The Pain Toolkit The pain toolkit and self -care toolkit have proved popular tools in the UK. The website has some useful resources and suggestions for people living with chronic pain. Website - www.paintoolkit.org Self-Care Toolkit - Booklet In association with the Pain Society of NZ and Health Navigator NZ, printable versions of these great little booklets have been adapted for NZ audiences.

The programmes: Aim to equip individuals and their whnau with the necessar y tools and skills to increase control and confidence in managing the daily challenges of living with a chronic condition. The generic programme has proven very popular and is now used in over 2 5 countries and translated into 22 languages. More recently specific programmes for back pain, diabetes, pain, the Internet and HIV have also been made available after testing for effectiveness through randomised, controlled trials over 2 -5 years. Held as small -group workshops , the courses are held in community settings and on the Internet (not yet for NZ participants) . They are facilitated by two leaders , with at least one having health problems of their own. The workshops are highly interactive, focusing on building skills, sharing experiences, and support.

What percentage of your patients with gout are on allopurinol? Marker for High Cardiovascular Risk and Diabetes The presence of gout is now recognised as a marker of high risk for diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. In Counties Manukau, approximately 25% of all patients seen at rheumatology clinics with gout have a five year CVD risk of 15% or more. Gout Self-Management Programme Arthritis New Zealand and Counties Manukau DHB have developed a self -management programme for Mori and Pacific Island people with gout. This programme includes gout risk assessment, gout education, and an individually tailored self -management plan for people affected by gout or at risk of developing it. Who is it aimed at? The self -management pro gramme is available for anyone with a particular focus on Mori and Pacific Island communities and is currently provided in the Counties Manu kau region .

Optimisation of medications & treatments; 2. Address any barriers to medication adherence such as health beliefs and health literacy; 3. Optimise p eople's self-management skills and behaviours through proven self - management programmes such as cardiac rehabilitation. \"If there were a pill that cost very little, reduced cardiac deaths by 27 percent, improved quality of life, and reduced anxiety and depression, every cardi ac patient in Europe would be expected to take it. There is no such pill, but taking part in a cardiac rehabilitation programme can provide all these benefits. \" (Professor Bob Lewin, European Society of Cardiology, Amsterdam 2005 ). Sadly, however, cardiac rehabilitation has not received the same profile as cardiac surgery or the arrival of new medications and many people miss out on referral or access to this valuable programme. Cardiac rehabilitation has three phases: Phase I: Inpatient rehabilitation (medical management, condition stabilisation, assessment of risk factors and commencement of education program me). Phase II: Outpatient rehabilitation - typically a supervised education/ambulatory programme for 6- 7 weeks in community settings . Supp ort is also available as a home -based programme (Heart Guide Aotearoa) in some parts of NZ, Phase III: Long term -maintenance . Support is available through a network of \"heart support groups \" and other exercise programmes. These are available on the cardiac directory online . Who is it aimed at? Cardiac rehabilitation is valuable for nearly all patients with cardiovascular disease, however studies suggest only approximately 30% of the target population (all patients with acute events) attend cardiac rehabilitation. If you find you have a patient who has not previously attended cardiac rehabilitation sessions and may like to, or you would recommend they do so, please refer. Where are groups located? A variety of different programmes are run in the community, with the aim to meet the needs of diff erent ethnic groups, ages and work commitments. The multidisciplinary rehab teams include Cardiac Rehabilitation Nurse Specialists , dietitians, physiotherapist s, psychologis ts, pharmacist s, cardiologists a long with ward staff. Where can I find out more? Information about Cardiac Rehabilitation programmes nationwide is available in the Heart Foundation Cardiac Community Online Directory. www.heartfoundation.org.nz/ccod Heart Support Groups Commun ity-based support groups provide an important forum for social support, physical activity, education, and secondary prevention. They are suitable for anyone who has a heart condition or is at high risk of developing one and their wh nau/family. 50 How can I refer to this programme? Heart Support Groups and Cardiac Clubs can be contacted directly and participants are also referred following P hase II Cardiac Rehabilitation programmes. Where can I find out more? The Heart Foundation's Cardiac Community Online Directory links to a variety of heart support groups and services within New Zealand, with a focus on people living with heart disease and their families. The Heart Foundation endeavours to keep this direct ory up to date, however as these groups are independent of the Heart Foundation, they cannot be responsible if details change without their knowledge. You are encourage d to contact the group directly for more information.

Mental health conditions are very common with approximately 20% of the population experiencing diagnosable mental illness in any given year. Emotional and psychological wellbeing can be significantly enhanced by effective self -management support. Good resources already exist for supporting h ealthy eating, physical activity and smoking cessation. Over the last few years, t he range and breadth of s elf-help, e- therapy and self -management resources for mental health have increased dramatically including e -therapy, or online/mobile or electronically enabled treatment. This section outlines some of the options now available. Screening Tools - eg: CHAT Tool Case -finding and Help Assessment Tool (CHAT Tool) Used for life-style and mental health assessment of adults (16 years and over) in primary health care, this nine item validated tool was developed by a multi -disciplinary team from Auckland University (led by Prof Felicity Goodyear -Smith). The tool assesses for physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug misuse, problem gambling, depression, anxiety and stress, abuse and anger problems. For each item (one or two questions) patients are asked whether this is something with which they would like help, either during this consultation or at a later date.

Currently there are no specific self -management programme s for neurological conditions. However , generic programmes can be adapted and utilise d to support patients and wh nau to optimise the management of their condition(s). (See Section 2 ) For many neurological conditions, such as dementia, acquired head injuries and Parkinson's disease, the personality/mood changes and increasing dependence places an enormous burden on family carers. Being available 24/7 takes its toll and an important part of self -management support is making sure carers are adequately supported as well. This can range from linking them with respite services, home -help, disability allowance and support groups through to counselling and managing depression, insomn ia and stress.

Over 200,000 New Zealanders have COPD, including 15% of New Zealanders aged over 45. With the right information , support and self-management skills, many acute exacerbations of COPD can be managed early and often some hospitalisations avoided. Every p erson with COPD should have a COPD Action/Management Plan so they know what their red flags or early warning signs are and what they should do. Likewise, most people with COPD will benefit from attending either a self-management programme or Pulmonary Rehabilitation . Pulmonary Rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation is an evidence -based approach to improve outcomes and quality of life for p eople with respiratory disease. The programme usually consists of 2 hou r sessions , twice weekly for approximately eight weeks and caters for patients with moderate to severe COPD . Usually run by specially trained physiotherapists, participants receive : An individualised exercise programme, learn about improved breathing techniques, relaxation , Receive support with smoking cessation an d nutrition, Education al sessions , support with medication management inc luding inhaler technique.

About the programme The Green Prescription Programme is carried out in two ways: 1. Phone Support A free service offering supp ort by phone for a period of three to four months. Support staff help people to find enjoyable physical activity options, assist them to fit these activities into their routine and form a regular habit. 2. Face -to-Face Other organisations partner with hea lthcare to provide free and low -cost physic al activity and wellnes s programmes in the community. These consist of an educational workshop and physical activity that can include aqua aerobics, gym workouts, walking and low impact aerobics. Who is it aimed at? Anybody who is interested in increasing his or her physical activity can go on the Green Prescription programme. Often people have medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and mental illness. Active Families Programme for children and their familie s. Criteria for referral are inactive children with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25 and within the 95th percentile, and a family able to make lifestyle changes. Most GRx Active Families referrals come from GPs, paediatricians or practice nurses. Families are also able to self -refer. Active Families Coordinators - -prescriptions/active -families Who to contact for more information A list of contacts and service providers in the Auckland region is available in the Services Directory at the end. 60 4.3: Managing grief \"Grief is a natural response to loss. It's the emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you love is taken away. This can include loss of ability to work, or role in life. You may associate grief with the death of a loved one - and this type of loss does often cause the most intense grief\" - Helpguide.org What is it? Any loss can cause grief. In long term conditions patients are often dealing with complex feelings and emotions r egarding their loss of function and/ or loss of roles in life. This can include loss of ability to work and financially provide for one's whnau/family , feeling dependent on others and being less able to fulfil previous roles within the whnau /family . For example, young children may have gran dparent(s) as primary carers resulting in grief for the chronically ill parent . Others may be on dialysis, have loss of a limb or suffered paralysis, blindness or deafness . In addition there may be issues of chronic pain, dyspnoea and lack of mobility. Look out for grief reactions in your patients - like depression, it is a common co-morbidity in patients with long -term conditions, is easily missed and often under -treated to the detriment of our patients and their families. Getting help for grief Counselling may help anyone who has had an extended period where the feelings of grief have not resolved, or they have become worse. Organisations that offer support for grief are listed below. Skylight Offers a wide range of services to support those facing tough times of change, loss, trauma and grief.

Nearly three out of four people do not take their medications as directed and at 12 months 50% have stopped taking their long -term medications such as statins, preventers, BP medication. A ll this resul ts in serious health consequences and lost opportunity for improved health outcomes. General advice Communication is KEY! We only remember approximately 20% of what we are told in a consultation so ensuring patients/clients have easy to understand written information can help. You can improve patient medication adherence by: Encouraging patients to ask questions Make sure patients really understand why they are on particular medications , how to take it and what to watch for . Learn more about health literacy and the large impact this has on taking medications correctly Provide appropriate written information to support what patients are told during cons ultations Encourag e patients to establish routines for taking medications, e.g., beside their toothbrush or kettle Use the Teach Back Method : ask patients to demonstrate how they will take their pills Give people written action plans about how to manage specific situations, e.g., pain, red flags or warning signs , asthma symptoms. Screen for depression and treat as appropriate (link to online Kessler 10) Ensur e financial barriers are removed (where possible) Rationalise medications & simplify regimes to once or twice a day (where possible) Resources Script Your Future Script Your Future is a national campaign to raise awareness about medication adherence.

Why is it important for me to do this? 63 The problem of medication adherence typically gets little attention compared with other, more pressing issues in health care. Yet higher adherence rates could dramatically improve patient outcomes while reducing overall health care spending.... (Mitka,M JAMA, 2010) Patients should be encouraged to ask their providers these three simple but essential questions in every health care interaction.

The use of family members or untrained interpreters leads to inferior quality of care and more errors. Evidence suggests that optimal communication, patient satisfaction, and outcomes and the fewest interpreter errors occur when such patients have access to trained professional interpreters or bilingual providers.

Universal Communication Principles Everyone benefits from clear information Many patients are at risk of misunderstanding, but it is hard to identif y them Testing general reading levels does not ensure patient understanding in the clinical setting Virtually everyone experiences difficulty with comprehension, retention and communication when facing stressors such as acute health events, surgery, tra uma, mental illness, sleep deprivation or illness of oneself or a loved one. 10 tips for improving communication 1. Partner with your patients - shift from the traditional role of advising and telling patients what to do. Form an equal partnership with shared knowledge, responsibilities, learnings and care. Enco urage patients to share in the decision -making and be proactive about their health. Respect patients as experts about themselves, their situation, values and prefe rences. Offer su ggestions and choices and then together agree the best option(s) . 2. Avoid jargon , abbreviations and explain medical terms - use plain, non -medical language , common words and socio -culturally appropriate language eg kai (food) and whnau (family). Words such as coronary, cervical (neck or uterine), otolaryngology, gynaecology etc. can be very confusing. 3. Use trained translators - for non -English spe aking patients/clients, organise phone or in -person translators. Using family members, friends or other non -trained people to translate is a common source of miscommunication. 4. Look for non -verbal cues and modify communication accordingly - 70% of communic ation is non -verbal - consider tone, body language, reactions, cultural differences (eye -contact) etc. 5. Practice active listening, use open -ended questions (cannot be answered with Yes or No) and encourage questions. Avoid: \"Do you have any questions?\" Rather - \"Most people have a number of questions. What would you like to know more about?\" OR \"what questions or topics would you like us to cover today?\" 6 Kessels RP. Patients' memory for medical information. J R Soc Med.

First things first - when giving information or advice, start with what is of most concern, impor tance or interest to the person. 7. Prioritize what needs to be discussed and limit information giving to three to five key points. 8. Consider l earning styles and use communication aids - modify communication accordingly. Draw diagrams, use interactive tools (such as Heart Forecast Tool ), decision aids, illustrations, plastic models, or video clips as much as possibl e. 9. Summarise key points and check understanding . Use the Teach -Back method 10. Give individualised or tailored written or online information (at an appropriate health literacy level) to reinforce key messages and actions. Using Open Questions : Open questions can transform a conversation. Just one question can elicit a response that provides insight into what really matters to the person you are working with.

The followi ng screening questions can be useful. 1. \"How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?\" (Not at all confident, a little confident, somewhat confident, quite a bit and extremely confident ). This has been used successfully as a single scre ening question with a summary likelihood ratio (LR) for limited literacy of 5.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 -6.4) for an answer of \"a little confident\" or \"not at all confident\"; a summary of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5 -3.3) or \"extremely confident.\" 2. \"How often do you need to have someone help you when you read instructions, pamphlets, or other written material from your doctor or pharmacy?\" (The Single Item Literacy Sc reener - A single item questionnaire intended to identify adults in need of hel p with printed health material. Possible responses are 1 -Never, 2 -Rarely, 3 -Sometimes, 4 -Often, and 5 - Always. Scores greater than 2 are considered positive, indicating some diff iculty with reading printed health related material is likely. More information at www.biomedcentral.com/1471 -2296/7/21 3. \"We now know that most adults have difficulty with understanding medical information, forms or prescriptions when unwell or stressed . How happy are you with your reading and writing in these situations? \" The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) is a new measure of health literacy. It is available only under licence and more information can be found at http://www.deakin.edu.au/health/research/phi/health -literacy -questionnaire.php 71 Goal Setting and Action Planning \"Goals give you a compass in order to direct your path through life. Goals focus your thoughts and actions on areas that have precise purpose and meaning.\" - Catherine Pulsifer Working with patients to identify somethi ng they want to do is one of the simplest, yet most effective techniques we can use to improve communication and behaviour change. A systematic review on improving diet, published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2002 , included goal set ting in a list of a few intervention components shown to be associated with improved behavioural outcomes. An earlier review by Cullen et al of 13 studies utilizing goal -setting in adult nutrition education found p ersons engaged in goal setting to improve diet did better in terms of self -reported dietary change, weight loss and improved serum ch olesterol than control groups. Goal setting was most successful if it included follow -up, problem solving, and adjusting activities if goals were not being achieved. When working with patients to develop their own goals, it is useful to remember the pneumonic SMART or SMARTER as shown below. To ensure ownership and motivation, it is also critical to ensure the patients/clients choose their own goals, rather than being given them by the health provider. SMARTER Goal Setting S - Specific What am I going to do? (What, when, where, ho w) M - Measurable How will I know when I have got there? A - Achievable Is this something I can do and in my control? What will I need? R - Realistic Am I being realistic? What are the likely problems? T - Time Bound Can I do this in a reasonable time frame? E - Enjoyable and evaluate Is this something I want to do? What worked, what didn't? R - Record and Rewards Writing it down and placing somewhere prominent helps keep us on track. Building in rewards also helps! 72 Self-Management Goal -Setting Technique 1. Ask: \"Is there something you would like to work on to improve your health this month?\" 2. Guide development of a short -term goal that is SMARTER. 3. Gauge the level of importance and score on a scale of 1 to 10. If rated less than 7, adjust goal to something that is more important to the patient/client. 4. Assess Confidence . Again, score from 1 to 10 and adjust the goal to something that is 7 or more. A score of 6 or less suggests th e goal is too hard. Likewise, if someon e scores 10, then this goal is very easy for them and you could check if they wish to make it a little more challenging. 5. Arrange short -term follow -up. A phone call, email, or text within one or two weeks of setting a new significant goal and change can make a significant difference to likeliness of achieving it. Help the person problem solve if they are facing barriers or struggling to achieve their goal and action plan. 6. Document goal in patient/client's notes and be sure to ask about it at the next visi t. (See Goal Setting & Action Planning template in appendices) Examples When someone comes up with a goal such as \"I want to lose weight\" ... or \"I want to be happier...\" help the person identify what a realistic target is (or what being happier would mean for them) and what specific action or behaviour they will do o n a regular basis to help them reach this goal. For instance: o Goal: \"I will lose 5 kg over the next two months by eating healthy di nners at home at least 5 nights per week.\" o An additional action can be: \"I will walk for at least 30 minutes on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday lunchtimes.\" o Goal: \"I will improve my asthma control over the next 6 weeks by taking my preventer twice a day so I will not get so puffed when I play with my kids.\" o An additional action could be: \"I will do this by setting an alarm on my phone to help me remember my puffer and by gradually increasing my walking and following my new exercise programme over the next 6 weeks.\" Ultra Brief Action Planning This is a simple and brief approach to developing a personal a ction plan that can be used in virtually any consultation and is b ased around three core questions . 1. \"Is there anything you would like to do for your health in the next week or two?\" (What, when, where, how often, etc.?) 2. \"On a 0 -10 scale of confidence, w here 0 means no confidence and 10 means a lot of confidence, about how confident are you that you will be able to carry out your plan?\" (If confidence <7, initiate collaborative problem solving). 3. When would you like to meet again to review how you've been doing with your plan?\" For more information: Download Ultra Brief Action Planning guide: www.ama - assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/ub_pap.pdf 73 Resources for Goal -Setting Coaching Approach Coaching Patients for Successful Self -Management Useful video presented by Tom Bodenheimer demonstrating coaching techniques to help encourage behaviour change and medication adherence by: Engaging the patient by continuously asking questions; Helping the patient develop a realistic action plan; Following up to monitor progress; Finding out whether the patient understands the medication plan and agrees with it; Asking the patient about barriers to med ication adherence; Following up - calling the patient a few days after a medication change to see how things are going.

Taking Control, co-designed with health providers and patients, contains a number of validated self -management support strategies including collaborative goal setting and action planning, problem s olving, self-monitoring, and information that is designed to be worked through, at home, by the individual with their family. Taking Control has been successfully used as a care planning resource within primary care in New Zealand. It is freely available f rom the Heart Foundation and more information can be found at http://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/programmes -resourc es/health - professionals/primary -prevention/cardiovascular -risk-management Co-Creating Health Model Co-Creating Health is an improvement programme developed by the Health Foundation in the UK that is helping people living with long -term conditions to take control of their health and health organisations with implementing self -management support. They i dentified four key elements: 1. Establishing the programme: The vision of clinicians, managers and commissioners must be aligned in order to deliver the programme effectively. 2. Improving clinical practice: Local clinical champions, who promote the value of the approach and advocate its feasibility among their peers, are essential. 79 3. Helping people to improve their health : Building the Self -Management Programme (SMP) into care pathways is essential for success. With this in mind, people are more likely to attend t he SMP if they are encouraged to do so by their clinicians. 4. Changing the system: Service improvement experience and expertise are needed to make real progress.

What is it? The Flinders Programme provides a generic set of tools and processes that enables clinicians and clients to undertake a holistic, structured assessment of self -management beh aviours, collaborative iden tification of problems and goal -setting leading to the development of individualised care plans. The aim of the programme is to provide a consistent, reproducible approach to assessing the key components of self -management that: Improves the partnership between the client and health professional(s) Collaboratively identifies problems and therefore b etter (i.e., more successfully) targets interventions Is a motivational process for the client and leads to sustained behaviour change Facilitates communication and trans -disciplinary team care Allows measurement over time and tracks change Has a predic tive ability. i.e. improvements in self -management behaviour as measured by the PIH scale, relate to improved health outcomes Three Key Steps 1. Assessment of self -management c apacity & barriers with Partner's In Health Scale (see appendices) and Cue & Response Interview \u00a9 2. Identify the main problem from the client's perspective using the Problems and Goals Assessment and formulate a key goal the client would like to work t owards over the following 6 - 9 months 3. Formulate a care plan with: Identification of mutually agreed i ssues and goals Key action steps, roles and responsibilities to address issues and goals for the next 12 months Monitoring and reviewing Case Studies Te Hononga PHO are using the Flinders Programme as their enrolment, assessment and care planning tool for their Long -Term Conditions Programme and Manaia PHO are using the Flinders programme for their Care Plus programme. Both groups have fo und the programme very useful at providing a holistic and structured approach to long - term condition management with many patients achieving some remarkable results. Often the patient /client 's goal is quite different to what health providers would expect, however the value of addressing the biggest problems first (be it financial, housing, social, emotional or health) is in facili tating motivation and ownership . Often the complexity of their social, financial and personal situation is so overwhelming that t heir health concerns are a much lower priority. 81 Where can I find out more? The Partner's in Health Scale can be used by any health professional. The other tools mentioned, (Cue & Response and Problems & Goals) require a licence, which is received after completing the requirements for a Certificate of Competency including attendance at a two -day workshop.

What is it? An Advance Care Plan (ACP) is a record of a p erson 's wishes and decisions regarding future treatment preferences for a number of situations or conditions. Individuals should complete an ACP after discussion with wh nau/family members and in collaboration with a trusted healthcare provider. This will ensure that those representing the p erson know of their wishes and have the document to support their decision -making in this process. Advance Care Planning is designed to facilitate reflection and discussion of wh at is important to an individual. This includes: Level of intervention and treatments they wish to receive, such as cardio -pulmonary resuscitation , ventilation, feeding tubes, dialysis and number of chemotherapy cycles Organ donation wishes Funeral wishes and practical advice Advance Care Planning has been recognised as an important issue and included in the 2011/12 regional health plan. Most clinicians are still relatively unfamiliar with advance care planning so a comprehensive project to provide clinic ians with templates, toolkits , and training is underway. The aim is to more consistently provide patients and wh nau with the opportunity to discuss and make informed choices surrounding future care.

Ministry of Health and Hospice New Zealand (View online) 83 Structured Problem Solving Structured problem solving is an evidence -based approach, widely used in psychological therapy, which involves a structured approach for helping patients who are overwhelmed by problems to identify, and systematically evaluate realistic solutions. As described by Blashki and colleagues, structured problem solving is a collaborative approach between the health practitioner and the patient, specific problems are identi fied and possible solutions are generated and evaluated through a series of short steps. Worksheets are often used to guide people through these steps. Patients/clients benefit not only from dealing better with their current problems, but also learn better problem solving skills to assist them with future issues. Common problems managed with structured problem solving: Relationship problems or problems with children Unemployment or change of job/occupation Housing problems Sexual problems Isolation from friends Problems with studying Drug and alcohol problems Useful Worksheets and References 1.

The strategy provides a structure for the health professional to tailor information to the patient's needs by : 1) asking the patient what he or she already knows or wants to know about his or her illness, 2) telling the patient what he or she needs to know and 3) asking or ascertaining whether the patient underst ands the information or has additional questions. The first step allows the health professional to assess the patient's understanding of his or her condition and its treatment. The health professional then responds by providing focused and tailored information relevant to the patient's issues regarding his or her health. A further question such as \"what else would you like to know about?\" helps keep the patients engaged in the discussion and build on their knowledge. The discussion should end with Teach Back to help assess the patient's response to , and understanding of , the information just received and keep the patient involved in the conversation. 86 Teach Back Method - Closing the Loop Studies have shown that 40 -80 percent of the medical information patients receive is forgotten immediately and nearly half of the information retained is incorrect. One of the easiest ways to close the gap of communication between clinician and patient is to employ the \"teach -back\" method, also known as the \"show -me\" method or \"closing the loop.\" It is the health care provider's responsibility, not the patient's, to communicate information in a clear and understandable manner . The Teach -Back method is a way to confirm that you have explained to the patient what they n eed to know in a manner that the patient understands. Patient understanding is confirmed when they explain it back to you. It can also help the clinic staff members identify explanations and communication strategies that are most commonly understood by patients. (North Carolina Health Literacy Toolkit ) The teach -back technique Do not ask a patient, \"Do you understand?\" Instead, ask patients to explain or demonstrate how they will undertake a recommended treatment or intervention. If the patient does n ot explain correctly, assume that you have not provided adequate teaching. Re - teach the information using alternate approaches. (From http://www.aspiruslibrary. org/literacy/Teach.pdf ) Example In Other Words...Confirming Understanding With the Teach -Back Technique Many providers begin with statements such as, \"I want to make sure I explained this clearly. When you go home today, what will you tell your [friend or family member] about [key point just discussed]?\" If patients cannot restate your instructions correctly, then explain again by drawing pictures or using simpler words. Use the teach -back again and repeat this process until you confirm that the key mess age is correctly understood. If you know you explained this well but after two or three tries the patient still does not \"get it,\" then look for other explanations (beyond your teaching) about why the message was not understood.

A national study (ABCC)8 published in early 2010 identified poor performance by most District Health Bo ards in New Zealand in the increasingly expensive domain of long term conditions. 70 -80% of all healthcare spending goes to long term conditions and the prevalence rates of conditions such as diabetes, COPD and other lifestyle related diseases continue to rise. This growing threat to the viability of the healthcare system urgently requires sustainable interventions and new models of care. There is good evidence that supporting people to self -manage their long term conditions can improve their motivation t o look after their health and change the way they use health services. A number of factors at a micro, meso and macro level influence a person's ability to self -manage. These are nicely summarised by Hinder and Greenhalgh9: \"At the micro level, self-management depends crucially on individuals' dispositions and capabilities, and will have relatively little purchase in those with low health literacy and other relevant capabilities. At the meso level, self -management depends on key roles, relationsh ips and material conditions within the family and also on the presence of a supportive infrastructure in the workplace, school and healthcare organisation. And at the macro level, self -management is likely to be influenced by prevailing economic conditions , cultural norms and expectations, and the underpinning logic of the healthcare system (e.g. the extent to which support for self -care is an expected and adequately remunerated aspect of the service).\" Additionally t here are multiple pressures on our hea lth system, including: population, work environment and societal factors. These are illustrated in the following diagram. 8 http://dhbrf.hrc. govt.nz/media/documents_abcc/ABCC_Study_NZ_Literature_Review_2011.pdf 9 \"This does my head in\".

MacColl Institute, 2011 As our understanding grows of the impact of broader determinants of health on the burden of disease, so does our thinking around models of care, workforce skill and profile, funding streams resources and approaches. In New Zealand the Whanau Ora Collectives are working across organisations and government departments with the aim of the integrati ng health, education and social service s and improving outcomes and results for New Zealand families/whnau. In Canada the E xpanded Chronic Care model was developed in part in recognition of the need to address these broader determinants of health as part of the health systems response to long-term condition management. This figure shows the Expanded Chronic Care Model , a Canadian adaption of the Chronic Care Model developed by Barr and colleagues. Inclusion of the five health promotion strands from the Ottawa Charter has been a popular adaptation. (View abstract) Benefits of applying the Chronic Care Model or one of its variants include the strong evidence base demonstrating usability, scalability, adaptability and effectivenes s for a wide range of long -term conditions and health care settings or organisations. There are dozens of implementation guides and resources.

A comprehensive needs assessment, audit, consultation process and curriculum review in Australia identified three groups of core skills and capabilities that are needed for the primary healthcare workforce to develop for effective chronic disease self -management.

Thus team care has generally been embraced by most as a criterion for high quality care.\" - Ed Wagner, BMJ, February 2000 As Ed Wagner10 has eloquently described \"the traditional image of a solitary family doctor \u2014concerned, vigilant, thoughtful \u2014seated at the bedside of a desperatel y ill child ...bears little resemblance to modern medicine, and not just because house calls are a thing of the past. Modern medical care involves complex, rapidly changing interventions and treatment plans, and the activities of multiple people, disciplines , and institutions.\" Research has clearly demonstrated that one of the key enablers of safer, more effective medical care is teamwork . Studies have also shown that simply working together in a clinic for a number of years does not automatically ensure th at the group functions as a n effective team. Characteristics of High Functioning Teams The Australian Primary Care Collaborative Programme has shown that successful practice teams demonstrate four key characteristics: 1. They are clear about their role, and they have an agreed strategy on how to run the practice 2. They have enough information, skills and experience to do the job 3. They have constr uctive group dynamics that create and maintain effective and efficient levels of communication 4. Members of the team are committed to the practice and to producing high quality, responsive patient care. Effective Team s - Structure11 Effective Teams - Proc esses13 Small, manageable number of members Appropriate mix of skills and expertise Measurable performance goals and specific tasks Clear roles Suitable leadership (person with most expertise) Good communication structures Collective responsibility for achieving goals Adequate resources - financial, training, administration, techn ical Share clear purpose and objectives* (*Strongest predictor of team effectiveness ) Regular communication, problem -solving High level of participation in team Emphasis on q uality Support for innovation Clear leadership (incl. lack of conflict about leadership) 10 Wagner, EH. (2004) Effective teamwork and quality of care. Medical Care. 42(11):1037 -9.. 11 Zwar NA, et al. Do multidisciplinary care plans result in better care for type 2 diabetes? Australian Family Physician. 2007; 36: 85 -9 93 Research demonstrates that \"effective teamwork in general practice encompasses general practitioners (GP), clinical and non -clinical staff, each with clearly defined roles and opportunities to provide feedback and input into how the practice is run and chr onic disease managed.\" 12 Facilitators of teamwork Factors identified as facilitators of teamwork in an Australian study include: Greater understanding of benefits (patient outcomes) Systemic changes (IT, protocols & processes, communication) Use of funding streams for chronic disease management (including nurse care) Greater role clarity Clinical benchmarking A designated leader in the practice Different models GP champions & case studies of success Support from Divisions (similar to Primary H ealth Organisations) & professional c olleges Involvement of Divisions with smaller practices (e.g. contract PN) More physical space Key Messages The following are some useful key messages identified by a large Canadian review :13 A healthcare system that supports effective teamwork can improve the quality of patient care , enhance patient safety and reduce workload issues that cause burnout among healthcare professionals. Teams work most effectively when they have a clear purpose; good communication; co - ordination; protocols and procedures; and effective mechanisms to resolve conflict when it arises. The active participation of all members is another key feature. Successful teams recognize the professional and personal contributio ns of all members ; promote individual development and team interdependence; recognize the benefits of working together; and see accountability as a collective responsibility The make -up and functioning of teams varies depending on the needs of the patient. The complexity of the health issue defines the task. The more interdependency needed to serve the patient, the greater the need for collaboration among team members. Patients and their families are important team me mbers with an imp ortant role in decision - making. To enable patients to participate effectively, they need to learn about how to participate in the team; how to obtain information about their condition; and how each healthcare professional will contribute t o their care. Teams function differently depending on where they operate. Teams in hospitals have clearly defined protocols and procedures, professional hierarchies, and shared institutional goals, while teams in community -based primary care practices fac e challenges related to the role -blurring in community settings. 12 Taggart J., Schwartz A., Harris M.F., et al. (2009) Facilitating teamwork in general practice: moving from theory to practice. Australian Journal of Primary Health 15, 24-28. 13Teamwork in Healthcare: Promoting Effective Teamwork in Healthcare in Canada - Policy synthesis and recommendations. Canadian Health Services Research Foundation. 2006. http:/ /www.chsrf.ca/Migrated/PDF/teamwork - synthesis -report_e.pdf 94 This wide variety of settings and tasks means that transferability of processes is not always straightforward. It also highlights the need for a common definition of \"team.\" Teamwork is influenced by organizational culture . A clear organizational philosop hy on the importance of teamwork can promote collaboration by encouraging new ways of working together; the development of common goals; and mechanisms to overcome resistance to change and t urf wars about scopes of practice. Teams need training to learn how to work together and understand the professional role/responsibility of each member. They also require an effective administrative structure and leadership. The larger policy context ca n promote teamwork by providing consistent government policies and approaches; health human resource planning; legislative frameworks to break down silos; and models of funding/remuneration that encourage collaboration. Successful team interventions are often embedded in initiatives working to improve quality of care through better co -ordination of healthcare services and the effective utilization of health resources with a focus on the determinants of health Additional Team Members A number of successful teams have found expanding their team to include new roles is beneficial. Examples include inclusion of nurse practitioners, healthcare assistants, information system staff and other allied health professionals for general practice t eams and specialist teams.

This is a scientific method used for action -oriented learning across multiple sectors such as engineering, business, health and education . After changes are thoroughly tested, PDSA cycles can be used to implement or spread change. The key principle behin d the PDSA cycle is to test on a small scale and test quickly. The PDSA philosophy is to design a small test with limited impact that can be conducted quickly to work out unanticipated \"bugs\". Repeated rapid small tests and the learning's gleaned build a p rocess ready for implementation that is far more likely to succeed. Tools: A PDSA Template is available in the appendices for you to print off and use. 96 Plan Define your objectives and make predictions about what will happen, and why it will happen. Get your team to answer the following questions: What exactly will you do? Who will carry out the plan? When will it take place? Where? What data/information will you collect to know whether there is an impr ovement? Tip: Make your goals SMART: Specific, Measureable, Action -based Realistic and Time -based. Do Carry out the plan and collect the data. This will include documenting experiences, problems, and surprises that occur during this test cycle. Study Analyse the test cycle and reflect on what you have learned. Compare results with the predictions made in the planning stage, and draw conclusions based on the collected data. Act Decide if there are any refinements or modifications needed to the chang e you have tried. This may lead to additional test cycles, which starts the process all over again with Plan. Linking PDSA Cycles and Tests of Change Testing changes is an ongoing process: the completion of each PDSA cycle leads directly into the start of the next cycle. A team learns from the test: What worked and what didn't work? What should be kept, changed, or abandoned? This new knowledge is used to plan the next test. The team continues linking tests in this way, refining the change until it is ready for broader implementation within the practice. People are far more willing to test a change when they know that chan ges can and will be modified as needed. Linking small tests of change helps ove rcome an organisation's natural resistance to change and ensures team buy -in. Resources Read more and view e xamples of PDSA cycles at: 1.

These eight steps have been recognised internationally as key stages, irrespective of the industry or sector for successful change managemen t. 1. Establish a Sense of Urgency Examine market and competitive realities Identify and discuss crises, potential crises, or major opportunities 2. Form a Powerful Guiding Coalition Assemble a group with enough power to lead the change effort Encourage the group to work as a team 3. Create a Vision Create a vision to help direct the change effort Develop strategies for achieving that vision 4. Communicate the Vision Use every vehicle possible to communicate the new vision and strategies Teach new behaviours by the example of the guiding coalition 5. Empower Others to Act on the Vision Get rid of obstacles to change Change systems or structures that seriously undermine the vision Encourage risk -taking and non -traditional ideas, activities, and actions 6. Plan for and Create Short -Term Wins Plan for visible performance improvements Create those improvements Recognize and reward employees involved in the improvements 7. Consolidate Improvements and Produce Still More Change Use increased credibility to change systems, structures, and policies that don't fit the vision Hire, promote, and develop employees who can implement the vision Reinvigorate the process with new projects, themes, and change agents 8. Institutionalize New Approaches Articulate the connections between the new behaviours and organizational success Develop the means to ensure leadership development and succession Source: Kotter, John P. \"Winning at Change\" Leader to Leader. 10 (Fall 1998): 27 -33. 98 6.7: Quality improvement resources New Zealand Health Service Co -design: Working with patients to improve services Hilary Boyd, Stephen McKernon & Andrew Old, Waitemata DHB, 2010 This guide is designed to help staff work with patients to understand their experiences and make improvements to healthcare services.

Ensure universal coverage The first and arguably most important characteristic of the high- performing chronic care system is ' ensuring universal coverage' . 2. Reduce financial barriers Reduce financial barriers - either care that is free at the point of use', or \"at least care that is provided at a cost that does not act as a major deterrent to sick patients seeking medical help.\" 3. Stronger focus on prevention Delivery system s should focus on the prevention of ill health' and not just the treatment of sickness. High performing systems use population h ealth approaches and wider healthcare teams to also target medical support at individuals at high risk of chronic disease. 4. Increased self - management support \"The fo urth characteristic is that 'priori ty is given to patients to self - manage their conditions with support from carers and families'. As Sobel shows, self -management support is critical because most care is and always has been self -care, and a small reduction in the propensity of people to self -care and manage effectively at home will result in a significant and potentially insupportable increase in demand for organised care services (Sobel, 1995 ). 5. Priority is give n to primary health care \"This characteristic derives from evidence on the contribution that primary care makes to overall system performance (Starfield et al., 2005 ), and to the everyday reality that most chronic disease management takes place in primary care in most he alth care systems.\" (Ham, 2010) 6. Population health management For example, use of risk stratification tools, measurement, audit and disease registries. 7. Integrated delivery systems Integrated delivery systems with primary health care teams being able to access specialist advice and support when needed as people's he alth needs typically fluctuate. 8. Use of information technology to support chronic care \"Information technology underpins effective population management in enabling primary health care teams to develop disease registers and to stratify the population acc ording to risk. In some applications, it also supports patient self -management through easing communication between patients and health care professionals and facilitating shared decision -making.\" (Ham, 2010) 9. Care is effectively coordinated \"Coordinati on is particularly important in the care of people with multiple conditions who are at much greater risk of hospital admission than people with single diseases (Wolff et al., 2002 ). The role of primary care physicians in providing coordination has been emphasised in a number of studies (Starfield et al., 2003 ). Also important are patient activation through coaching interventions and support by key staff such as specialist nurses for transition care . 10. Linking these nine characteristics into a coherent whole \"...link these nine characteristics into a coherent whole as part of a strategic approach to change'. This is important in view of evidence that it is the cumulative effect of different elements th at explains the degree of impact of the Chronic Care Model rather than individual components.\" (Ham 2010) Ham, C (2010).

PDSA Template Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles are a very popular and useful tool for trying and testing out small improvement ideas to bring about significant incremental quality improvement over time. Three Questions: 1. What are we trying to accomplish? Develop a goal for improvement 2. How wi ll we know that a change is an improvement? What measures can we use to track our progress towards achieving our goal? 3. What changes can we make that can lead to an improvement? List the ideas you would like to test to achieve your goal. Idea Describe the i dea you are testing: refer to the third fundamental question, 'What changes can we make that will result in an improvement?' Plan What exactly do you plan to do to test this idea? Remember to keep it simple! What will you do? Who will do it? When and where? Predictions and data to be collected: Do Was the plan executed? Document any unexpected events or problems. DO = DONE Study Record, analyse and reflect on the results. What did you find? What does it mean? Act What will you take forward from this cycle? (next step / next PDSA cycle) What next? How useful was this PDSA for your practice? 1 2 3 4 5 Not useful Very useful 107 Tip Start with: How..? When..? Where..? What..? Describe.. Tell me about.. Set a joint agenda What would you like to cover today? What would you like to know about? What worries have you had since your last visit? What else would you like to go over? Explore health beliefs What do you think about..? What do you make of it..? How does your situation make you feel? Describe how you feel about... Different people react differently to finding out about....how does it make you feel? Tip Ask yourself: Who is doing most of the talking in this conversation? Explore ambivalence -develop discrepancy What is good about ...... staying the same? making change? What worries do you have about ...... staying the same? making change? What is the worst thing that could happen? What is your vision for the future? Set goals What do you want to do? When will you do it? How often will you do it? How important is it to you? How confident do you feel about doing this? Who /what can support you with this? 108 Solve problems What might help you to..? How else do you think you could handle it? What ideas do you have? What might you be overlooking? What are the pros and cons of doing that? How have you handled something like this before? Tip Ask yourself: Who else needs to be part of this conversation? Assess understanding We have covered a lot today, it can be hard to remember everything, can you tell me the key points we have discussed? To make sure I have explained things clearly, can you tell me what you will say to your family about your visit when you go home? Can you show me how you will ... Tip Remember, the argument for change comes from the person not from you. Follow -up on goals How has it gone? Tell me about ...... what went well. what is getting in the way. What will make you more confident? What have you done to reward your success? What else can I do to support you? Tip Remember, pause and allow the person time to think. 109 Services Directory Diabetes Self -Management Courses Area Programme Contact Central Auckland Type 2 Diabetes - ADHB regional service for Diabetes SME http://www.tehononga.org.nz/diab etes-self-education.aspx Phone: 09 973 0789 Fax standard referral letter to 09 973 0789 Email: Diabetes Stanford Programme ProCare: Ph: 09 3746815 Email: life@procare.co.nz Diabetes Auckland - Living Well Programme Diabetes Auckland Type 1 Diabetes - Youth Programme ADHB Contact ADHB Diabetes Centre South Auckland Counties Manukau Health East Health PHO Group Diabetes SME DDI: 538 0446 davidh@easthealth.co.nz Parvin Stanford Programme ProCare: Ph: 09 life@procare.co.nz Referral through local general practice or PHO Alliance Health + Group SME in some practices and via Parish Nurses Mesepa Channing mesepac@alliancehealth.org.nz (09) 588 4299 Whitoria Clinic at Counties Manukau DHB - range of diabetes programmes for Type 1, youth, Type 2, weight loss etc. Manukau, Botany, Mangere, Pukekohe Ph: www.healthpoint.co.nz/default,19961.sm West Auckland HealthWest Diabetes EPIC Programme HealthWest North Shore Diabetes SME Programme Check with your PHO or DHB Type 1 Diabetes - DAPHNE Course Waitemata DHB Diabetes Service 110 Diabetes Projects Trust group programmes : http://www.dpt.org.nz/our -programmes Diabetes and Prevention Train the Trainer This free programme helps health professionals and others working with individuals or groups at risk of diabetes to hone their prevention and management skills.
