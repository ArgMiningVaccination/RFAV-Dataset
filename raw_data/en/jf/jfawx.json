What is medical marijuana or medical cannabis? Medical marijuana is the medical use of the Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica plant to relieve symptoms of or treat diseases and conditions. The Cannabis plant was used medically for centuries around the world until the early 1900s. Medical marijuana facts can be difficult to find because strong opinions exist, both pros and cons. Medical uses and emerging research on off-label uses are summarized in this article. What are THC and CBD? THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive compound in marijuana. It is responsible for the \"high\" people feel. There are two man-made [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) called [dronabinol](https://www.medicinenet.com/dronabinol-oral/article.htm) ( [Marinol](https://www.medicinenet.com/dronabinol-oral/article.htm)) and [nabilone](https://www.medicinenet.com/nabilone-oral/article.htm) forms THC. They are FDA-approved to prevent [nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) and [vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) in people receiving chemotherapy. CBD or cannabidiol is another compound in marijuana that is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to be responsible for the majority of the medical benefits. Epidiolex is a CBD oil extract that is undergoing [clinical trials](https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm) for [epilepsy](https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_and_seizures_quiz/quiz.htm). THC:CBD: Nabiximols (Sativex) is a specific plant extract with an equal ratio of THC: CBD. It is approved as a drug in the UK and elsewhere in Europe for the treatment of [multiple sclerosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), [spasticity](https://www.medicinenet.com/spasticity/symptoms.htm), [neuropathic pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/neuropathic_pain_nerve_pain/article.htm), [overactive bladder](https://www.medicinenet.com/overactive_bladder/article.htm), and other indications. Medical marijuana products are available with a huge range of THC and CBD concentrations. The expert opinion states that 10mg of THC should be considered \"one serving\" and a person new to medical marijuana should inhale or consume no more until they know their response.

Medical uses of marijuana include both studied and approved uses and off-label uses. In a recent research survey, the most common reasons people use medical marijuana are for [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm), [anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm), - [depression](https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm), - muscle [spasticity](https://www.medicinenet.com/spasticity/symptoms.htm), and [inflammatory bowel diseases](https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_intestinal_problems/article.htm)such as Crohn's disease. More research has been conducted on the compound CBD. Medical CBD to be neuroprotective in [Huntington's](https://www.medicinenet.com/huntington_disease/article.htm), [Parkinson's](https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm), and [Alzheimer's](https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm) disease, fetal [hypoxia](https://www.medicinenet.com/hypoxia_and_hypoxemia/article.htm), and other neurodegenerative conditions and movement disorders. What are the health benefits of medical marijuana? There are over 60 peer-reviewed research studies examining the benefits of medical marijuana. Sixty-eight percent of these studies found benefit while 8% found no benefit. Twenty-three percent of the studies were inconclusive or neutral. Most research has been conducted on the compound CBD. The benefits of medical marijuana can be attributed to binding to the endocannabinoid system. This has many effects including - modulating the immune system, - promoting neuroplasticity, - emotional and cognitive modulation including learning and motivation, appetite, vascular function, and digestive function. Are there any side effects of medical marijuana? Medical marijuana side effects are minimal when used at low doses and include At higher doses, side effects include [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness/symptoms.htm), [paranoia](https://www.medicinenet.com/paranoia/symptoms.htm), and - psychoactive effects including [mood changes](https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm)and [hallucinations](https://www.medicinenet.com/hallucinations/symptoms.htm). There are concerns about the adverse effects of cannabis among adolescents because the risks are greater to the immature brain and neurological system. Concerns include increased risk of [schizophrenia](https://www.medicinenet.com/schizophrenia/article.htm) and loss of IQ. There are public health concerns about the safety of driving under the influence of medical marijuana. A JAMA study found lower rates of opioid overdose deaths in states with legal medical marijuana. Is medical marijuana legal? At the time this article was written, 23 states have legalized medical marijuana with varying restrictions. However, it is classified as a Schedule I substance by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and thus is illegal at the Federal level. In most states with legal medicinal marijuana, a prescription, authorization, or medical recommendation is required, and a card or license is issued. This allows a person to buy medical marijuana. How do you get medical marijuana? In states where medical marijuana is legal, shops, often called dispensaries, sell marijuana products in a variety of forms. Medical marijuana is available in - edible forms (candies or cookies), - oils, and extracts, and - as the plant which can be smoked or otherwise inhaled. Dispensaries require a medical marijuana card before they will sell products. How people can get a medical marijuana card varies by state. It requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. Is medical marijuana \"addictive?\" Most research suggests a very low risk of [addiction](https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm) and very low toxicity of medical marijuana when taken as recommended in low therapeutic doses. There is concern about psychological dependence in heavy users and whether this constitutes marijuana abuse. Some research has suggested CBD oil might be useful in the treatment of marijuana [addiction](https://www.medicinenet.com/drug_abuse/article.htm) or marijuana abuse. What research is being done for medical marijuana? There are numerous studies underway on medical marijuana, but research is challenged by limited access given the FDA classification. A search of the National Institutes of Health-funded projects list in 2016 revealed 165 studies related to cannabis and 327 studies related to the search term marijuana. The majority of these studies are surveyed into use patterns. Many are also basic science studies investigating how the endocannabinoid system in the brain and immune system works. Survey studies that anonymously assess users' habits and reported benefits may provide insight into the effects of real-world use patterns. There are over 60 peer-reviewed research studies that have been published about medicinal cannabis. Sixty-eight percent of these studies found benefit while 8% found no benefit. Twenty-three percent of the studies were inconclusive or neutral. The most promising areas of research appear to be in the use of CBD for neuroprotection.

Arterial Chemotherapy Infusion & Chemoembolization of LiverArterial chemotherapy infusion of the liver and chemoembolization of the liver (TACE) are used in the treatment of liver cancer. Chemotherapy is directly injected into the hepatic artery so that a higher concentration of chemotherapy agents reach the tumors without subjecting the patient to the toxicity of the chemotherapy. Intra-arterial chemotherapy can cause the following side effects: - inflammation of the gallbladder(cholecystitis), - intestinal and stomach ulcers, and - inflammation of the pancreas(pancreatitis). Drug Abuse and AddictionDrug abuse and addiction is a chronic disease that causes drug-seeking behavior and drug use despite negative consequences to the user and those around him. Though the initial decision to use drugs is voluntary, changes in the brain caused by repeated drug abuse can affect a person's self-control and ability to make the right decisions and increase the urge to take drugs. Drug abuse and addiction are preventable. GlaucomaGlaucoma is a common eye condition in which the fluid pressure inside the eye rises because of slowed fluid drainage from the eye.

Marijuana Addiction and AbuseCannabis use disorder is when you're addicted to marijuana. Learn more about this condition and how to treat it. Multiple Sclerosis (MS)Multiple sclerosis or MS is an autoimmune disorder in which brain and spinal cord nerve cells become demyelinated. This damage results in symptoms that may include numbness, weakness, vertigo, paralysis, and involuntary muscle contractions. Different forms of MS can follow variable courses from relatively benign to life-threatening. MS is treated with disease-modifying therapies. Some MS symptoms can be treated with medications. Muscle SpasmsMuscle spasms are involuntary muscle contractions that come on suddenly and are usually quite painful. Dehydration, doing strenuous exercise in a hot environment, prolonged muscle use, and certain diseases of the nervous system may cause muscle spasms. Symptoms and signs of a muscle spasm include an acute onset of pain and a possible bulge seen or felt beneath the skin where the muscle is located. Gently stretching the muscle usually resolves a muscle spasm. Nausea and VomitingNausea and vomiting are symptoms of many conditions including motion sickness, pregnancy, emotional stress, gallbladder disease, and other illnesses. Learn about causes, treatment, and when to be concerned. Panic AttacksPanic attacks are sudden feelings of terror that strike without warning. These episodes can occur at any time, even during sleep. A person experiencing a panic attack may believe that he or she is having a heart attack or that death is imminent. The fear and terror that a person experiences during a panic attack are not in proportion to the true situation and may be unrelated to what is happening around them. Most people with panic attacks experience several of the following symptoms: racing heartbeat, faintness, dizziness, numbness or tingling in the hands and fingers, chills, chest pains, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of loss or control. There are several treatments for panic attacks. Parkinson's DiseaseParkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurological disease characterized by a fixed inexpressive face, a tremor at rest, slowing of voluntary movements, a gait with short accelerating steps, peculiar posture and muscle weakness, caused by degeneration of an area of the brain called the basal ganglia, and by low production of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Most patients are over 50, but at least 10 percent are under 40. Smoking QuizYou know it's time you quit smoking. Learn the myths and facts about quitting smoking with the Smoking Quiz.

Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome (TMJ)Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is a disorder that causes symptoms like pain, clicking, and popping of the jaw. TMJ is caused by injury to the temporomandibular joint. Stress, poor posture, jaw trauma, genetic predisposition, and inflammatory disorders are risk factors for the condition. A variety of self-care measures (application of ice, use of over-the-counter pain medication, massage, relaxation techniques) and medical treatment options (dental splint, Botox, prescription medications, surgery) are available to manage TMJ. The prognosis of TMJ is good with proper treatment. "}
