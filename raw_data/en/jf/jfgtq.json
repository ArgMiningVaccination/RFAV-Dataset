WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)? An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products , including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID -19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service s (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID -19 pandemic. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approve d, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based 7 Revised: 29 October 2021 on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID -19 during the COVID -19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the p roduct outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID -19 pandemic. This EUA for the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.
