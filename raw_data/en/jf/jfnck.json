However, no local agency, city or county, will enforce this provision and make the owner fix the mold problem. Who can help me? The State Housing Law, [California Health and Safety Code (HSC), section 17920.3(a)(13),](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17920.3.&lawCode=HSC) establishes that visible mold growth, as determined by health or code enforcement officers, would deem a residential building to be substandard. Residents experiencing substandard conditions in residential buildings/dwellings, including the presence of mold in rental housing, are encouraged to contact their local health or code enforcement departments to determine the local agency with jurisdiction. [HSC, sections 17960 and 17961](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=13.&chapter=5.&part=1.5.&lawCode=HSC&article=1.), mandate that the building department and health departments/environmental agencies, respectively, of every city/county are responsible for enforcement of State Housing Law, State Housing Law Regulations, and the California Building Standards Code. Failure of the responsible local agencies to enforce the HSC sections referenced above, is a violation of State Law.
