The Child and Adolescent Health Service Board is legally responsible and accountable for the oversight of the acute and community services within CAHS and is chaired by Dr Rosanna Capolingua. Bright and colourful spaces are abound throughout PCH such as the Medical Clinic pictured left and the Digital Wall inside the Northern Entrance pictured above Charter of Healthcare Rights PCH is committed to patient and family centred care and supports the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights (2nd edition). The charter was developed following extensive consultation by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and describes the rights that consumers, or someone they care for, can expect when receiving healthcare. Please go to the 'Your healthcare rights' section on our website to read the charter. CAHS acknowledges the Aboriginal people of the many traditional lands and language groups of Western Australia. It acknowledges the wisdom of Aboriginal Elders both past and present and pays respect to Aboriginal communities of today. CAHS Board and hospital charter 4 Have your say Have your say PCH is committed to working with patients, parents, carers, families and members of the community to continually improve the quality of our care and services. We recognise the value of feedback, both positive and negative. All feedback is reviewed by our Consumer Engagement Team and we encourage our patients and families to discuss any concerns they have about the care and level of customer service and facilities available to them during their visit. Partnering with consumers The National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards officially recognises the importance of providing a health service that is responsive to patient, carer and consumer input and needs. At PCH, consumers are represented by two key groups - the Consumer Advisory Council (CAC) and the Youth Advisory Council (YAC). CAC is made up of members representing PCH and the broader CAHS community and provides advice to the CAHS Board and hospital Executive about ways to engage with consumers, carers and the community in aspects of planning, reporting and service delivery. See the PCH website for more information. YAC members are passionate young people who represent the voice of children and adolescents and use their own experiences to help improve that of other patients. Members either have been or are inpatients, outpatients, siblings or friends of patients. 5 Have your sayCAC and YAC contribute to the improvement of the patient experience and the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of our services. Members meet monthly and provide feedback to help us better understand the consumer experience, helping the hospital to continually improve the quality of its care and services. Would you like to make a difference? If you would like to join our CAHS Consumer Network to hear about how consumers are involved in improving our services or to know about opportunities to participate, please email CAHS.Consumers@ health.wa.gov.au . Share a compliment or make a complaint Feedback can be given in a variety of ways at PCH. Feedback forms are widely available across the hospital and can be placed in the feedback box located at the Information Desk on Ground Level or posted at a later date.

Surveys Feedback about your child's experience at PCH is important to us. Regardless of your child's length of stay, your opinion will help us to find out what we are doing well and what we need to improve on. You may receive a text message on your mobile phone after an inpatient stay which gives you the opportunity to rate your or your child's experience of the care and treatment they received at PCH. Care Opinion CAHS is a subscriber to the Care Opinion website, which offers patients and families an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback about their health care experiences. Our staff appreciate hearing your personal stories and will be in touch about changes that have been implemented due to the feedback received. Please go to www.careopinion. org.au to share your PCH story. 7Finding your way around PCHPCH is a big place but finding your way around doesn't have to be difficult. In addition to the widespread signage around the hospital and information below, our staff and volunteers will be happy to help you in navigating our expansive facility. Information desk The main information desk is located on Ground Level, inside the Main Entrance. It is staffed on weekdays between 6.30am to 9pm, weekends and public holidays from 7am to 9pm. Ward clerks and receptionists on all levels will also help you with directions and information about the hospital. Wayfinding kiosks There are electronic kiosks located near the three entrances on Ground Level with interactive maps and suggested routes, so you can find your way to facilities, services and clinics with ease. Visitors using PCH's wayfinding kiosks inside the Main Entrance Lifts The lift bays are brightly coloured and service specific areas of the hospital. After-hours access is restricted and you may need to use an intercom to access certain areas. Green lifts service the ward areas, Clinics H and J and basement car parks only.

Finding your way around PCH 8 For your child's safety PCH is committed to patient safety and the highest standards of care. Here are some tips on how you can help us keep your child safe while they are in hospital. Speak up Parents know their child best and often have helpful ideas about how their care can be improved. We encourage family members and children, to share their observations and opinions with members of the care team. Always feel free to ask any questions if you are unsure about what nurses and doctors are doing to help your child get better. Are you worried? We need to know. If your child seems sicker or is behaving unusually, tell us right away. You know your child best. We will listen to you. Child Safe Organisation CAHS is committed to being a child safe organisation. We have robust policies and procedures to reduce the likelihood of harm to children or young people at our services. You can report a concern directly to a staff member or by following the processes outlined in the 'Have your say' section on page 5. 9 For your child's safetyKeeping our children safe To assist us in implementing the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations, we ask that you follow child-safe ward protocols. Access to the wards is controlled via an intercom, located at the entrance doors to all wards. It's important that you don't let anyone else into the ward with you as all visitors must be screened and approved. Remember to leave the privacy glass off and the curtain open as often as possible so we can see our patients. If you want to leave the ward with your child to visit other areas of the hospital make sure you let a nurse know. You don't want to miss any important medications or ward rounds. And please remember - any child under the age of 18 needs to be accompanied at all times. Visitors You will need to provide a list of approved visitors on admission so we know who can and cannot visit your child. All visitors, including parents and carers, must use the intercom to gain entry to the wards. Falls Sick and injured children are at risk of falling while they are in hospital. You can help us keep your child safe from falls by using bed or cot sides at all times, supervising their play, helping them to the toilet and in the shower when appropriate and providing non- slip footwear. Please ask our staff for help if you are unsure of how to use the bed or cot sides or any other safety equipment.Hand hygiene Hand hygiene is the number one way to stop the spread of germs. Hand hygiene means washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol based hand-rub foam solution (hand sanitiser). Please use the hand sanitiser located in all rooms and wards as well as at a number of locations throughout the hospital. Remember, it's absolutely okay to remind your child's health care team to wash their hands too. My medicines Please speak to a member of your child's health care team if any of their medications are making them feel unwell. Sometimes medicine is administered via a plastic tube directly into their hand; please tell the nursing staff if it becomes painful or itchy. Patient identification When your child is admitted, a nurse will fit a patient identification (ID) band to their wrist or ankle. Please help us keep your child safe by checking that their details are correct and that they wear the band at all times. Pressure injuries If it's possible, please ensure your child changes position in bed regularly to avoid them getting sore. If your child complains of any pain, please tell a member of the healthcare team. Saying no to unwell visitors It's important that visiting friends and family members stay at home if they are feeling unwell, as they could pass on an illness or infection to your child or other patients. 10Your stay at PCH Your stay at PCH A to Z Guide Whether your child's admission is for a day stay, overnight or longer PCH has been designed to make your time in hospital as comfortable and convenient as possible. Most inpatient wards share the same features including bright and spacious single rooms equipped with an ensuite and parent bed, a parent lounge on every floor as well as a multi therapy room. Many wards also enjoy fantastic views of Kings Park and were designed to invite the healing and therapeutic effects of nature into the rooms. During your stay you are likely to meet a number of different staff. Nurses, doctors, therapists, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, teachers and others may all play part in your child's care. They may also visit you as part of the hospital's daily clinical ward rounds (see A to Z guide).
