Listing various Chinese remedies to treat or several ailments, the document also provides ancient medical advice that is based on living life via the way of The Tao. Ancient Chinese medicine believed that illness was the result of dysfunction between the yin and yang, the mind, body and spirit, and that through ingestion of a healthy diet, proper medicine, and following the ways of The Tao, one could bring about full inner and outer healing. It is widely known as the earliest, and most important work, of traditional chinese medicine in its history. Back in 2010, this text was brought to [UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/huang-di-nei-jing-yellow-emperors-inner-canon/), the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, to be nominated for permanent inscription.

In 2011, the Huang Di Nei Jing was accepted for permanent inscription and sits today as a true relic of medical history.
