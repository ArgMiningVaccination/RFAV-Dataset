Side effects (SE) from vaccination are one of the reasons for reluctance to vaccinate. We systematically investigated self-reported SE after the first, second, and booster vaccinations. The data were collected during the T\u00fcSeRe: exact study (T\u00fcbinger Monitoring Studie zur exakten Analyse der Immunantwort nach Vakzinierung). Employees of health and research institutions were invited to participate. Study participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire and report their SE after each dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A total of 1046 participants (mean age: 44 \u00b1 12.9 years; female, n = 815 (78%); male, n = 231 (22%)) were included in the analysis. Local and systemic SE were more frequent after receiving the vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the first vaccination. However, local and systemic SE were more common after receiving mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273) in the second vaccination. Compared to the BNT162b2 vaccine, more SE have been observed after receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine in the booster vaccination. In multivariate analysis, local and systemic side effects were associated with vaccine type, age and gender. Local and systemic SE are common after SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The frequency of self-reported local and systemic SE differ significantly between mRNA and vector-based vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-25", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Side Effects in Health Care Workers after Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: Data from T\u00fcSeRe:exact been categorized as a positive sense single-strand RNA virus that is highly contagious. The SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in 2019, forcing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an outbreak of crucial public health emergency and concern in January 2020 and a pandemic by March 2020 [ [2](#B2-viruses-15-00065)]. After its initial outbreak in Wuhan, WHO recommended the name 2019 novel coronavirus as a provisional name, however, by February, the international committee on taxonomy of virus officially recommended the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ [3](#B3-viruses-15-00065)]. [4](#B4-viruses-15-00065)]. Some key symptoms that the COVID-19 patients recorded include fatigue, fever, loss of sense of smell, and dry cough. [5](#B5-viruses-15-00065)]. Later on, COVID-19 cases spread to other parts of Europe, causing numerous deaths that resulted in the creation and implementation of COVID-19 mitigation guidelines to contain the disease in Central Europe and other parts of the globe [ [6](#B6-viruses-15-00065)], as well as unprecedented efforts to understand the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 [ [7](#B7-viruses-15-00065)]. [8](#B8-viruses-15-00065)]. However, the vital COVID-19 vaccines available in Germany include, first, the vector-based ChAdOx-1 nCOV-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria, Oxford/AstraZeneca, UK) hereinafter referred to as AZE, which was recommended for people above 60 years of age and at high risk of contracting the disease because of its age-dependent safety profile [ [9](#B9-viruses-15-00065)]. Due to rare but severe thrombotic complications, this vaccine is no longer recommended [ [10](#B10-viruses-15-00065)]. Secondly, the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany), hereinafter referred to as BNT, is administered to people 5 years of age and above. Both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 are mRNA-based vaccines. Thirdly, the mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) vaccine, hereinafter referred to as MOD, which is considered effective and safe, particularly for people 30 years of age and above [ [11](#B11-viruses-15-00065)]. The vaccine is also be given to individuals who had previously contracted the coronavirus. For a complete immunization, two repeated doses of the same vaccine are necessary. However, due to vaccine availability, a combination of different vaccines has been also accepted as a full immunization. Since antibody titers are reduced with time, a booster vaccination 6 months after a full vaccination is deemed to be necessary for continued protection [ [12](#B12-viruses-15-00065)]. [13](#B13-viruses-15-00065), [14](#B14-viruses-15-00065)]. Acute side effects after a COVID-19 vaccine can be classified into two groups: local and systemic side effects. Local side effects include swelling, redness, pain on the injection site, and skin sensitivity. Systemic side effects include fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, shivering, and fever [ [15](#B15-viruses-15-00065)]. Most of the reported side effects usually diminish in a few days, however, on rare occasions, severe side effects such as anaphylaxis [ [16](#B16-viruses-15-00065)] and thrombotic events were reported [ [17](#B17-viruses-15-00065), [18](#B18-viruses-15-00065)]. [19](#B19-viruses-15-00065)]. In this study, we systematically investigated self-reported vaccine side effects after the first, second, and booster vaccinations. 2. Materials and Methods [20](#B20-viruses-15-00065)]. Regarding local side effects at the injection site, the probands were asked about were pain, skin sensitivity, swelling, and redness (i.e., erythema). The systemic side effects we asked about were headache, fever, shivers, generalized muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. These were acquired on an ordinal scale as follows: none, mild, moderate, severe. [https://datatab.net](https://datatab.net)(accessed on 15 October 2022)). Multivariate analysis with a generalized linear model (GLM) and an adjustment for dependencies of observation between different vaccinations in the same subject (GEE, Generalized Estimating Equations) was performed using SPSS Version 29 (IBM Inc, Armonk, NY, USA). The presence of local and systemic side effects was included as a dependent parameter in the model. Variables were included in the models according to their statistical significance in univariate logistic regression analysis (p 0.1). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. 3. Results 3.1. Study Cohort 3.2. Local and Systemic Side Effects after First Vaccination [Table 1](#viruses-15-00065-t001). After the first vaccination, 78% of the study cohort reported at least one local side effect. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site, which was reported by 73% of study participants. [Table 2](#viruses-15-00065-t002). Local side effects were significantly different between AZE and BNT only in terms of skin sensitivity ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). Swelling and erythema were significantly higher after MOD compared to AZE (p < 0.05, [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). Furthermore, skin sensitivity, swelling, and redness were more frequent after MOD compared to BNT (p < 0.05, [Table 2](#viruses-15-00065-t002)). [Figure 1](#viruses-15-00065-f001). Compared to AZE, the severity of local side effects, except for skin sensitivity and diarrhea, was significantly higher after vaccination with MOD ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). However, the severity of most local side effects was similar after receiving AZE and BNT vaccines after the first vaccination ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). On the other hand, the severity of most of the local side effects was higher after MOD compared to BNT ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). [Table 2](#viruses-15-00065-t002)). The most frequent side effect was fatigue, which was reported by 62% of the participants. Systemic side effects were reported by 88% of those participants receiving AZE as the first vaccine. In contrast, the percentage of participants with systemic side effects was 60% and 57% after receiving BNT and MOD vaccines, respectively. All systemic side effects, except nausea and diarrhea, differed significantly between AZE and both mRNA-based vaccines ( [Table 2](#viruses-15-00065-t002)). The severity and frequency of self-reported systemic side effects are presented in [Figure 1](#viruses-15-00065-f001). In terms of the severity of systemic side effects, BNT and MOD vaccines were not significantly different ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). 3.3. Local and Systemic Side Effects after the Second Vaccination [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)), respectively. The most reported local side effect was pain at the injection site, reported by 87%, and the most common systemic side effect was fatigue, with 64%. Recipients of the MOD vaccine as the second dose not only reported the highest proportion of local side effects, but also systemic ones, where the difference is most significant ( [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)). All local side effects were more frequent after MOD compared to AZE and BNT ( [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)). Pain at the injection site was more common after BNT compared to AZE ( [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)). Although the frequency of skin sensitivity was similar after receiving AZE and BNT, the severity of the symptom was significantly higher the lowest proportion of reported adverse events compared with the first dose, with 53% of the participants experiencing local side effects and 54% experiencing systemic side effects ( [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)). General muscle pain and fatigue were significantly more common after BNT compared to AZE ( [Table 4](#viruses-15-00065-t004)). The vast majority of all reported side effects after the second dose were mild to moderate ( [Figure 2](#viruses-15-00065-f002)). 3.4. Local and Systemic Side Effects after Booster Vaccination [Table 5](#viruses-15-00065-t005)). The proportion of recipients reporting at least one side effect locally or systemically is comparable to the previous two administrations. Again, pain at the injection site (75%) and fatigue (62%) were the highest reported side effects ( [Figure 3](#viruses-15-00065-f003)). A statistically significant difference in frequency between MOD and BNT was found in seven of the twelve included side effects ( [Table 5](#viruses-15-00065-t005)) and five out of the twelve in terms of severity ( [Table 3](#viruses-15-00065-t003)). 3.5. Homologous vs. Heterologous Vaccine Regimes [Table 6](#viruses-15-00065-t006)). However, a statistically significant difference between AZE-MOD and AZE-AZE vaccine regimes was found in two of four local side effects and six of twelve side effects ( [Table 6](#viruses-15-00065-t006)). On the other hand, the incidence of side effects was similar when the second vaccination was performed with the same mRNA vaccine. 3.6. Multivariate Analysis [Table 7](#viruses-15-00065-t007)). As risk factors for local SEs, our model took vaccine type, age, skin disease, and previous COVID-19 infection into consideration. Multivariate analyses showed an association between vaccine type and the frequency of local SE ( [Table 7](#viruses-15-00065-t007)). In terms of local SE, MOD showed higher odds ratios for local SE compared to both AZE (OR(95%CI) = 2.202 (1.630-2.975); p < p = 0.171). While the difference between BNT and AZE was not significant (OR(95%CI) = 1.224 (0.966-1.551); p = 0.094). Younger age (18-45 years) was associated with higher odds ratio for local SE (OR(95%CI)= 1.817 (1.431-2.332); p < 0.001). Having a skin disease was associated with higher odds ratio of having 1 local SE (OR(95%CI) = 2.914 (1.390-6.109); p = 0.005). In contrast, previous COVID-19 infection was not associated with increased local SE (OR(95%CI) = 0.667 (0.373-1.192); p = 0.171). [Table 7](#viruses-15-00065-t007)). Similar to local SEs, vaccine type was associated with the frequency of having 1 systemic SE. The difference between MOD and AZE was not significant (OR(95%CI) = 0.785 (0.596-1.034); p = 0.085). On the other hand, BNT was associated with lower SE frequency compared to both MOD (p < 0.001) and AZE (p < 0.001) vaccines. The frequency of systemic SE was higher in participants younger than 45 years of age (OR(95%CI) = 1.458 (1.177-1.805); p < 0.001). Cardiovascular disease was associated with higher incidence of systemic SE (OR(95%CI) = 1.575 (1.007-2.463); p = 0.046). [Supplemental Tables S1 and S2](#app1-viruses-15-00065)). The same held true for males (larger differences between vaccines) vs. females in local SE ( [Supplemental Tables S3 and S4](#app1-viruses-15-00065)). 4. Discussion [21](#B21-viruses-15-00065)]. Furthermore, Klugar et al. compared mRNA-based and viral vector based COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers after receiving the first vaccination [ [22](#B22-viruses-15-00065)]. Similar to our findings, while local side effects were more common after receiving mRNA-based vaccines compared to viral vector-based vaccines (78.3% vs 70.4%), systemic side effects were more frequent after viral vector-based vaccines (62% vs 87%) [ [22](#B22-viruses-15-00065)]. The fact that a vector vaccine carries both the antigen and the viral vector, and both can elicit an immune response, it may explain the higher reactogenicity of vector vaccines [ [23](#B23-viruses-15-00065)]. Furthermore, high prevalence of adenoviral diseases in the community and the consecutive pre-existing immune mechanisms might also contribute to these findings [ [24](#B24-viruses-15-00065), [25](#B25-viruses-15-00065)]. [26](#B26-viruses-15-00065)]. Both vaccines are mRNA-based and are packed in lipid particles and contain no adjuvants. However, potentially explaining the difference, is the dose per injection, which is significantly higher in MOD (100 \u00b5g) compared to BNT (30 \u00b5g). [13](#B13-viruses-15-00065)]. Similar to our findings, they found that side effects are more common after the first dose compared to the second dose [ [13](#B13-viruses-15-00065)]. This effect may be in part explained by the adjustment of the German vaccination recommendations. AZE recipients were significantly older. As Ramasamy et al. have shown, the tolerance of AZE is higher in older adults [ [27](#B27-viruses-15-00065)]. On the other hand, we found that compared to the first dose, the number of individuals reporting systemic side effects increased among those receiving an mRNA vaccine as a second dose. This finding is in accordance with the literature. El-Shitany et al. also reported an increased side effect rate after a second dose of BNT compared to the first vaccine dose [ [15](#B15-viruses-15-00065)]. It can be explained through a two-fold mechanism: the build-up of long-lasting memory T-cells and B-cells facilitates a faster and more intense immune response. And as discussed by Yao et al., a more recent finding suggests an additional role of the cells of the innate immune system in contributing to a well-prepared immune response upon a second encounter with an immunogen. This phenomenon is referred to as trained immunity [ [28](#B28-viruses-15-00065)]. [29](#B29-viruses-15-00065)]. Furthermore, heterologous vaccination provides a better immunogenicity compared to homologous vaccination [ [30](#B30-viruses-15-00065)]. We further investigated whether heterologous vaccination influenced the side effect frequency. Both local and systemic side effects were more common in individuals receiving MOD or BNT after AZE compared to those who received two doses of AZE. Hillus et al. recently found systemic reactions in 49% of vaccinations after heterologous AZE-BNT vaccination, and in 39% after homologous AZE-AZE [ [31](#B31-viruses-15-00065)]. Baldolli et al. investigated the side effect rate after heterologous vaccination in health care workers [ [32](#B32-viruses-15-00065)]. In accordance with our findings, individuals receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine reported more local and systemic symptoms compared with those receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine after AZE [ [32](#B32-viruses-15-00065)]. [33](#B33-viruses-15-00065)]. A third vaccination improves the antibody binding to the omicron variant [ [33](#B33-viruses-15-00065)]. Most of the participants in our study received BNT as a booster. Local side effects were more common after MOD compared to BNT in booster vaccination. [14](#B14-viruses-15-00065), [15](#B15-viruses-15-00065), [34](#B34-viruses-15-00065)]. Using multivariate analyses, we investigated possible confounders. Differences between vaccines remained significant after adjustment. In agreement with previous studies [ [15](#B15-viruses-15-00065), [35](#B35-viruses-15-00065)], multivariate analyses in our study revealed a tendency to local and systemic SE in participants older than 45 years of age. Furthermore, females reported more side effects compared to males in our cohort. These results indicated that age and sex were associated with vaccine side effects and that these effects should be considered when interpreting the results of similar studies investigating reactogenicity after COVID-19 vaccination. [35](#B35-viruses-15-00065)]. However, in the current study, previous COVID-19 infection was not found to be associated with SE. We believe the low number of participants with prior COVID-19 infection (3%) precludes any certain association. [36](#B36-viruses-15-00065)]. Therefore, the gender distribution reflects the population under study. Third, side effects were collected using a pre-formed online questionnaire, which might cause the underreporting of rare side effects. Online questionnaires and applications have recently been increasingly used to collect information for medical studies when face-to-face interviews are not possible because of contact limitations. On the other hand, the studied population consisted of health professionals who can be assumed to have the necessary health literacy to understand and answer the health-related questions. 5.
