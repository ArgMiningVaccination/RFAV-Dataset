SCID means they have no functioning immune system, so even a simple infection can prove life threatening. Left untreated, children with SCID often die in the first few years of life. There are stem cell/gene therapies funded by the [California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/)), such as ones at [UCLA](https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2020/08/03/celebrating-a-life-that-almost-didnt-happen/) and [UCSF/St. Judes](https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2022/02/14/cirm-funded-study-helping-babies-battle-a-deadly-immune-disorder-gets-boost-from-fda/), but an alternative method of treating, and even curing the condition, is a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). This replaces the child's blood supply with one that is free of the SCID mutation, which helps restore their immune system. However, current HCT methods involve the use of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy the patient's own unhealthy blood stem cells and make room for the new, healthy ones. This approach is toxic and complex and can only be performed by specialized teams in major medical centers, making access particularly difficult for poor and underserved communities. To change that, [Dr. Judy Shizuru](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-shizuru) at Stanford University, [with CIRM funding](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/clinical-trial/monoclonal-antibody-depletes-blood-stem-cells-and-enables-chemotherapy-free), developed an antibody that can direct the patient's own immune cells to kill diseased blood stem cells, creating the room needed to transplant new, healthy cells. The goal was to make stem cell transplants safer and more effective for the treatment of many life-threatening blood disorders. That approach, JSP191, is now being championed by [Jasper Therapeutics](https://www.jaspertherapeutics.com/) and they just got some very good news from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted JSP191 [Fast Track Designation](https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track), which can speed up the review of therapies designed to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs. In a [news release](https://ir.jaspertherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jasper-therapeutics-announces-fda-fast-track-designation-jsp191), Ronald Martell, President and CEO of Jasper Therapeutics, said this is good news for the company and patients: \"This new Fast Track designation recognizes the potential role of JSP191 in improving clinical outcomes for these patients and will allow us to more closely work with the FDA in the upcoming months to determine a path toward a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission.\" Getting a BLA means Jasper will be able to market the antibody in the US and make it available to all those who need it. This is the third boost from the FDA for Jasper. Previously the agency granted JSP191 both [Orphan](https://www.fda.gov/industry/medical-products-rare-diseases-and-conditions/designating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products) and [Rare Pediatric Disease ](https://www.fda.gov/industry/medical-products-rare-diseases-and-conditions/rare-pediatric-disease-rpd-designation-and-voucher-programs)designations. Orphan drug designation qualifies sponsors for incentives such as tax credits for clinical trials. Rare Pediatric Disease designation means that if the FDA does eventually approve JSP191, then Jasper can apply to receive a priority review of an application to use the product for a different disease, such as someone who is getting a bone marrow transplant for sickle cell disease or severe auto immune diseases.
