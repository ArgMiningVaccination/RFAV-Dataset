The condition is called \"tech neck,\" and it has actually been around for decades. In essence, tech neck is an issue that develops among workers whose duties keep them hunched down at their desks or workstations for hours. Computer programmers or IT workers are not the only ones whose strained neck muscles end up putting pressure down their spines and connective tissue. Prep cooks and machine operators at manufacturing plants are also known to suffer from tech neck. Even school teachers can develop this condition if they spend an extended amount of time at the front of the classroom instructing the children; it all boils down to proper posture and ergonomics. Now that chiropractors are treating more patients for tech neck, they are also being tasked with explaining toxic release, a set of symptoms that are similar to detoxification, and which happen to many people who are not accustomed to spinal adjustment and other techniques that are part of chiropractic care. At Dean Chiropractic, we always inform new patients about the potential they face with regard to toxic release, which is easier to deal with if you understand what is causing you to feel slightly under the weather after going through sessions. Understanding Toxic Release Toxins are pathogenic substances or particles that can become harmful when their concentrations are higher; they can be organic or synthetic, and they all present a risk of illness under certain conditions. Some toxins are more harmful than others. Mold and mildew are examples of spore toxins we are exposed to on a daily basis, but when they enter our bloodstream in high quantities, they can cause our body to become ill. Here are other examples of toxins: - Pesticides - Flame retardant materials - Hydrocarbon emissions - Many industrial chemicals We are constantly exposed to toxins in various ways. The major organs that take care of these pathogens through metabolic waste processing are the kidneys and the liver. This is a physiological detoxification process. Detoxification is another term for the process of elimination, whereby harmful substances, toxins, or impurities are removed from the body, as a last step before complete elimination. Detoxification is a necessary biochemical function when the body is overloaded with toxins from food, cigarettes, and alcohol, or from controlled substances and even prescription medications. For example, it is not unusual to see substance abuse patients who were using on a daily basis display the typical signs of detoxification such as vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, and dehydration. Similarly, it is not uncommon to see some alcoholics deal with symptoms of detoxification, such as nausea, dry mouth, headaches, and insomnia during their journey to recovery. It is important to make the distinction between detox and withdrawal symptoms; in some cases, they will overlap, but the processes are different. Toxic release in chiropractic patients is not the same as what substance abuse patients go through. Symptoms You May Experience During Toxic Release As previously mentioned, toxic release after chiropractic therapy is a form of detoxification, which means that you will experience some uncomfortable symptoms such as: - Nausea - Tightness of muscles - Unspecified fatigue - Headaches - Elevated temperature - Stomach aches The combination of the symptoms above will make you think that you caught the influenza virus or some kind of bacterial infection; however, it is very unlikely that toxic release will actually increase your core body temperature. You may feel as if you have a fever, but the thermometer will not register it. Quite a few patients will experience these symptoms a few hours after their first spinal adjustment session, but they will not last long. How Toxins Are Released Through Spinal Adjustment Whenever you are dealing with a misaligned spine, you can expect toxins to form within the joints and connective tissue; these toxins are contained within microscopics bubbles that are dissolved through spinal adjustment, and they are ultimately released back into the bloodstream. Your immune system will detect these pathogens and activate natural defenses through antibody action. As these toxins are targeted by antibodies, you will feel the reaction in the form of the aforementioned symptoms, which will decrease in terms of intensity as they are eliminated. Even though toxin release may feel like a negative reaction, it should be noted that a significant aspect of chiropractic care involves clearing the spine of abnormal interference through precise adjustments. As your body adjusts, you may experience soreness, stiffness, and tenderness in the joints and muscles. This is normal and expected, but these symptoms will only be felt for a brief period. This is how you know that your body is doing what it is supposed to be doing. Over the long term, your body will heal and you will return to your adequate level of health. Since toxic release is in fact augmenting the functions of the kidneys and liver, it should be considered a positive aspect of chiropractic treatment despite its brief feeling of discomfort. The most important thing to remember is that even though you may feel as if you have a fever, the symptoms you are experiencing are not those of a disease, but a normal detox process. Even though you may feel a bit sick, there is no need to worry; you will recover in time. How Patients Can Deal With Toxic Release Chiropractic treatment, like therapeutic massage, works on the principle of increasing the flow of nerve messages. Nerve pathways, which send and receive messages about the body, lie alongside the spinal column. When they become compressed, they may fail to communicate properly. Massage increases the pressure of the body on these pathways and improves communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Many scientists believe that massage is an important part of all rehabilitation programs. This is why toxic release also happens after going through specialized massage therapy sessions. The first thing you should know about toxic release is that strong symptoms are only felt by about 15% of patients. For the most part, the symptoms will be substantially milder than those you feel when getting a COVID-19 vaccine, which means that they can be compared to an easy cold. You should be able to ride out toxic release with relaxation, a good night's sleep, and a healthy meal. In addition to getting adequate rest, you should also help your immune system with proper hydration. Water and drinks that contain minerals and electrolytes will support the process of toxin elimination. Most patients will feel great the next day; if for some reason your symptoms persist, you should focus on eating fresh fruits and vegetables for an entire day. There should not be any need to take medications during the toxic release process; nonetheless, if strong symptoms persist for more than a day, you may want to schedule a medical appointment in order to assess whether your immune system is compromised. Why Toxic Release is Largely Unavoidable The release of toxins is part of chiropractic therapy. Toxins constantly accumulate and release through various processes. People who are physically active tend to handle toxic release better than others, but this will also depend on the overall health and efficiency of their immune systems. If you have a history of allergies, dealing with infections, and inflammatory episodes, the potential of feeling strong toxic release symptoms will increase. In some cases, nutritional deficiencies, cancer, and intestinal conditions may also intensify toxic release. At Dean Chiropractic, we sometimes treat patients whose intense toxic release merits a medical consultation because there may be underlying issues that need to be evaluated.
