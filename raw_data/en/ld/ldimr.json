Called the Shanghai Academy of International Standardization for Traditional Chinese Medicine, the new institute will be dedicated to promoting the international standardization of TCM. \"The establishment of the research institute will further promote the development of TCM international standardization, which is key to the modernization and internationalization of TCM,\" said Shen Yuandong, chairman of ISO/TC 249. Jin Xingming, vice-chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the international standardization of TCM has had a profound impact on strengthening quality control, promoting the development of the traditional Chinese medicine industry, enhancing international trade in traditional Chinese medicine, and promoting traditional Chinese medicine and culture around the world. The political advisory body had proposed the establishment of the academy five years ago. \"Standards are the universal language of the world. Our key mission is to improve the ability to internationalize standards, build a bridge between China and the world, and serve to build a new pattern of all-round opening up to the outside world,\" said Jin. According to Ji Guang, president of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the newly established academy has gathered key members of the research team who have been deeply involved in the standardization of the TCM industry since the establishment of ISO/TC 249 in 2009. As of June 2023, ISO/TC 249 had officially published 95 international standards for traditional Chinese medicine. Another 31 international standards are currently under development. \"The establishment of the Shanghai Academy of International Standardization for Traditional Chinese Medicine will further energize the international standardization of traditional Chinese medicine and create a new pattern of development, making greater contributions to the inheritance and innovation of traditional Chinese medicine,\" said Ji. Sixteen proposals for new projects covering areas such as Chinese medicinal materials, Chinese medicine products, acupuncture needles, traditional Chinese medicine medical devices, and traditional Chinese medicine terminology will be discussed during the ongoing 13th plenary session, according to the event organizer. The conference, which will run till June 8, has attracted 275 registered participants, including representatives from 16 member countries, the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies, the World Confederation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion Societies, and the International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee for Elderly Society, the organizer said.
