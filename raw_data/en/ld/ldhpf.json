Many Americans use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in pursuit of health and we ll-being. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which incl uded a comprehensive survey of CAM use by Americans, showed that approximately 38 percent of adults use CAM. This fact sheet pr esents an overview of CAM, types of CAM, summary information on sa fety and regulation, the mission of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and additional resources. Defining CAM Defining CAM is difficult, because the field is very broad and constantly changing. NCCAM defines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. Conventional medicine (also called Western or allopathic medicine) is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) and D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psyc hologists, and registered nurses. The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not absolute, and specific CAM practice s may, over time, become widely accepted. \"Complementary medicine\" refers to use of CAM together with conventional medicine, such as using acupuncture in addition to usual care to help lessen pain. Most use of CAM by Americans is complementary. \"Alternative medicine\" refers to use of CAM in place of conventional medicine. \"Int egrative medicine\" (also called integrated medicine) refers to a practice that combines both conventional and CAM treatments for which there is evidence of safety and effectiveness. Types of CAM CAM practices are often grouped into broad categories, such as natural products, mind-body medicine, and manipulative and body- based practices. Although these cate gories are not formally defined, they are useful for discussing CAM practices. Some CAM practices may fit into more than one category. Natural Products This area of CAM includes use of a variety of herbal medicines (also known as botanicals), vitamins, minerals, and other \"natural produc ts.\" Many are sold over the counter as dietary supplements . (Some uses of dietary supplements\u2014e.g., taking a multivitamin to meet minimum daily nutritional requirements or taki ng calcium to promote bone health\u2014are not thought of as CAM.) CAM \"natural products\" also include probiotics \u2014live microorganisms (usually bacteria) that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the human digestive tract and that may have beneficial effects. Probiotics ar e available in foods (e.g., yogu rts) or as dietary supplements. They are not the same thing as prebiotics\u2014non digestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of microorganisms already present in the body. Historical note: Herbal or botanical medicines reflect so me of the first attempts to improve the human condition. The personal effects of the mummified prehistoric \"ice man\" found in the Italian Alps in 1991 included medicinal herbs. By the Middle Ages, thousands of botanical products had been inventoried for their medicinal effects. Current use: Interest in and use of CAM natural pro ducts have grown considerably in the past few decades. The 2007 NHIS found that 17.7 percent of American adults had used a nonvitamin/nonmineral natural product. These pr oducts were the most popular form of CAM among both adults and children. The most commonly used product among adults was fish oil/omega 3s (reported by 37.4 percent of all adults who said they used natural products); popular products for children included echinacea (37.2 percent) and fish oil/omega 3s (30.5 percent). Mind-Body Medicine Mind-body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, with the intent to use the mind to affect ph ysical functioning and promote health. Many CAM practices embody this concept\u2014in different ways. Meditation techniques include specific postures, fo cused attention, or an open attitude toward distractions. People use meditation to increase calmness and relaxation, improve psychological balance, cope with illness, or enhance overall health and well-being. The various styles of yoga used for health purposes typica lly combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxa tion. People use yoga as part of a general health regimen, and also for a variety of health conditions. Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving the stimulation of specific points on the body using a variety of techniques, such as penetrating the skin with needles that are then manipulated by hand or by electrical stimul ation. It is one of the key components of traditional Chinese medicine, and is among th e oldest healing practices in the world. Other examples of mind-body practices include deep-breathing exercises, guided imagery, hypnotherapy, progressive relaxation, qi gong, and tai chi. Acupuncture is considered to be a part of mind-body me dicine, but it is also a component of energy medicine, manipulative and body-based practices, and traditional Chinese medicine. 2 Historical note: The concept that the mind is important in the treatment of illness is integral to the healing approaches of traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, dating back more than 2,000 years. Hippocrates also no ted the moral and spiritual aspects of healing and believed that treatment could occur only wi th consideration of attitude, environmental influences, and natural remedies. Current use: Several mind-body approaches ranked among the top 10 CAM practices reported by adults in the 2007 NHIS. For example, the survey found that 12.7 percent of adults had used deep-breathing exercises, 9.4 percent had prac ticed meditation, and 6.1 percent had practiced yoga; use of these three CAM practices had incr eased significantly sinc e the previous (2002) NHIS. Progressive relaxation and guided image ry were also among the top 10 CAM therapies for adults; deep breathing and yoga ranked hi gh among children. Acupuncture had been used by 1.4 percent of adults and 0.2 percent of children. Manipulative and Body-Based Practices Manipulative and body-based prac tices focus primarily on the structures and systems of the body, including the bones and joints, soft tissues, and circulatory and lymphatic systems. Two commonly used therapies fall within this category: Spinal manipulation is performed by chiropractors and by other health care professionals such as physical therapists, osteopaths, and some conventional medical doctors. Practitioners use their hands or a device to apply a controlled force to a joint of the spine, moving it beyond its passive range of motion ; the amount of force applied depends on the form of manipulation used. Spinal manipulatio n is among the treatment options used by people with low-back pain\u2014a very common co ndition that can be difficult to treat. The term massage therapy encompasses many different techniques. In general, therapists press, rub, and otherwise manipulate the mu scles and other soft tissues of the body. People use massage for a variety of health-r elated purposes, including to relieve pain, rehabilitate sports injuries, reduce stress, increase relaxation, address anxiety and depression, and aid general well-being. Historical note: Spinal manipulation has been used sinc e the time of the ancient Greeks and was incorporated into chiropractic and osteopat hic medicine in the late 19th century. Massage therapy dates back thousands of years. References to massage appear in writings from ancient China, Japan, India, Arabic nati ons, Egypt, Greece (Hippocrates de fined medicine as \"the art of rubbing\"), and Rome. Current use: According to the 2007 NHIS, chiropractic /osteopathic manipulation and massage ranked in the top 10 CAM therapies among both a dults and children. The survey found that 8.6 percent of adults and 2.8 percent of child ren had used chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, and 8.3 percent of adults and 1 percent of children had used massage. Other CAM Practices CAM also encompasses movement therapies \u2014a broad range of Eastern and Western movement-based approaches used to promote physical, mental, emotio nal, and spiritual well\u00ad being. Examples include Feldenkreis method, Alexander technique, Pilates, and Trager psychophysical integration . According to the 2007 NHIS, 1.5 pe rcent of adults and 0.4 percent of children used movement therapies. 3 Practices of traditional healers can also be considered a form of CAM. Traditional healers use methods based on indigenous theories, beliefs, and experiences handed down from generation to generation. A familiar example in the United States is the Native American healer/medicine man. The 2007 NHIS found that 0.4 percent of adults and 1.1 percent of children had used a traditional healer (usage varied for the seven spec ific types of healers identified in the survey). Some CAM practices involve manipulation of various energy fields to affect health. Such fields may be characterized as veritable (measurable) or putative (yet to be measured). Practices based on veritable forms of energy include those involving electrom agnetic fields (e.g., magnet therapy and light therapy ). Practices based on putative energy fields (also called biofields) generally reflect the concept that human beings are infused with subtle forms of energy; qi gong, Reiki, and healing touch are examples of such practices. The 2007 NHIS found relatively low use of putative energy therapies. Only 0.5 perc ent of adults and 0.2 percent of children had used energy healing/Reiki (the survey define d energy healing as the channeling of healing energy through the hands of a practitioner into the client's body). Finally, whole medical systems , which are complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved over time in different cultures and ap art from conventional or Western medicine, may be considered CAM. Examples of ancient whole medical systems include Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine . More modern systems that have developed in the past few centuries include homeopathy and naturopathy . The 2007 NHIS asked about the use of Ayurveda, homeopathy, and naturopathy. Althou gh relatively few respondents said they had used Ayurveda or naturopathy, homeopathy rank ed 10th in usage among adults (1.8 percent) and 5th among children (1.3 percent). A Note About Safety and Effectiveness Rigorous, well-designed clinical trials for many CAM therapies are often lacking; therefore, the safety and effectiveness of many CAM therapies are uncertain. NCCAM is sponsoring research designed to fill this knowledge gap by building a scientific evidence base about CAM therapies\u2014whether they are safe; and whether th ey work for the conditions for which people use them and, if so, how they work. As with any medical treatment, there can be risks with CAM therapies. These general precautions can help to minimize risks: Select CAM practitioners with care. Find out about the practitioner's training and experience. Be aware that some dietary supplements may interact with medications or other supplements, may have side effects of thei r own, or may contain potentially harmful ingredients not listed on the label. Also keep in mind that most supplements have not been tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children. Tell all your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. For tips about talk ing with your health care providers about CAM, see NCCAM's Time to Talk camp aign at nccam.nih.gov/timetotalk/. 4 NCCAM's Role NCCAM's mission is to explore CAM practices us ing rigorous scientific methods and build an evidence base regarding the safety and effectiv eness of these practices. NCCAM achieves its mission through basic, translational (\"bench-to -bedside\"), and clinical research; research capacity building and training; and education and outreach programs.

A Note About Gover nment Regulation Dietary Supplements The Federal Government regulates dietary supplem ents primarily through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulations for dietary supplements are not the same as those for prescription or over-the-counter drugs. In general, the regulations for dietary supplements are less strict; for example, a manufacturer does not have to prove the safety and effectiveness of a dietary supplement before it is marketed. Once a dietary supplement is on the market, the FDA monitors safety and product information (label claims and package inserts), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitors advertising. Practitioner-Based Therapies There is no standardized, national system for credentialing CAM practitioners. The extent and type of credentialing vary widely from state to state and from one CAM profession to another. For example, some CAM professions (e.g., chir opractic) are licensed in all or most states, although specific requirements for training, test ing, and continuing education vary; other CAM professions are licensed in only a few states or not at all. 5 For More Information NCCAM Clearinghouse The NCCAM Clearinghouse provides information on CAM and NCCAM, including publications and searches of Federal databases of scientific and medical literature.
