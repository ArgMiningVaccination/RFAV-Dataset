SAGE working group on polio (Established August 2008) Terms of Reference 1. Prepare SAGE for the development of comprehensive pol icy guidance on the use of IPV in the post -eradication era in low and middle income settings, including by: Reviewing long -term Polio Risks & Risk Management Strategies: reviewing the long -term risks associated with live polioviruses after wild polio tran smission globally, and reviewing the range of strategies for mitigating those risks in low -income settings (e.g. coordinated OPV cessation, mOPV stockpiles and response mechanism). Assessing Current & Future IPV Products: reviewing the existing range of I PV products, in terms of supply capacity, production cost, price, presentations, etc, and their appropriateness and suitability for low -income settings, particularly sub -Saharan Africa; and studying the IPV 'pipeline' and its implications for post -eradicat ion IPV use in terms of potential new products (e.g. Sabin -IPV, adjuvanted -IPV, fractional dose IPV), production costs, and prices. Establishing Potential IPV Policies & Implications: establishing the range of IPV vaccination schedule options that could be utilized in a post -eradication world, given the difference in polio immunization objectives and polio risks compared with a polio -endemic world; and identifying and characterizing the programmatic implications, economics and opportunity costs of those po licy options, for both IPV stand -alone and combination formulations, in low -income settings and particularly sub -Saharan Africa; Page 9Updated: 25 March 2013 Identifying and prioritizing knowledge gaps that should be addressed to facilitate SAGE decision -making on the role(s) and opt ions for IPV use in the post -eradication era in low -income settings. 2. Propose key recommendations to SAGE for updating the 2003 position paper on IPV and consolidating it with other relevant documents (including the 2006 supplement to the IPV position paper) into one vaccine position paper on routine polio immunization covering both IPV and OPV and giving consideration to the ongoing polio eradication efforts. 3. Advise SAGE on technical guidance to WHO and the GPEI for the development and finalization of the overall polio eradication 'endgame strategy' to reduce long -term risks associated with OPV and to accelerate wild poliovirus eradication, including: policy and programmatic options for the use of different OPV formulations and IPV delivery options, and strategy and priorities in the related areas of outbreak response, surveillance, containment, risk assessment (esp. Vaccine Derived Polio Viruses - VDPVs), research and product development, and vaccine supply. Composition SAGE Members Elizabeth Miller, Ch air of Working Group.

This is also an opportunity for SAGE to review new data on the effectiveness of various vaccination strategies aimed at reduc ing infant mortality as well as the pertussis related outcome of the Vaccine schedule optimization project. Specifically the working group will be asked to: Review epidemiological data from countries that have or not experienced a resurgence of pertussis, in particular data that relates to the quality and duration of protection of protection for wP and aP vaccines Review, in the context of the above, accumulated data on the usefulness of the following strategies to prevent early mortality o Role of vaccinat ion of adolescents and adults o \"Cocooning\" o Vaccination of pregnant and lactating mothers o Vaccination of new -borns Update estimates of effectiveness of 1 or 2 dose schedules against mortality Create optimal primary vaccination schedule and timing of boos ter dose(s) Propose, based on the above and as necessary, an update of the current recommendations on the use of wP/aP vaccine.

SAGE Working Group on non -specific effects of vaccines (established March 2013) Terms of Reference WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has requested the WHO Secretariat to review the evidence concerning the possible non -specific effects of vaccines included in the routine infant immunization sc hedule. Preparatory to such a review of the evidence by SAGE in 2013, it is necessary to: systematically review all published and grey literature concerning epidemiological studies addressing \"non survival/all -cause mortality in children under five years of age and, critically appraise the evidence using the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) guidelines. The Working Group will be asked to determine if the current evidence is su fficient to lead to adjustments in policy recommendations or to warrant further scientific investigation, and if so, to define the path towards obtaining unequivocal evidence on these issues that would support future robust, evidence -based adjustments in i mmunization policies, if warranted. Guidance for the development of evidence -based vaccine related recommendations. The Working Group will specifically be asked to: 1. Review and provide guidance on the protocol for two independent systematic reviews (one on epidemiological studies and one on immunological factors) on the evidence of selected vaccines on child survival/ deaths by all causes in children less than 5 years of age. 2. Review the available evidence that addresses the effect of BCG, DTP and measles -containing vaccines on survival/all -cause mortality in children less than five years of age and, the outcomes of the above mentioned reviews and related GRADE tables. 3. Determine if the current evidence on non -specific effects of vaccines is sufficient to l ead to adjustments in policy recommendations or to warrant further scientific investigation.

SAGE is charged with advising WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccine a nd technology research and development, to delivery of immunization and linkages between immunization a nd other health interventions. The mandate of SAGE is to provide strategic advice rather than technical input, and is not restricted to childhood vaccines and immunization but extends to the control of all vaccine-preventable diseases. SAGE advises the WHO Director-General specifically on the: 1. adequacy of progress towards the achievement of the goals of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS); 2. major issues and challenges to be addressed with respect to achiev ing the goals of GIVS; 3. immunization programme response to cu rrent public health priorities; 4. major general policies, goals and ta rgets including those related to vaccine research and development; 5. adequacy of WHO's strategic plan and priority activities to achieve the GIVS goals consistent with its mandate and considering the comparative advantages and the respective roles of partner organizations; 6. cross-departmental activities and initiatives rela ted to vaccine and immuni zation technologies and strategies and linkages with other health interventions; 7. engagement of WHO in partnershi ps that will enhance achievement of global immunization goals. Membership The SAGE comprises 15 members, who shall serve in th eir personal capacity and represent a broad range of disciplines encompassing many aspect s of immunization and vaccines. SAGE members are recruited and selected as acknowledged experts from around the world in the fields of epidemiology, public health, vaccinology, paediatrics, internal medicine, infectious diseases, immunology, drug regulation, programme management, immunization delivery, health-care admi nistration, health economics, and vaccine safety. The membership of SAGE shall seek to reflect a representation of: 1. professional affiliation (e.g., academia, medical profession, clinical prac tice, research institutes, and governmental bodies including national immunization programmes, public health departments and regulatory authorities); 2. m a j o r a r e a s o f e x p e r t i s e ( e . g . , i n fluenza control, diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory diseases, research, biologics, and safety); and 3. the three major strategic areas of WHO's work relating to immunization (i.e., accelerating innovation, ensuring quality and safety, and maximizing access and links with other health interventions). SAGE members, including the Chairperson, shall be nominated by the WHO IVB Direct or in consultation with WHO Regional Offices and other relevant WHO departments upon the propos al of an independent selection panel including representativ es of key partner organizations. A public call for nominations is issued. After determination of eligibility, nominations are submitted to the selection panel. Members will be selected on the basis of their qualifications and ability to contribute to the accomplishment of SAGE's objectives. Page 17 SAGE members are appointed by the W HO Director-General; all nominations for new SAGE members, as well as renewals and discontinuation of appointments to SAGE, must be appr oved by the WHO Director-General. Consideration will be given to ensuring appropriate geographic representation and gender balance. Members of SAGE, including the Chairper son, shall be appointed to serve for an initial term of three years. Such three-year terms may only be renewed once. Prior to being appointed as SAGE members and prior to renewal of term, nominees and current SAGE members shall be required to complete a WHO declarati on of interest as per the attached form (Annex 1). In addition, prior to confirmation by WHO of their appo intment as SAGE members, SAGE nominees shall be required to sign a confidentiality agreement(Annex 2). All papers presented to SAGE, which may include pre- publication copies of research reports or documents of co mmercial significance, shall be treated as confidential. SAGE deliberations are confiden tial and may not be publicly disc losed by SAGE members. A register of members' interests and signed confidentiality agreemen ts shall be maintained by WHO. Membership in SAGE may be terminated for any of the following reasons: (1) failure to attend two c onsecutive SAGE meetings; (2) change in affiliation resulting in a conflict of interest; and (3) a lack of professionalism involving, for example, a breach of confidentiality. Roles and responsibilities of SAGE members Members of SAGE have a responsibility to provide WHO with high quality, well considered, advice and recommendations on matters described in the SAGE term s of reference. Members play a critical role in ensuring the reputation of SAGE as an internationally recognized advisory group in the field of immunization. In keeping with SAGE's mandate to provide strategic advice rather than technica l input, members will be committed to the development and improvement of public health policies. Focused technical input will be solicited from identified experts a nd advisory scientific groups. The Committee has no executive or regulatory function. Its role is solely to provide advice and recommendations to the Director-General of WHO, and includes providing advice and recommendations on urgent matters as needed. SAGE members may be approached by non-WHO sources for their views, comments and statements on particular matters of public health concern and asked to state the views of SAGE. SAGE members shall refer such enquiries to WHO. Meetings and operational procedures SAGE will normally meet twice annually. The frequency of meetings may, however, be adjusted as necessary. Decisions or recommendations will, as a rule, be taken by consensus. UNICEF, the Secretariat of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), and WHO Regional Offices will participate as observers in SAGE meetings and deliberations. WHO may also invite other observe rs to SAGE meetings, including re presentatives from WHO regional technical advisory groups, non-governmental organizations (NGO), international professional organizations, technical agencies, donor organizations and associations of manufacturers of vaccines and immunization technologies. Additional experts may be invited to meetings, as appropriate, to further contribute to specific agenda items. Page 18 SAGE will work with WHO to develop its prio rities of work and meeting agendas. SAGE will be kept informed by WHO and partner agencies of progress in implementation of strategies and the attainment of objectives at country and regional level. SAGE will also be informed of policies and recommendations set by the WHO regional technical a dvisory groups. WHO, with advice from SAGE, will determine which policy recommendation issues and information from other WHO technical advisory groups should be brought to th e attention of SAGE. SAGE Working Groups are es tablished as resources intended to increase the effectiveness of SAGE deliberations by reviewing and providing evidence ba sed information and options for recommendations together with implications of the various options to be discussed by the full SAGE in an open public forum. These Working Groups are established on a time limited basis in exceptional situations to help address specific questions identified by SAGE when the issue is particularly complicated a nd could not be addressed by existing standing WHO advisory committees. The need and charge for a working group is discussed and agreed during SAGE meetings. The purpose, structur e and functioning of the Working Groups is described in detail in Annex 3. In addition to attendance of mee tings, active participations will be expected from all SAGE members throughout the year, including participation in SAGE working groups, video a nd telephone conferences as well as interactions via e-mail. Review of documents may also be solicited. SAGE members may be requested to participate as observers in other important WHO departmental or cross-departmental meetings. SAGE members will not be remunerated for their partic ipation in SAGE; however, reasonable expenses such as travel expenses incurred by attendance at SAGE or related meetings will be compensated by WHO. SAGE reports to the WHO Director-General (or designee( s)). The SAGE chairperson will debrief the Director- General (or designee) and the IVB Director following each SAGE meeting. Minutes of SAGE meetings will be taken and circulated among SAGE members. The reco mmendations/conclusions of SAGE meeting shall be published, with the prior approval of WHO, in the Weekly Epidemiologi cal Record and posted on the IVB Departmental website within two months of each S AGE meeting. In addition these recommendations and conclusions will be further translated and posted on the IVB Departmental website. Page 19Annex 1: DECLARATION OF INTERESTS FOR WHO EXPERTS The assistance of distinguished authorities knowledgeable in a variety of medical and scientific professions is essential to th e solution of international health issues. It is expected that persons qual ified to serve as an expert fo r the World Health Organization (WHO) may have private interests rel ated to the subject of their expertise. At the same time , it is imperative that situations be avoided in which such interests may unduly affect, or may be perceived to affect, an expert's impartiality or the outcome of wo rk in which he/she was involved. To assure the highest integrity, and hence public confidence, in the activities of the Organization, WHO regulations and polici es require that all experts serving in an advisory role disclose any circumstances which could give rise to a potential conflict of interest (i.e., any interest which may affect, or may reasonably be perceived to affect, the expert's objectivity and independence). According ly, in this Declaration of Interest form, you are reques ted to disclose any financial, professional or other interest relevant to the subje ct of the work or meeting in which you will be involved and any interest that could be significantly affected by the outcome of the meeting or work.

Occas ionally the Working Group C hair, in consultation with the Lead WHO st aff and the SAGE Chair, may re quest the participation of add itional disease / vaccine experts who are not members of the working group. These may include SAGE members, organization representatives, industry representatives/exper ts, public health officials and faculty of acade mic institutions.

S A G E Working Group Chairs, other Working Group representatives, or the Working Groups per se are not empowered to speak on behalf of SAGE. Rather, they are utilized by the SAGE to gather and organize information upon which the SAGE can deliberate and act. Thus , while SAGE Working Groups can and should examine an area in detail and define the issues, including development of options for Page 25recommendations, the actual processes of group deliberation terminating in development of group consensus and recommendations m ust occur in the open public forum of SAGE meetings. Working Group Process. E f f e c t i v e c o m m u n i c a t i o n a n d a s t r o n g w o r k i n g c o l l a b o r a t i o n b e tween the Working Group Chair and the Lead WHO staff are significant determinants of the effectiveness of a Working Group. The development of a brief (1-2 pages) summary of each Workin g Group meeting by one of these people will facilitate the function of the Working Group. Summaries should be provided to the SAGE Exec utive secretary so that IVB senior staff, immunization Regional Advisers and SAGE members can be informed in real time of progress an d issues. With the Lead WHO Staff, the Chair of the Working Group develops a plan for routine operations of the Group. Working Groups accomplish most of their work th rough teleconferences. A set day and time for r outine monthly teleconferences may be establishe d, in order to allows standing teleconferences to be arranged and Working Group members to anticipate and reserve time for these teleconferences. The frequency of Working Gr oup teleconferences may be changed depending on the urgency of issues being conside red by the group and the amount of preparatory work needed prior to a topic being brought up for plenary discussion and decision ma king at SAGE. Some Working Groups may more effectively achieve their purpose through exchange of e-mail communications with intermitten t teleconferences. I n - p e r s o n m e e t i n g s o f W o r k i n g G r o u p s m a y f a c i l i t a t e p r o g r e s s . I f possible, they should be scheduled in association with SAGE meetings and should be anticipated at least 2 months in advance of the SAGE meeting. WHO routinely supports travel costs for th e duration of SAGE meetings for SA GE members, chairs of regional technical advisory groups, WHO Regional Advisers and any experts invited to present at SAGE. WHO may support travel for additiona l persons for the purpose of a WG meeting. Such requests should be brought to the SAGE Executive Secretary fo r consideration on a case by case basis, with justification for the increased costs. A s i s s u e s m a t u r e , p r o p o s a l s f o r p r e s e n t a t i o n t o t h e S A G E s h o u l d b e submitted to the SAGE Executive secretary at least 10 weeks ahead of each SAGE meeting for circulation to SAGE members and to WHO staff. At th is stage, formal interaction between the SA GE Working Group Chair, lead WHO staff, SAGE Executive secretary and the SAGE Chair should occur allowing for a briefing on the is sue at hand and ensuring that areas of potential conflict are recognized prior to the meeting itself. D e c i s i o n t o p r o c e e d w i t h t a b l i n g t h e i s s u e at the next SAGE meeting will then be taken jointly by the Ch air of SAGE and IVB Director after consideration of issues raised during the consultative process. M a n a g e m e n t of Conflict of Interest / Undue Influence W h e n a S A G E W o r k i n g G r o u p i s f o r m e d , a n d a t t h e s t a r t o f each Working Group meeting, participants should respond to a request to report conflicts of interest relevant to the focus of the Working Group. This is done using the eDOI. SAGE members, organization representatives or WHO staff who have conflicts of interest may not participate in the Working Group. Persons who serve as consultants, may participate in the Working Group despite conflicts of interest if, in the judgment of the SAGE Chair, SAGE Exe cutive Secretary, Working Group Chair and lead WHO staff they bring speci fic expertise that is essential to the efforts of the Working Group. However, conflicts, both personal and those of their liaison orga nization (in the case of liaison representatives), must be dec lared and recorded at the beginning of each Working Group meeting. Partic ipation of all persons with declared conflicts will be restricte d by the Working Group Chair and lead WHO staff to that necessary for the Working Group to benefit fr om the expertise provided by the consultant.

This report provides a summary of the discus- sions, conclusions and recommendations.2 report from the WHo department of immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals In 2011, globally 90% of children received (DTP1) and the third dose (DTP3) remained problematic in several coun- tries, resulting in global DTP3 coverage estimated at only 83%. In 64 of the 194 WHO member states, DTP3 coverage was <90%. If every child who received DTP1 also completed the primary vaccination series, an additional 30 countries would reach the goal of 90% DTP3 coverage. Concerns were expressed over vaccine coverage, which has remained level over the last few years, and the degree of un- certainty in global coverage estimates, which is not reported. The degree of un- certainty both in terms of precision and potential bias is needed to avoid misinter- pretation and a negative impact on policy formulation and implementation.

The Emergency Plan of Action to maintain measles/rubella regional elimination in the Americas was developed to maintain high quality sur- veillance and high levels of immunization coverage, and ensure effective outbreak response. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has success - fully sustained high immunization rates due to high levels of population demand, including in those coun - tries which have recently experienced civil unrest; how - ever there is concern that reductions in coverage may occur over the longer term if insecurity is prolonged. 7KH\u00035HJLRQDO\u0003&RPPLWWHH\u0003UHDI\u00c0UPHG\u0003WKH\u0003LPSRUWDQFH\u0003RI\u0003 pooled vaccine procurement for non-GA VI eligible low- middle-income countries (LMICs).

SAGE acknowledged the global successes in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases but noted that deter- mined efforts were still needed to sustain and enhance these achievements. SAGE stressed that country owner- ship of immunization as an integral component of pri- mary care is essential as well as the need to assure corresponding political commitment to this approach from the highest levels of government. A constraint experienced across Regions was that of repetitive shortfalls in vaccine supply, both for existing vaccination programmes (in particular for DTP-con- taining vaccines) as well as for new/emerging vaccines, and the impact on vaccine coverage in several countries. The need for SAGE to address this issue was noted. gocoque du s\u00e9rogroupe A n'a le dixi\u00e8me la Am\u00e9riques a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9, pour couverture vaccinale une \u00e0 une demande des populations, R\u00e9gion M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e orientale a de situation G\u00b7LQVpFXULWp\u0003VH\u0003SURORQJH\u0011\u0003/H\u0003&RPLWp\u0003UpJLRQDO\u0003D\u0003UpDI\u00c0UPp\u0003O\u00b7LP - portance des achats group\u00e9s tranche inf\u00e9rieure (PRITI) ne remplissant pas GA VI.

SAGE expressed strong concern that despite high cover- age with primary and booster pertussis vaccination, there has been a recent resurgence of pertussis in some industrialized countries including among the very young. Reasons for this are complex but may include more rapid waning of immunity with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines compared to whole cell vaccine. It was agreed that SAGE would establish a working group on pertussis to prepare for a SAGE review of the data and to consider updating current pertussis vaccine recom- mendations. As it will take a year to formulate this ad- vice SAGE advised countries considering a switch from whole cell to aP vaccines to await further SAGE guid- ance, or to themselves carefully review the latest evi- dence on aP pertussis vaccine effectiveness and the possibility that such a switch may lead to a less favour- able outcome in terms of pertussis disease control.

Further to the November 2011 SAGE recommendation, a technical expert group was established to provide advice to WHO on the evaluation of tuberculosis vaccines. This group will provide guidance on the data that is needed from clinical trials to enable an assessment of the pos- sible public health impact of new tuberculosis vaccines. The group will also guide interpretation of data from Phase II, III and IV trials, with a particular focus on the assessment of long-term safety and effectiveness.

This included the adoption of re- vised recommendations for oral poliovirus vaccines; diphtheria, tetanus, and combined with DTP antigens; live attenuated Japanese encephalitis vac- cines; and a new guideline for candidate malaria vaccines. ECBS will also initiate the establishment of global standards for vaccines against enterovirus 71, which are being developed in one part of the world with potential for broad public health use. SAGE had previously requested that a paper be deve- loped, highlighting the circumstances in which off-label use of any vaccine could be recommended, while clari- fying the differences between regulatory decisions and public health recommendations.

Discussions have begun at the Regional level to update regional immunization plans in alignment with GV AP and to establish processes to moni- tor and report progress to the respective Regional Com- mittees each year. The WHO and UNICEF guidance for preparation of national multi-year and annual plans for immunization are being updated to align them with the guiding principles and strategic objectives of GV AP and to foster greater alignment with national health sector plans. The proposed structure and process for monitoring the implementation of the GV AP through a Monitoring & Evaluation /Accountability Framework was described. The framework has 3 elements: (i) monitoring results (based on the indicators for the GV AP Goals and Stra- tegic Objectives); (ii) monitoring commitments and resources; and (iii) an independent review of progress. 3URJUHVV\u0003ZDV\u0003GHVFULEHG\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003HIIRUWV\u0003WR\u0003\u00c0QDOL]H\u0003PRQL - WRULQJ\u0003 LQGLFDWRUV\u000f\u0003 HVWDEOLVK\u0003 RSHUDWLRQDO\u0003 GH\u00c0QLWLRQV\u000f\u0003 sources of data, and the reporting process.

De plus, 6 Draft global reported. SAGE provided feed- back on the proposed activities for the technical group to take into consideration as they begin their work. SAGE was pleased to see the work being proposed, in- cluding the economic analysis, and the plan to ensure external validation. Finally, a summary of the process to review and report progress on the implementation of GV AP at the national, regional and global levels was presented. This included the constitution of a SAGE working group that will un - dertake a detailed review of progress and prepare a re - port to SAGE on an annual basis. The report, incorporat - ing feedback from SAGE, will form the basis of the WHO secretariat annual reports to the Executive Board and the WHA. The reports to the WHA will also be shared with the independent Expert Review Group for the United Nations Secretary General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health. An open call for nominations of experts to serve on the working group will be initiated. Members will serve in their personal capacities and will be chosen by a selection panel including representation from the lead agencies for the implementation of GV AP and a representative of the Civil Society Organizations. SAGE made the following recommendations on the pro- posed Monitoring & Evaluation/Accountability Frame- work: Monitoring indicators 6$*(\u0003PDGH\u0003VSHFL\u00c0F\u0003FRPPHQWV\u0003DQG\u0003UHFRPPHQGDWLRQV\u0003 on the following: Goal 3: Meet vaccination coverage targets in every region, country and community. SAGE noted that district level coverage data are impor- tant for monitoring equity in delivery of immunization within countries and for operational and planning pur- poses. However, SAGE recognized the important resource requirement for conducting surveys to gener- ate coverage estimates for all districts in a country and proposed that as an alternative, countries may choose to conduct such surveys in selected \"high risk\" districts that are likely to have low coverage. Such surveys should be done at least twice in the decade. Strategic objective 2: Individuals and communities un- derstand the value of vaccines and demand immuniza- tion both as a right and a responsibility.

Such an indicator may be devel- oped for presentation to the SAGE DoV GV AP working group in 2013.

SAGE recommended that an annual narrative report should be prepared on vaccine price trends for low and middle-income countries, including self-procuring countries, as well as progress on supporting vaccine procurement mechanisms. Other proposed changes were accepted with the proviso that the SAGE working group should continuously review the need for reformulation of the indicators or mechanisms for collection and reporting of data.

SAGE also recog- nized the urgency for having approximate estimates and recommended that the technical group provide pre- liminary estimates for SAGE review in November 2013. optimization of '@DLNOGHKTR\u00d0HM\u00c7TDMY@D type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine schedules Hib conjugate vaccines have been in use for >20 years with remarkable success. By 2011, 179 (92%) of coun- tries worldwide had introduced Hib-containing vac- cines. However, WHO estimates that only 43% of infants worldwide received at least 3 doses of Hib- containing vaccine in 2011, given the large populations of children in some countries not yet using Hib vaccine and the lack of full implementation or coverage in others with routine use. SAGE was requested to consider the optimal Hib im- munization schedules for children in different epide- miological settings. SAGE discussion was informed by: (i) 3 systematic reviews (2 independent RCTs reviews, 1 on case-control and cohort studies) of the effect of Hib-containing vaccines on the immune response and on various disease outcomes, (ii) a global review of the epidemiology of Hib disease in children, (iii) a system- atic review of Hib vaccine herd effects and, (iv) a review of the long term impact of Hib vaccine in 34 countries which had introduced the vaccine more than 5 years DJR\u0011\u00037KH\u0003RXWFRPHV\u0003RI\u0003WKHVH\u0003UHYLHZV\u0003ZHUH\u0003XVHG\u0003WR\u0003GH\u00c0QH\u0003 the parameters for a model incorporating the potential of various immunization schedules and of improve- ments in vaccine delivery timeliness and coverage, in order to assess impact on disease burden. During the discussion, SAGE members noted that the evidence on the number of primary doses and the need for booster doses requires further evaluation before recommendations can be made on optimizing the cur- rent schedule. In particular, the experience of the United Kingdom, where the introduction of Hib vaccine into the childhood immunization programme in 1992 led to an initial reduction in the incidence of Hib dis- ease in all age groups followed by a subsequent resur- gence, needs to be further evaluated. There were a num- ber reasons that may have contributed to the Hib resurgence: these include waning immunity after a 2/3/4 month priming schedule possibly exacerbated by the use of combination vaccines containing aP , together with the lack of boosting due to the herd immunity effect of the UK programme on Hib carriage (achieved as a result of high coverage and a catch-up programme to 4 years of age). This illustrated the complexity of the issues surrounding recommendations as to the optimal schedule for use of Hib vaccines in different epidemio- logical settings. SAGE considered that the information regarding the interval between doses should also be re-analysed and that additional immunological studies should be con- sidered. A more in-depth evaluation of duration of pro- tection after each dose of Hib containing vaccine was des personnes ayant Il a d'\u00e9tudier les calendriers valence Hib sur la r\u00e9ponse immunitaire et sur les issues des maladies, ii) un examen mondial de l'\u00e9pid\u00e9miologie de l'infection chez l'enfant, iii) un examen syst\u00e9matique des effets de groupe de la vaccination contre le Hib et iv) un examen de l'impact du vaccin anti-Hib sur le long terme dans 34 pays l'ayant introduit il y a plus de 5 ans.

AMR has achieved elimination of both measles and rubella and the WPR is approaching interruption of endemic measles transmission. In addition, the number of countries using rubella vaccine in their routine childhood immunization programme has been steadily increasing. However, despite this progress, a careful assessment of the comprehensive reports pre - sented indicates that based on current trends and pro - gramme performance, the 2015 global targets as well as Regional elimination targets in EUR (2015), EMR (2015) and AFR (2020) will not be achieved on time. SAGE urged countries and partners to raise the visibil - ity of measles and rubella elimination activities and to ensure that they receive adequate priority and re - sources as a central component of the GV AP . In keeping with the GV AP target of measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO Regions by 2020, SAGE urged SEAR to establish a measles elimination goal and AFR, EMR, SEAR and WPR to work towards establishing regional rubella elimination goals. SAGE endorsed the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan for 2012-2020 and recommended full implementa - tion of the key strategies in a manner that promotes country ownership, strengthens the immunization system, promotes equity and reinforces linkages with polio eradication and other programmes. SAGE noted that some key components of the strategic plan remain under-funded and urged countries and partners to work towards closing this funding gap. ,Q\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014\u000f\u0003!\u0015\u0013\u0003PLOOLRQ\u0003FKLOGUHQ\u0003GLG\u0003QRW\u0003UHFHLYH\u0003WKHLU\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003 dose of measles vaccine on time and countries with low routine immunization coverage continue to experience the highest burden of measles.

Despite increases in MCV1 coverage and the introduc- tion of MCV2 as part of routine immunization pro- grammes, large outbreaks have occurred in a number of countries in Europe, Africa and Asia over the past 24 months. SAGE noted the changing epidemiology of measles, with a shift in age distribution of cases towards older age groups, which is consistent with a programme that primarily targets young children. SAGE urged coun- tries to conduct in-depth investigations of their out- breaks to determine the underlying reasons and the role of these older age groups in sustaining transmission, and to develop approaches to target these older age groups as appropriate. In considering age groups for measles vaccination, rubella susceptibility in older age groups also needs to be addressed. SAGE noted the gaps in the immunization coverage and surveillance data needed to guide the programme. Regions and countries are urged to strengthen report- ing of district-level vaccination coverage, strengthen an integrated measles and rubella case-based, laboratory- supported surveillance of fever and rash illness, and introduce surveillance of congenital rubella syndrome. Closer linkages between measles and rubella strategic plan, SAGE recom- mended that countries and global immunization part- ners assess the potential synergies and take active steps, where appropriate, to adapt and apply the polio infra- structure and lessons learnt to support achievement of measles and rubella elimination targets and strengthen- ing of routine immunization programmes. SAGE welcomed recent routine coverage, mea- sles-rubella and measles supplementary immunization activities, and timely outbreak response vaccination. SAGE recommends that countries seize this unique opportunity and commit additional national resources to ensure that programme planning and implementa- tion is of the highest quality. Each campaign should follow established \"best practices\" and be independently evaluated to ensure homogeneous vaccination coverage of >95%.

The framework should be evaluated and adjusted over time, based on country experience. SAGE was concerned by the challenges and high costs resulting from the continuous importation of measles into countries which have achieved elimination, and suggested that the possibility that international travel regulations could potentially reduce the likelihood of measles importation be explored. SAGE welcomed the report from the measles aerosol project. This project, led by WHO, aims to achieve li- censing of at least one method for respiratory delivery of a currently licensed measles vaccine. SAGE was pre- sented with data from clinical studies, especially on a Phase II/III trial in India. The results from the pivotal non-inferiority immunogenicity trial showed that the per-protocol being -9.2% (95% CI: -12.2%, concluded that the tested aerosol vaccine may not be suitable for primary vaccination of infants against measles. 1HYHUWKHOHVV\u000f\u00036$*(\u0003UHFRJQL]HG\u0003WKH\u0003SRWHQWLDO\u0003EHQH\u00c0WV\u0003RI\u0003 a measles aerosol vaccine because it could be used by non-health-care workers in low-resource settings in the context of outbreaks, acute emergencies and outreach.

SAGE noted that the list of VPDs to be considered as part of the framework should be extended to include rabies, and that the current categorization of vaccines should be changed to focus on the mode of transmis- sion of the pathogen.

New vaccine introduction in middle-income countries (miCs): current initiatives to address \u00c6M@MBH@K\u00d0BG@KKDMFDR\u00d0 In 20087 a n d 2 0 1 08 t h e S A G E m a d e a n u m be r o f r e c o m - mendations to WHO regarding assessing and addressing the challenges faced by middle-income countries (MICs) in immunization, particularly in the introduction of new vaccines. SAGE was presented with a draft paper entitled \"Global Support for New Vaccine Implementation in Middle- Income Countries\" . The information provided in the paper was complemented by presentations from WHO, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and UNICEF. SAGE noted that the MICs have a combined population of 5 billion and an annual birth cohort of 96 million and are home to nearly 75% of the world's poorest populations. Providing support to MICs for immuniza- tion programmes and new vaccine introduction is crit- ically important for equity, both between and within countries. Since 2000, 40 of the 111 MICs have received support from the GA VI Alliance, 3 countries have graduated from support, and a further 16 will graduate in 2015- \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0019\u0011\u00036$*(\u0003QRWHG\u0003WKDW\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003KHDOWK\u0003JDLQV\u0003KDYH\u0003EHHQ\u0003 made by those countries eligible for GA VI support, gains not apparent in countries which have not had access to either GA VI funding or to technical assistance from partners. Those MICs graduating from GA VI support will require assistance from development partners in the transition from that support. SAGE noted that some of the MICs are struggling to introduce new vaccines, in part due to an inability to access pricing appropriate to the country's economic status. As an example, a dose of HPV vaccine was reported to cost 4 times less in one Western industrialized European country than in one Eastern European developing country. SAGE noted that the constraints for non-GA VI eligible MICs to introduce new vaccines extend beyond pricing and procurement, and include equity, sustainability, regulation, capacity building and partner support. The focus of development partners on a restricted group of countries and subsequent concentration of technical support and capacity building in these areas has limited the support available for other countries. MICs in the EUR also report a lack of capacity to address negative attitudes towards new vaccines among parents and medical workers. 7 See No 22, 2008, pp. 193-208. 8 See No 1-2, 2011, pp. 1-16.explication plus compl\u00e8te des principes \u00e9clair\u00e9. elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9bat, les catastrophes \u00e9tant de nature tr\u00e8s diverse.

EMRO is working closely with and is paying special attention to the countries affected by political turmoil. During 2012, EMRO provided support to Libya for reviewing the vaccination schedule in preparation for introduction of PCV and rotavirus vaccine. EMRO has conducted effective vaccine management assessment in Egypt and 2 workshops for implementation of the recommendations took place February 2013. Egypt is also being supported for preparing for introduction of pentavalent vaccine. EMRO is also supporting conducting vaccination cluster coverage survey in Egypt to identify any negative effect on routine vaccination coverage. EMRO has provided support to Syria for implementation of MMR and Polio SIAs in November 2012. EMRO continued to support Y emen in implementation of integrated outreach activities to improve routine vaccination coverage, specially in hard to reach areas and follow up measles SIAs targeting children 9 months-10 years was successfully conducted in Y emen in April 2012. EMRO is supporting Tunisia for preparing for Measles/Rubella SIAs for control of the rubella outbreak. General SAGE requested that cold chain and vaccine management, thiomersal and the non-specific effects of vaccines also be discussed by SAGE in the future.Agenda item Nov 2011 Ongoing A specific session Information on vaccines for an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to prepare a global legally binding instrument on the use of mercury took place at the April 2012 SAGE meeting. It discussed thiomersal and alternative preservatives and presentations. A preliminary session on the non-specific effects of vaccines is slotted for April 2013 to discuss the proposed approach. A SAGE working group on non-specific effects was established and held its first teleconference on 12 March 2013. It is expected that the full analysis will be presented to SAGE in November 2013 or April 2014. Other agenda items have been added on the master list of items to be discussed by SAGE and will be ready for discussion in the next 2 years. General SAGE recommended that ways to improve curricula for medical personnel should be explored.Action Nov 2008 Ongoing The African region started to work with academia to develop a pre-service curricula for nursing and medical staff. Annual courses for medical and nursing staff take place in collaboration with Network for education and support in immunization (NESI). An evaluation of the impact of pre/service training and curricula changes is ongoing in 9 countries in AFRO. An evaluation was conducted in late 2011 and a draft report has been prepared but it is not available for wider circulation yet. It first needs approval from countries involved. Expected early 2013. Report not still recieved. General SAGE noted the important potential of immunization programmes for strengthening the overall health system, suggesting that good examples be documented and shared.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing An analysis of health systems impact of new vaccine introduction was presented to SAGE in April 2012. SAGE endorsed revised principles for adding a vaccine to a national immunization system while strengthening the immunization and health systems and endorsed the proposal that the 2005 WHO Vaccine Introduction Guidelines be updated to assist decision-makers and managers with identifying and taking opportunities to strengthen the health system through new vaccines introduction. General SAGE recommended that new approaches, such as periodic intensification of routine immunization, be carefully evaluated prospectively to determine their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.Action Apr 2009 Ongoing Work with Immunization Basics to document country experiences is wrapping up. Mission to observe Zimbabwe Child Health Days which included routine catch up doses was undertaken in June 2009. Final report available (17 June 2010). Mission to Macedonia was undertaken in April/May 2010 to document the European Immunization Week (EIW) (draft report has been reviewed by WHO and will be finalized shortly). This topic has been referred to the WHO Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (IPAC) which has discussed it intensively at its meetings June and November 2010, particularly the issue of no longer being able to use the delivery strategy to reliably disinguish whether a dose is routine and supplementary. Jointly WHO & UNICEF prepared a Guidance Note outlining four criteria to determine if a given vaccination is a routine or supplemental dose. IPAC endorsed the Guidance Note at its meeting September 27-28, 2011. WHO/UNICEF are now proceeding to disseminate the criteria and consult with stakeholders regarding the consequences. Page 1 of 1825 March 2013Page 60Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up General SAGE encouraged the European region to document and share its experiences in country profiling, tailoring responses and using novel communication strategies to effect behaviour change.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing EURO is working to give countries tools to address vaccine hesitancy at the individual level. These include: 1. Development of the Tailoring Immunization Programs \"TIP\" toolkit, which allows a country or sub-national level authority to segment/profile a population based on behaviours rather than background characteristics. The resulting group profile can help inform programmatic responses that could be communication-oriented or inform improved service delivery. Best practices from other disease programs are included that can be adapted for country-specific issues. TIP was piloted in Bulgaria in 2012. The Toolkit is being further pilot tested in Sweden among migrants, marginalized and anthroposophic communities. The toolkit will be launched during EIW2013 (April 22-27, 2013) 2. Strengthening the ability of member states to handle crises in vaccine confidence and trust through a guidelines document on vaccine safety communication. It is to be launched during European Immunization Week 2013 (April 22-27, 2013). This was done at the request of EPI managers. 3. Advocating through Immunization Week, which began in 2006. Activities are independent for each country. 4. Strengthening the use of new media. Well-ranked bloggers who write in Russian and English will be brought in to dialogue about how to better engage around vaccine confidence. A vaccines social media strategy is under development and an smart-phone immunization tracker/reminder 'app' for parents will be launched on April 24, 2013. 5. An online vaccines resource centre was launched in 2012 and has been strengthened and improved through 2012-2013, with a number of MS using or translating the caregiver and health-care worker tools presented. General SAGE requested that a paper be developed, highlighting the circumstances under which off-label use of any vaccine can be recommended, while clarifying the differences between regulatory decisions and public health recommendations. Legal and programmatic implications of off-label recommendations and the need for clear communication should be considered.Action Apr 2012 Pending Advice being sought through the ECBS - added to agenda of next meeting, 15-19 October 2012. SAGE had previously requested that a paper be developed, highlighting the circumstances in which off-label use of any vaccine could be recommended, while clarifying the differences between regulatory decisions and public health recommendations. During the SAGE November 2012 meeting, SAGE further requested ECBS to prepare guidance for national regulatory authorities on studies needed to support evidence-based off-label use of vaccines which benefit public health. It was noted that for regulators, product specific data are paramount. SAGE requested that an additional document be prepared to advise the national immunization technical advisory committees about the type of data that might support a policy recommendation to use a vaccine outside its licensed schedule in order to achieve public health benefits such as operational simplicity or cost savings. General - GVAP The SAGE working group should continuously review the need for reformulation of the indicators or mechanisms for collection and reporting of data.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing The selection process for the DoV SAGE Working Group is still ongoing and should be finalized prior to the April 2013 SAGE meeting. Once established the Working Group will review the GVAP indicators and mechanisms. General - GVAP SAGE requested consideration of the establishment of a SAGE standing working group to monitor GVAP implementation.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Terms of Reference for a SAGE DoV-GVAP standing working group were discussed at the November 2012 SAGE meeting. A call for nominations and selection of working group members was launched in January 2013. The selection panel is to review all nominations on March 25 and the composition of the group should be settled prior to the April 2013 SAGE meeting. Page 2 of 1825 March 2013Page 61Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up General - GVAP SAGE also recognized the urgency for having approximate cost and impact estimates and recommended that the technical group provide preliminary estimates for SAGE review in November 2013.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing As part of GVAP resources invested in immunization will be tracked and monitored on a yearly basis throughout the decade, using the System of Health Accounts (SHA 2011) framework, the global standard to report spending in the health sector. The process to monitor resources invested in immunization will put emphasis on strengthening country capacity and creating a single platform for collecting, analyzing and reporting annually on all health expenditures, including those on priority diseases or programmes like immunization. This is intended to unify under a single platform other existing resource-tracking efforts, such as those being undertaken on national health accounts, and those for the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health, and for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This exercise will not only ensure regular and efficient reporting of good-quality data as part of the monitoring process, but also promote accountability and sustainability for immunization financing. Accessibility of affordable vaccines: gaps and WHO's role in supporting emerging manufacturersSAGE suggested to monitor gaps and opportunities and consecutively develop a systematic process to responds to these needs in collaboration with keys partners. A perspective is to be presented at a future SAGE meeting on accessibility of affordable vaccines.Pending Nov 2010 Ongoing Activities to lead to better vaccine price information and vaccine pricing transparency are being considered and under discussion for funding. Contribution of WHO to the DoV work stream on global access. IVB staff are actively participating in the annual DCVMN meeting to update them on new developments, concerns and issues related to vaccine presentations, prequalification, regulation financing and priority country need. Discussions have taken place with DCVMN as such and individual DCVMN members to consult on potential and actual role of emerging manufactuers in supplying affordable vaccines . This could be followed by offering the possibility for bilateral meetings with manufacturers to discuss this issue as well as exchange on strategic orientations as this is already being done with some members of The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA). General discussions on the process of technology transfers are taking place under the leadership of the Evidence Information and Research Cluster. IVB has launched a new project on vaccine product, price and procurement. The purpose of the project is to support GAVI graduating and lower and middle income countries to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines through the provision of improved vaccine product and price information for decision-making. It is a 3-year project funded by the BMGF . Childhood mortality SAGE noted the recommendation by QUIVER (now IVIR-AC) that WHO would encourage countries to collect local data at country level and not only estimated age specific mortality rates by epidemiological modeling or expert elicitation.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing All models reviewed by IVIR-AC are hampered by the lack of primary data, and more efforts should be made to make such data readily available. Specically, for pertussis disease burden estimation IVIR-AC suggests validating the parameter estimates against data from Senegal and Europe as a first step, although primary data from developing countries that is currently not publicly available would provide a more compelling comparator for validation. For polio more primary data should be made available for all models. IVIR-AC recommends that polio related data should be made available for multiple modeling groups to encourage comparison of results using different approaches. Page 3 of 1825 March 2013Page 62Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Cholera vaccines Oral Cholera Vaccines(OCVs) - SAGE will further consider their use in endemic countries and whether a stockpile should be developed, particularly as current manufacturing capacity is limited.Action Apr 2011 Ongoing A meeting on use of oral cholera vaccines in complex emergencies was held in early May 2011, and the WHA passed a resolution on mechanism for cholera control and prevention was passed in the May 2011 assembly. In addition, a meeting on cholera vaccine stockpile was held in Geneva from 6 to 7 September 2011. A meeting on the experience of Zanzibar to use cholera vaccine as a preventive tool was held in February and the Zanzibar Government is keen to use the vaccine island-wide if support is forthcoming. Cholera vaccine has been introduced as a pilot in Haiti as well as in Guinea. The preliminary reports from both appear highly encouraging on the utility of vaccine to prevent cholera. In 2012 the WHO Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases Dept convened an expert working group to develop SOPs for implementation of the cholera vaccine stockpile for outbreak response, including definition of specific criteria for deployment of vaccine from the stockpile. Financial support has been identified (EU-ECHO, USAID-OFDA and three private entities). A request for procurement has been issued in a closed bid for 2 million doses of vaccine with closure of the bid being 5th of April 2013. The planned AFRO regional stockpile preparations are underway with the stockpile anticipated to be active 01 July 2013. Decade of Vaccines IVR was encouraged to contribute actively to the research component of the DoV.Action Apr 2011 Ongoing IVR participates in the Research and Development subgroup, and tracks research issues emerging from delivery group. R&D working group meeting was held on 29 September 2011. Tentative list of research priorities short, mid and long-term was developed. IVR leads on coordinating R&D agenda with partners agencies. A formal memorandum was signed. Progress on establishing a vaccine research forum and implementation strategies in support of GVAP R&D related activities. Feedback from IPAC IPAC update. Information Nov 2011 Ongoing The last IPAC meeting was held in October 2012, and feedback was provided on this meeting as well as the April 2012 meeting, to SAGE in November 2012. The next IPAC meeting will occur April 2013, one week prior to the SAGE meeting. Key topics on IPAC upcoming agenda include solar refrigeration guidance to countries, development of unvaccinated framework, health worker checklist piloting and controlled temperature chain (CTC) application with Meningococcal A vaccine MenAfriVac. Financing SAGE identified the need to support countries that become ineligible and lower middle income countries through pooled procurement.Action Oct 2009 Ongoing Various activities are conducted at global and regional level to support non GAVI and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) - At global level: a study to enhance global knowledge and understanding of the challenges that Lower Middle Income Countries face as they explore potential adoption of new vaccines. The study was completed in March 2011. Finding and preliminary conclusions and recommendations were presented to the SAGE in November 2010. At regional level: EMRO is working with MICs in the region to set up a pooled procurement system with the support of UNICEF SD, CDC and PAHO and other partners . Identification of graduating countries and their potential constraints and issues is ongoing with GAVI and UNICEF to define measures and activities to overcome the obstacles and develop transition plans. 2 regional and 6 country assessment were conducted in 2012 on GAVI graduating countries. Despite some progress, the challenges are enormous on the financial aspects as well as on ownership, decision making, capacity, pricing and procurement aspects. The establishment of a pooled procurement in EMRO has been decided by the Regional Committee in 2012 and in under development despite the unstable political situation in the region. In November 2012, SAGE reviewed the situation faced by middle income countries including countries graduating from GAVI support and made strong recommendation calling for a global and coordinated effort to support MIC and for the establishment of a task force on Middle Income countries to advocate and support the implementation of the platform discussed at the November 2012 session on MIC. Terms of Reference have been drafted, potential composition has been identified and contact with key partners are underway to set up the SAGE recommended task force. Page 4 of 1825 March 2013Page 63Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Financing SAGE requests that WHO conduct further situation analysis of financial challenges for low or middle-income countries and consultation with countries concerned & partners to distil issues to more actionable activities.Action Apr 2008 Ongoing A Request for Proposal (RFP) has been drafted and submitted to the BMGF for funding. This was accepted, the RFP was issued in March 2009 and selection was made in June 2009. R4D was selected to conduct the study on LMIC to be launched early November 2009. Preliminary results were presented at the GIM and NUVI meeting in 2008 and 2010, findings and initial conclusions and recommendations will be presented to the SAGE in November 2010. Actionable activities will be then adopted and discuss with partners for implementation. Work is now underway to consider ways of addressing the potential obstacles and issues faced by the 16 graduating countries from GAVI support. A Sharepoint on Middle-Income Countries and new vaccine introduction was created by IVB-WHO to facilitate data collection and exchange between the Middle-Income Country working group members. A Middle-Income Country presentation by EMRO during the 2009 WHA took place and was well received - the May 2008 WHA resolution on immunization referred explicitly to Middle-Income Countries. Sessions on Middle-Income Country was held during the NUVI meeting in June 2008 and 2010, an updated background document was discussed and an action plan for 2009-12 was approved with all concerned parties (vaccine industry, country and region representatives, WHO and UNICEF , Gates Foundation, ...). Ongoing discussions are taking place with UNICEF , BMGF and other entities to implement the R4D study recommendations. The draft GVAP has partly addressed some the issues but more clarity and consistency is needed. A brainstorming meeting was organized on the lower-middle-income countries activity information and coordination on 12-13 March at HQ. On this occasion we discussed concepts, general approaches and specific plans for MIC with the ultimate objective of developing a platform and way forward for engagement and co-ordination with partners. The results of this and other consultations was presented at the November 2012 SAGE. A session was held on Middle-Income countries. A draft paper entitled \"Global Support for New Vaccine Implementation in Middle-Income Countries\" was presented to SAGE. The information provided in the paper was complemented by presentations from WHO, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and UNICEF . Given the importance of the topic, SAGE requested that this issue and achievements be revisited in a subsequent meeting. Global vaccine safety BlueprintThe Blueprint implementation should be led by WHO and its partners. It should be aligned with other related WHO capacity-building efforts. This includes in particular immunization programme and national regulatory authorities strengthening together with the development of national expert advisory bodies. SAGE suggested that a mechanism be developed to enable prioritization of both activities and countries in the implementation of the Blueprint. SAGE invited the GAVI Alliance and other partners to support this implementation.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing The Global Vaccine Safety Initiative has been launched and hosted its first annual meeting in November 2012. A portfolio of activities is being developed to cover all 8 strategic objectives. Page 5 of 1825 March 2013Page 64Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up HIV SAGE requested regular updates on the progress of HIV-vaccine research.Action Apr 2010 Ongoing In 2010/2011, with an objective of addressing ethical and regulatory challenges for follow up activities after the announcement of the Thai RV144 trial, which demonstrated for the first time moderate 31.2% level of efficacy in preventing HIV infection and following SAGE recommendation on these aspects: WHO/IVR/HVI and UNAIDS implemented the following 2 activities: 1. Development of a new ethics guidance point on ethical involvement of populations with high risk for HIV infection (i.e. people who injecting drugs) through extensive regional consultations held in June 2010 in Istanbul for the Eastern Europe region and Kuala Lumpur for the Asian region. This consultation allowed for the development of recommendations and drafting a new guidance point to be included in the new edition of the WHO/UNAIDS Ethics Guidelines. 2. In support of regulatory frameworks, WHO/IVR/HVI and UNAIDS have initiated a project on the development of policy/discussion paper to facilitate national decision making with regard to the novel strategies for testing HIV vaccines, namely, the recently proposed Adaptive Trail Design). A background working paper was developed and discussed at an expert group meeting co-organized in collaboration with WHO, UNAIDS, IAVI, NIH and the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise. The expert group meeting took place on 10-11 February 2011 in New Y ork. As an outcome of this meeting a technical discussion paper has been developed targeting the national regulatory authorities in countries where this type of trials are being planned in the coming years. This paper has been submitted to the journal Vaccine for review. A written update will be provided on the progress of HIV-vaccine research for the November 2013 SAGE meeting. Hepatitis A Long-term protection from single or 2-dose schedules should be regularly monitored by countries and reviewed by SAGE.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Post-market surveillance continues in Argentina and a detailed report on the 2012 epidemiological situation was provided to WHO. There is still no identified breakthrough case among vaccinated children since the introduction of hepatitis A in the national immunization program in 2005. A slight increase in the number of reported cases in 2012 mostly in those 45 years of age and over may in part be due to a surveillance artifact as surveillance keeps improving and the result of natural (or due to the impact of vaccination) evolution of the risk in those too old to have been vaccinated. These occurring cases indicate that the risk persists in the population. As also requested by SAGE, an economic analysis of the impact of the single dose immunization strategy against hepatitis A in Argentina has been done. Estimated total vaccination cost for the 2006-2010 post vaccination period was ~US$ 45 million. Both health system and societal costs prevented totaled ~US$ 137 million with health systems cost ~US$ 44 million. Based on the Argentinian's experience, in 2012 both Colombia and Paraguay introduced a single dose national immunization schedule for 1 year old children. Page 6 of 1825 March 2013Page 65Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Hepatitis B SAGE recommended that the timely delivery of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (that is, within 24 hours of birth) should be used as a performance measure for all immunization programmes. Reporting and monitoring systems should be strengthened to improve the quality of data on the birth dose.Action Apr 2009 Ongoing A consultation on implementation of new universal birth dose recommendation was conducted in December 2010 with special focus on countries with a high percentage of home births. Outputs include a monograph documenting the systematic review and best practices from the consultation. IPAC reviewed this work in early 2011 and again in April 2012, and endorsed publication of 'Practices to Improve Coverage of the Hepatitis B birth dose vaccine'. From this, work is ongoing to develop field guidelines for scaling up Hepatitis B birth dose. The JRF (Joint Reporting Form) and associated materials have been revised to improve reporting of birth dose with a particular focus in WPRO and now steps are being taken to make HepB birth dose a WHO/UNICEF \"best estimate\" in line with previous SAGE recommendations. Analysis of timely birth dose data for 2008 shows no significant changes from 2006 analysis and major issue is lack of data quality. A study of the cost of scaling up the birth dose by country has been completed, based upon previously published methodology estimating the cost of implementing the GIVS goals. Hepatitis B All regions and associated countries should develop goals for hepatitis B control appropriate to their epidemiologic situations. Serologic surveys of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence, representative of the target population, will serve as the primary tool to measure the impact of immunization and achievement of the control goals.Action Nov 2008 Ongoing WHO HQ has completed and disseminated a new global viral hepatitis strategy. EMRO is working with Member States to ensure achievement of the Regional Committee goal for HBsAg reduction in vaccinated children. In 2012, WPR TAG endorsed the region's Hepatitis B Expert Resource Panel (ERP) proposal to set 2017 as the target year to achieve the goal of reducing childhood hepatitis B prevalence to <1%. SEARO has a draft regional strategy and will convene two meetings in 2012 to finalize. AFRO has convened a regional hepatitis TAG and will bring their input to the Regional Committee in 2012. EURO will consider a regional hepatitis B control goal. PAHO has resolved to eliminate hepatitis B virus transmission and is formulating a regional strategy. Documenting the Impact of Hepatitis B Immunization: best practices for conducting a serosurvey (WHO/IVB/11.08) has been published by the department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. Hib SAGE recommended that a revised summary of the evidence, including a critical appraisal of the evidence with GRADE tables and justification for proposed recommendations, should be presented to SAGE in April 2013.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing A revised summary of evidence including all the aspects suggested by SAGE along with the GRADE tables have been included in the SAGE Y ellow Book for the April 2013 meeting and will be discussed at the meeting. Page 7 of 1825 March 2013Page 66Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Immunization safety SAGE encourages development of simple technological solutions with improved environmental characteristics, and encourages donors to support such work as a priority.Action Nov 2007 Ongoing - Work is on-going through Project Optimize in collaboration with the Vaccine Packaging and Presentation Advisory Group to explore vaccine packaging that minimizes the impact on environment. VPPAG has 2 related streams of work 1) Working on recommendations to minimize primary, secondary, and tertiary container packaging. 2) Drafting a consensus statement with industry about use of materials for vaccine packaging that will minimize environmental impact. - A document on Environmental due diligence procedures has been developed and shared with GAVI. It expresses steps to be taken to minimize and manage waste from immunization activities in an environmentally friendly manner.The WHO reference document is: WHO policy paper on Health Care Waste Management(see http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/hcwmpolicy/en/index.html) - The health care waste component of Global Environment Facility (GEF) project is developing a small autoclave in Tanzania to treat waste produced in low income countries. The technology is ready and final administrative arrangements should be finalized in the coming weeks. - The issue of needle-cutters and WHO recommendation about their use have been in debate for at least 6 years now during every SIGN meeting. At the 2010 SIGN meeting, there was a special session on needle cutters. A Bangladesh study on the safety of using needle removers was reviewed. The results showed that hub cutters do not lead to increased needle-stick injuries among HCWs. Based on the findings of this study, although there was no unanimity among the group, it was decided to state that WHO doesn't object (not recommends) the use of needle cutters but their introduction should come with training of HCWs on their use. An RCT on hub cutters has subsequently been completed in Ghana with WHO collaboration. Following this study a project proposal from GEF was submitted to the Gates Foundation Grant Challenge and granted (100,000 USD). This project will start with a pilot in one district. Used syringes will be collected and decontaminated by autoclave and supplied to a manufacture for recycling. As of today the project is waiting for the purchase of an autoclave. Immunization schedulesSAGE endorsed continuing work in the related research areas, with refinement of the research agenda undertaken by the research component of IVB, under the oversight of the research advisory bodies of WHO. SAGE asked to be kept informed of progress and results.Information Apr 2007 Ongoing Work in progress. Presentation of the PCV evidence was done at the SAGE November2011 meeting resulting in the updating of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines position paper in April 2012. Evidence on rotavirus vaccines was presented at the April 2012 meeting and the updated rotavirus position paper will be published in January 2013. Evidence on Hib was presented at the November 2012 meeting. During the discussion, SAGE members noted that the evidence on the number of primary doses and the need for booster doses requires further evaluation before recommendations can be made on optimizing the current schedule. Hib will be revised during the SAGE April 2013 meeting. Immunization schedulesSAGE requested that the models reflect operational realities - for example, delays in vaccine administration.Action Nov 2010 Completed Models to examine these factors have been developed. Their application to PCV was presented in Nov 2011. The implication of coverage and timeliness by age on rotavirus vaccine impact was presented at the April 2012 SAGE meeting. Page 8 of 1825 March 2013Page 67Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Immunization schedulesSAGE encouraged WHO to complete the project promptly. SAGE requested a critical appraisal of alternative schedules for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, rotavirus vaccine and Hib vaccine in 2011.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing PCV: evidence was reviewed by SAGE on November 2011. New recommendation on schedules issued and data was used to update the position paper Rotavirus: evidence was reviewed by an ad-hoc group of experts in February 2012 and presented to SAGE in April 2012. An updated vaccine position paper on the use of rotavirus vaccines will be published in February 2013. Hib: No resources for model and/or ICEA. Evidence review is being completed; an ad hoc consultation will be held in September 2012 and outcomes were proposed for SAGE consideration at the November 2012 meeting. During the discussion, SAGE members noted that the evidence on the number of primary doses and the need for booster doses requires further evaluation before recommendations can be made on optimizing the current schedule. The issue will be revised during the April SAGE 2013 meeting. For all: review of number of contacts during first years of life (ongoing); cost of contacts (planned); update on actual age at vaccination data (completed and used in conjunction with rotavirus epidemiology). Impact of the introduction of new vaccines on immunization and health systemsSAGE recommended that the ad-hoc working group work towards producing guidelines and tools for WHO to assist decision-makers and EPI managers contemplating the introduction of new vaccines, in order to take account of collateral effects inherent in introduction. The guidelines should provide a set of indicators that would enhance the potential positive effects, and reduce any potential negative effects, both on the immunization system and the health system. The guidelines should accommodate vaccines with different characteristics.Action Apr 2010 Ongoing Further information was collected through a search of the published, unpublished and grey literature (such as post-introduction evaluation reports) as well as through key informant interviews. An in-depth study in 3 countries was conducted by LSHTM in 2011-12 to gather further information. The ad-hoc group has updated the framework based on the data obtained and has drafted a guideline (Vaccine Introduction Guidelines - Adding a vaccine to national immunization programme) to assist country decision makers and EPI managers to take account of the potential effects/impacts of new vaccine introduction on the immunization and health systems. The 'Principles for adding a vaccine to a national immunization programme while strengthening the immunization and health systems' were endorsed by SAGE in April 2012 and form part of this guideline document, which is to be published after external review in early 2013. Impact of the introduction of new vaccines on immunization and health systemsSAGE noted the importance of the ad hoc working group continuing to include a broad range of partner agencies, and encouraged to seek endorsement of this work at senior levels of partner agencies.Action Apr 2010 Ongoing The ad hoc working group included a broad range of partner agencies (WHO, UNICEF , WB, CDC, PATH, JSI, LSHTM, JHU) and has sought endorsement of this work at senior levels of partner agencies. The revised Vaccine Introduction Guidelines which are to be published in early 2013 as a result of the proceedings of the ad hoc working group are being vetted by the partner agencies and will be endorsed by their senior personnel. Influenza SAGE recommended that the Influenza Vaccines and Immunization Working Group develop a research agenda.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing The Global Influenza Programme (GIP) presented their development of a WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza (PHRAI) in the August 2011 SAGE WGIVI meeting. The WG acknowledged the extensive coverage of influenza research topics in the PHRAI and activities of the SAGE WGIVI can serve as one avenue to inform the RA. One area that may need further development is on vaccine communication and risk communication issues. It is recognized that communication is population-specific and how generalizable are the research work in this area would be an important topic to address. SAGE WGIVI also suggested that experiences from industry on the information gathered from countries on impact and lessons learned in view of research activities to inform the PHRAI. The importance of evidence-based recommendations was stressed and the PHRAI would be an important tool. There is also a need to identify more detailed research needs for influenza vaccines and the SAGE WGIVI encourages close collaboration with the PHRAI in addressing this need. Page 9 of 1825 March 2013Page 68Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Influenza SAGE recommends WHO continue urgent development of H5N1 stockpile. Further SAGE noted that WHO needs, concurrently with the acquisition of a stockpile, to develop the operational guidelines that would govern the management and release of the stockpiled H5N1 influenza vaccine, and to define appropriate methods for monitoring its use and evaluating outcomes. SAGE further recommended a feasibility study on the management and use of the stockpile.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing This project is being taken forward by the SAGE influenza working group for influenza vaccines and immunization. Discussions are ongoing and continued during the last 3 face to face meetings. During the 2nd meeting in February, 2011, the WG favored the option of keeping the stockpile mainly as a virtual stockpile with a small physical stockpile of filled and finished doses of H5N1 vaccine for rapid response and outbreak control in case of need. WHO should ensure that it has procedures in place to facilitate the deployment of pandemic vaccine to countries in need of support. Lessons learned from the deployment of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine in 2009 and 2010 are used to develop guidance and procedures for future vaccine deployment activities. Guidance document and associated work plans are available in all UN languages from: http://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/deployment/en/index.html. WHO H5N1 stockpile is also being discussed in the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework. Further discussion by the SAGE working group for influenza vaccine and immunization will have to wait for the outcome of discussions in the PIP framework. Japanese encephalitisCommercial kits for detection of JE-specific IgM should be compared and validated. Valuable experience had been gained from linking surveillance of encephalitis to detection of acute flaccid paralysis.Action Apr 2006 Ongoing Assessment using serum carried out by PATH, published Am J Trop Med Hyg July 07. Field validation of serum and CSF in India and Bangladesh assessed in a joint WHO/CDC meeting, SEARO, February 2008. Nepal and Cambodia field evaluation of JE assays is complete and paper submitted to JID. Assessment of kits using CSFs accepted for publication in Am J Trop Med Hyg. CDC Fort Collins will distribute the 3rd serum and CSF proficiency test panel to evaluate in-house and commercial JE ELISA assays to WPRO JE labs 4ht quarter 2012. The three WPR JE regional reference labs (Japan, China and Republic of Korea) held their annual coordination meeting, Chengdu, China, 2nd quarter 2012. China CDC JE regional reference Lab was fully accredited by WPR and HQ Lab Coordinators, August 2012. A WPR JE labnet meeting too place on 15 March 2013 and a Regional JE workshop for WPR is planned the week of 17 June in Seoul. Submission for publication of a paper summarizing the development of the JE LabNet is pending. Japanese encephalitisSAGE looked forward to better assessment of the disease burden and identification of target populations for immunization and to reviewing the regional JE control goal currently under development and the activities to achieve this goal.Action Nov 2008 Ongoing Planning and fundraising efforts are ongoing in the Regions. Control goals have currently not been formulated. A literature review on the JE burden of disease has been conducted, estimating the burden of JE to some 67,000 clinical cases and a CFR of above 20%. This was Published in the Bulletin of WHO, Bull World Health Organ 2011;89:766-774. Identification of target populations are being discussed in the context of country control strategies, and a review has been conducted at the 2011 biregional JE meeting. An update of the JE position paper (from 2006) is being planned that will comprise a review of immunization strategies. Japanese encephalitisInterference with the immune response to other vaccinations, number of doses required and the duration of protection need to be assessed.Action Apr 2006 Ongoing Some studies are being initiated by PATH, and planned by Governments considering introduction of the vaccine. Issue of interference with measles vaccination discussed at the December 2007 GACVS meeting. Measles co-administration (S Gatchalian, Vaccine 2008) had to be redone due to assay inconsistencies - results still pending. Number of doses required (one or two doses for primary immunization with live JE vaccine) has been assessed through case control studies in Nepal and India (the Nepal study is published and India study published as a note to the editor, 2 April 2009 in NEJM). A comprehensive review of the vaccine performance is planned in conjunction with an update of the JE position paper from 2006. Page 10 of 1825 March 2013Page 69Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Lower middle-income countries: sustainable adoption and financing for new vaccinesSAGE requested that WHO facilitate the establishment of a partnership among all relevant stakeholders to consider: pooled procurement; tiered pricing; greater transparency of pricing; and exploring the role that UNICEF , the Pan American Health Organization and foundations can have in assisting these countries with procuring and financing vaccines.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing Establishing a partnership among all relevant stakeholders to support middle income countries is our aim and has been clearly recommended by SAGE in 2011 and 2012. WHO has already started consulting with agencies, projects and initiative to explore what are the possibilities to collaborate and support middle income countries with procuring and financing vaccines and immunizations. This is the case with UNICEF , PAHO, SIVAC, OPTIMIZE, PROVAC and others. We have also consulted with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) on their concerns and plans. They showed a great interest in supporting activities but they are still hesitating and trying to identify the best approaches. We have organized in January 2011 a successful brainstorming meeting on vaccine price and vaccine pricing focusing on issues faced by GAVI graduating and middle income countries. A proposal was submitted and is now funded by the BMGF on vaccine product, price and procurement (V3P project). This is a 3-year project aiming to identify, develop and establish the most appropriate and comprehensive method(s), mechanism(s) and/or tools to provide countries with accurate, reliable and useful data on vaccine product, price and procurement. In parallel we have raised the LMIC issue within the Decade of Vaccines collaboration, it has been considered as one the priority of the decade of vaccines and is now reflected in the Global Vaccine Action Plan.(GVAP). Multiple consultations took place on GAVI graduating and middle-income countries activities and issues. The results of this consultative process were presented at the November 2012 SAGE. SAGE appreciated the efforts made by WHO, UNICEF and GAVI and other partners to extend discussions about vaccine supply and pricing to MICs where appropriate, and the adaptation of some activities to suit MIC-specific needs. However, SAGE noted with concern that these efforts are fragmented and are failing to optimize synergies in the work being undertaken by each agency. SAGE noted that with a modest investment technical assistance and capacity building could be significantly strengthened. SAGE requested that this issue and achievements be revisited in a subsequent meeting and that a Task force is establish by WHO to coordinate policies and efforts of partners. At regional level, EMRO is working to launch in 2013 the EMR Initiative on pooled procurement and to contribute to the UNICEF SD initiative on MIC and new vaccines. Some results are expected during the second half of 2013. Lower middle-income countries: sustainable adoption and financing for new vaccinesSAGE recommended, as a priority, the creation of a task force convened by WHO as a mechanism for inclusive stakeholder engagement and forum for harmonization and implementation of projects and activities.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing Terms of Reference have been drafted, potential composition has been identified and contact with key partners are underway to set up the SAGE recommended task force. Lower middle-income countries: sustainable adoption and financing for new vaccinesSAGE noted that the lack of access to life-saving vaccines in MICs has not significantly improved since this was first raised in 2008 and that rapid action is now required. SAGE requested that this issue and achievements be revisited in a subsequent meeting.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing Various initiatives are underway to facilitate access to new vaccines in middle income countries: UNICEF SD is consulting with Vaccine Industry and with countries to supply PCV, RV and HPV to middle income countries and to set up a ceiling price. The regional Committee of EMR has decided to establish a pooled vaccine procurement to support introduction of priority vaccines in middle income countries and to collaborate with UNICEF SD on its MIC initiative GAVI board retreat in March discussed to options to support access to GAVI prices for graduating countries as well as lower middle income countries. Concrete efforts and results are still to be seen. Coordinated effort, consistent policy and financial support are needed to translate those initiatives into reality for countries. Page 11 of 1825 March 2013Page 70Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Malaria SAGE requested that it be kept informed of developments in the ongoing multi-country Phase 3 trial and indicated that further discussion on the optimal schedule for a malaria vaccine will need to occur.Action Oct 2009 Ongoing The Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01E completed enrollment Jan 2011 with 15,460 infants enrolled in 11 sites in 7 African countries. Two sets of results were published in Oct 2011 and Nov 2012. These are 12 month follow-up data post dose 3 for young children aged 5-17 months of age with no co-administration, and for infants aged 6-12 weeks in co-administration with DTwP/HepB/Hib and OPV respectively. Both age groups received 3 i.m. doses of RTS,S/AS01 at 4 week intervals. In each age group there were three trial arms, with one arm including a fourth (booster) dose 18 months post dose 3. In 5-17 month olds 55% efficacy (95% CI 50-59) was reported against all episodes of clinical malaria, and 47% (95%CI 22-64) efficacy against severe malaria. In 6-12 week olds the equivalent figures were 33% efficacy (95% CI 26-39) for all episodes of clinical malaria, and 37% (95% CI 5-58) efficacy for severe malaria. Immunogenicity was 3-fold higher in the older age group, in terms of antibodies to the malaria antigen present in RTS,S. The authors report an excess of febrile seizure within 7 days of vaccination in the RTS,S/AS01 groups, for the older age group only. A full safety review will be performed by GACVS, tentatively scheduled for June 2015. The full trial results will be available in late 2014 and will include information on 30 months of follow-up, the safety and efficacy of an 18 month booster dose and site-specific clinical malaria efficacy. The Joint Technical Expert Group on malaria vaccines (JTEG) met in Oct 2012 and has advised that this 2014 data may support policy recommendation in 2015. The first regulatory submission will be to the European Medicines Agency under the article 58 procedure. The first wave of 5 national regulatory submissions will be to Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal and Burkina Faso, where Phase 4 studies of safety and effectiveness are planned. The dates for regulatory submissions remain unconfirmed, with a recent indication that the regulatory submission timing would be consistent with a possible \"For Decision\" session in Q4 2015. This is planned to be a joint Session between SAGE and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee. The vaccine development partnership has been encouraged to fully explore optimal schedules and age groups for possible administration of this vaccine. An additional schedule study is ongoing in Malawi, with several 3 dose schedules. Previously published RTS,S/AS01 co-administration studies in children younger than 12 months of age have reported that non-inferiority criteria have been met for D, T, wP , Hep B, Hib, Measles and Y ellow Fever. A major issue for communication will be the need to evaluate RTS,S/AS01 as an addition to, not a replacement for, existing preventive measures, particularly long-lasting insecticidal nets and the need for ongoing availability of rapid diagnostic tests, and effective antimalarial drugs after any possible use of this vaccine in the future. Measles and rubella SAGE requested that the measles and rubella working groups should merge and monitor progress, oversee the research agenda required for eradication and report back to SAGE regularly. The working group should liaise with QUIVER and IPAC to address relevant quantitative issues as well as those related to immunization practices. This activity has been included in the draft terms of reference for the combined measles and rubella working group.Action Nov 2010 Completed The working group on measles and rubella was formed in late 2011. Peter Figueroa is the chair of the working group and as of 27 September 2012, the group has held monthly conference calls and 2 face-to-face meetings (22 March and 20-21 September 2012). The working group prepared a session on measles and rubella at the November 2012 SAGE meeting. The session included a report on progress, challenges, lessons learnt, and opportunities for achieving measles and rubella targets. In addition, there was a presentation on aeorsol measles vaccination and a brief update on the planned outputs from the working group in 2013. SAGE endorsed the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012 - 2020. Page 12 of 1825 March 2013Page 71Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Optimizing immunization schedulesSAGE recommended that WHO provide support to country-level policy-makers on the rational use of analyses generated by the tool.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing We have approached SIVAC to collaborate in one African country as a case study (initially Cote d'Ivoire now considering Mozambique). After consulation with AFRO colleagues and, bearing in mind that the NITAGs have been only recently constituted, this activity has been postponed and no new date has been set yet. Optimizing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedulesSAGE requested that available evidence and guidelines to facilitate decision-making at country and regional level be posted on the WHO website.Action Nov 2011 Completed A BETA version of the proposed approach to summarize the evidence and of the website was presented to SAGE during the April 2012 meeting: http://perso.epita.fr/~costa_k/RotavirusProjectVersion2/ Pertussis control SAGE endorsed the establishment of a pertussis-vaccine strain repository and a database on the genealogy and characteristics of different vaccine strains. A proposal should be presented to the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization.Action Apr 2010 Pending The initial offer of the pertussis strains made by Dr Nicole Guiso from the Institut Pasteur (IP) was not presented to the ECBS in 2010 due to the lack of information regarding the use of the strains and the related data. The proposal is currently subject to the official decision regarding the future of these strains that the Institut Pasteur needs to make. A possibility for maintaining the strains in the IP repository is one of the options under consideration. Update March 2013: As cooperation with the IP due to administrative issues has shown to be complicated, the value of taking this issue to another center will be discussed by the newly established SAGE Pertussis Working Group. Pertussis control Establish a working group on pertussis. Action Nov 2012 Completed A SAGE Working Group on Pertussis vaccines was established in March 2013. The first teleconferences of the working group took place on 11th of March 2013. Polio eradication SAGE recommended that WHO/GPEI continue to work with GAVI to ensure financing is available within 18 months for any GAVI-eligible countries wanting to introduce a low-cost IPV option as part of the switch strategy.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing The financial requirements for the 'Endgame' are projected to be US$ 5.5 billion for the period 2013-2018; this reflects substantial work under various scenarios and is the consensus position of the core GPEI partners, in consultation with the relevant global, regional and country stakeholders. The proportion across key budget categories, which include the introduction of IPV, surveillance and laboratory costs, outbreak response capacity & vaccine stockpiles, as well as containment certification costs, will be adjusted as progress against key polio eradication milestones is evaluated. Adjusting the estimated year of interruption will increase/decrease costs accordingly. The financial needs of this plan will be met by implementing a resource mobilization, communications and advocacy strategy jointly developed by GPEI partners with the guidance of the relevant executive groups in the GPEI architecture, particularly the Polio Partners' Group and the Polio Emergency Steering Committee. Discussions with GAVI are ongoing to ensure financing for the introduction of a low-cost IPV option as part of OPV2 cessation for GAVI-eligible countries. Polio eradication SAGE recommended that the draft Polio Eradication and Endgame plan be revised to include recommendations from current stakeholder consultations.Action Nov 2012 Completed The draft 2013 to 2018 GPEI Polio Eradication and Endgame was extensively revised, following a series of in-depth stakeholder consultations; the draft will be made available to SAGE at the April 2014 meeting. Polio eradication SAGE recommended that an IPV supply and funding strategy be established for timely introduction of IPV using existing whole dose products for a transition period if needed. For its next meeting SAGE requested additional details on the scientific evidence for, and programmatic implications of, targetng expanded age groups during polio campaigns in endemic areas.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing Work focusing on the establishment of the required IPV supply and funding strategy with stakeholders and with GAVI has continued to allow the introduction of whole-dose IPV in time before the planned cessation of OPV2. The polio session during the April 2014 SAGE meeting will also include an update on the programmatic implications of new strategies during polio SIAs in priority countries. Page 13 of 1825 March 2013Page 72Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Polio eradication SAGE encouraged WHO to specifically assess how existing international mechanisms could be used to strengthen and implement vaccination recommendations for travellers entering and leaving polio-infected countries and areas and, for areas of uncontrolled transmission, to consider travel advisories.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing WHO continues to assess the feasibility of using international mechanisms to implement such vaccination requirements and travel advisories. It is currently envisioned, that such measures ((e.g. an IHR standing recommendation on vaccination of travelers) would be considered for any area with continuing poliovirus transmission at end-2014. Additionally, as in previous years, WHO has updated its International Travel and Health publication, providing vaccination recommendations to travellers based on the most up-to-date global polio epidemiology. Polio eradication SAGE recommended that WHO/GPEI work with vaccine manufacturers to develop both options and with regulatory authorities to initiate fast track review of ID IPV immediately, to ensure that a low-cost IPV option is available within a year.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing The SAGE Polio WG updated SAGE during the November 2012 meeting in detail on the outcome of discussions about the ongoing work towards achieving options for affordable IPV, including on the WGs direct interaction with four IPV manufacturers and discussions with regulatory authorities. The WG will report to SAGE in April 2013 on progress made along several 'workstreams' towards achieving the prerequisites for OPV2 withdrawal,and on the anticipated timeline towards OPV2 cessation. Polio eradication SAGE requested that WHO/GPEI draft a 'GPEI Strategic Plan/Budget for 2013-2018' by November 2012 that incorporates OPV2 cessation and eventual bOPV cessation, with different scenarios for the timing of IPV introduction for the period of the tOPV/bOPV switch and longer term IPV uptake following complete OPV cessation.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Following this request from SAGE and a similar recommendation from the GPEIs Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), a Strategic Plan for the Polio Endgame and Legacy Options 2014 to 2018 has been drafted. This document was developed in close consultation with GPEI spearheading partners and other initiatives (i.e. GAVI), as well as with WHO Regional Offices; the SAGE Polio Working Group also reviewed the draft and provided comments. The document has three main sections: a) the endgame strategic plan, including the eradication of polio and management of associated risk, b) the financial requirements 2014 to 2018 (i.e. a 2014 to 2018 indicative budget), and c)the legacy, i.e. to define the broader global health benefits of the global polio programme. In November 2012, SAGE welcomed the long-term vision of the draft GPEI Polio Eradication and Endgame Plan, 2013-2018 and endorsed the 4 major components. Polio eradication SAGE recommended that tight deadlines should be set for the completion of each step required to implement the switch from tOPV to bOPV. Similarly, urgent plans must be in place for the development of a low-cost IPV, and for its introduction by countries which choose to adopt this strategy. For countries planning to introduce IPV, including the low-cost IPV option, similar planning must take place.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Discussions among the GPEI partners, and activities of the SAGE Polio Working Group have continued since the November 2012 SAGE meeting to further refine the definition and timeline for the programme of work on the six main pre-requisites that need to be in place before the withdrawal of OPV2 (i.e. replacement of tOPV by bOPV for routine immunization) can be considered. As requested by SAGE, the considerably expanded work-streams on the OPV2 withdrawal pre-requisites - including lab containment of polioviruses, introduction and uptake of affordable IPV, IPV and bOPV product development and licensing, and MOPV2 stockpile and outbreak response, and anticipated time-lines within the polio endgame - will be presented at the April 2013 SAGE meeting. Polio eradication SAGE requested that WHO/GPEI undertake further consultation with countries and regions to document the policy and programmatic implications of introducing an IPV dose (whether IM or ID) as part of the strategy to switch from tOPV to bOPV and to facilitate individual country decision-making.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing A review of operational differences between using IPV as a full dose (IM) vs. application as fractional dose (ID), comparing differences relating to service delivery, cold chain and logistics, management, training, supervision, and cost. The assessment included detailed interviews with EPI managers from Asia (India), and Africa (one West and one East African country). Results of this investigation were reported to the SAGE Polio Working Group, and at the October 2 meeting of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (IPAC). Special sessions on the 'polio endgame', focusing in particular on the plans for OPV2 cessation (i.e. the switch from tOPV to bOPV for routine immunization) have been conducted at the EMRO EPI manager's meeting (September 2012) and are planned for the 4th quarter of 2012 at the regional EPI meetings in the South-East Asian and African Regions. During the November 2012 meeting, SAGE recommended that all countries should introduce at least 1 dose of IPV in their routine immunization programme to mitigate the risks associated with the withdrawal of OPV2. Page 14 of 1825 March 2013Page 73Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Polio eradication SAGE strongly encouraged the Global polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to proceed with its full IPV research agenda, in particular to clarify the duration and quality of the priming immune response to inform the work of the SAGE IPV working group.Action Apr 2011 Ongoing The WHO polio eradication research team is coordinating additional research in this area, including further analysis of Cuba study data (e.g., titre of neutralizing Ab after one and two doses of IPV), and potential collaboration with the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), Korea, to measure mucosal and systemic antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses against polio vaccines in young infants after one and two doses of IPV. The data have been shared on multiple occasions both with the SAGE WG, and the full SAGE. In addition, a manuscript has been published that summarizes these data from Cuba. (Resik S et al. Priming after a fractional dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine. NEJM.2013;368:416-24). Reports from other advisory committeesSAGE recommended appointment of appropriate programmatic and implementation expertise to QUIVER's membership including representation of experts from low and middle-income countries.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing The new QUIVER AC called Immunization and Vaccines related Implementation Research (IVIR) advisory committee has been expanded to 15 members with programmatic and implementation research expertise. It remains a challenge to include representatives from low and middle-income countries. Four of the five new members nominated are from LMICs with expertise in vaccine implementation issues and vaccine trials. Reports from other advisory committees on immunizationWHO and NIBSC should develop with other stakeholders, a business plan to assure long-term security of global public health resource and additional efforts be undertaken to disseminate outcomes of the committees deliberations and to explain the relevance of its work to the broader immunization community.Action Nov 2006 Pending A comprehensive review of the work of the ECBS is still pending. The review will include (but not be restricted to) consideration of communication of ECBS outcomes. This will be linked with an overriding review of Expert Committees by the department of Essential Medicines and Health Products. Thiomersal SAGE requested WHO to produce a report on the security of the supply of affordable vaccines and encouraged donors to invest in the development of new vaccine technologies that facilitate the delivery of effective, affordable vaccines to populations most at risk.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Discussions with donors has advanced well and planning for meeting on new vaccine technologies being initiated. Further work on the report is still pending. Internal QSS-EPI discussions are in progress. Thiomersal SAGE endorses the proposal for a scientific meeting on alternatives to thiomersal prior to the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to prepare a global legally binding instrument on Mercury (INC4), as this would support the aims of the INC and avert concerns that developing countries are using products no longer used in industrialized countries. SAGE asked GACVS to present a review of the safety of alternative preservatives. SAGE will also consider the broader implications of alternative preservatives for global immunization policy.Action Nov 2011 Completed A scientific meeting was held on 3-4 April 2012 to develop further guidance on vaccines for the UNEP-convened Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting 4, and the conclusions of this meeting were reported to SAGE on April 2012 for a specific session Information on vaccines for an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to prepare a global legally binding instrument on the use of mercury took place at the April 2012 SAGE meeting. It discussed thiomersal and alternative preservatives and presentations. In early 2103 the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee finally agreed to exclude vaccines containing thiomersal from the scope of the new international convention that will reduce the harmful health effects of mercury. Tuberculosis vaccinesSAGE endorsed the establishment of a WHO TB vaccine technical expert group with representation from SAGE. An annual written report on TB vaccine developments should be provided to SAGE.SAGE would be provided with two-page summaries of progress every year. TB would only be included on the agenda of SAGE when there is a meaningful development of decision from SAGE required.Action Nov 2011 Pending Written update was provided for the November 2013 SAGE meeting. Page 15 of 1825 March 2013Page 74Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Typhoid Need for advocacy and prioritization at international level. To include prioritizing WHO's prequalification for new-generation typhoid vaccines and the need for international financing mechanisms.Action Nov 2007 Ongoing A 3-year grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates to the Coalition against Typhoid (CaT) and Sabin Vaccine Institute ends in 2013 and an application has been initiated to seek a supplementary grant to 2016. CaT, WHO and other partners will continue to implement and support typhoid control and prevention activities, including immunization as well as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) strategies. A major international conference on International Conference on Typhoid Fever and Other Invasive Salmonelloses held 1-2 March 2013 in Dhaka served as testament to increased advocacy and prioritization efforts. As previously reported to SAGE, WHO pre-qualified the sanofi pasteur Vi polysaccharide vaccine in June 2011, the first typhoid vaccine to be WHO prequalified. However Vi polysaccharide vaccine uptake has remained low for multiple reasons including funding. In November 2011 the GAVI Board re stated its 2008 commitment to typhoid conjugate vaccines in the GAVI Vaccine Investment Strategy; it is expected that a typhoid vaccine support window will be opened when a WHO prequalified conjugate typhoid vaccine is available. The first typhoid conjugate vaccine likely to be presented for WHO pre-qualification is projected to be licensed in 2015. WHO and its expert groups are currently developing guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of typhoid conjugate vaccines, expected to be presented to the ECBS in Oct 2013 for approval (public consultation of the draft document now available with a deadline of 19 April at http://who.int/biologicals/WHO_TyViPSconj_Draft.01.06_cl_web.pdf). Typhoid Need for feedback from WHO's regional offices and countries to determine how countries could implement SAGE recommendations.Action Nov 2007 Ongoing A full report was presented to the November 2010 meeting of SAGE. SAGE reiterated that countries should consider introduction of existing typhoid vaccines and not necessarily wait for surveillance systems to be in place. Further, to take the typhoid agenda forward, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a three year grant to the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Washington DC,to coordinate all stakeholders interested in typhoid and to develop a global agenda for the control and prevention of typhoid fever. WHO will work closely with Sabin in this process. Since typhoid vaccine is one of the 7 vaccines that GAVI listed as their priority vaccines for support, for the November 2011 meeting of the GAVI Board, a case was made for typhoid vaccine support. The GAVI Board finally issued a clear statement that GAVI will not support the Vi-polysaccharide vaccine and will wait for a conjugate vaccine to be available. Given this stand there is clearly no appepite for any donors to support ViPS typhoid vaccine. Thus all activities related to encouraging countries to consider ViPS are stopped. Focus is now on supporting the development of conjugate vaccine and strengthening surveillance in countries to generate better data on typhoid. Un/under-immunize d childrenSAGE recommended that the targeted approaches undertaken by Tanzania and Ethiopia to reduce to number of un/under-immunized children should be appropriately adapted for use in other countries.Action Apr 2011 Ongoing The targeted approaches undertaken by Tanzania and Ethiopia to reduce to number of un/under-immunized children have been incorporated in the framework to reduce unvaccinated children. In addition a case study from India has also been included. The final draft of the framework is complete. A follow-up meeting with the WHO regions and partners was heldd on the 4th October 2012 to review the in-depth tools that are being put together. Another meeting has been scheduled on the 3rd April 2013. Un/under-immunize d childrenSAGE requested that WHO quickly roll out tools so that other countries can address low coverage of vaccination.Action Nov 2010 Ongoing A set of one diagnostic tool and 6 in-depth tools has been conceptualized. In addition to the work on the framework at HQ, the EURO, AMRO/PAHO and AFRO regional offices of WHO are working on operational guidelines and demand generation side documents respectively. A framework to increase coverage has been drafted and was presented to a small group comprising of representatives from EURO (2), AFRO (1), HQ and Dr David Durrheim, member of SAGE. The final draft of the framework is complete. A follow-up meeting with the WHO regions and partners was held on the 4th October 2012 to review the in-depth tools that are being put together. The initial diagnostic tool is in its draft final stage. A follow-up meeting has been scheduled on the 3rd April 2013. Page 16 of 1825 March 2013Page 75Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Un/under-immunize d childrenSAGE recommended that WHO prioritize the ongoing work on the development of the framework to guide countries in identifying determinants of low immunization coverage and institute corresponding local solutions.Action Apr 2011 Ongoing The work has been prioritized. A framework to increase coverage has been drafted and was presented to a small group comprising of representatives from EURO (2), AFRO (1), HQ and Dr David Durrheim, member of SAGE. The final draft of the framework is complete. A follow-up meeting with the WHO regions and partners was held on the 4th October 2012 to review the in-depth tools that are being put together. Another meeting has been scheduled on the 3rd April 2013. Vaccination in humanitarian emergenciesSAGE requested that the finalized framework be presented to the November 2012 SAGE meeting for consideration.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing The draft was presented at the November 2012 SAGE meeting. SAGE endorsed the revised framework as a major step forward and considers that it fills an existing gap. Vaccination in humanitarian emergenciesSAGE strongly affirmed the potential utility of this framework and recommended pilot testing in the field. The working group was asked to adapt the document and proceed with further pilot tests before finalization.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing Finalization of the document based on feedback received from the SAGE meeting of November 8th, 2012 is in progress. The document has been revised and is currently being review by the members of the working group before finalization. Vaccination in humanitarian emergenciesSAGE also suggested that the framework approach to vaccine decision-making could be considered for other health interventions in emergencies.Action Apr 2012 Ongoing Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response (ERM) Department staff do consider that the framework approach for other health interventions in emergencies is a good recommendation from SAGE. ERM will explore this issue in the second half of 2013. Vaccine Supply It was noted that SAGE needs to address the constraint experienced across Regions of repetitive shortfalls in vaccine supply, both for existing vaccination programmes (in particular for DTP-containing vaccines) as well as for new/emerging vaccines, and the impact on vaccine coverage in several countries.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing Discussions have been initiated with UNICEF Supplies Division, and UNICEF Programme Division to work on global vaccine supply issues. A meeting was held in Copenhagen on 20 Feb to solidify the workplan, and work started in 2012 to combine WHO and UNICEF databases on vaccine forecasting, supply and distribution in countries is ongoing. It was agreed to have a joint discussion on DTP , HepB mono and TT/Td supply in Q2 2013. WHO will also take part in the global forecasting discussions in September 2013. Vaccine coverage SAGE recommended that WHO support new research for biological specimen collection including rapid on-site diagnostics that could improve coverage and susceptibility estimates. Improved serological surveillance techniques could be integrated with existing population-based surveys such as DHS or MICS. These research topics should be included on the QUIVER agenda.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing As the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is now accepting Letters of Inquiry for the development of an easy-to-use tool that rapidly assesses the immune status of children against select vaccine-preventable diseases. Inquiries will be welcome that focus on prototype development and detail plans for future commercialization possibilities (details available from: www.gatesfoundation.org/vaccines/Pages/rfp-immunity-assessment-tool.aspx). Vaccine coverage WHO to identify appropriate methods and develop guidelines for collecting, analysing, and interpreting biomarkers for validating coverage.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing WHO to identify appropriate methods and develop guidelines for collecting, analysing, and interpreting biomarkers for validating coverage. A consultant has been recruited to review currently available biomarkers and draft a guideline document which reviews, for a selected list of vaccine-preventable diseases, laboratory test available and associated requirements for specimen collection/transport, personal experience and training, and laboratory supplies and equipment. For each selected disease study populations, sampling methods, data/specimen collection, laboratory/statistical analysis, and implications of results was summarized in a document. Work in progress was presented to WHO and UNICEF Regional Focal Points for immunization during the Meeting on Monitoring National Immunization Systems, 9-11 October 2012 for their comments. Internal and external review of the document will continue and after incorporating the comments draft guidelines will be developed for use of sero-surveillance as an evaluation tool for immunization programmes. Page 17 of 1825 March 2013Page 76Topic Recommendations/Action item Category Meeting Date Status Comments and Follow up Vaccine coverage SAGE recommended that WHO explore alternative survey methods to improve the precision, reduce the cost and improve the usefulness of survey results to national and local immunization programmes.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing To improve the precision and usefulness of survey results and to reduce the cost of surveys, SIG proposes to explore 1) recent advances in sampling methodology, 2) new technologies for constructing sampling frames, supervision of field work, data collection, and analysis and 3) alternative content, collection, analysis, presentation and linkages with other data sources. An explicit description of precision, usefulness and cost of various trade-offs between alternative methods will constitute part of the exploration. An initial meeting was convened of the IVB Informal Advisor Group on Monitoring Immunization Programme Performance through Household and Community Surveys. First meeting addressed the need to modify Demographic and Health Surveys, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and the WHO Immunization Cluster Survey to accommodate changes in immunization system strategies. Vaccine preventable disease surveillanceSAGE endorsed the recommendations of the ad hoc TAG for improving the quality of the IB-VPD surveillance network and urged that the objectives of this network be more clearly defined, that collaboration with other surveillance systems and laboratory networks (i.e. the polio/measles laboratory networks) be continued, and that, where feasible, activities be linked with other programmes enhancing country capacity, including implementation of the International Health Regulations. SAGE also noted that country ownership should be enhanced and that Ministries of Health should be encouraged to increase their own funding for surveillance. SAGE appealed for sustained financial support to ensure quality for sentinel site surveillance. SAGE underscored the importance of ensuring the representativeness of sentinel sites.Action Nov 2011 Ongoing Since the previous update on the November 2011 SAGE session on VPD surveillance, WHO has conducted the following activities as aligned with SAGE recommendations: NUVI surveillance mission statements & objectives have been developed; In December 2011, WHO began the dissemination five (5) agreed minimal criteria for funding, which will be enforced as of 2014 funding. WHO has received funding from CDC to strengthen data management capacity during 2013. The methodology to estimate a denominator for Tier 1 IB VPD sentinel sites was piloted in 4 countries, reviewed technicially, and is being developed into a field guide; WHO continues to sustain the global and regional reference laboratories for training, quality assurance, and PCR testing of culture negative specimens; and reviewers have commented on the draft global IB-VPD SOPs, and comments will be incorporated during 2013. WHO will be closely assessing the status of the NUVI surveillance networks during 2013. Funding beyond 2013 remains uncertain. Vaccine safety SAGE highlighted the urgent need for a safety review of other important vaccines that could be used during pregnancy.Action Nov 2012 Ongoing A sub-group of GACVS has been launched to address vaccine safety during pregnancy. Vaccines during humanitarian emergencies will be discussed at a forthcoming SAGE meeting.The use of vaccines during humanitarian emergencies will be discussed at a forthcoming SAGE meeting.Action Nov 2010 Completed A SAGE Working Group on vaccination in humanitarian emergencies was established in June 2011. Multiple teleconferences were held and two face-to-face meeting of the working group took place on 20-21 September 2011 and on 16-17 February 2012. The group reported to SAGE in April and November 2012. In November 2012, SAGE endorsed the complete framework for decision making on the use of vaccinations in humanitarian emergencies as a major step forward and considers that it fills an existing gap but acknowledged that the framework focuses on vaccination, which is only one priority consideration in humanitarian emergencies. SAGE strongly affirmed the potential utility of this framework and recommended pilot testing in the field. The working group was asked to adapt the document to take into consideration SAGE's comments and proceeds with its finalization, hopefully prior to the April 2013 SAGE meeting.Consideration was given to the potential inclusion of case studies in the documents but this was debated, as disasters are very diverse. It was left to the working group to decide whether these should be included.

It also reports on the status of progress made towards achieving the goals of the De cade of Vaccines. 2. Four sets of activities are essential to put the pl an into practice and to turn the actions into results: (1) development of guidance for putting th e plan into practice; (2) completion and implementation of a mechanism for evaluation and ac countability in alignment with the accountability framework for the United Nations Secretary-General' s Strategy for Women's and Children's Health;2 (3) securing commitments from stakeholders; and (4) p u b l i c i z i n g t h e o p p o r t u n i t i e s , w h i l e acknowledging the challenges, offered by the Decade o f V a c c i n e s . T h i s r e p o r t s u m m a r i z e s t h e progress made in these areas. OPERATIONALIZING THE GLOBAL VACCINE ACTION PLAN 3. During the past few months, all regions have held t echnical meetings to review the strategies proposed in the action plan and the actions require d at regional level. Progress in immunization activities and in implementing regional multi-year strategies and plans for immunization in alignment with the global plan will be reported to the respec tive regional committees in 2013. 4. WHO/UNICEF's guidance for developing multi-year and annual national immunization plans3 is being updated in order to facilitate alignment with the global action plan's goals and strategic objectives. The updated guidance will set out how t he different elements of health systems can be used to ensure that multi-year immunization plans align better with broader national health sector plans. Guidance for Member States to develop national moni toring, evaluation and accountability processes that align with the corresponding regional and glob al processes will also be included in the update. 1 See document EB132/18 and the summary records of t he Executive Board at its 132nd session, tenth meeti ng, section 3. 2 Commission on Information and Accountability for W omen's and Children's Health.

Geneva, World Health Organization, 2005. Page 78A66/19 2 PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING, EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 5. In resolution WHA65.17, the Health Assembly urged M ember States to report every year to the regional committees on lessons learnt, progress mad e, remaining challenges and updated actions to reach the national immunization targets. The propos ed framework for monitoring, evaluating and accountability in the implementation of the global vaccine action plan is intended to guide the conten t of annual progress reports submitted to the regiona l committees and the Health Assembly through the Executive Board. 6. Following the guidance of the Strategic Advisory Gr oup of Experts on immunization, the proposed framework will be applied to: (1) monitori ng results (defined as progress towards the action plan's goals and strategic objectives); (2) documen ting and monitoring stakeholders' commitments to the action plan; (3) tracking resources invested in v a c c i n e s a n d i m m u n i z a t i o n ; a n d ( 4 ) i n c l u s i o n o f independent oversight and review of progress, throu gh the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, in the reporting to the governing bodies. 7. This proposed framework is designed to be aligned w ith the Accountability Framework for the United Nations Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health1 and also to provide for reporting to the independent Expert Rev iew Group2. The Accountability Framework refers to a cyclical process of monitoring, review and rem edial action, in which progress is assessed, succes s documented, problems that need to be rectified iden tified, and prompt action taken as and where needed. It is structured around the 10 recommendati ons made by the Commission on Information and Accountability that are categorized as: (1) better information for better results; (2) better tracking of resources for women's and children's health; and (3) better oversight of results and resources. A similar cyclical process of monitoring, review an d action is proposed for the framework for the global vaccine action plan. Monitoring results 8. Progress towards the goals and strategic objectives o f t h e a c t i o n p l a n a s m e a s u r e d b y t h e respective indicators will serve as the basis for m onitoring results throughout the decade. 9. Following the endorsement of the action plan by the Health Assembly, its monitoring indicators were reviewed, with consideration being given to th e comments made by Member States during the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly.3 Relevant disease-control programmes and technical experts were consulted in order to review and refine the existin g indicators, develop operational definitions for e ach indicator, define the source(s) of data if they exi st or how data may be collected, and to establish baselines, milestones and targets, as appropriate. Additional consultations were held by in person, by telephone or online, and feedback on the draft indi cators was elicited from more than 600 people, representing different stakeholders, including repr esentatives of civil society organizations and vacc ine manufacturers. The indicators revised through this process were in turn reviewed and approved by the 1 Commission on Information and Accountability for W omen's and Children's Health.

Page 79A66/19 3 Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization a t i t s m o s t r e c e n t m e e t i n g ( G e n e v a , 6-8 November 2012). The updated list of indicators is annexed to this report. 10. In addition to the indicators for the action plan, a report on trends in vaccine prices, classified according to the procurement mechanisms used, will be presented for review by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts. The Advisory Group will also be requested to advise on an appropriate indicator for monitoring such price trends. 11. Progress, as measured by the indicators, except tho se for research and development, will be reported annually to the Health Assembly through th e Board. Progress towards the research and development goals and strategic objectives will be reported biennially. Documenting and monitoring commitments for immuniza tion 12. For monitoring commitments made to immunization act ivities, it is proposed to take advantage of the process used for the commitments to the Glob al Strategy for Women's and Children's Health. However, to enable the commitments earmarked for im munization to be tracked, they have to be explicit. Following the guidelines used for making commitments towards the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, the Secretariat has formulated specific guidelines for making commitments related to immunization; these exemplif y the types of commitment that could be made towards the Decade of Vaccines. 13. The types of commitment could include financial ple dges, policy and service delivery. Efforts will be made to secure commitments from a broad ran ge of stakeholders, including national governments, development partners, global agencies, c i v i l s o c i e t y o r g a n i z a t i o n s , a c a d e m i a a n d professional societies, vaccine manufacturers and t he private sector. Monitoring resources invested in immunization 14. Resources invested in immunization will be tracked and monitored on a yearly basis throughout the decade, using the framework of the OECD/EUROSTA T/WHO System of Health Accounts 2011,1 the global standard for reporting spending in the h ealth sector . T h e d e v e l o p m e n t p r o c e s s f o r t h e monitoring of resources invested in immunization wi ll involve an emphasis on strengthening country capacity and creating a single platform for collect ing and analysing all health expenditures , including those on priority diseases or programmes like immunization, and for preparing an annual report. This effort is intended to unify under a single platform other resource-tracking initiatives, such as those being undertaken on national health accounts, and t hose for (i) the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health an d (ii) the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This exercise will not on ly ensure regular and efficient reporting of good-quality data as part of the monitoring process , but will also promote accountability and sustainability for immunization financing. 15. Activities to track resources will focus on evaluat ing funding flows to support immunization programmes from national governments, development p artners and, to the extent possible, civil society organizations at the global, regional and c ountry levels. Findings will be reported for the 94 countries, territories and areas identified in t he costing and financing analysis of the global vac cine 1 Available at http://www.who.int/nha/sha_revision/e n/ (accessed 26 February 2013).

Annual reporting by countries will be phased in, with an increasing number of countries reportin g annually as national capacity is enhanced. Sources of data for the resource-tracking exercise include government reports, and records of expenditures incurred by development partner agencies and civil society organizations engaged in immunization activities, insurance providers, private entities and households. Funding flows will be evaluated both in total and, to the extent possible , with disaggregated data on expenditures for vaccines and delivery. Other possible disaggregatio n will be explored as the quality and breadth of data are examined more fully. Oversight, review of progress and next steps 16. The regional and global level review will use WHO's existing processes. At the global level the review process will be through the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization and to the Health Assembly through the Board. The proposed mec hanism for the review and reporting at the global level is through the constitution of a worki ng group on the Decade of Vaccines by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization. The work ing group would consist of eight individuals with the technical expertise to review each compone nt of the framework for monitoring, evaluation and accountability and would have the appropriate geographical and gender representation. 17. It is proposed that the Secretariat prepare and tra nsmit annual reports on the Decade of Vaccines to the working group for detailed review, and that the assessment report and any draft recommendations for corrective actions from this working group be submitted to the Strategic Advisory Group for further review, on the basis of which the progress report for the Board and Health Assembly will be prepared. 18. At the regional level, WHO's regional offices are c onsidering the mechanisms for review and reporting to the regional committees. Member States would need to consider the review and reporting modalities at the country level. It is envisaged th at countries will develop a national-level framewor k to monitor performance of immunization programmes a s well as a review process to document best practices, identify problems and make recommendatio ns for corrective action. At the country level, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups and t h e I n t e r a g e n c y C o o r d i n a t i o n C o m m i t t e e s may have important roles to play in this regard. 19. The process for collecting and synthesizing data ba sed on the proposed framework has been initiated, with the first substantive report to the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts for immunizati on due in 2013. Following that, a report based on the assessment of progress by the Advisory Group will be provided to the governing bodies in 2014.

Available data on progress made toward achieving th e goals for the Decade of Vaccines as of 2011 are summarized below. Progress made on poliomy elitis eradication is described in a separate report.2 21. Between 2000 and 2011, the reported incidence of me asles at global level decreased by 65% from 146 to 52 cases per million population. In 201 1 reported measles incidence was lowest in the Region of the Americas (2 cases per million), follo wed by the Western Pacific Region (12 cases per million), the South-East Asia Region (36 cases per million), the European Region (43 cases per million), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (61 case s per million) and the African Region (227 cases per million) . However, despite this progress, a careful assessmen t of the comprehensive reports presented indicates that based on current trends an d programme performance, the 2015 targets for immunization coverage and mortality reduction will not be met. On the same basis, it is also likely th at the regional elimination targets for three regions will not be met by their respective target years: t he European Region (2015), the Eastern Mediterranean ( 2015) and the African Region (2020). 22. By the end of 2011, 23 of the 58 countries targeted had b een v al ida ted a s hav i ng elim inat ed neonatal tetanus.3 S u p p l e m e n t a l i m m u n i z a t i o n a c t i v i t i e s t a r g e t i n g w o m en of reproductive age are being implemented in the remaining countries to enable them to achieve the elimination target. 23. An estimated 83% of infants worldwide received at l east three doses of diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP3) in 2011; 130 Me mber States achieved national coverage of at least 90% and 113 of them had sustained this level of coverage for three or more years. However, only 50 of them achieved coverage of at least 80% in eac h district or equivalent administrative unit; 49 did not achieve this target and 31 did not report subna tional coverage data. Five countries (Ethiopia, Ind ia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan) accounted for 62% of all unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children in the world. 24. In 2011, 33 of the 141 Member States classified as low- or m iddle- incom e countr ies by th e World Bank added one or more new or underutilized v accines to their national immunization schedule. 25. Under-five mortality is declining. Among the 74 so- called Countdown countries,4 24 are now on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4. 1 The independent Expert Review Group reports regular ly to the United Nations Secretary-General on the r esults and resources related to his Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health and on progress in implementing this Commission's recommendations (available at http://www.who.int/woman_child_accountability/about /ierg/en/index.html, accessed 26 February 2013 ). 2 Document A66/18. 3 The countries validated were: Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Comoros, Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ghana, Liberia , Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Turkey, Uganda, Viet Nam, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 4 The Countdown countries consist of the States that bear the highest burden of child and maternal mort ality and whose progress towards achievement of the Millenniu m Development Goals is monitored by a group of Unit ed Nations agencies through the countdown process. Page 82A66/19 6 COMMUNICATING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF AND CHALLENGES T O THE DECADE OF VACCINES 26. In order to ensure progress towards the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Decade of Vaccines, coordinated advocacy and communication strategies and consistent messages will be required. These efforts will need to demonstrate th e value of vaccines and secure the necessary commitments from all stakeholders, including nation al governments and communities. The 5th GAVI Alliance Partners' Forum which was held in D ar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, from 5-7 December 2012 provided an opportunity to advocate in support of the Decade of Vaccines and to the participants with update about developme nts since the endorsement of the global vaccine action plan by the Health Assembly. 27. WHO is working with UNICEF, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States of America, the GAVI Alliance and the B i l l & M e l i n d a G a t e s F o u n d a t i o n a n d o t h e r partners to develop a communications strategy for W orld Immunization Week, the designation of which was requested by the Health Assembly in resol ution WHA65.18. The Secretariat will produce a new information pack for World Immunization Week, which will take place from 24 to 30 April 2013. The pack will include multimedia features, a campai gn essentials toolkit for event organizers, and relevant info-graphics. 28. A Global Vaccine Summit will be held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on 24 and 25 April to coincide with World Immunization Week. The Global Vaccine Summit will continue the momentum of the Decade of Vaccines. 29. The Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum, t o b e h e l d a p p r o x i m a t e l y e v e r y 18 months, will serve as an opportunity to track pr ogress and to stimulate debate on the research agenda of the action plan. The Forum will be co-hos ted by WHO, the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in close collaboration with other major stakeholders. The first Forum will be held in early 2014. ACTION BY THE HEALTH ASSEMBLY 30. The Health Assembly is invited to take note of the report, including the proposed framework for monitoring and evaluation and accountability.

No licensed dengue vaccine is currently available. However, there is a significant and continually growing public health need for effective interventi ons against dengue.1 A s a f e , e f f e c t i v e a n d affordable dengue vaccine would represent a major a dvance for the control of the disease. Several vaccine candidates are currently at different stage s of preclinical or clinical development.2 T h e candidate currently at the most advanced clinical development stage is a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur (CYD-TDV ), which is under evaluation in phase II and phase III clinical studies. What are the main objectives of the phase IIb study of CYD-TDV in Thailand?3 The primary objective of the phase IIb study is to assess the efficacy of CYD-TDV in preventing dengue disease, after completion of the vaccination schedule of three doses given 6 months apart. Additional objectives include the evaluation of vac cine safety and immunogenicity. The study population consists of 4,002 children aged 4 to 11 years in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity results, as available one y e a r a f t e r c o m p l e t i o n o f t h e v a c c i n a t i o n schedule, are described in a recent publication.3 The study protocol includes a follow-up period of two additional years, which is currently ongoing. What conclusions can be drawn from the results of t he phase IIb study? This is the first study conducted to evaluate the e fficacy of any dengue vaccine candidate against clinical dengue disease in a population naturally e xposed to dengue, which represents a significant advance for the field of dengue vaccine research. T he results are therefore of considerable interest to the vaccine research community. Phase IIb studies are generally designed to provide initial proof-of-concept data, to be corroborated in larger phase III studies. Interpretation of phas e IIb study results should therefore be undertaken with caution. The primary efficacy analysis, as defined in the pr otocol for this study, is based on the number of dengue cases in vaccinated and control subjects, du ring a one year observation period following completion of the vaccination schedule. The reporte d vaccine efficacy result of 30.2% (95% confidence interval: -13.4% to 56.6%) is not statis tically significant, and the vaccine efficacy therefore remains inconclusive. Additional analyses were carried out to explore eff icacy after at least one vaccine dose, and against individual dengue virus serotypes. Statistically si gnificant efficacy estimates were reported for thre e of the four dengue virus serotypes after at least one vaccine dose, but not after three doses. These exploratory analyses, which are based on relatively s m a l l n u m b e r s o f d e n g u e c a s e s , m u s t b e interpreted cautiously. According to a WHO advisory group of experts4, the recently published data from this phase IIb study do not yet prove nor disprove efficacy of CYD -TDV against disease caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes. Further studies in larger populations and different epidemiological settings are needed to assess conclusively the efficacy of t his vaccine candidate. Page 94 2 Based on the recently published data, the safety pr ofile of CYD-TDV is satisfactory, for an observation period of 25 months after the first vac cine dose. Continued follow-up of participants in this and other studies will be critical to generate data towards an assessment of long-term safety of CYD-TDV. Antibody responses to each of the four dengue virus s t r a i n s i n t h e v a c c i n e w e r e o b s e r v e d i n vaccinated subjects. Evaluation of antibody persist ence over time will require continued follow-up of participants in this and other studies. Detailed d a t a o n t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n a n t i b o d y responses and protection against clinical dengue di sease in this study, such as comparisons of antibody levels in vaccinated subjects who develope d dengue versus those who did not, remain to be published. Other efficacy studies in different epidemiological settings should also contribute to addressing this critical question. What are the implications for phase III studies and potential future licensure? The recently published data from a phase IIb study support the continued evaluation of this vaccine candidate in phase III studies. Phase III efficacy studies of CYD-TDV are currently underway in 31,000 children and adolescents in 10 countries in Asia and Latin America. These large-scale, multi-centre studies in a variety of epidemiologica l settings will be important to obtain pivotal efficacy results, additional safety data, and further insight into the relationship between vaccine- induced immune responses and protection against cli nical dengue disease. Future licensure of any dengue vaccine candidate wi ll depend on the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy data by national regulatory agencies. Based on currently available evidence, WHO believes that the public health value of CYD-TDV re mains to be demonstrated, and further studies are therefore needed. How is WHO involved in dengue vaccine research effo rts? The role of WHO is to advise and guide the dengue v accine development activities of the global research community. This includes scientific consen sus-building, guidance on vaccine evaluation, and assessment of the evidence base for policy reco mmendations on vaccine introduction and use. WHO also provides guidance to national regulatory a gencies on approaches and methodologies related to the assessment and licensure of vaccines a n d p o s t - l i c e n s u r e s u r v e i l l a n c e . I n a d d i t i o n , WHO prequalification is a mechanism to ensure that a vaccine meets international standards for quality, safety and efficacy and is appropriate for t h e t a r g e t p o p u l a t i o n . O n l y W H O p r e q u a l i f i e d vaccines can be supplied to countries through UN ag encies.

There is no licensed dengue vaccine and prevention is exclusively through vector control. However, s everal vaccine candidates with a variety of vaccine constructs are in the pipeline with th e most advanced being a live attenuated chimeric vaccine (developed by sanofi pasteur) that employ s the yellow fever 17D -backbone which is currently in Phase III trials in Asia and the American region . WHO held an expert consultation in October 2011 to review long-term safety considerations of dengue vaccines , and in particular the current scientific evidence regarding a hypothetical concern (based on the natural history of dengue) of an increased risk of severe dengue resulting from vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine. The experts convened also considered broadly various m ethodological approaches that could potentially be used for the long-term assessment of vaccine safety. Safety issues It has long been recognized that i nfection with a specific DENV serotype (of the 4 distinct serotypes) produces life -long serotype -specific immunity whereas immunity against the other serotypes is short -lived for about 3 to 6 months . Severe disease occurs most commonly after secondary infections and t he most important risk factor is infection with a different serotype than the previous infection(s ). There is additional evidence of an increased risk of severe disease in dengue -infected infants born to dengue -immune mothers associated with decline in maternally -derived neutralizing antibodies. While mechanisms for this increased immunopathology are not well understood, non -neutralizing antibodies or sub -neutralizing antibody titres are believed to constitute a critical element. To date, clinical trials have not observed an increased risk of severe dengue following vaccination . In addition, trials to date have shown the live dengue vaccine candidates to be well-tolerated (some studies showed more local and systemic reactions after the first dose than subsequent doses and more frequent fever than in adults ) and have not reported d engue -like illness caused by the vaccine . Page 96Dengue&long )term&safety& )&Executive&Summary&for&SAGE&Meeting &(April&2013 )& & &2&Current WHO guidelines and considerations for future assessments Previous WHO guidelines for the clinical evaluation of dengue vaccines in endemic areas (2008), and guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccines (2012) have recomme nded follow -up of dengue -vaccinated and control subjects for at least 3 to 5 years after completion of primary vaccination in Phase II and Phase III trials . Ongoing clinical trials for candidate vaccines take i nto account th is WHO guidance , however, post -licensure vaccine introduction strategies may need to include longer -term assessments in order to extend and provide more robust safety (and effectiveness ) data. The WHO consultation discussed a number o f methodological considerations, including factors for or against the potential use of case -control, cohort, randomised control or stepped wedge study designs. Key issues to be considered in selecting an appropriate study design and planning long -term studies will include the feasibility of accurate a scertain ment of vaccination status and infection exposure , the a scertainment of severe dengue and diagnostic challenges, a need to conduct studies in a variety of settings with different dengue transmission intensities , and ethical challenges for inclu ding unvaccinated comparison groups in long-term studies after a n effective vaccine is licensed. Key conclusions of the expert consultation included that (a) reliable data on the long -term safety of dengue vaccines will be critical to identify and manage unsubstantiated safety concerns that could emerge after vaccine introduction ; (b) a coordinated approach should be established to ensure such safety assessment (most likely in sentinel sites); (c) efforts should be made to enhance dengue surveillance in countries where the vaccine is introduced given that cases of severe dengue are less likely to be captured by the current adverse event surveillance systems in many endemic countries ; (d) dengue vaccine introduction provides an opportunity to further strengthen routine post -marketing surveillance of AEFI (e.g., through the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative ); and (e ) the c ollection and long - term storage of serum or other samples from vaccinees should be encouraged to fac ilitate further studies (e.g. for correlates of protection and possible booster needs ). It was also noted that c lose collaboration will be needed between licensing national regulatory authorities and with respective vaccine sponsors.

When the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) issued its /f_irst report early in April 2011: r\u000199% of polio had been eradicated a decade previously but 1% had remained since then. r\u0001Four countries had 'endemic' disease: India, Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. r\u0001Three countries that had previously been free of disease had 're-established transmission' for more than six months: Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo. r\u0001There had been 14 outbreaks in other countries since the start of 2010. 2. In its series of meetings and reports, the IMB has challenged a ected countries and those leading the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (we use the term 'the Programme' for the sum total of these people and activities) to look critically at performance and improve it. The IMB has pushed the Programme to broaden its thinking and approach to embrace more strongly the 'people factors' that are critical to this endeavour. Traditionally, the Programme's strengths have lain with technical and epidemiological disease control interventions and activities. The IMB has raised questions, directed attention and recommended action in areas such as: r\u0001Are the right people in the right jobs? r\u0001Is there political commitment and alignment from national to regional to local level? r\u0001Are governmental leaders working e ectively with traditional and religious leaders? r\u0001Is the management of local vaccination days achieving a consistent standard of best practice? r\u0001Are front-line vaccinators properly trained and valued? r\u0001Is the Programme receiving the level of priority attention needed for success? r\u0001Is everybody focusing on why vaccination days repeatedly miss the same children, and on what can be done about it? r\u0001What can be done to eliminate refusals and increase community demand? r\u0001Does the Programme think and act too much in isolation, missing opportunities for strong and e ective alliances? 3. The IMB has been pleased that the Programme has responded positively to our guidance. We have seen its leadership re /f_lect, learn, change its emphasis, and increase its urgency. Page 100Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio's Last Stand? 64. A s we issue this, our sixth report: r\u0001All but 0.1% of polio has been eradicated globally: there were 350,000 cases in 1988; there have been just 175 so far in 2012. r\u0001Polio is more tightly con /f_ined than ever before - a ecting just 94 districts in four countries so far this year. r\u0001The Programme is enjoying an unprecedented level of priority and commitment, much of it stemming from the World Health Assembly's declaration of polio eradication as an emergency for global public health. 5. The IMB was established to monitor the Programme's 20 1 0- 1 2 Strategic Plan. This aimed to stop global polio transmission by the end of 20 1 2. The Programme will now clearly not achieve this goal. 6. Despite it missing yet another deadline, the IMB judges the Programme's prospects to be more positive than ever. If this level of progress had been achieved at the start, not the end, of the 2010- 1 2 period, transmission could have been stopped by now. 7. History shows how cruel polio can be - that it resurges more easily than it is contained. There is a signi /f_icant risk of having more polio cases in 201 3 than in 201 2, and in more countries. The Programme must receive a level of priority to not just mitigate this risk, but to achieve another year of major progress towards stopping transmission. 8. The challenge ahead is huge for each of the four countries where polio transmission persists: r\u0001Nigeria is the only country to have had more polio transmission this year than last. There is /f_inally some evidence that more children are being vaccinated. With its personnel surge and well-constructed plan, the Nigerian Programme may be on the brink of a breakthrough. Over the next six months, the world will be watching. If case numbers are not reduced, spread to other countries is all but inevitable. The fate of polio in Nigeria - and therefore Africa - now lies in the hands of the Nigerian Programme - from President to vaccinator . The Local Government Area Chairmen and T raditional Leaders of the north are crucial in leading this mission. The Programme needs to do everything possible to encourage and support them. r\u0001Pakistan's chances of stopping polio have been transformed over the last year. Its Programme reorientated and case numbers plummeted in 201 2 as a result. But an election looms, which could distract government at every level and allow the virus to resurge. This, and a complex security situation, are the major risks in Pakistan in 201 3. r\u0001Afghanistan has surely, but too slowly, made progress over the last two years. Its slow pace of improvement is worrying, particularly because the country's security landscape faces uncertainty as international troops withdraw. r\u0001Chad has rebuilt its Polio Programme over the last year, su ering just /f_ive cases so far in 201 2. It now needs to build on its turnaround, to create a programme that can see every last bit of polio virus gone from the country. Page 101Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio's Last Stand? 79. Each country will stop polio transmission if its leaders, at every level, take to heart the mission to protect their country's children from being blighted by polio. The word 'ownership' encapsulates what is required. The Indian Government and the Indian people truly 'own' the task of protecting children and families from the scourge of polio. India did not want its image as a modern, vibrant, successful nation to be tarnished by harboring a virus that has been vanquished in most countries of the world. India seized 'ownership' of the polio eradication e ort and as a direct consequence has interrupted transmission for the /f_irst time in its history. 10. We make ten recommendations to the Global Programme: r\u0001Every time a child or adult travels abroad from Afghanistan, Nigeria or Pakistan, they risk carrying the polio virus with them. We recommend that the International Health Regulations Expert Review Committee urgently issue a standing recommendation by May 201 3 that will introduce pre-travel vaccination or vaccination checks in each of these countries until national transmission is stopped. No country should allow a citizen from any endemic polio state to cross their border without a valid vaccination certi /f_icate. r\u0001The low season over the next six months is a crucial time. Each of the four aected countries has many actions planned, amongst which the priorities could get lost. Countries that have successfully stopped transmission o er vital lessons about what these priorities should be. We recommend that each aected country rapidly considers its plan, and best practice elsewhere, to set out a list of no more than /f_ive priority goals that they absolutely commit to achieve by the end of April 201 3, and maintains the focus and pace necessary to do so. r\u0001When the same children are missed by one vaccination campaign after another, frequent campaigns may not be the best way to stop polio transmission. We recommend that an analysis be urgently commissioned to examine the relationship between the frequency and quality of vaccination campaigns, to guide programmatic decisions about the optimum interval between campaigns. r\u0001Mothers and fathers are critical to the Programme's success, but do not have a voice within it. We recommend that every endemic country district-level task force (or equivalent) should be constituted to include a parent, representing parents of the district. r\u0001Too many communities see polio vaccination as an imposition with no bene /f_it. We recommend that every opportunity be taken to 'pair' other health and neighbourhood bene /f_its with the polio vaccine. r\u0001The Programme cannot a ord for vaccine supply issues to dictate when campaigns can and cannot be held. The IMB requests a report on vaccine supply at each of its future meetings.Page 102Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Polio's Last Stand? 8r\u0001Capturing the learning, both positive and negative, from polio eradication for future public health programmes is essential. It is an important and distinct part of the legacy of the Polio Programme. This learning needs to be rigorous and comprehensive, needs to involve other partners in immunisation, and it needs to start now. We recommend that the Programme accelerate planning to set out how the learning from polio eradication can be captured and disseminated as part of the strategic legacy plan, overseen and funded with minimal distraction to current work. r\u0001It would be dangerous to assume that polio will remain con /f_ined to four countries. Population movement and poor immunity leave a great number of other nations and areas at risk of importation, particularly Yemen, Libya, the Horn of Africa, Somalia, Ukraine, Uganda and Kenya. We recommend that an intensive 'Polio Watch' be established in the countries at highest risk of a polio outbreak. We further recommend that the responsible WHO Regional O ces should issue within the next month an action plan for strengthening vaccination coverage and surveillance in these areas. r\u0001In India, maintaining the hard-earned polio-free status is crucial. We recommend that India plans for a simulation exercise to test the readiness of its emergency response plans. We recommend that the exercise should begin, on an unannounced date in mid-20 1 3, by selecting a sample of districts at random and carrying out real-time simulation-based scrutiny of their emergency response capability. r\u0001An Emergency Operations Centre is being established in Nigeria. We recommend that a continual live audiovisual feed should be broadcast online from here, with a facility for the world's polio experts and the IMB to observe and provide input at any time. 11. The Programme ends 201 2 in a complex position: deadline missed, but strong progress made. What happens next? The Programme is developing a strategic plan. Aspirations are no longer good enough - this needs to be a rigorous manifesto for success. Asking for a US$5.5 billion investment, it needs to robustly address the question: why can this Programme now achieve what it has so far failed to deliver? The body of this report sets out the strategic areas that need thorough development. These include ensuring clarity and realism about how the Programme relates to routine immunisation, and making sure that the mission of eradication is truly led by the countries where polio persists. 12 . As 201 2 draws to a close, the IMB congratulates those who have made the year a success for the Polio Programme. We also pay great tribute to the memory of those who have tragically lost their lives in the pursuit of polio eradication. 13 . The Programme has never been in a stronger position, but how history looks back on 201 2 will depend what happens next. The remaining polio virus now sits on just 0.2% of the Earth's land mass. Are we seeing its last stand? Only a fool would say this for certain. The virus has fought back and outwitted the Programme many times. Its survival guide is well-established - weak leadership, poor parental engagement, /f_lawed microplans, under- /f_inancing. The time is momentous for pubic health history. A /f_inal concerted e ort could indeed mean writing the story of polio's last stand. One size does not fit all : While core principles of eradication are global and the vast majority of all polio-endemic countries stopped transmission within two-three years, the tactics needed in the remaining countries need to be carefully tailored to adapt to a range of factors. 2. Technological innovation cannot overcome gaps in political support, management and community engagement : It is necessary to create and foster strong political support, as programme management and accountability. In addition, social mobilization must be focused on a micro-level to increase community trust and reach chronically missed children. 3. A combination of innovations tailored to country context can deliver success in even the most challenging conditions : India's success highlighted operationa l best practices to ensure highest quality polio vaccination campaigns. These in cluded: careful micro-planning; strengthened monitoring; a massive and well-managed social mobilization effort; strict accountability measures; community and local leadership en gagement; and, a mass increase of human resources at district Sutter RW, et al.

Page 112Version: 19 March 2013 Page 2 of 43 Introduction Yellow fever is a vector-borne disease resulting from the transmission of yellow fever virus to a human from the bite of an infected mosquito. It is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Infection in humans is capable of producing hemorrhagic fever and is fatal in 20-50% of person with severe disease. Because no treatment exists for yellow fever disease, prevention is critical to lower disease risk and mortality. Yellow fever vaccine has been used since 1937 in the prevention of yellow fever disease with more than 600 million doses of the vaccine having been delivered worldwide. Currently all yellow fever vaccines in use are live attenuated viral vaccine from the 17D lineage. The vaccine has been proven to be highly immunogenic and a single dose provides long-term protection against yellow fever. In general, the vaccine is well tolerated inducing mild local and systemic side effects in up to a third of recipients. However, rare but serious side effects have been observed following yellow fever vaccination including: 1) immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions; 2) yellow fever neurologic and 3) yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). YEL - AND is a group of neurologic conditions that are either due to direct viral invasion of the central nervous system by the vaccine virus resulting in meningitis or encephalitis or due to an autoimmun e reaction resulting in conditions such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. YEL- AVD results from the replication and dissemination of the vaccine virus similar to the wild-type virus. Y EL-AVD cases typically develop multi-organ system dysfunction or failure and over 60% of cases have been fatal. To date, YEL-AND and YEL- AVD only have been reported in primary vaccine recipients. Yellow fever vaccine is recommended for person aged 9 months who are living in or traveling to areas at risk for yellow fever virus transmission in South America and Africa. Because of the risk of spread of the virus through infected mosquitoes or more likely infected humans, policies regarding the use of yellow fever vaccination are included in International Health Regulations (IHR). Under IHR (2005), countries can require proof of yellow fever vaccine receipt from persons upon entry. Individuals who arrive in a country with a yellow fever vaccination entry requirement without proof of vaccination may be quarantined for up to 6 days. Per IHR, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is consider to provide protection against yellow fever virus infection starting 10 days following the administration of the vaccine and continuing for 10 years when a booster dose of the vaccine should be given. The SAGE Working Group on Yellow Fever Vaccines was tasked with reviewing evidence and preparing recommendations related to the use of yellow fever vaccines in order to update the 2003 WHO position paper for SAGE review. This report reviews the evidence related to main topics considered by the working group, including: 1. Need for booster doses every 10 years to maintain protection against yellow fever 2. Safety of the vaccine in selected special populations a. Persons aged 60 years and older b. HIV-infected persons c. Persons with other immunocompromising conditions d. Pregnant women e. Lactating women, specifically the safety of vaccine exposure in their breastfed infants Page 113Version: 19 March 2013 Page 3 of 43 3. Interference between yellow fever and other co-administered vaccines 4. Impact of vaccination strategies on control of yellow fever a. Routine vaccination versus outbreak control b. Combined routine immunizations and preventive campaigns Methodology To update the 2003 WHO position paper on yellow fever vaccine, the SAGE working group for yellow fever vaccination considered several key issues (outlined above). To address the se issues and review current data relating to yellow fever vaccination, the working group first met in December 2011 conducting monthly teleconferences through July 2012 and having two face- to-face meetings conducted in April 2012 and January 2013. Published, peer-reviewed studies were the primary source of data used. When relevant to issues under discussion, unpublished data available to WHO also were considered. To address the question related to the need of a booster of yellow fever vaccine and safety of yellow fever vaccine in persons age 60 years and over, the WHO Secretariat collaborated with both external (Eduardo Gotuzzo and Gabriela C\u00f3rdova) and internal investigators (Ellen Rafferty) to review available data. This work was also supplemented by the following questions that were assessed by personnel from the WHO Secretariat using the GRADE approach: Is there evidence that a booster dose is required in immunocompetent individuals to ensure long- term protection? Is there evidence that elderly individuals over 60 years of age in endemic settings are at greater risk of Y EL-AVD? Is there evidence that elderly travelers over 60 years of age are at greater risk of Y EL-AVD ? Findings and Recommendations The findings and recommendations of the working group for each of the main topics reviewed are presented below in distinct sections. Each section includes key findings, more in-depth information, and the recommendations of the working group. Page 114Version: 19 March 2013 Page 4 of 43 Booster Doses Key Findings No efficacy study has been performed for yellow fever vaccine; however, neutralizing antibodies have been used as a surrogate to indicate a protective immune response. The current recommendation of a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine every ten years has been in place under IHR since 1965 and was determined based on limited evidence. Data suggest that the majority of vaccine recipients will develop a protective antibody titer against yellow fever virus within 28 days of vaccination and will maintain protective antibody titers for potentially several decades, or possibly life-long, following vaccination. Children less than 2 years of age have lower seroconversion rates following a single dose of yellow fever vaccine. Very few primary vaccine failures following yellow fever vaccination have been reported and there are no reports of secondary vaccine failures due to time elapsed after immunization. Recent data suggest that, in addition to neutralizing antibodies, both innate and cell-mediated immunity also contribute to the initial immune response and the maintenance of long-term protection against yellow fever virus in those who are vaccinated. !Although no human efficacy studies have been performed with yellow fever vaccine, several observations support yellow fever vaccine being protective in humans, including: 1) the reduction of laboratory-associated infections in vaccinated workers; 2) the observation following initial use of the vaccine in Brazil and other South American countries that yellow fever only occurred in unvaccinated people; 3) the rapid disappearance of cases during yellow fever vaccination campaigns initiated during epidemics, and 4) the protection of rhesus monkeys against virulent yellow fever virus by neutralizing antibodies generated in response to yellow fever vaccination [1, 2]. From the dose-response study conducted in rhesus monkeys, a minimal level of neutralizing antibodies needed to protect the monkeys against virulent yellow fever virus was established. Testing using a log 10 neutralization index (LNI) demonstrated that LNI >0.7 was correlated strongly with protection [1]. Although the amount of serum needed for LNI testing is suitable for animal studies or clinical trials, it precludes routine screening among humans [3]. Therefore, a similar test, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), is used most frequently in diagnostic tests and follow-up studies to determine the absence or presence of neutralizing antibodies and the specific serum antibody titer. Clinical trials have found 80% to 100% of vaccinated individuals develop yellow fever virus neutralizing antibodies by 10 days after vaccination [4-6]. Most studies find >99% of the vaccinated individuals developed neutralizing antibodies by 28 days after vaccination [3]. Yellow fever vaccine is recommended for persons aged 9 months who are traveling to or living in areas where there is a risk of yellow fever virus transmission. Per IHR (2005), a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is consider to provide protection against yellow fever virus infection starting 10 days following the administration of the vaccine and continues for 10 years [7]. The booster dose requirement for yellow fever vaccine was put into place in 1959 under the precursor to IHR, International Sanitary Regulations, with booster doses initially being required every 9 years based on available data [8, 9]. Th e booster dose interval was changed in 1965 to every 10 years based published studies that showed Page 115Version: 19 March 2013 Page 5 of 43 neutralizing antibodies were present in the majority of vaccine recipients for at least 10 years after vaccination (Table 1) [10, 11]. A systematic review conducted by external collaborators and WHO secretariat identified at least 6 additional studies on the presence of neutralizing antibodies in yellow fever vaccine recipients 10 or more years since vaccination [12-18]. Although different techniques and assay PRNT cutoff values were used in the studies, most studies document a high proportion of vaccine recipients (>90%) with detectable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies up to 20 years post vaccination (Table 1). Studies that have looked at persons 20 or more years after vaccination have found that approximately 80% of vaccine recipients still have detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies [12, 14, 15, 17]. One of these long-term immunity studies was conducted among U.S. military veterans from World War II and found that more than 80% of military personnel had neutralizing antibody 30-35 years following a single dose of yellow fever vaccine [12]. In a separate study, neutralizing antibodies were detected in one vaccine recipient 60 years following their vaccination [17]. Since the 1930s when yellow fever vaccine was first used, only 12 cases of yellow fever disease have been identified among vaccine recipients of over 600 million doses of the vaccine administered (Table 2) [19-23]. Of the 12 cases, some (n=3) lacked any laboratory data to confirm them as yellow fever cases while others had questionable or inadequate laboratory findings (n=7). Two of the yellow fever disease cases occurred in person who received the vaccine within two weeks of their illness onset and thus may not have had adequate time to develop neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine before being exposed to wild-type yellow fever virus. For these cases, nucleotide sequencing was performed and identified wild-type yellow fever virus rather than vaccine virus (i.e., not YEL -AVD cases) [23]. A ll 12 of the cases of yellow fever disease among vaccine recipients developed within 5 years of vaccination suggesting that secondary vaccine failures due to waning immunity do not occur. In addition to the systematic review, the following question related to the need for a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine was evaluated using GRADE: 1) Is there evidence that a booster dose is required in immunocompetent individuals to ensure long-term protection? (Table 3). The conclusions from GRADE were that healthy persons rarely fail to develop neutralizing antibodies after vaccination. Despite some observed time-dependent waning, neutralizing antibody titers can be found in the vast majority more than 10 years after vaccination. Further evidence suggests that even with no detectable neutralizing antibodies, protective immunity might be induced due to cell-mediated immunity. Post-licensing monitoring of break-through infections is missing yet observational studies attest the effectiveness of the vaccine. In endemic settings high primary vaccination coverage (60-80%) is sufficient to prevent yellow fever outbreaks and waning of antibody titers seems not to be relevant in affected regions. In immunocompetent persons, there is no demonstrated need for a booster dose every ten years. However, the confidence in the estimate of the effect on the outcome is limited. Working Group Discussion and Conclusions The need and timing of booster doses of yellow fever vaccine was discussed by the previous SAGE Yellow Fever Working Group that provided the recommendations for the 2003 yellow fever vaccine position paper. It was noted at that time that the booster dose recommendation predominantly applied to travelers, most of which were traveling from non-endemic areas. The current working group reviewed information: 1) collected through the systematic review [18]; 2) from outbreaks of the yellow fever disease in endemic countries; and 3) on the mechanism of Page 116Version: 19 March 2013 Page 6 of 43 immunologic memory following yellow fever vaccination. The working group agreed that the information collected from the systematic review (presented above) suggest that immunity following yellow fever vaccination is likely to be life-long. The working group also noted the rarity of primary vaccine failures and the lack of identified secondary vaccine failures in persons from endemic areas or in travelers who have been vaccinated against yellow fever. However, the working group did note issues and concerns with interpreting published study data as different PRNT levels (e.g., 50% to 90% cutoff) were used in the various studies and the lack of a clear correlate of protection in the immune response to yellow fever vaccination. It was also noted that persons living in an endemic area are likely to have some degree of \"boosting\" that occurs due to exposure either to yellow fever virus or to related viruses, such as dengue, West Nile, or Zika virus es. Furthermore, endemic populations are likely to have some effect of herd immunity in regards to protection as humans are a potential amplifying reservoir of yellow fever virus. So if there is adequate vaccine coverage, an unvaccinated individual may be \"protected\" due to decrease in amplifying reservoirs around them. Another potential concern raised by working group members are data suggesting that children (<2 years) do not seem to develop the same high level of neutralizing antibodies as is seen in adults and this could lead to some yellow fever cases among persons who received the vaccine as a child if a booster dose is not given [24]. However, this observation is confounded by the fact that seroprotective levels of neutralizing antibodies, using a PRNT, have not been determined. In regards to outbreaks of yellow fever disease, the working group discussed unpublished data from the large outbreaks of yellow fever that occurred in Nigeria during the 1980s. Nigeria had good levels of yellow fever vaccination in their population until the 1960s, when routine vaccination was discontinued. In the 1980s, large outbreaks of the disease were seen in several areas of the country and hundreds of thousands of persons were believed to develop disease [25, 26]. During these outbreaks, yellow fever disease only occurred in unvaccinated individuals and persons who received yellow fever vaccine several decades previously were protected from developing yellow fever disease (Tomori, personal communication). In response to concerns over the lack of a correlate of protection and potential waning antibody titers against yellow fever virus over time following yellow fever vaccination, the working group briefly discussed the mechanism of immunologic memory following vaccination. Recent research suggests cellular immunity and innate immunity contribute to the initial immune response and sustaining the immune memory to yellow fever vaccination [27, 28]. Therefore, the working group felt that a lack of detectable neutralizing antibodies may not mean a lack of protection against yellow fever viral infection among yellow fever vaccine recipients; however, detection of neutralizing antibodies was clearly associated with a protective immune response. Finally, the working group noted that yellow fever surveillance needs to be improved and maintained in order to detect potential yellow fever cases due to vaccine failure. Testing of acute samples for viral RNA will be critical for these cases to differentiate vaccine failures from other caus es of jaundice and hemorrhage. Recommendations: Based on currently available data, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine appears to confer life-long protective immunity against yellow fever disease. Therefore, a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed to maintain immunity. However, further study is needed Page 117Version: 19 March 2013 Page 7 of 43 in certain groups, who may have suboptimal seroconversion rates following a single dose of the vaccine to determine if they may benefit from a single booster dose.

Conclusi ons In total over 540 million doses of yellow fever have been used globally (1) . So far only 12 cases of secondary vaccine failure have been reported in literature (2-6)4. Healthy persons rarely fail to develop neutralizing antibodies after vaccination (7). Despite some observed time -dependent waning, neutralzing antibody titers can be found in the vast majority more than 10 years after vaccination (8-19). Further evidence suggests that even with no detectable neutralizing antibodies , immunity might be giv en due to cell -mediated protective effects (13;15) . Post - licensing monitoring of break -through infections is missing yet observational studies attest the effectiveness of the vaccine. In endemic settings high primary vaccination coverage (60 -80%) is sufficient to prevent yellow fever outbreaks and waning of antibody titers seems not to be relevant in affected regions (20) . In immunocompetent persons there is no demonstrated need for a booster dose ev ery ten years. 1 6 observational studies reported 74.5 -100% neutralizing antibody (NTAb) 10years after vaccination. One small study reported 65% (n=13/20) with protective NTAb after 10 years (De Melo et al. 2011). One study (Gomez SY et al. 2008) reported NTAb in >68% in v accinees after 4years post vaccination. One study (Veit et al.2009) reported 88% NTAb 1 -10 years after vaccination and one study reported 73% with NTAb 3 - 4 years after vaccination (Gibney et al. 2012). 2 Limitations in only 2 of 8 studies/therefore no do wngrading: No clear description of method and incomplete medical records of vaccinated (Poland et al. 1981). Non -standardized methods such as mouse -protection test used (Groot et al. 1962). 3 Serological marker as proxy to assess level of clinical protect ion, yet overall agreement in the assumption that titer>1:10 in plaque reduction neutralization test is associated with protective immunity (Hepburn at al. 2006; Monath et al. 2005), therefore no downgrading. 4 Reporting of 10 cases of secondary vaccine failure, with disease onset >5 month after vaccination (3 -6).Two cases with onset of disease 2 -14 days after vaccination (Fillipis et al.2004). Page 123Version: 19 March 2013 Page 13 of 43 ! Page 125Version: 19 March 2013 Page 15 of 43 Special Populations Use of yellow fever vaccine in people over 60 years old Key Findings There are published reports identifying a higher risk of serious adverse events following immunization ( AEFI ), namely YEL-AVD, in persons 60 years old and older compared to younger persons who are receiving the vaccine for travel to an endemic area. There are insufficient data to determine if the risk of serious AEFI may be elevated among elderly persons who reside in an endemic area and receive yellow fever vaccine. !Previous studies have suggest ed that there is a higher risk of serious adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with yellow fever vaccine, in particularly YEL -AVD, among the elderly [1, 2, 3]. These studies primarily used age-specific reporting rates (RRs) and reporting rate ratios (RRRs) as proxies for determining risk in the elderly population and have used a variety of case definitions for YEL -AVD and YEL- AND . A systematic review was conducted by the WHO secretariat that utiliz ed the recently published Brighton case definition for viscerotropic disease in order to better quantitate the current risk of YEL-AVD among the elderly for both travelers and endemic populations [4]. The review found that the crude number of reported cases of YEL-AVD among the elderly ( 60) was quite high (n=19) compared to all the other age groups combined (n=24) (Table 4). After applying the Brighton Classification for both diagnostic certainty and causality to published studies on travelers, the re-calculated RRs were statistically significant and remained the highest among persons aged 70 years or older but also were higher in those aged 60 years as well with significant RRR with ratios of 34 to 47 (Table 5) [1, 2]. Currently, there is only one published article that calculates age-specific RRs of YEL-AVD in an endemic country (Table 6) [5]. Although this study does demonstrate a slightly higher RR of YEL-AVD among the elderly than the average RR, the calculated RRR [RRR=2.57, 95% CI (0.57, 8.54)] showed no significant difference for those aged 60 years compared to those aged 15-59 years (reference population). From these data, the systematic review concluded that: 1) there are data to support an increased risk of YEL-AVD among elderly travelers; and 2) the evidence of increased risk of YEL -AVD in older endemic population is undetermined. In addition to the systematic review, two questions related to the use of yellow fever vaccine in elderly were as evaluated using GRADE: 1) Is there evidence that elderly individuals 60 years of age and older in endemic settings are at greater risk of YEL- AVD than those less than 60 years? and 2) Is there evidence that elderly travelers 60 years of age and older are at greater risk of YEL- AVD than those less than 60 years? Relative to the question on yellow fever vaccine use in elderly individuals living in endemic areas, the conclusion from GRADE found age-related tendencies between Y EL-AVD and older age in endemic settings can be seen, yet the evidence is limited (Table 7). For yellow fever vaccine use in elderly travelers, the conclusion from GRADE was age-related tendencies showed an association between higher rates of serious adverse events after yellow fever vaccination in travelers 60 years than those <60 years (Table 8). Yet the evidence to support association is limited. Further research was felt to be necessary to support either hypothesis. Working Group Discussion and Conclusions Page 126Version: 19 March 2013 Page 16 of 43 The working group felt the main difference between endemic and traveler populations that might account for the higher rates of AEFIs in travelers is that travelers are more likely to be immune na\u00efve to yellow fever virus (both vaccine and wild-type virus) and thus are potentially more \"susceptible\" to developing serious AEFIs than those living in endemic areas. The association between serious AEFIs, like YEL -AVD , and primary vaccination is likely due to the fact that primary vaccine recipients often become viremic following vaccination while viremia has not been documented in persons receiving a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine. A recent study also found more frequent viremia with a higher yellow fever vaccine RNA copy numbers in elderly when compared to younger na\u00efve vaccine recipients [6]. In addition, there was also a delayed antibody response seen among the elderly. The authors hypothesized that slower antibody response and increase in viremia may lead to an increased risk of developing serious AEFI, such as YEL-AVD, and therefore could explain the higher rates of serious AEFI in the elderly population. Based on the current data, the working group concluded that caution be used when vaccinating persons aged 60 years who have not received the vaccine previously regardless if they live in an endemic area or not. They also concluded that further research is needed on this topic as well as exploring the age-specific rates of YEL- AND. Recommendations: Based on the currently available data, it is advisable to recommend caution in vaccinating persons 60 years of age against yellow fever if they have not been previously vaccinated. A risk-benefit assessment for yellow fever vaccination should be performed for any person 60 years of age who has not been vaccinated but for whom the vaccine is recommended. The risk assessment should take into account risk of acquiring yellow fever disease (e.g., location, season, duration of exposure, occupational and recreational activities, and local rate of virus transmission in the potential area of exposure) versus the risk of a potential adverse event following immunization (e.g., age, underlying medical conditions, medications). Further research is needed to better quantitate the risk for vaccine recipients who is 60 years and might reside in or near a yellow fever endemic area. References 1. Martin M, et al.

Yet the evidence to support association between older age and Y EL-AVD in travelers is limited. F urther research is needed to support the hypothesis. 1 Two observational studies reported reporting rate ratio of YEL -AVD in elderly travelers (Khormava et al.2005, Lindsey et al.2008). Some additional trials included reports of YEL -AVD in elderly, but either in endemic settings or no age -related analysis (Martin et al.2001, Martins RdM et al. 2010, Monath et al.2005; Lawrence al 2004;,Fitzner et al. 2004; Struchiner et al. 2004; Whittembury et al.2009 ). 2 Source of data was from passi ve public health surveillance.

Page 136Version: 19 March 2013 Page 26 of 43 Use of yellow fever vaccine in HIV-infected persons Key Findings Data on the safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccines in HIV-positive persons are from a limited number of small studies and case reports, mainly among travelers with CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3. Monitoring vaccination campaigns in countries where the prevalence of HIV is about 1-5% has identified only a few HIV-positive individuals among those with any serious AEFI. Data suggest that the immunologic response to yellow fever vaccine in HIV-infected individuals wanes more rapidly than non-infected vaccinated persons. !Language below is from the Weekly Epidemiological Record (No. 5, 2011, 86, 37 -44) that summarized the GACVS Meeting from December 2010 where yellow fever vaccine use in HIV -infected persons was discussed [1]. The benefits of mass vaccination campaigns for yellow fever are recognized in endemic countries, and millions of individuals are vaccinated against the disease every year in countries where the prevalence of HIV is 1-5% among those aged 15-49 years. In many places access to laboratory testing and other resources for diagnosing and treating HIV infection is poor, and many people with undiagnosed advanced HIV infection are likely to have received the vaccine. Published studies on the safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccines in HIV-positive people are limited to small studies and case reports, mainly of travelers with CD4 counts >200 cells/mm3. With the exception of 1 case of fatal meningoencephalitis, these studies did not detect any other serious [AEFI ] among HIV-positive individuals. However, little evidence has accumulated about the safety of this vaccine in people with advanced HIV infection. Data about the immune response to the vaccine are scarce but show consistent immunogenicity in HIV positive people with CD4 [counts] >200 cells/mm3. In West and Central Africa, between 2007 and 2010, 10 countries undertook vaccination campaigns against yellow fever, during which about 50 million people were vaccinated. In these countries, surveillance efforts have been implemented in collaboration with national health authorities and local expert committees. Analyses of the safety data are continuing in 7 countries, but so far around 194 serious AEFI have been reported, and more than three quarters of patients have been tested for HIV. Only a few individual cases of serious AEFI have occurred in HIV-positive individuals. Similar findings have been reported from vaccination campaigns in Latin America. In summary, monitoring vaccination campaigns in countries where the prevalence of HIV is about 1-5% has identified only a few HIV-positive individuals among those with any serious AEFI; no clear risk has been identified that precludes the use of yellow fever vaccine in people infected with HIV. However, the sensitivity of these studies to detect serious AEFI has not been established. In addition, GACVS is awaiting data about the completeness of case investigation, the classification of serious AEFI and the HIV status of those cases. No changes have been suggested by GACVS to WHO's recommendation that individuals known to be severely immunocompromised should not receive yellow fever vaccine; the available data do not identify a significant problem with mass vaccination in populations where a moderate proportion of individuals are HIV-positive. However, GACVS strongly recommends that additional data on safety and immunogenicity should be obtained on the effect of vaccination in HIV-positive individuals, and Page 137Version: 19 March 2013 Page 27 of 43 especially in those with advanced HIV infection. Also, additional clinical studies of yellow fever vaccines administered to HIV-positive individuals should be conducted. Working Group Discussions and Conclusions The working group reviewed published and unpublished data from the large preventive campaigns that have been conducted in West and Central Africa [2]. The se data did not suggest additional safety concerns beyond those noted by GAVCS previously. The working group also reviewed new data on the immunologic response to yellow fever vaccine in HIV-infected travelers. In a recent retrospective cohort study, 65 (83%) of 78 HIV-infected persons developed specific antibodies against yellow fever virus in the first year after vaccination; however this was significantly lower than vaccinated persons without HIV infection (97%, 64/66) [3]. An older study noted that, only 3 (17%) of 18 HIV-infected infants in developing nations developed yellow fever virus-specific neutralizing antibodies within 10 months of vaccination compared to 42 (74%) of 57 HIV-uninfected controls matched for age and nutritional status [4]. The mechanisms for the diminished immune response in HIV-infected persons are uncertain but appear to be correlated with HIV RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts [5]. Further studies are required to assess the relevance of these findings. Recommendations: [Maintain current language] Yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated for severely immunocompromised persons, including persons with AIDS or CD4+ counts < 200 cells/mm3. Yellow fever vaccination may be offered to asymptomatic HIV- infected persons with CD4+ counts 200 cells/mm3 who require vaccination. Additional data on safety and immunogenicity should be obtained on the effect of vaccination in HIV-positive individuals. References 1. World Health Organization.

Page 138Version: 19 March 2013 Page 28 of 43 Use of yellow fever vaccine in persons with immunocompromising conditions (other than HIV) Key Findings The contraindication of yellow fever vaccine in persons with immunocompromising conditions is based on historical experience with vaccines as a whole rather than yellow fever vaccine specifically. There are limited data on the safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccine in persons with specific immunocompromising conditions. Although there have been case reports and case series published regarding the safe use of yellow fever vaccine in immunocompromised persons, clinical trials with control groups and appropriate surveillance data with clear numerator and denominator data are lacking. The rationale behind contraindicating yellow fever vaccine in immunocompromised persons is based on historical experience with live attenuated vaccines, rather than yellow fever vaccine specifically, and is from the observation that immunocompromised persons may not mount an appropriate immune response to live vaccines and thus the vaccine could cause disease similar to the wild-type disease it is meant to prevent. The only condition where yellow fever vaccine has been associated with an increased risk of serious AEFIs is thymus disease. Four (17%) of the initial 23 YEL-AVD reported cases were noted to occur in persons who had had thymectomies performed for thymomas [1]. Currently, all yellow fever vaccine manufacturers note that yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals in their package inserts. They note that yellow fever vaccine poses a risk of encephalitis or other serious adverse events to patients with illnesses that commonly results in immunosuppression or patients whose immunologic responses are suppressed by treatments/drugs. Furthermore, they note that persons with a history of thymus dysfunction should not be vaccinated. Working Group Discussion and Conclusions The working group reviewed available data on the use of yellow fever vaccine in persons with immunocompromising conditions and did not find any evidence to change the current recommendation that contradicts the use of yellow fever vaccine in persons who are severely immunocompromised. The working group did, however, think that additional clarity is warranted about the specific conditions that might contraindicate or require special caution for the use of yellow fever vaccine. The working group considered the following conditions and treatments to be severely immunocompromising: 1. Severe primary immunodeficiencies (i.e., conditions affecting IgG and/or T cell responses) 2. Thymus disorder 3. Symptomatic HIV-infection or CD4+ T-lymphocyte values < 200 per mm3 (see previous section ) 4. Malignant neoplasm being treated with chemotherapy 5. Recent (< 2 years) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 6. Drugs with known immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory properties (e.g., high-dose systemic inhibitors, IL-1 blocking agent, or other monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cells) 7. Current or recent radiation therapies that target immune cells * Dose of either 2 mg/kg of body weight or a total 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for persons who weigh >10 kg when administered for 2 weeks is considered sufficiently immunosuppressive to contraindicate the use of live -attenuated vaccines. Corticosteroids are not a contraindication when administration is under any of the following circumstances: short -Page 139Version: 19 March 2013 Page 29 of 43 term (i.e., < 2 weeks); a low -to-mode rate dose (<20 mg of prednisone or its equivalent per day); long -term, alternate -day treatment with short -acting preparations; maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); or administered topically (skin or eyes), inhaled, or by intra -articular, bu rsal, or tendon injection. Recommendations: [ Maintain current wording from 2003 position paper but further clarify possible immunocompromising conditions ] Contraindications against yellow fever vaccination include... severe immunodeficiency. Conditions and treatments that would be considered severely immunocompromising include: certain primary immunodeficiencies, thymus disorder, symptomatic HIV-infection T-lymphocyte values < 200 per mm3, malignant neoplasm treated with chemotherapy, recent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, drugs with known immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory properties (e.g., high-dose IL-1 blocking agent, or other monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cells), and current or recent radiation therapies targeting immune cells.

Based on the available albeit limited data, yellow fever vaccine is believed to represents minimal risk to a pregnant woman and her fetus. ! Immune response to yellow fever vaccine may be suboptimal for pregnant women and may depend on the timing of vaccination during pregnan cy. !There are no specific data on the yellow fever disease risk for pregnant women and their fetuses. However, from available surveillance and outbreak data, pregnant women do not appear to be at risk for more severe yellow fever disease. The use of yellow fever vaccine during pregnancy has not been studied in a large prospective trial. Limited data are available from several small studies where pregnant women were either inadvertently vaccinated or given the vaccine in outbreak settings. Since the last position paper, two studies have been published regarding yellow fever vaccine and pregnant women [1, 2]. In the first study, 304 infants born to women who were vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine early in their pregnancies were examined for malformations [1]. There was no increased risk of major malformations found. However, there was an increased risk for minor malformations (e.g., pigmented nevi) but the authors suggested that the finding could have resulted from assessment bias. The second study involved the same mother-child cohort and it did not find an increased risk of fetal death (7.4/1,000 in vaccinated women versus 18.5/1,000 unvaccinated women in the general population) among 441 women inadvertently vaccinated early in their pregnancy [2]. These findings do not support an earlier study that suggested a potential increased rate of spontaneous abortions among pregnant women who received the vaccine [relative risk of 2.3 (95% confidence intervals 0.7-8.0)] [3]. The second study also examined the rates of yellow fever virus IgG antibodies formed in pregnant women and found that 98% of 433 women vaccinated predominantly in the first trimester developed IgG antibodies [2]. These findings differ from that of a previous study which found only 39% of 101 pregnant women receiving yellow fever vaccine predominantly in their third trimester had evidence of seroconversion to yellow fever virus [4]. These findings suggest that proportion of women vaccinated during pregnancy who develop antibodies against yellow fever is variable and may be related to trimester in which they received vaccine. Recommendations: [ Maintain wording from 2003 position paper ] On theoretical grounds, [yellow fever] vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. However, pregnant women may be vaccinated during epidemics when the risk of yellow fever virus transmission may be very high. References 1. Cavalcanti DP, et al.

Page 141Version: 19 March 2013 Page 31 of 43 Use of yellow fever vaccine in lactating women Key Findings Three infants less than 6 weeks of age developed encephalitis as a result of infection with yellow fever vaccine virus potentially transmitted to them via breastfeeding from their recently-vaccinated mothers. Potential risk of transmission may vary depending on whether mothers are vaccinated for the first time or have been previously vaccinated. !Language below is from the Weekly Epidemiological Record ( No. 30, 2010, 85, 285 -292) that summarized the GACVS Meeting from June 2010 where the use of y ellow fever vaccine and breastfeeding was reviewed [1]. The [GACVS] reviewed recent data suggesting that 3 neonates (aged 10 days, 23 days and 5 weeks) developed encephalitis as a result of infection with yellow fever vaccine virus transmitted to them from their recently-vaccinated mothers. All 3 infants were being breastfed, but the mode of transmission has not been established. All 3 mothers had received the vaccine for the first time during the infant's first month of life. Further research is needed to quantify the potential risk of transmission of yellow fever vaccine virus from mothers to infants, including the possibility of transmission through breast milk. Mass vaccination campaigns being conducted in West Africa provide an opportunity to conduct studies that will clarify these issues. Such studies might test breast milk from vaccinated mothers for the presence of vaccine virus, and test infants for evidence of seroconversion to the vaccine virus. The potential risk of transmission may vary depending on whether mothers are vaccinated for the first time or have been previously vaccinated. In areas where yellow fever is endemic, or during outbreaks, the Committee believes that the benefits of vaccinating nursing mothers are likely to far outweigh the risk of potential transmission of vaccine virus to infants; the Committee also believes that the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the alternatives for infant feeding. Nursing mothers who are considering travel to endemic areas should be counseled regarding the benefits and potential risks of vaccination. Vaccination is recommended if vaccination is indicated for a breastfeeding woman and travel cannot be avoided or postponed. Working Group Discussion and Conclusions The working group reviewed the available literature, which included published case reports for each of the cases reviewed by GACV S [2, 3, 4]. The working group agreed with GACVS' assessment, recommendations, including the call for more study on yellow fever vaccine use among breastfeeding women. Recommendations: [Per GAVCS] In areas where yellow fever is endemic, or during outbreaks, the benefits of vaccinating nursing mothers are likely to far outweigh the risk of potential transmission of vaccine virus to infants. Nursing mothers who are considering travel to endemic areas should be counseled regarding the benefits and potential risks of vaccination. Vaccination is recommended if vaccination is indicated for a breastfeeding woman and travel cannot be avoided or postponed. References 1. World Health Organization.

Page 143Version: 19 March 2013 Page 33 of 43 Co-administration of yellow fever and other vaccines Key Findings Co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and other vaccines typically has no impact on safety. Co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and other vaccines generally elicits a good immune response to yellow fever; notable exception is combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Additional co-administration studies are needed yellow fever vaccine with several vaccines where co-administration data are lacking or incomplete .!Data were reviewed by the working group from both published and unpublished literature regarding the safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccine when co-administered (given on the same day but in different locations and in different syringes) with other vaccines. Yellow fever vaccine co- administration has been studied for at least unique 17 antigens (Table 9). Twenty-eight published articles or abstracts on the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine were identified since 1964, which includes articles on the co-administration with 10 inactivated vaccines and 10 live-attenuated vaccines (see more specific report on web for more details ). There are also several (n=11) available vaccines for which there are no co-administration data available (Table 9). Based on the available data for inactivated vaccines (Table 10), there are no safety concerns with the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and inactivated vaccines. Immunogenicity for most vaccines appears not to be compromised when yellow fever vaccine is co-administered with inactivated vaccines. Potential limitations of the studies include: 1) most studies were conducted several decades ago, using different vaccine preparation than what might be currently available; 2) individual studies often contained low number of subjects; 3) studies do not include all potential targeted populations (e.g., children or adults); and 4) no studies were performed in special populations. Based on the available data for co-administration of yellow fever vaccine with other live- attenuated vaccines (Table 11), there are no safety concerns with co-administration with most vaccines. However, data from two studies on the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and a dengue chimeric vaccine based on the yellow fever vaccine backbone found increased rates of both systemic and local adverse events [1, 2]. Although there w as no increase in serious adverse events noted, there was limited power to detect serious AEFIs. Immunogenicity for most vaccines is also not compromised when yellow fever vaccine is co-administered with other live-attenuated vaccines. The most notable exception was with the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) to children 12-23 months of age [3]. The study found a significant decrease in the seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers obtained against yellow fever, mumps, and rubella when the vaccines were co-administered versus administered 28 days apart; no decreases were noted in the immune response to measles. Another exception was from a study involving persons who received yellow fever vaccine one year before the chimeric tetravalent dengue vaccine based on the yellow fever vaccine backbone [4]. The study found an initial delay in the antibody response to dengue 1 among yellow fever vaccine-primed persons. Potential limitations of the studies on the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and live vaccines are similar to those noted for inactivated vaccines. Working Group Discussion and Conclusions In reviewing available data, the working group found that co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and other vaccines typically have no impact on safety and generally elicit a good immune response to yellow Page 144Version: 19 March 2013 Page 34 of 43 fever vaccine. A notable exception is the co-administration of MMR vaccine and yellow fever vaccine where immune response is decreased to several antigens when they are co-administered versus administered 28 days apart. The working group suggests additional studies are needed on the co- administration of yellow fever vaccine and vaccines that are likely to be given at the same time as yellow fever vaccine and where there are no, limited, or conflicting data. Priority co-administration studies identified by the group include: 1. MMR vaccine - Only study performed showed decrease immune response to several antigen s [3]. MMR will be increasing used in yellow fever endemic countries and based on current timing of measles vaccine, these vaccines will be co-administered. 2. Meningococcal A or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine - Currently there are no or very limited data on the co-administration with yellow fever vaccine. It is expected that yellow fever and meningococcal vaccines will be co-administered in the EPI of several African countries where both diseases are endemic or prone to causing epidemic disease. Note: One study has been conducted but the results are currently pending. 3. Other considerations: Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines are being increasing used in the EPI and final doses in the series for these vaccines may coincide with yellow fever vaccine delivery. Malaria and dengue vaccines are in development but once available are likely to be used in the same populations (endemic and travelers) and may be co- administered wi th yellow fever vaccine. Recommendations: Currently available data suggest that there is minimal impact on the reactogenicity and immunogenicity when yellow fever vaccine is co-administered with other vaccines. One notable exception is the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and MMR vaccine in young children, where immunogenicity appears to be compromised against several antigens. Additional studies are warranted on the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and other vaccines, in particularly MMR and meningococcal A vaccines. References 1. Poo J, et al.

There is a continued need to improve and strengthen yellow fever disease surveillance and improve vaccination coverage. Current yellow fever vaccination strategies are cost-effective and the costs do not vary substantially between the various strategies (e.g., EPI, preventive, or reactive campaigns). Vaccine supply issues need to be considered when determining the optimal vaccination strategies. The WHO-recommended control strategy for yellow fever centers on preventing, detecting and controlling outbreaks [1, 2]. This strategy includes ensuring the quality and sensitivity of the epidemiological surveillance system for yellow fever and delivery of yellow fever vaccine through systematic organized programmes, such as the EPI, or mass prevention and response campaigns. Yellow fever vaccination in routine EPI Immunization against yellow fever through EPI is an effective strategy for disease control [1]. Significant progress had been made since 1998 when WHO and UNICEF recommended introducing yellow fever vaccine into the routine immunization schedule of countries considered to be at risk. By 2008, 23 of the 33 yellow fever endemic countries in the African Region and 9 of the 13 endemic countries in American Region were offering yellow fever vaccine through EPI. Although gap between coverage of yellow fever vaccine and measles vaccine is decreasing, EPI coverage rates have varied by country and in certain countries is <50% [1]. One major limitation to the EPI coverage has been shortages of the vaccine [1, 2]. Preventive mass vaccination campaigns Immunization against yellow fever through EPI requires several years to raise population immunity to a level that is sufficient to prevent outbreaks. To obtain faster and broader population coverage, routine (EPI) immunization may be complemented by preventive mass immunization campaigns. This combined strategy (routine EPI plus preventive campaigns) has proved to be highly effective in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with yellow fever and reducing the risk of outbreaks [1, 2]. A good example of this approach has been in The Gambia that had several large outbreaks of yellow fever disease including one in 1978 when 271 cases and 63 deaths were reported [3]. Estimations from subsequent studies suggested that there were likely more than 8,000 cases and 1,700 deaths in the 1978 outbreak. Following this outbreak a mass campaign vaccination targeting the whole country was conducted with a vaccine coverage > 95%. Starting in 1979, yellow fever vaccine was introduced into the EPI for children > 9 months. In 2009, 96% coverage was reported. Despite ongoing risk that has been documented through unvaccinated travelers to Gambia becoming ill with yellow fever, no autochthonous cases have been reported in the country since 1978. Page 149Version: 19 March 2013 Page 39 of 43 In 2005, the GAVI Alliance invested US$ 58 million to decrease the risk of yellow fever epidemic s in Africa by vaccinating millions of people in 12 African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo) [1]. To date 11 of the original 12 countries as well as Central Africa Republic have undergone preventive mass vaccination campaigns. Nigeria is the only remaining country to have a preventative mass vaccination campaign mostly due to larger than anticipated vaccine needs. The country is currently scheduled to undergo a mass vaccination campaign from 2013-2016. The same preventive mass vaccination campaign strategy has been used as well in the American Region, namely in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. As was seen with The Gambia, there have been no outbreaks reported in areas receiving preventive campaigns. Reactive mass vaccination campaigns Reactive mass vaccination campaigns have been successful in the past years at controlling outbreaks of yellow fever disease in places with inadequate vaccination coverage [1]. There is currently an emergency vaccine stockpile of roughly 6 million doses funded by the GAVI Alliance, which allows for a more effective response to outbreaks. Since 2007, the vaccine stockpile has been used by a number of countries that experienced an outbreak of the disease in areas where the disease has been silent for decades, such as Southern Brazil, Paraguay, Sudan, and Uganda. In each instance, no subsequent cases of the disease were noted among vaccinated persons following the reactive campaigns. However, with the outbreaks in Brazil and Paraguay in 2008, the vaccine stockpile was depleted by February of that year. Although the stockpile was eventually restocked in the following months, this situation stressed the need for countries to: 1) continue to optimize their current vaccine coverage in populations at risk; and 2) develop a national stock of vaccine in areas where significant proportions of their population are outside the endemic area and therefore are unvaccinated (e.g., the Americas). Cost-effectiveness of the various vaccination strategies Following a review of the various vaccination strategies that are available, the working group assessed the cost of each strategy to determine if any of the strategies are more cost-effective or cost-prohibitive. Although older data suggest differential costs between EPI and reactive (outbreak control) vaccination strategies, current available data suggest that cost per dose of yellow fever vaccine is similar for various strategies. Cost was estimated to be approximately US$ 0.67/dose for each strategy but the breakdown of cost (e.g., cold chain, vaccine price) var ied based on strategy. Given these data, it was decided that vaccine utilization strategies should be driven by factors other than cost (e.g., vaccine availability). Recommendations: Control strategy for yellow fever should include sound epidemiologic surveillance and delivery of yellow fever vaccine through a complementary and optimized combination of EPI and mass preventive campaigns. Reactive campaigns should be conducted in response to yellow fever outbreaks if there is inadequate vaccination coverage within the population. References 1. World Health Organization.

Page 151Version: 19 March 2013 Page 41 of 43 Summary Over the last 75 years, yellow fever vaccine has been the most effective means of prevent ing of yellow fever disease. The vaccine has been proven to be highly immunogenic and a single dose provides long- term protection against yellow fever. However, rare but serious side effects have been observed following the administration of this live attenuated viral vaccine. The SAGE Working Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine carefully reviewed and weighed all available data regarding the use of yellow fever vaccine to reach the following conclusions and recommendations: 1. Booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed to maintain immunity as a single dose of yellow fever vaccine appears to confer life-long protective immunity against yellow fever disease. 2. Caution should be used in vaccinating pregnant women, lactating women, and persons >60 years of age against yellow fever if they have not been previously vaccinated. 3. Yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated for severely immunocompromised persons, including persons with AIDS or CD4+ counts < 200 cells/mm3, certain primary immunodeficiencies, thymus disorder, malignant neoplasm being trated with chemotherapy , recent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, drugs with known immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory properties (e.g., high-dose IL-1 blocking agent, or other monoclonal antibodies targeting immune cells), and current or recent radiation therapies targeting immune cells. 4. There is minimal impact on the reactogenicity and immunogenicity when yellow fever vaccine is co-administered with other vaccines. One notable exception is the co-administration of yellow fever vaccine and MMR vaccine. 5. Control strategy for yellow fever should include sound epidemiologic surveillance and delivery of yellow fever vaccine through a combination of EPI, preventive campaigns, and reactive campaigns. In addition to the conclusions and recommendations above, the working group also noted several areas where additional research is warranted to address critical gaps related to the safety and immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccine (Table 12).

Study : An estimated number of 200 -400 HIV infected persons have to be thoroughly investigated for neutralizing/protective antibodies to get statistically valid data.

Research question(s ): Are there higher numbers of serious AEFIs in elderly pe rsons compared to younger persons due to a less competent immune system? Study : This requires continuous notification, analysis and investigation of side effects after YF vaccination. Since the rate of side effects after YF vaccination is in the range of a few cases per thousand vaccinees (1/100 ,000) the limiting factor to obtain statistically robust data is the total number of YF vaccine administered to people >60 years over the years. gSafety of YF vaccine in people with immunocompromising conditions . Research question(s): Are there higher numbers of serious AEFIs in immun ocompromised pe rsons due to a less competent immune system? Study : This Page 153Version: 19 March 2013 Page 43 of 43 requires continuous notification, analysis and investigat ion of side effects after YF vaccination. Since the rate of side effects after YF vaccination in immunocompromised is very low and the range of diseases causing immunosu ppression is very different it is not possible to give an estimated number of cases to be investigated to get statistically valid data. hDuration of protective immunity against YF in children . Research quest ion(s): What is the duration the protection against YF in children receiving YF vaccine in the EPI?

These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immuniza- tion programmes; limited vaccination, as executed mostly in the private sector, may be a valuable supplement to national pro- grammes, but is not emphasized in these policy documents. The position papers sum- marize essential background information on the respective diseases and vaccines and conclude with the current WHO position concerning their use in the global context. The papers have been reviewed by a number of experts within and outside WHO and are designed for use mainly by national public health officials and immunization pro- gramme managers. However, the position papers may also be of interest to interna- tional funding agencies, the vaccine manu- facturing industry, the medical community and the scientific media. Summary and conclusions Y ellow fever (YF) is a mosquito-borne, viral haemorrhagic fever that is endemic in tropi- cal regions of Africa and South America. Aedes aegypti is the vector of YF virus in the urban human-to-human cycle of transmis- sion, whereas in the monkey-to-monkey accidentally mon- key-to-human \u00f1 cycle, several different mos- quito species are involved. About 90% of an estimated 200000 annual cases of YF occur in Africa, where outbreaks are common and where both the urban and the jungle type of transmission operate. In South America, the jungle type of YF predominates, either in in- dividual cases or localized outbreaks.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for the YF vi- rus. A highly efficacious, live attenuated vaccine (17D) has been available for 60 years. One month following immuni- zation, up to 99% of vaccinees show protective levels of neutralizing antibodies, and the immunity is likely to last for decades. Adverse events following YF vaccination are usually minor, although hypersensitivity to vaccine com- ponents may occasionally occur, and very rare cases of viral encephalitis or multiple organ failures have been re- ported. The rare adverse events should not deter the appro- priate use of this highly valuable vaccine. In countries at risk1 for YF, this vaccine is recommended for individual and outbreak prevention as well as outbreak control. The vaccine is also widely used for the protection of travellers to YF-endemic areas. Although there is no current shortage of YF vaccine at the global level, supplies may not be suffi- cient in the event of multiple large outbreaks in urban cen- tres. In countries at risk for YF, the use of the 17D vaccine is the main strategy recommended to rapidly build up YF immunity in the population at large. This prevention strategy has two components. The first component is the inclusion of the 17D vaccine in national childhood im- munization programmes. For convenience and im- proved coverage, the YF vaccine should be administered simultaneously with the measles vaccine at approxi- mately 9\u00f112 months of age, but in a separate syringe and at a different injection site. The second component is the implementation of mass preventive vaccination campaigns to protect susceptible older age groups. In the event of limited resources, as- sessment of the degree of risk can help prioritize areas for mass preventive campaigns. During YF epidemics, outbreak response vaccination campaigns should be carried out with minimum delay in order to limit the spread of the disease. The occur- rence of an epidemic reflects incomplete implementa- tion of prevention strategies, which therefore need to be strengthened following the outbreak. Appropriate measures to control Ae. aegypti should accompany all ef- forts to improve immunization coverage. YF vaccine should be offered to all travellers to and from at-risk areas, unless they belong to the group of individ- uals for whom YF vaccination is contraindicated. There is currently insufficient scientific evidence to support a change in the International health regulations for trav- ellers to endemic areas demanding proof of valid YF vaccination within the preceding ten years. However, in at-risk countries, vaccination resources should be directed to ensuring good primary vaccination coverage rather than to providing booster doses.soit des cas isol\u00c8s ou des flamb\u00c8es locales.

This underscores the impor- tance of having a sensitive, case-based YF surveillance system, supported by laboratory diagnostic facilities. The timely notification and investigation of patients with acute febrile illness and jaundice, with or without haem- orrhagic manifestations, is recommended to increase the sensitivity of surveillance to detect the circulation of YF virus. The early detection of YF virus circulation would prompt timely implementation of outbreak response ac- tivities. Improved surveillance and reporting of any potential adverse event following vaccination is recommended in order to correct any programmatic errors that may be involved and to facilitate improved understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms causing the recently de- scribed serious adverse events. Mechanisms should be found to provide incentives for manufacturers of YF vaccine to sustain or increase their production capacity to ensure rapid delivery of suffi- cient quantities in the event of a major YF outbreak. Background Public health aspects Y ellow fever is a mosquito-borne, viral haemorrhagic fever that is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and South Amer- ica, where it has caused outbreaks at irregular intervals for centuries. Like plague and cholera, YF is subject to control measures outlined in the International health regulations . WHO estimates that a total of 200000 cases of YF occur each year, with about 30000 deaths. More than 90% of YF cases occur in Africa, where over 500 million people live in the YF at-risk zone between 15 north and 15 south of the equator. Furthermore, YF is a significant risk to more than 3m i l l i o n t r a v e l l e r s w h o v i s i t a r e a s a f f e c t e d w i t h Y F e a c h year. Exposure of susceptible persons to bites from infected mosquitoes is the only significant mode of YF transmis- sion. An urban and a jungle (forest, sylvatic) form of YF can be distinguished by differences in their respective trans- mission cycles. Urban YF, which frequently occurs as large outbreaks, is transmitted from infected to susceptible hu- mans by Ae. aegypti, a mosquito species that breeds in the proximity of human habitats. The urban form of transmis- sion is found mainly in Africa. The jungle form of YF is pri- marily an enzootic viral disease of non-human primates, but the various mosquito vectors involved may occasional- ly cause individual cases or small outbreaks of YF among humans in the forested savanna of Africa and in jungle areas of South America. As a result of high vector density, the risk of contracting YF is usually greatest towards the end of the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry sea- son, particularly with the jungle type of transmission. The YF virus is maintained during the dry season by trans- ovarial transmission in mosquitoes. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the incidence of YF has increased dramatically, particularly in Africa. In Nigeria, more than 20000 cases, notably in children, were re- ported in successive outbreaks between 1986 and 1994. donc important de de surveillance de la fi\u00cbvre jaune fond\u00c8 sur les cas, et appuy\u00c8 par des moyens de diagnostic au laboratoi- re.

During outbreak periods in Africa, about 20\u00f140% of the population in affected areas show serological evidence of YF infection. The ratio of infection to clinical illness was found to be 3.8:1 and 7.4:1 respectively, in two separate epi- demics. By 1940, successful vector control had resulted in the disap- pearance of urban YF in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. However, the urban vector ( Ae. aegypti ) was never eliminated in the Guyanas, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. In recent years, rein- festation of Ae. aegypti resulted in the reappearance of ur- ban YF in Bolivia, and, if the vector is re-established widely across South America, there is a significant threat of reap- pearance of urban YF on this continent. Jungle YF has a permanent enzootic cycle throughout the region encom- passing the great river basins, and cases (generally a few hundred per year) have continued to occur annually in Bra- zil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, the Guyanas, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. The reported national incidence figures concerning YF are believed to significantly underes- timate the true incidence. In fact, during outbreak periods, about 1\u00f13% of the population in affected regions of South America shows serological evidence of YF infection. Whereas urban YF can be successfully eliminated by large- scale vaccination and measures to suppress Ae. aegypti , vaccination is the only means of controlling the jungle form. In Africa, Ae. aegypti is widespread in rural villages as well as in towns and cities, and vector control is there- fore inefficient. The pathogen and etiological diagnosis Y ellow fever virus is the prototype of the genus Flavivirus , which comprises about 70 different viruses, most of which are arthropod-borne. The core of the small (35\u00f145 nm), en- veloped virus contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of 10233 nucleotides, which encode three structural and eight non-structural proteins. The viral envelope pro- tein plays an essential role in cell tropism, virulence and immunity, and mutations in the envelope gene may alter these functions. Based on sequence analysis, wild-type YF virus strains have been classified into at least seven geno- types: five in Africa and two in South America. The geno- typic variation is not accompanied by antigenic differences across strains, and the 17D vaccine is therefore effective against all YF virus genotypes in both continents. Y ellow fever virus can be inactivated by lipid solvents (ether, chlo- roform), heating at 56 C for 30 minutes and with ultravio- let light. Following a bite from an infected mosquito, YF virus first replicates at the site of inoculation and spreads from there to the local lymph nodes, liver, spleen, bone marrow and myo- cardium, but very rarely to the brain (i.e. viscerotropic rather than neurotropic affinity). The virus is present in the blood during the incubation period and early stage of illness at levels capable of infecting blood-feeding Ae. aegypti .

A single IgM-positive serum sample obtained in the absence of recent vaccination pro- vides a presumptive YF diagnosis. As cross-reactions occur between the YF virus and other flaviviruses, it is recom- mended that all presumptive positive cases are confirmed by the regional reference laboratory (RRL) within seven days. The RRL has the capacity to confirm the positive re- sult using a battery of methods, including testing with po- tentially cross-reacting antigens, virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In specialized laborato- ries, YF virus may be isolated by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice, intrathoracic inoculation of mosquitoes or inoculation into cell cultures. PCR can also be used to detect the viral genome in clinical samples, including serum taken in the first month after onset of illness. In emergency situations, WHO, through its network of Col- laborating Centres for Arboviruses and Haemorrhagic Fevers, can organize diagnostic assistance to affected countries. Immune response Infection with YF virus is followed by a rapid immune re- sponse. IgM antibodies appear during the first week of ill- ness, peak during the second week and decline over the next 1\u00f12 months. Specific neutralizing antibodies, which are the principal mediators of protection, appear at the end of the first week and persist for many years. Neutralizing antibodies bind to epitopes on the viral envelope protein and interfere with both viral attachment to the host cell membrane and the subsequent internalization of the virus. Some non-structural viral proteins (NS1 and NS2) are as- sociated with the infected host cell membrane, where they are targets for immune elimination. Antibodies to NS1 con- tribute to protective immunity by lysing infected cells, whereas NS3 is a target for cytotoxic T-cells. Wild-type YF virus induces lifelong protection against subsequent infec- tion, but relatively little is known about the cellular re- sponses in humans to infection by this virus. Previous in- fection with certain heterologous flaviviruses, in particular dengue virus, appears to modulate disease expression and severity of YF. Determination of the presence of neutraliz- ing antibodies is the only useful test for immunity to YF. Clinical features Following a bite from an infected mosquito, the incubation period is approximately 3\u00f16 days. This is followed by either subclinical infection, nonspecific illness, transient influen- za-like disease, a febrile illness with jaundice or fatal haem- orrhagic fever. Disease onset is typically abrupt and char- acterized by fever, chills, malaise, headache, lower back pain, generalized nausea and dizziness. Congestion of the conjunctiva and face, as well as relative bradycardia, is commonly found. In patients with a transient, non-icteric infection, the average duration of fever is 3\u00f14 days, fol- lowed by complete recovery. However, in approximately 15% of cases, the disease progresses, with or without a brief (24\u00f148 hours) remission, to a more severe form, with fever, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, renal failure and haem-pour la recherche des IgM par capture utilis\u00c8e par les Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( A t l a n t a , E t a t s - U n i s d \u00ed A m \u00c8 ri q distance mesure o la maladie.

The haemorrhagic manifesta- tions are caused by reduced synthesis of clotting factors as well as by a consumptive coagulopathy. Encephalitis due to YF virus is exceedingly rare. About 20\u00f150% of patients with hepato-renal failure die, in most cases 7\u00f110 days after onset of disease. Case-fatality rates are highest among young children and the elderly. Patients surviving YF may experi- ence prolonged weakness and fatigue, but healing of the liver and kidney injuries is usually complete. The specific pathogenic mechanisms involved in human YF remain poorly defined. Justification for vaccine control Ye l low f e v e r i s a v e r y s e r iou s d i s e a s e a n d a m a j o r p u b l i c health problem for hundreds of millions of people in large parts of tropical Africa and South America. Millions of travellers to at-risk areas are also at risk of YF infection. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of YF cases. No drug treatment is available against YF virus, and mosquito control is impractical in areas of jungle-type transmission. For unvaccinated individuals entering an area of epidemic activity in Africa, the risks of YF illness and death have been estimated at 1:267 and 1:1333, respectively, for a two- week trip, although the risks vary considerably according to the season. The corresponding figures for South Ameri- ca are likely to be 10 times lower. Immunization is the single most effective means of obtain- ing protection against YF. For decades, a safe and effective 17D vaccine has been available and is recommended by WHO for large-scale use by residents of and visitors to at- risk countries. This live attenuated vaccine provides long- lasting protection after one injection and its routine use in children in at-risk countries has a favourable cost\u00f1benefit ratio. Furthermore, a valid certificate of vaccination is required under the International health regulations for en- try into most YF-endemic countries or for travel from en- demic countries to countries at risk for introduction of YF virus. Yellow fever vaccine The yellow fever 17D vaccine is the only commercially available vaccine against YF. The vaccine is based on a wild- type YF virus (the Asibi strain) isolated in Ghana in 1927 and attenuated by serial passages, principally in chicken embryo tissue culture. Numerous mutations in the viral structural and non-structural genes have resulted in the attenuated variant 17D. This attenuated vaccine virus exists in the two sub-strains and 17DD), which share 99.9% sequence has shown between the wild-type Asibi strain and the attenuated sub-strains affecting 20 amino acids. Many of the substitutions involve the envelope protein, and the resulting phenotypic changes make the sub-types non- transmissible by mosquitoes. The and 17DD sub-strains both used in vac- cines and produced in embryonated chicken eggs in sever- al countries. The production procedures include testing of both primary and secondary seed lots for viscerotropic and neurotropic activity.manifestations h\u00c8morragiques.

According to current WHO re- quirements, a YF vaccine that has been held at 37 C for 14 days must (i) maintain the minimal potency of >1000 MLD50 p e r d o s e a n d ( i i ) s h o w a m e a n l o s s o f ti tr e <1 log 10 MLD50. These requirements necessitate the addi- tion stabilizers such as sorbitol and gelatin. The lyophi- lized vaccine requires proper storage under cold-chain conditions, and reconstituted vaccine must be kept on ice and used within six hours. Effectiveness. Protective levels of neutralizing antibodies (log neutralization index of at least 0.7) are found in 90% of vaccinees within 10 days and in 99% within 30 days. In most cases, protection appears to last for 30\u00f135 years or more. Since there is no interference between YF vaccine and other vaccines, YF vaccine may be administered simultaneously, but in different syringes and at different sites, with the fol- lowing vaccines: measles, polio (oral polio vaccine), diph- theria\u00f1tetanus\u00f1pertussis, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, oral chol- era and oral or parenteral typhoid. When not given simul- taneously, live vaccines should be administered at least one month before or one month after the YF vaccination. This recommendation is based on the assumption that interfer- on released in response to the first vaccine may have a tem- porary inhibitory effect on other live virus vaccines. Safety. About 400 million doses of YF vaccine have been administered worldwide with an excellent record of safety, although mild systemic reactions such as headache, myal- gia, malaise and weakness occur during the first few days after vaccination in 10\u00f130% of vaccinees. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, but when they do occur in- fants (encephalitis) and the elderly (multiple-organ failure) seem more susceptible than the YF-vaccinated population at large. Three distinct types of serious adverse reactions to the 17D vaccine have been described: 1.H y p e r s e n s i t i v i t y r e a c t i o n s . The rate of serious allergic reactions, particularly those of anaphylactic reactions, is very low. However, the vaccine is produced in embryonated chicken eggs and is contraindicated for persons with a his- tory of oral egg intolerance or strong allergic reactions to egg-based products. In persons without egg allergy, sys- temic allergic reactions are known to occur, although very rarely. Sensitivity to gelatin, which is commonly used to stabilize the vaccine, may explain at least some of these cases. 2.Vaccine-associated neurotropic disease . Since 1945, a to- tal of at least 26 cases of proven or probable post-vaccinal encephalitis have been reported, of whom 16 were infants aged under 7 months. Of these 26 patients, 24 recovered without sequelae. V accine virus obtained from the brain of one fatal case in a 3-year-old child showed mutations in the envelope gene of the virus and increased neurovirulence in animal studies. It is unknown whether the other cases were caused by similar mutations of the vaccine strains. The other fatality was in an HIV-infected adult patient who was immunosuppressed.Le vaccin antiamaril vaccin\u00c8s dans les 10 jours qui suivent la et chez 99% des vaccin\u00c8s dans les 30 jours de ans, voire n\u00edy embryonn\u00c8 Maladie postvaccinale neurotrope.

Un cas fatal le VIH.Page v iscerot ropic disease During 1996\u00f1 2001, 7 cases of YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (including 6 deaths) occurred in Australia (1 case), Brazil (2 cases) and the United States (4 cases). Subsequently, 11 additional suspected or probable cases (including 2 deaths) have been reported from different countries. During 1996\u00f12001, approximately 150 million doses of the vaccine were administered worldwide, of which 54 million doses were given in Brazil, where 2 cases of vaccine-associ- ated viscerotropic disease were identified. Careful investi- gation of the first 7 cases reported suggested that an atypi- cal host response, rather than genomic instability of the attenuated vaccine virus, caused the serious reactions. The risk of YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease appears to be limited to the first immunization against YF. The fre- quency of such reactions remains uncertain, although esti- mates based on Brazilian experience (including routine childhood immunization) indicate a risk in the order of 1p e r 1 0 m i l l i o n d o s e s . C o m p a r a t i v e r i s k e s t i m a t e s f r o m the United States (mainly protection of adult travellers) are 1 per 200 000\u00f1300 000 doses and 1 per 40 000\u00f150 000 doses for vaccinees above 60 years of age. Indications for YF vaccine All persons aged 9 months or older and living in YF at-risk areas should receive YF vaccine. Highest priority should be given to those persons most likely to be exposed, such as forestry and agricultural workers, and to those living in vil- lages or towns with a history of previous outbreaks. Immi- grants to such regions from non-endemic areas should also be vaccinated against YF. During YF outbreaks, mass im- munization should be instituted at the earliest possible stage and according to locally defined priorities. Travellers should be vaccinated at least 10 days before arrival in the at risk area. Contraindications to YF vaccination The vaccine is contraindicated in children aged under 6m o n t h s a n d i s n o t r e c o m m e n d e d f o r t h o s e a g e d 6 \u00f1 8 months, except during epidemics when the risk of YF virus transmission may be very high. It is also contraindicated for persons with severe allergy to egg and for severely immuno- compromised persons. On theoretical grounds, the 17D vac- cine is not recommended during pregnancy. However, preg- nant women may be vaccinated during epidemics when the risk of YFV transmission may be very high. General WHO position on new vaccines Vaccines for large-scale public health use should: \u00f3meet the quality requirements as defined in the current WHO policy statement on vaccine quality; \u00f3be safe and have a significant impact against the actual disease in all target populations; \u00f3if intended for infants or young children, be easily adapted to the schedules and timing of national child- hood immunization programmes; \u00f3not interfere significantly with the immune response to other vaccines given simultaneously; \u00f3be formulated to meet common technical limitations, e.g. in terms of refrigeration and storage capacity;3.

WHO position on yellow fever vaccine In 1988, the joint United Nations Children\u00eds Fund/WHO Te chnical Group on Immunizat ion in Af r ica recommended that countries at risk for YF incorporate the 17D vaccine into their national immunization programme. Unfortu- nately, in most at-risk African countries, routine YF vacci- nation coverage remains low. In the at-risk countries of South America, YF vaccination has been used for decades, although national coverage and immunization strategies vary considerably. Coverage rates of more than 70% have been achieved in enzootic areas of Brazil and Bolivia whereas coverage of only about 30% has been reached in some other endemic areas. The recent increase in YF incidence both in Africa and in areas of Latin America, where the disease had been under control for centuries, is alarming, particularly since the tools to prevent YF outbreaks are well known, safe and of documented effectiveness. When promoting increased use of YF vaccine in at risk areas, the outstanding safety and effectiveness profile, the long duration of protection and the cost-effectiveness of the 17D vaccine should continue to be emphasized. However, recent reports of severe, but very rare, vaccine-associated adverse events highlight the importance of careful post-licensure surveillance, even for well established vaccines. Enhanced surveillance of such events and careful molecular analyses of the 17D strains isolated from potential new cases as well as from the actual vaccine batches should contribute to the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. In countries at risk of YF, YF vaccine is recommended for use in all children aged at least 9\u00f112 months of age. In addi- tion, preventive vaccination of older children and adults is recommended in at risk areas. V accination for YF is also recommended for travellers aged above 9 months who plan to visit areas at risk for YF. Contraindications against YF vaccination include age less than 6 months, severe hy- persensitivity to egg antigens and severe immunodeficien- cy. Whereas it is relatively easy to avoid immunization of the first two categories, the principal contraindications against immunization during pregnancy and in severe im- munodeficiency cause significant practical problems. For- tunately, the few published cases of congenital infection caused by 17D have not been associated with fetal abnor- malities. Similarly, no adverse events occurred in a small study of HIV-infected children with low CD4+ counts who received the vaccine. These observations are important considering the likelihood that many pregnant women and HIV-positive individuals, including children, will be immu- nized inadvertently during large-scale immunization ac- tivities in at-risk countries. For international travellers, where laboratory and other re- sources are available, YF vaccination may be offered to asymptomatic HIV-infected persons with CD4+ counts above 200 cells/mm3 who require vaccination for unavoid- able travel. Individual expert assessments are required be- fore YF vaccination may be offered to persons taking high- dose corticosteroids or antineoplastic drugs.

Une \u00c8valuation par un sp\u00c8cialiste s\u00edimpose RECORD , NO. 40, 3 OCTOBER 2003tests should be performed to ensure that protective levels of neutralizing antibodies have been achieved, as primary vaccination failure is common in immunodeficient indi- viduals. According to the International health regulations and the WHO International certificate of vaccination , a booster- dose of YF vaccine is required every 10 years. However, in most cases, the duration of protection following the first dose of YF vaccine seems to be at least 30\u00f135 years and pos- sibly lifelong. For this reason, it has been proposed to limit vaccination against YF to a single dose. In order to clarify this matter, WHO organized a consultation with a group of YF experts in March 2003. This group reviewed relevant lit- erature and available data and concluded that, at present, the evidence for protective immunity beyond 10 years was insufficient to justify a change in the current YF vaccina- tion policy for international travellers. However, in at-risk countries, vaccination resources should be directed to en- suring good primary vaccination coverage rather than to providing booster doses. For the purposes of international travel, only YF vaccinations performed at nationally au- thorized YF vaccination sites and using WHO pre-qualified YF vaccines may be entered into the International Certifi- cate of V accination. Each year, 9 million travellers from areas not at risk travel to YF at-risk countries in Africa and South America, and at least 3 million of these persons may visit regions where YF transmission is ongoing. Estimates from the United States indicate that only 10\u00f130% of such travellers have been vaccinated against YF. On the other hand, the number of imported cases to non-endemic re- gions is remarkably low, probably indicating that the per- centage of vaccinated persons is considerably higher among those visiting the most YF-affected areas. Given the very rare, but potentially severe, adverse effects, YF vaccine for travellers should be administered on strict indications only, particularly in the elderly. Restriction of YF vaccina- tion to authorized centres is likely to promote the appropri- ate use of YF vaccine. A serious international shortage of the vaccine was demon- strated in connection with the YF outbreak in Guinea in 2000. Concerned international organizations have agreed to build up an emergency stockpile of YF vaccine that should be re- tained for outbreak response in Africa and South America. A stockpile of 6 million doses is now reserved for this purpose. Mechanisms should be found to provide incentives for man- ufacturers of YF vaccine to sustain or increase their produc- tion capacity to ensure rapid delivery of sufficient quantities in the event of a major YF outbreak. Stockpiling of vaccine for emergency use is necessary but does not solve the underlying problem. To avoid devastating outbreaks of YF in the future, YF vaccine must be fully intro- duced into well functioning childhood vaccination pro- grammes. In addition, childhood vaccination should be combined with pre-emptive YF vaccination campaigns in at- risk areas, and in urban areas control efforts directed against Ae. aegypti should be increased. In areas of predominantly jungle-type transmission, YF vaccination of persons belong- ing to the high-risk groups is strongly recommended. In most countries, YF occurs in remote regions where hu- man and technical resources are limited. For this reason, annual reports on the incidence of YF greatly underesti-tico\u00d4des ou des antitumoraux.

WHO recognizes the urgent need for improved surveillance of YF in at-risk countries. In terms of clinical presentation, however, individual cases of YF may not be differentiated easily from other haemor- rhagic fevers or from diseases such as malaria, influenza and typhoid fever, all of which occur in countries endemic for YF. There is therefore an urgent need for rapid laborato- ry confirmation of diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. WHO recommends extended use of the filter-paper meth- od for blood collection because it improves safety of the procedure and simplifies both collection and transporta- tion of the samples. Dried blood on filter-paper allows test- ing for PCR products as well as for YF virus-specific IgM. de moyens permettant de confirmer rapidement au laboratoire le diagnostic chez des cas suspects cliniques.

Each year, meningitis sweeps across sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks sometimes involving 100 000 people or more. Vaccination is the only effective public health weapon to combat these outbreaks. Two years ago, however, those battling the disease suffered an enormous setback with the emergence of the W135 strain, for which no afford- able vaccine existed. The response was the development by GlaxoSmithKline, in record time, of a new vaccine specifi- cally for these outbreaks. It is being made available to WHO at reduced cost, to allow the building of an emergency response stockpile for African countries. Funds are now urgently needed for production of the new vaccine before the next wave of meningitis begins. Production constraints mean that funds to purchase 6 million doses must be found within days. This is an urgent public health situation \u00f1 one that forces quick action. If the appeal is successful, enormous suffer- ing can be prevented, lives saved, and hope given to tens of thousands of people who live in the direct path of this dis- ease. Every year, the disease ravages people living in Africa\u00eda \u00ecmeningitis belt\u00ee \u00f1 a swathe stretching from Ethiopia to Senegal and with a population of 350 million.

If only hazard ratios are available for a study, we use these instead. If only 2\u00d72 data (rather than person-years) ar e available we will estimate risk ratios. We will assume that these approximate to rate ratios provided that overall mortality risk is low. For case-control studies we will derive odds ratios: we will assume that these approximate to rate ratios in the general population. Where possible, we will compare published estimates with those directly calculated from raw data. Where data are available for two or more time periods we will plot RRs and 95% CIs over time. Where studies are considered substantively si milar enough for meta-analysis to be appropriate, both fixed- and random-effects analyses will be carried out. Heterogeneity (differences between the true vaccine effects in the different studies) will be quantified by estimating the between-study variance 2. Factors that may bias estimates from case-control studies will be examined by displaying the results in forest plots stratified by these factors and their effects will be estimated in meta-regression analyses. These factors include whether a match ed design has been ignored in the analysis (giving \"crude\" estimates from studies that have a ma tched design), and whether the controls were sampled from the same population as the cases. As sensitivity analyses we will report analyses restricted to studies assessed as at low, and low or unclear, risk of bias if this is feasible 4.Assessment of the strength of conclusions We will use the GRADE approach, as modified by WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), to assess the evidence in support of va rious hypothesized associations between various vaccines and (i) survival/all-cause mortality/deaths from infections other than those conditions that the vaccine is designed to prevent and/or; (ii) on all- cause mortality/deaths by all causes/survival in children less than five years of age in all settings.

For example, in countries where the burden of severe Hib disease lies in young infants it is more appropriate to provide three doses of Hib vaccine early in life. The first dose should be given at 6 weeks of age or soon after and the interval between primary doses should be at least 4 weeks. However, in settings where the greatest disease morbidity and mortality occur later, in the presence of herd immunity or, where a resurgence of Hib cases is seen after the introduction of Hib vaccine, it might be advantageous to use a schedule where the third dose is given as a booster e.g. at 11 months of age or during the second year of life. Programmatic considerations are also likely to influence the choice of Hib vaccine schedule, as most Hib vaccines are administered as combined vaccines, which mean that the scheduling of the other co-administered vaccines must also be taken in to account when choosing a Hib vaccine schedule. SUMMARY Selecting the optimal schedule for Hib containing vaccines is a complex process. It requires understanding of the efficacy and effectiveness of various schedules from clinical trials and observational studies. Choice of vaccine schedule depends on the age-distribution of Hib disease and the potential to achieve high and timely coverage of each dose. The choice of schedule should also take into account programmatic considerations including but not limited to: (i) vaccine presentation in use (especially since many countries are using Hib vaccines in combination forms, often as pentavalent with DTwP and HepB), (ii) potential to administer all recommended doses on time and achieve high coverage and, (iii) contact opportunities for provision of other health interventions and other vaccines. In addition, the experience to date in various countries has demonstrated that the interplay between carriage rates in the pre-vaccine era, reduction of carriage and potential for natural boosting after vaccine introduction, herd immunity and the force of infection, and immunological memory are also key factors to determine the potential impact on disease and immunological outcomes of various immunization schedules. Moreover, Hib vaccine effectiveness may be reduced as a result combining it with certain vaccines. Hib conjugate vaccines have been in use for over 20 years with remarkable success. Hib vaccine has been recommended for universal introduction by WHO since 2006. The current WHO recommendation for Hib includes a three doses primary schedule with no booster (3p+0) and states that immunization should start as early as possible after the age of 6 weeks and that in countries where the vaccine is being introduced, consideration should be given to offering a one-time dose to all eligible children aged 12-24 months. Page 2406 Countries are currently using Hib vaccines in routine immunization programmes as part of a combination product (often as pentavalent presentation e.g. Hib-DTwP-HepB). The Hib containing immunization schedules (as reported in the JRF, data as 31st December 2011) can be summarized as follows. 8.8% countries out of 194 reporting countries have not introduced Hib vaccine in the routine immunization programme, 56.2% countries (mostly non-industrialized countries representing 76.9% of the global birth cohort of ~135 million infants) use 3 primary doses without booster schedule(3p+0); 28% of countries (most of them industrialized countries) use 3 primary doses plus a booster (3p+1) and, 5.7% of countries (most of them industrialized countries representing 1.4% of the global birth cohort) use 2 primary doses plus a booster (2p+1). There are 41 countries using a combination that includes acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine, 36 of them with a schedule that includes a booster dose in the second year of life (6 as 2p+1 and 30 as 3p+1), the majority of which are from industrialized countries, (see further information on page 18). However in practice the actual age at vaccination may vary from recommended ages1 . NUMBER OF PRIMARY DOSES Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two primary doses? Conclusion Data suggest that at least three doses of Hib vaccine are required to achieve high effectiveness. (See further information on pages 18-28). Summary statement From the studies identified, data available do not clearly favour a 3p+0 or 2p+0 schedule in terms of disease outcomes or immunogenicity for various Hib vaccine types [except for PRP-OMP]. The observed marginal increase in efficacy and effectiveness was considerably greater between the first and second dose, than between second and third dose, when assessed as part of the primary series. The data found did not show significant differences by type of Hib vaccine conjugate (except PRP-OMP conjugate as reported efficacy and effectiveness with one or two doses was reported as > 90%) or for combination vaccines using wP or aP. Data available from RCTs suggest that a booster dose after a 2p primary series results in high levels of proportion above a set threshold (i.e. > 1.0 ug/ml)). If a two primary doses schedule is selected, evidence suggests that efficacy and effectiveness over time will be high. There is some evidence that DTaPHib vaccines may be less effective and less immunogenic that DTwPHib vaccines. Quality of evidence We are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. We were unable to identify data from RCTs or observational studies reporting direct comparison between 2 and 3 primary doses for disease outcomes for any of the conjugates, and using different vaccine combination types such as aP containing vaccines. In terms of immunological outcomes, seven RCTs provided immunological data to compare two doses versus three primary doses. There was also information from observational studies. Page 2417 Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two primary doses? Caution Estimates of vaccine efficacy from different trials in terms of immunogenicity cannot be compared directly as evidence of equivalence or superiority of one particular schedule and there were too few trials for a network metanalysis which would allow such a comparison. It is important to note that most of the evidence on effect on disease outcomes is drawn from observational studies and few RCTs comparing schedule versus no vaccination. The observational studies took place when the vaccine was in routine use and other children in the community may have received 3 or more doses. There is no experience from any country using a 2p+0 schedule. NEED FOR A BOOSTER DOSE Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two or three primary doses with a booster? Conclusion In some countries, administering a booster dose during the child's second year of life has been deemed necessary to sustain overall disease control in population and direct protection of toddlers. However, the need for booster doses in non-industrialized countries requires further evaluation. (See further information on pages 30-35). Summary statement Available data suggest that after 5 years of vaccine introduction using a 3p+0 schedule a significant reduction in meningitis in young children was observed in a number of developing countries. A recent evaluation from four South American countries reported that Hib meningitis rates were similar 6-10 years post introduction in countries with and without boosters. There is similar data from a dozen of non-industrialized countries that have used a 3p+0 schedule for at least 6 years. However, the UK had a different experience: after the introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (2, 3, 4 months) in 1992 with PRPT-conjugate alongside a catch-up campaign for toddlers 12-48 years of age (with HbOC conjugate vaccine), the UK had an initial decline in cases, but started observing an increase in Hib over a decade after an initial decline in cases. As a result of this, a Hib vaccination booster campaign using (PRP-T conjugate) was conducted between May and September 2003, offering one dose of vaccine to all children who were aged between 6 months and 4 years on 1 April 2003 and to those children who reached 6 months of age during the campaign. A routine booster dose in the vaccine schedule was introduced in 2006. Following these interventions cases declined again. Data from industrialized countries suggest that immunogenicity may be lower with PRPT conjugate and aP containing vaccine and this could have an impact on duration of protection. Emerging reports on some resurgence of Hib cases in older children in The Gambia (3p + 0) highlight the need for further evaluation of duration of protection and of the role of a booster dose in non-industrialized country settings [e.g. 10 years after introduction of Hib vaccine in combination with whole cell pertussis vaccine]. If boosters are deemed necessary (i.e. as Page 2428 Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two or three primary doses with a booster? part of a 2p+1 or 3p+1 schedule), an alternative to routine booster at 11 months or later may be to implement catch-up campaigns targeting toddlers. The UK experience suggests that they have resulted in important reductions of overall carriage Quality of evidence We are moderately confident on the estimate of the effect. 3primary doses vs 2p+1 low quality of evidence (GRADE table 6) Assessment of the need for booster doses is challenging because (a) there are no data directly comparing clinical effectiveness between similar primary schedules with and without booster No data are currently available from developing country settings using aP containing combination vaccines without a booster dose. Caution The situations in which a booster dose should be used remain unclear, and it would depend on various factors including local epidemiology, co-administered vaccines, and the potential for natural boosting as well as other factors. INTERVAL BETWEEN DOSES Does using Hib conjugate vaccine schedule with a longer interval between primary doses (e.g. 8 weeks or more) have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than a schedule with a shorter interval (i.e. 4 weeks) between doses? Conclusion Limited data available showed no consistent or clinically relevant differences between shorter (e.g. 4 weeks) and longer (e.g. > 8 weeks) intervals between primary doses of Hib vaccines. (See further information on page 55-57). Summary statement In most reported schedules, 3 primary doses were separated by either one month (e.g. 6, 10, 14 weeks and 2, 3, 4 months) or two months (e.g. 2, 4, 6 months) whereas 2-dose schedules essentially included 8-weeks intervals. Available data on proportion achieving a set threshold (i.e. > 0.15mcg/ml and >1.0 mcg/ml) show no significant difference between short interval [e.g. 4 weeks] vs. longer interval [e.g. > 8 weeks] in the primary series on immunogenicity outcome for different types of Hib conjugates. There was no clear difference in effectiveness against Hib meningitis, invasive Hib disease or radiologically confirmed pneumonia between observational studies using different dosing intervals or different Hib conjugates. Two months intervals between doses in the primary schedule were not shown to be consistently more immunogenic than one month interval in the observational studies. From long term impact studies both a 4 week and 8 week interval have been used in a number of countries with good sustained long term impact. Quality of evidence We are moderately confident on the estimate of the effect. There were no RCTs or observational studies that compared various intervals and, types of vaccine conjugate and that reported effect on various disease outcomes. Caution Not enough evidence on schedules using 2p+1 at short intervals (e.g. 4 weeks) Page 2439 DURATION OF PROTECTION Does using 2 or 3 primary doses plus a booster of Hib conjugate vaccine has a greater effect on duration of protection than using three primary doses without a booster? Conclusion Although there is some evidence for decrease over time in the proportion above a set threshold (i.e. >0.15mcg/ml and >1.0 mcg/ml) there is limited evidence for this decline being associated with an increase in disease. (See further information on page 37-39). Summary statement The rationale for the 3p+0 schedule is predicated on the induction of sufficient primary antibody responses after three doses in infancy to reduce carriage and thus confer indirect protection through the early childhood years when susceptibility is greatest. In the UK over a decade after Hib vaccine introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (at 3, 4 and 5 months, using PRP-T conjugate) and at the same time a catch up campaign with single dose of Hib (HbOC conjugate) given to those aged 13 months to 4 years, vaccine failures were observed primarily in children age 1-4 years who completed the primary vaccination series, despite the induction of immune memory. An increased in disease in previously non immunized children over 15 years of age was also seen, confirming the resurgence of Hib circulation. Enhanced national surveillance in England and Wales observed an increase in the number of reported invasive Hib disease cases in all age groups - peaking at 120 cases in children aged <5 years in 2002. The reasons for this increase included a decline in indirect protection offered by catch-up campaign conducted when the vaccine was introduced in 1992, a greater than expected decline in vaccine effectiveness among children who were only vaccinated in infancy and a temporary change in the Hib vaccine combination offered to young infants. During 2000-2001, a shortage of combined vaccines containing whole cell pertussis meant that less than half the infants received DTP-Hib combination vaccines containing acellular pertussis . This vaccine was known to have reduced Hib immunogenicity, but this was not felt to be clinically significant Quality of evidence We are uncertain about the estimate of the effect Although there is some evidence for decrease over time in proportion above a set threshold there is limited evidence to date for this decline being associated with increase in disease, except in the UK Caution As mentioned above, available data from developing countries on long-term duration of protection requires further evaluation. This is a complex issue. With high sustained vaccine coverage with a highly effective vaccine and a low force of infection, carriage may be reduced to a low level which results in less opportunity for boosting antibody levels by exposure but also a very low risk of disease. If VE in children drops then this might allow Hib to re-emerge. In countries, such as those in the developing world, with lower coverage and a higher force of infection, carriage of Hib may be still likely to be sufficiently common to result in continued boosting and maintenance of antibody levels and thus longer duration of direct protection in an individual but no indirect protection. Page 24410 Hib combination vaccines: The above statements are based on evidence related to all the currently available Hib conjugate vaccines and to both combination and monovalent vaccines. There are limited data comparing the effect on Hib disease between vaccination schedules that include acellular vs. whole cell vaccine combinations. There is some evidence of lower immunogenicity (and limited data on lower clinical effectiveness outside the UK) when Hib vaccines are combined with acellular pertussis as compared to whole cell pertussis combinations. (See further information on page 55). Sources of evidence Although the systematic reviews used to inform this summary assessed several schedules with different numbers of primary doses and boosters, the summary below focus on information from studies that used 3p+0, 2p+1 and 3p+1. Full details of analyses and studies descriptions are available in each individual systematic review report. Hib conjugate vaccines of the following types were eligible for inclusion in this summary: PRP-HbOC (diphtheria CRM 197 protein conjugate), PRP-OMP meningitides conjugate) and PRP-T (tetanus toxoid conjugate).

It is estimated that in 2008 globally there were 203,000 (uncertainty range: 139,000 - 287,000) child deaths due to Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) among those under 5 years, of which 199,000 (uncertainty range: 136,000 - 281,000) occurred among HIV-negative children. It is also estimated that there were 541,000 (uncertainty range: 376,000- 594,000) global child deaths due to pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) infections among those under 5 years, of which 476,000 (uncertainty range: 333,000 - 529,000) occurred among HIV-negative children. Hib and pneumococcal global and regional mortality estimates by syndrome and HIV infection status are provided in Annex I. An update of the year 2000 pneumococcal and Hib case estimates has not been done for year 2008; Hib and pneumococcal case fatality ratios combining year 2008 deaths and year 2000 cases should not be done as there are important methodologic and key input differences in the year 2000 and year 2008 models. Based on the World Health Organization estimates of 8.8 million deaths among children under 5 years of age globally in the year 2008, (of which 5.2 million occurred in the non-neonatal period), Hib is estimated to cause 2% of all cause-child mortality under five and 4% of non-neonatal mortality while pneumococcus is estimated to cause 5% of all cause-child mortality under five and 9% of non-neonatal mortality. The year 2000 and 2008 Hib and pneumococcal mortality values are shown in Annex II. Although part of the reduction in number of deaths from Hib can be attributed to the introduction of Hib vaccine into the national immunization schedule of 68 countries between 2000 and 2008, the change in values should not be interpreted as a time-series or used as the values to infer the impact of Hib vaccine. Although the Hib mortality differences do include the effect of vaccine introduction, differences in the mortality estimates between the two time periods are deeply impacted by significant changes in the value of model input parameters (e.g. population size, child mortality, pneumonia mortality). Specifically the all-cause pneumonia death estimates by WHO declined from 1.8 million in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2008. This change is attributable to changes in estimation methods and model input values. The year 2008 Hib and pneumococcal mortality estimates, like the year 2000 estimates, do not incorporate any impact from PCV, which was not yet in use in the developing world by 2008. Epidemiology of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis in the pre-vaccine era 7 Aim: To seek existing data on age at invasive Hib disease and Hib meningitis, with age groups small enough for assessment of the population impact of vaccination according to different schedules. Age at Hib disease i) Re-examine an earlier literature review of the burden of Hib disease covering the period 1980-2005 (Watt et al 2009), and conduct a literature review for the period 2005-12; ii) identify papers with relevant data on age at Hib and/or authors' contact details; iii) seek authors' cooperation in supplying age distributions or raw data; iv) tabulate %s aged < 6m and < 12m if available; v) for finely stratified datasets, fit gamma distributions to Page 24713 summarize results from each population and deal with reporting anomalies; vi) fit regression models for each gamma parameter with independent variables such as GDP (World Bank); and vii) use these models to estimate age distributions in countries without data. A case of invasive Hib disease was defined as a child <5 years of age with H. influenzae type b isolated from a normally sterile site (i.e., blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or pleural fluid, etc.). A case of Hib meningitis was defined as a child <5 years of age with laboratory-confirmation by culture or identification (i.e. by Gram stain or antigen detection methods) of Hib in the CSF, pleural fluid or from the blood, in a child with a clinical syndrome consistent with bacterial meningitis (WHO, 2003). Age at vaccination: i) Obtain data from recent DHS and MICS surveys; ii) impute missing data and carry out survival analyses to estimate age-specific coverage; iii) fit lognormal curves to the age-coverage curves; iv) fit regression models for each lognormal parameter, with independent variables including GNI & skilled birth attendants (World Bank), the difference between coverage of DPT1 and DPT3, and WHO-CHOICE subregion (WHO); v) use these models to estimate timeliness in countries without surveys. Results age at Hib disease. The earlier literature review included 209 studies, of which 97 had relevant data on Hib and 35 had author contact details. The new review produced 1492 studies, 28 with relevant Hib data and 11 with author contact details. A further 14 investigators were identified as having unpublished data. Attempts were made to contact 60 authors/investigators, and 7 (12%) sent more detailed data. We found 16 published studies, and 6 unpublished datasets, with age bands <=3m, and 17 of these included more than 100 cases aged < 60m. In 67 studies there were data from studies with n > 30 on the percentages of all cases aged < 60m who were also aged < 6m and < 12m. Results from these are shown in Table 2.

In general, three-dose primary series is given at the same time as the primary series of DTP. The first dose may be given to infants as young as 6 weeks of age, and the second and third doses may be given at 4-8-week intervals along with DTP. For children aged 12-24 months who have not received their primary series of immunizations, a single dose of the vaccine is sufficient. When Hib vaccine is introduced into a country, the implementation of catch-up vaccination of children aged 12-24 months will likely result in a more rapid decline of disease incidence. The vaccine is not generally offered to children aged >24 months owing to the limited burden of Hib disease among them. In most developed countries, a booster dose is recommended at 12-18 months of age; in developing countries, the need for and timing of booster has not yet been defined. Although immunization against Hib disease is not routinely recommended for individuals aged >24 months, older children and adults who are at an increased risk for invasive Hib infection should be vaccinated where resources are available. Such high-risk individuals include those with HIV infection or immunoglobulin deficiency, recipients of stem cell transplants, patients undergoing chemotherapy for malignant neoplasms and those with asplenia (for example, due to sickle-cell disease or splenectomy). Although vaccines are generally less immunogenic in immunocompromised individuals, people who have not previously been vaccinated and who have one of the aforementioned conditions or similar immunodeficiency should be given at least 1 dose of a conjugate Hib vaccine. (...). Evidence suggests that an immunization series started with one type of conjugate Hib vaccine may be completed using another formulation of conjugate Hib vaccine. Hib vaccine has not been associated with any serious adverse effects. \" Table 3. Recommended Routine Immunizations for Children (http://www.who.int/immunization/policy/Immunization_routine_table2.pdf) 1 Position paper reference: Weekly Epid. Record (2006, 81: 210-220) Immunization should start as early as possible after the age of 6 weeks. The 3-dose primary series is given at the same time as the DTP primary series often in combination vaccines. The vaccine is not generally offered to children aged >24 months owing to the limited burden of Hib disease among children older than that age. Delayed series - if a child 12-24 months of age has not received their primary vaccination series, a single dose of the vaccine is sufficient. Booster dose may be administered to children aged between 12-18 months although there is no WHO recommendation on this yet.

Delayed/ interrupted schedule. Page 25016 Progress with the introduction of Hib vaccines globally and vaccines and schedules in use In 1997, 31 countries had introduced or partially introduced Hib containing vaccines. Mainly in the region of the Americas and Europe; South Africa, Australia and New Zealand also introduced the vaccine by that year. 31 of them are high-income countries and 18 middle-income countries. By March 2013, 184 (95%) of the countries introduced Hib containing vaccines, 3 countries are planning introduction in 2013 and 4 countries are planning introduction in 2014 (Figure 2). Data is not available or there are no introduction plans from 3 countries. Note that on a global level only 74% of all infants are receiving Hib vaccine. Countries are currently using Hib vaccines in routine immunization programmes as part of a combination product (often as pentavalent vaccine presentation) using one of 3 different schedules: 56.2% of countries (mostly developing countries) use 3 primary doses (3p+0), 28% of countries (most of them industrialized countries) use 3 primary doses plus a booster (3p+1), 5.7% of countries (most of them industrialized countries) use 2 primary doses plus a booster (2p+1). There are 41 countries using a combination that includes acellular pertussis vaccine, all with a schedule that includes a booster dose in the second year of life, the majority of which are from the European Region. Page 25117 Table 4. Summary of Hib containing vaccine delivery as reported in the JRF, data as at 31st December 2011 Notes: 1. The list of countries that have introduced Hib includes the ones that have introduced in some parts of the country, which are Belarus, India and the Philippines. This explains the large birth cohort for SEAR that is for the entire country for India 2. The 17 countries not having introduced Hib are: China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Republic of Korea (the), Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the), Maldives, Myanmar, Nigeria, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Timor-Leste, South Sudan. Since then, the following countries introduced (but did not yet report to WHO their JRF with the schedule): Haiti, Iraq, DPRK, Maldives, Myanmar; Nigeria (in some parts of the country) and Timor-Leste. 3.

Conclusion Data suggest that at least three doses of Hib vaccine are required to achieve high effectiveness. Summary statement From the studies identified, data available do not clearly favour a 3p+0 or 2p+0 schedule in terms of disease outcomes or immunogenicity for various Hib vaccine types [except for PRP-OMP]. The observed marginal increase in efficacy and effectiveness was considerably greater between the first and second dose, than between second and third dose, when assessed as part of the primary series. The data found did not show significant differences by type of Hib vaccine conjugate (except PRP-OMP conjugate as reported efficacy and effectiveness with one or two doses was reported as > 90%) or for combination vaccines using wP or aP. Data available from RCTs suggest that a booster dose after a 2p primary series results in high levels of proportion above a set threshold (i.e. > 1.0 ug/ml)). If a two primary doses schedule is selected, evidence suggests that efficacy and effectiveness over time will be high. There is some evidence that DTaPHib vaccines may be less effective and less immunogenic that DTwPHib vaccines. Quality of evidence We are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. We were unable to identify data from RCTs or observational studies reporting direct comparison between 2 and 3 primary doses for disease outcomes for any of the conjugates, and using different vaccine combination types such as aP containing vaccines. In terms of immunological outcomes, seven RCTs provided immunological data to compare two doses versus three primary doses. There was also information from observational studies. Caution Estimates of vaccine efficacy from different trials in terms of immunogenicity cannot be compared directly as evidence of equivalence or superiority of one particular schedule and there were too few trials for a network metanalysis which would allow such a comparison. It is important to note that most of the evidence on effect on disease outcomes is drawn from observational studies and few RCTs comparing schedule versus no vaccination. The observational studies took place when the vaccine was in routine use and other children in the community may have received 3 or more doses. There is no experience from any country using a 2p+0 schedule. Page 25319 Effect of 3p+0 and 2p+0 schedules on selected disease outcomes Table 5. Summary of studies reporting on Hib vaccine efficacy (PRPT-conjugate) and effectiveness on Hib disease: studies comparing 3p+0 or 2+0 schedule versus no vaccination We found no data from RCTs or observational studies that directly compare 3p+0 vs. 2p+0 schedules. PRP-T vaccines INVASIVE HIB DISEASE HIB RADIOLOGICALLY DEFINED PNEUMONIA RCTs- two RCTs (Gambia -Mulholland 199719 and Chile - Lagos 200822 and Germany-Kalies 200423). All used combined Hib vaccines including wP vaccine with the exception of the German studies that used aP. RCTs- no RCTs Observational studies - two RCTs (Gambia-Mulholland 199719, Chile-Lagos 199620, reported one RCT (Indonesia - Gesner 200529) reported on clinical pneumonia. Observational studies - two studies (Colombia-de la Hoz 200430 and Bangladesh-Baqui 200728) after 3p+0. All used combined Hib vaccines including wP vaccine except for Colombia which used monovalent Hib vaccine. The Gambia -Mulholland 199719 64.8, 100). A case control study that compared 2p+0 vs. 3p+0 (The Gambia-Adegbola 200521) reported no statistically significant difference between both schedules. Cohort studies (Chile-Lagos 199620, 2Germany-Kalies 200822 and Germany-Kalies 200423) as follows: 90.4 (95% CI 70.6-96.8) (Germany 200822), In the observational studies, VE against Hib meningitis after two or more doses ranged from 65% (95% CI-190 to 100%)28 to 99% (95% CI 92-100%)24. Excluding the estimate of 65%, the lowest reported effectiveness against Hib meningitis after 2 or 3 doses was 87% (95% CI 14-100%)25. Meta-analysis (Jackson C et al 2012)4 using community controls produced estimates of VE against Hib meningitis of 55% 1, 2 In the RCTs, the reported PP VE against radiologically defined pneumonia was 22.4% (95%CI -1.9, 38.6) for randomized trial and 23% (95%CI1, 40) in the cluster-randomized trial (Chile-Lagos 1996 20). ITT VE estimates were similar to PP estimates. In the RCT that reported ITT VE against clinical pneumonia was 4% (95%CI 0.7,7.1) In an observational study in Colombia 30 2 Page 25420 PRP-T vaccines INVASIVE HIB DISEASE HIB MENINGITIS RADIOLOGICALLY DEFINED 91.7 (95% CI 200423) for 3p+0. Acellular pertussis was used in the two German studies, all studies used combination vaccines. VE for 1-2 doses ranged from 68.4 (95% CI 19-87.6) in to 89.6% (95% CI 67-96.7) in Germany 200423. Based on the screening method, in England & Wales during 1993-2003, when the intended schedule was 3p+0 (at 2, 3, 4 months) and PRPT was used, VE against invasive Hib disease for full primary vaccination or a single catch-up dose at age 13 months was estimated to be 57% (95% CI 42 to 67%), or 72% in a sensitivity analysis which assumed that vaccination coverage in the population was 2% than reported (UK - Ramsay 200331). VE against invasive Hib disease was only 49% (95% CI 32 to 64%) when vaccinees were defined only as children who received their 3 primary doses. VE overall (full primary vaccination plus catch up) and VE restricted to full primary vaccinees only were both higher within two years of scheduled vaccination (66%, 95% CI 51-76%) than after two years (37% 95% CI 3-62%). VE was estimated to be higher in children vaccinated at and 3 doses, respectively. The estimates using hospital controls were similar: 53% 65-99%). There was no or very limited heterogeneity between studies using community controls; in studies using hospital controls, the one-dose estimates were moderately heterogeneous (I2 = 35.8%). For Hib meningitis, one Danish study (published in 2004 and using data from 1991-1999), which used various schedules over the study period and which did not specify what vaccines were used, presented dose specific VE which suggest high VE was achieved after a single dose: VE 1 dose: 97.74% (90.77-99.45%); 2 doses 3p+0 was reported to be 55% (95% CI 7-78%). In Bangladesh 28, VE after 3p+0 were estimated to be 44% (95% CI 16-63%) or 32% (95% CI -2 to 54%) effective against radiologically confirmed pneumonia, based on hospital and community controls, respectively3. 3 These estimates are based on cases of pneumonia diagnosed both by study personnel and by an independent paediatrician who reviewed the radiograph. If the VE estimate is instead based on cases diagnosed by only study personnel or by only the independent paediatrician, then the estimate is lower than that stated above, potentially as low as 16% (95% CI -11 to 37%) based on community controls diagnosis by the independent paediatrician. Page 25521 PRP-T vaccines INVASIVE HIB DISEASE HIB MENINGITIS RADIOLOGICALLY DEFINED PNEUMONIA more than one year of age compared with those vaccinated during infancy (HbOC vaccine was predominantly used in the catch-up campaign in the UK). It is important to note that during the 2000-2002 period approximately half of the conjugate Hib vaccine was in combination with aP vaccine. This later vaccine has reportedly associated with lower Hib immunogenicity. A German screening method study32 reported VE against invasive Hib disease during 1998 and 1999, when the intended schedule was DTaP-Hib or DTaP-IPV-Hib given at 2, 3 and 4 months followed by a booster at 11-15 months. VE estimates were, 95.4% (92.7; 97.2) for two doses and 98.9% (98.3; 99.3) for three doses, compared to 0 doses). Page 25622 Table 6.

The observational studies that compared 3p+0 vs. no vaccination reported vaccine effectiveness above 94% and one study that compared 2p+0 vs. no vaccination reported vaccine effectiveness of 89%. One study (USA-Vadheim 1994) reported not statistically significant difference between 2p+0 and 3p+0. The pooled estimates from meta-analysis (Jackson C et al 20124) of studies that used PRP-T or PRP-HbOC vaccines were 59% (95% CI 30-76%) for one dose and 99% (95% CI 77-100%) for three doses (only two studies which used PRP-T or PRP-HbOC vaccines reported two-dose VE against invasive Hib disease, so meta-analysis was not performed). There was high heterogeneity in the three-dose estimates (I2 = 79.8%) but not in the one-dose estimates (I2 = 0%). Sufficient data for meta-analysis of vaccine effectiveness from cohort studies that used PRP-T or PRP-HbOC were identified only for three doses against invasive Hib disease. The South African study 39 stratified VE estimates by HIV status; No data found The observational study from Brazil 40 reported the effectiveness of two or more doses against radiologically confirmed pneumonia as 31% (95% CI -9 to 57%), based on an intended schedule of 2, 4, 6 months and using HbOC. All of these estimates of effectiveness against radiologically confirmed pneumonia 28 30 40are lower than those of the effectiveness of two or three doses against invasive Hib disease and Hib meningitis. Unfortunately the VE estimates from Indonesia Lombok trial for radiological pneumonia were published without confidence intervals therefore they could not be included in meta-analysis29.

The proportions above a set threshold were lower at the 1.0\u00b5g/ml threshold and at 6m after last dose in the primary schedule. Neither the 2p nor the 3p schedule was consistently favored in analyses. By six months after the last primary dose, there was no statistical evidence of a difference between the schedules at the 1.0g/ml threshold (pooled risk difference -0.02, 95%CI -0.10, 0.06, I2 0%) but it remained high the 0.15g/ml threshold (pooled risk difference 0.02 95%CI -0.10, 0.14, I2 75%). A case-control study performed at the time demonstrated an increased risk of vaccine failure in those who received the DTaP-Hib combination (Ramsay et al., 200331). Despite intensive study and the supposition that Hib carriage must have increased in the period, associated with increased disease, adequately powered studies of Hib carriage in various age groups failed to reveal significant Hib carriage in the United Kingdom population during this period (Heath & McVernon, 200247). Trotter and colleagues (Trotter et al., 200348) studied serum samples obtained from different birth cohorts and showed that Hib antibody titres beyond the first year of life in cohorts immunized after the catch-up campaign did not differ significantly from titres in similarly aged children in the pre-vaccine era. McVernon colleagues (McVernon IgG titres in the serum stored from adults in the United Kingdom, spanning the period 1991 to 2003, and showed that titres in adults declined and remained low following the introduction of Hib conjugate. This was presumably as a result of reduced exposure to Hib due to the reduction in carriage associated with the introduction of conjugate. Low circulating titres in toddlers and adults may thus explain the increase in invasive disease in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2002, which suggests that immune memory alone in a vaccinated child is unable to provide robust protection against invasive Hib disease. A catch-up campaign was undertaken in the United Kingdom in 2003 for all children under the age of five years, and the incidence of invasive Hib disease reduced. A routine Hib booster dose was introduced into the United Kingdom schedule in 200650. Page 26228 Three primary doses (3p) vs. two primary doses (2p) A UK study (Southern 200751) recruited, through immunisation clinics, 388 children aged 6 months to 4 years who had previously received their full primary Hib vaccine series and were given a booster dose in a catch-up campaign. Amongst these children, the GMC before the booster decreased with time since vaccination, and thus age. Despite this, the post-booster GMC increased with age at boosting: 29.87\u00b5g/ml, 68.41\u00b5g/ml and 182.36\u00b5g/ml in each group one month after booster. All but one of the 344 participants who had a blood sample taken one month after the booster had a titre 0.15\u00b5g/ml one at that time, and all but three had a titre 1.0\u00b5g/ml. PRP-OMP vaccines - we did not find RCTs for this vaccine type. An observational study in the USA (Shehab 199152) which used PRP-OMP vaccine did find an increase in GMT after a single dose. The GMT increased from 0.11 to 1.75 g /ml after a single dose administered at the age of 2-3 months. The GMT increased further in all age groups following the second dose, e.g. to 3.5 g /ml in those vaccinated at 2-3 months of age. The fold increases in GMT were 15-31, depending on age group after the first dose and 2-3 after the second. There was little difference between age groups in the percentage of children whose antibody titres reached 1.0 g /ml after the first dose (76%, 75% and 72% of children aged 2-3 months, 4-5 months and 6-11 months at vaccination) or the second (91% of children aged <6 months and 92% of children aged 6-11 months). PRP-HbOC vaccines - two trials examined PRP-HbOC (USA Lieberman 199553 and Chile -Lagos 199841). One trial (Chile -Lagos 199841) examined PRP-HbOCand presented seropositivity data. Point estimates favored the 3p group but the confidence interval crossed the null effect at both two and six months after the last dose and for both thresholds. The trial which reported only GMC (USA Lieberman 199553) examined PRP-HbOCand compared a birth dose plus doses at 2 and 4 months of age to doses at 2 and 4 months of age. Two months after the last dose, the GMC in the 3p group (birth-dose group) 0.29) in 2p group. In an observational study of the immunogenicity of HbOC and PRP-D vaccines carried out in Finland (K\u00e4yhty 198954), 46 children received HbOC at ages 4 and 6 months, and 25 of these received a booster dose at 14 months. Blood samples were taken before each vaccination and one month after the second and third doses, and anti-PRP antibody titres measured. There was no increase in GMT after the first dose of HbOC (0.07g/ml before, 0.09g/ml after); after the second dose, GMT increased to 4.32g/ml and all children had a titre >0.15g/ml. Use of Hib vaccines and observation of their clinical efficacy in practice has questioned the relevance of the >0.15 ug/ml and >1.0 ug/ml (ref)concentration as conjugate vaccination (Eskola et al., 199955) although they are still widely used today for licensure purposes. The fact that conjugate vaccines induce memory, suggests that irrespective of the antibody concentrations achieved after vaccination, priming for memory responses may provide protection of longer duration, particularly if ongoing exposure to Hib is able to maintain circulating antibody concentration. Protection against invasive Hib disease in the face of vaccine induced memory but the absence of circulating antibody is not clearly established (Galil et al., 199956) and is illustrated with experience in the United Kingdom. Page 26329 An increase in antibody avidity following primary immunization and boosting has been demonstrated in Hib conjugate immunogenicity trials (Goldblatt, Vaz & Miller, 199857; Anttila et al., 199958). Avidity measurements have thus been proposed as a surrogate marker for the successful generation of immunological memory. The relative importance of memory versus circulating antibody levels for clinical protection by conjugate vaccines is unclear. During the development and evaluation of Hib conjugate vaccines, two thresholds were identified, one that predicted short-term and one that predicted long-term protection respectively (i.e. >0.15 ug/ml and >1.0 ug/ml). Need for a booster dose Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two or three primary doses with a booster? Conclusion In some countries, administering a booster dose during the child's second year of life has been deemed necessary to sustain overall disease control in population and direct protection of toddlers. However, the need for booster doses in non-industrialized countries requires further evaluation. Summary statement Available data suggest that after 5 years of vaccine introduction using a 3p+0 schedule a significant reduction in meningitis in young children was observed in a number of developing countries. A recent evaluation from four South American countries reported that Hib meningitis rates were similar 6-10 years post introduction in countries with and without boosters. There is similar data from a dozen of non-industrialized countries that have used a 3p+0 schedule for at least 6 years. However, the UK had a different experience: after the introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (2, 3, 4 months) in 1992 with PRPT-conjugate alongside a catch-up campaign for toddlers 12-48 years of age (with HbOC conjugate vaccine), the UK had an initial decline in cases, but started observing an increase in Hib over a decade after an initial decline in cases. As a result of this, a Hib vaccination booster campaign using (PRP-T conjugate) was conducted between May and September 2003, offering one dose of vaccine to all children who were aged between 6 months and 4 years on 1 April 2003 and to those children who reached 6 months of age during the campaign. A routine booster dose in the vaccine schedule was introduced in 2006. Following these interventions cases declined again. Data from industrialized countries suggest that immunogenicity may be lower with PRPT conjugate and aP containing vaccine and this could have an impact on duration of protection. Emerging reports on some resurgence of Hib cases in older children in The Gambia (3p + 0) highlight the need for further evaluation of duration of protection and of the role of a booster dose in non-industrialized country settings [e.g. 10 years after introduction of Hib vaccine in combination with whole cell pertussis vaccine]. If boosters are deemed necessary (i.e. as part of a 2p+1 or 3p+1 schedule), an alternative to routine booster at 11 months or later may be to implement catch-up campaigns targeting toddlers. The UK experience suggests that they have resulted in important reductions of overall carriage Quality of evidence We are moderately confident on the estimate of the effect. Assessment of the need for booster doses is challenging because (a) there are no data directly comparing clinical effectiveness Page 26430 Does using 3 primary doses of Hib conjugate vaccine in infancy have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than using two or three primary doses with a booster? between similar primary schedules with and without booster No data are currently available from developing country settings using aP containing combination vaccines without a booster dose. Caution The situations in which a booster dose should be used remain unclear, and it would depend on various factors including local epidemiology, co-administered vaccines, and the potential for natural boosting as well as other factors. Effect of 3p+1 and 2p+1 on selected disease outcomes We did not identify RCTs or observational studies that compared these schedules to a 3p+0 schedule. The conclusions below are based on data from long term impact post vaccine introduction (Watt J et al 20125) that are described in page 38 of the 3p+1 or the 2p+1 regimens. In some countries, administering a booster dose during the child's second year of life has contributed to sustain overall disease control in population and direct protection of toddlers. However, the need for booster doses in non-industrialized countries requires further evaluation. Data from industrialized countries suggest that immunogenicity is lower with an aP containing vaccine and this could have an impact on duration of protection. No data are currently available from developing country settings using aP containing combination vaccines without a booster dose. Available data suggest that after 5 years of vaccine introduction using a 3p+0 schedule a significant reduction in meningitis in young children has been observed in a number of developing countries. A recent evaluation from four South American countries reported that Hib meningitis rates were similar 6-10 years post introduction in countries with and without boosters. However, the UK after the introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (2, 3, 4 months) with the PRPT-conjugate alongside a catch-up campaign for toddlers 12-48 years of age (with HbOC conjugate) experienced an increase in Hib cases several years after an initial decline in cases. Cases again declined after two booster campaigns and the introduction of a routine booster dose to the vaccine schedule. (see pages 31-36). The situations in which a booster dose should be used remain unclear, and might relate to local epidemiology, co-administered vaccines, and the potential for natural boosting as well as other factors. Emerging reports on cases of Hib disease from the Gambia highlight the need for further evaluation of duration of protection and of the role of a booster dose in some settings [e.g. 10 years after introduction of Hib vaccine in combination with whole cell pertussis vaccine]. See pages 39-48. Page 26531 If boosters are deemed necessary, an alternative to routine booster is to implement catch-up campaigns targeting toddlers. The UK experience suggests that they have resulted in important reductions of overall carriage. See page 49. Table 9. Summary of studies reporting on Hib vaccine efficacy and effectiveness on selected disease comparison of 3p+0 versus schedules including a booster dose. Hib invasive disease Hib meningitis Hib pneumonia Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. two or three primary doses and a booster (2p+1 or 3p+1) No data from RCTs or observational studies that directly compared three primary doses with other primary doses and a booster schedules No data from RCTs or observational studies that directly compared three primary doses with other primary doses and a booster schedules No data from RCTs or observational studies that directly compared three primary doses with other primary doses and a booster schedules Two or three primary doses and a booster vs. no vaccination (2p+1 or 3p+1 vs. no vaccination) PRP-T vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-T vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-T vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-OMP vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-OMP vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-OMP vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-HBOC vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-HBOC vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies PRP-HBOC vaccines - No data from RCTs or observational studies Page 26632 Effect of 3p+1 or 2p+1 on selected immunological outcomes A booster dose after a primary series of either two or three doses of Hib conjugate vaccine results in high levels of seropositivity. There was no evidence from trials that the age at which the booster dose is given, or the interval between the primary series and the booster dose affect the level of seropositivity. Proportion above a set threshold levels in children after a booster dose are much higher than in children who received the same primary schedule without a booster. The interval between the last vaccine dose and blood draw is, however, shorter in children receiving the booster than in those who received only the primary schedule, and it is not clear if differences in antibody levels can be interpreted as differences in protection from Hib disease. The UK experienced an increase in Hib cases several years after an initial decline in cases subsequent to the introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (2, 3, 4 months) alongside an early catch-up campaign. Cases again declined after two booster campaigns and the introduction of a routine booster dose to the vaccine schedule. Table 10. Summary of studies reporting on Hib vaccine efficacy on selected immunological outcomes: comparison of 3p+0 versus for schedules including a booster dose. Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. two primary doses and a booster (2p+1) Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. three primary doses and a booster (3p+1) PRP-T vaccines - One trial provided immunological data for this comparison (Sweden-Carlsson 199846) using PRP-T. This trial reported seropositivity and GMC data. At 13 months of age (seven months after the 3p group received their last primary dose and one month after the 2p+1 group received their booster); the 2p+1 schedule resulted in higher proportions above a set threshold than the 3p schedule at both the 0.15\u00b5g/ml and 1.0\u00b5g/ml thresholds. The difference was -0.79 -0.71) -0.20 (95%CI -0.27, at 0.15g/ml. The proportion above the 0.15\u00b5g/ml threshold PRP-T vaccines - two trials provided immunological data for this comparison (Canada-Scheifele 200559, Europe- Knuf seropositivity data (Europe-Knuf 201160). Both trials reported GMC. At 13 months of age (one month after the 3p+1 group received their booster dose), the 3p+1 schedule resulted in higher proportions above a set threshold than the 3p schedule at both the 1.0\u00b5g/ml (risk difference 0.59, 95%CI 0.67) and difference 0.22). Page 26733 Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. two primary doses and a booster (2p+1) Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. three primary doses and a booster (3p+1) remained high at around 6 months after a 3p schedule. This proportion was lower at the 1.0\u00b5g/ml threshold. Additionally, six trials included in this review reported data for an individual trial arm receiving a 3p schedule or individuals remained above the 0.15\u00b5g/ml threshold 6 months after a 3p schedule. The proportion was lower at the 1.0\u00b5g/ml threshold but there was variability between trials. One trial reported only GMC (Canada-Scheifele 200559). At 16 months of age a group which received a 3p schedule with a booster dose at 15 months of age achieved a GMC of 29.2g/ml (95%CI 24.58, 36.43) and a group which had received a 3p schedule with no booster dose by 16 months of age achieved a GMC of 0.32g/ml (95%CI 0.25, 0.41). A UK study (Southern 200751) recruited, through immunisation clinics, 388 children aged 6 months to 4 years who had previously received their full primary Hib vaccine series and were given a booster dose in a catch-up campaign. Amongst these children, the GMC before the booster decreased with time since vaccination, and thus age. Despite this, the post-booster GMC increased with age at boosting: 29.87\u00b5g/ml, 68.41\u00b5g/ml and 182.36\u00b5g/ml in each group one month after booster. All but one of the 344 participants who had a blood sample taken one month after the booster had a titre 0.15\u00b5g/ml one at that time, and all but three had a titre 1.0\u00b5g/ml. PRP-OMP vaccines - We did not find RCTs for this vaccine type. A study, carried out in Alaska Native infants (Bulkow 1993), compared three different Hib conjugate vaccines and also found that geometric mean antibody titres were increased after one dose of PRP-OMP intended to be given at the age of 2 months, and increased further after a second dose intended to be given at 4 months. However, vaccination with HbOC or PRP-T required 3 doses (intended to be given at 2, 4 and 6 months) for a substantial rise in GMT, although the results are influenced by the timing of sample collection (samples were taken 2 months after doses 1 and 2, but 1 month after dose 3.) PRP-OMP vaccines - We did not find RCTs for this vaccine type. Page 26834 Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. two primary doses and a booster (2p+1) Three primary doses (3p+0) vs. three primary doses and a booster (3p+1) PRP-HbOC vaccines - We did not find RCTs for this vaccine type. In the Finnish study (K\u00e4yhty 198954) of 25 children given a primary series of HbOC at 4 and 6 months with a booster at 14 months, the GMT immediately prior to the booster dose was 1.12\u00b5g/ml. This increased to 58.3\u00b5g/ml following the booster. PRP-HbOC vaccines - We did not find RCTs for this vaccine type. Impact of Hib vaccines on carriage The mechanism of protection against carriage is not well understood, but high levels of serum anti-PRP IgG (>5 lg/mL) have been associated with protection against carriage, and the presence of anti-PRP antibodies in saliva is associated with high serum levels of anti-PRP antibody. Vaccination strategies that elicit higher post-vaccination anti-PRP levels may therefore be more effective in reducing Hib carriage and transmission. The reduction in Hib carriage directly determines herd immunity and significantly contributes to the protection of the vaccinated population. However, in a non-vaccinated population, Hib encountered in the course of childhood may contribute to immunity by repeated stimulation of antibody production thereby inducing both individual and herd immunity. Thus in a vaccinated population reduction in carriage results in a decrease in natural boosting and, in the absence of further doses of vaccine, serum antibody concentrations wane. Initial efficacy trials, involving only a subset of the population may have underestimated this effect (reference Goldblatt et al 200761). There were no eligible carriage outcome data from trials that compared different schedules of Hib vaccination. One trial presented data about carriage for 1p1= vs. no doses (Gambia-Mulholland 199719). Carriage was measured in the second and third years of the trial (different children each year) and in urban and rural locations. Heterogeneity between settings and years of the trial was low (I2 0%). The point estimate showed slightly less carriage with one dose of PRP-T compared to no doses but confidence intervals were very wide (pooled odds ratio 0.82, 95%CI 0.14, 4.71). This trial also reported about carriage for 2p+0 vs. no doses although it was randomized trial of a 3p schedule (Gambia-Mulholland 199719). Carriage was measured in the second and third years of the trial (different children each year) and in urban and rural locations. Heterogeneity between settings and years of the trial was moderate (I2 47%). The point estimate showed less carriage with two doses of PRP-T compared to no doses but confidence intervals were very wide (pooled odds ratio 0.52, 95%CI 0.08, 3.37). Again, this trial, comparing three primary doses of PRP-T at 2, 3 and 4 months with no Hib doses, reported carriage data (Gambia-Mulholland Page 26935 199719). Carriage was measured in the second and third years of the trial (different children each year) and in urban and rural locations. Heterogeneity between settings and years of the trial was low (I2 0%). The combined odds ratio comparing three doses of PRP-T to no doses was 0.36 (95%CI 0.25, 0.53, I2 0%). A case-control study conducted in three rural Alaskan villages found no evidence of an effect of Hib vaccine on carriage of Hib. Based on 16 carriers and 32 controls (matched on age and village), 62% of carriers and 62% of controls had received at least one dose of a Hib conjugate vaccine, implying 13% effectiveness of at least one dose against carriage but with an extremely wide confidence interval (95% CI -1000 to 93%). Restricting the analysis to children born after conjugate vaccine became available in this setting, there was no evidence of an effect on carriage of either PRP-OMP, HbOC or the time since last vaccination (<82 or 82 days, the median value). However, the number of carriers and controls was small and the confidence intervals wide62. A study in Turkey compared the prevalence of carriage in fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated children (the intended vaccination schedule was 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, using PRP-T) 53. 19/57 (33%) fully vaccinated children carried Hib in the oropharynx, compared to none of 17 partially vaccinated and 46/85 (54%) unvaccinated children. After adjusting for previous respiratory infection, having a sibling aged <5 years, breastfeeding and recent antibiotic use, the OR comparing unvaccinated to fully vaccinated children was 3.76 (95% CI 1.61 - 8.80). This implies a VE of 73% (95% CI 38-89%). This estimate is not adjusted for age, time since vaccination or socioeconomic status (although the authors state that there was no association between carriage and parental job)84 A study in Native American children63 reported the prevalence of carriage in relation to age and the number of doses of PRP-OMP received (intended to be given in 3 doses at ages 2, 4 and 12-15 months). Overall, 65% of carriers and 80% of non-carriers had received at least one dose before the swab was taken; 13% of carriers and 36% of non-carriers had received the intended number of doses for their age. The point estimate of the prevalence of carriage was highest in unvaccinated children in all age groups (Figure 6) but confidence intervals were wide (the number of carriers was <10 in each group) and there was no apparent dose-response relationship. After adjusting for age and the presence of a respiratory infection at the time of swabbing, the OR comparing children who were not age-appropriately vaccinated to those who were, was 2.66 (95% CI 1.00 - 7.05, p = 0.05) 54. This implies a VE against carriage of 62% (95% CI 0 - 86%). Page 27036 Figure 6: Prevalence of oropharyngeal carriage of Hib by Native American children, by age and number of previous doses of PRP-OMP. Error bars show 95% exact binomial CIs (or one-sided 97.5% CIs if the point estimate is zero) 63 In the UK, carriage was assessed in 143 children (recruited via computerised immunisation records) who had received three doses of Hib-containing vaccine in relation to the number of doses given as DTaP-Hib 51. Only three carriers were identified: one had received no doses of DTaP-Hib and two had received three doses. These small numbers do not allow a comparison of the effects of DTaP-Hib versus other vaccines on effectiveness against carriage. The studies included here which report the prevalence of carriage according to the number of vaccine doses received did not suggest an obvious dose-response relationship, but the number of carriers was usually small. However, these studies of Hib vaccination indicate some reduction in carriage, perhaps with an effectiveness of 60-70%. They are thus consistent with population data showing dramatic impacts of Hib vaccines against invasive disease in several populations. Page 27137 Duration of protection and considerations for immunization schedule selection Does using 2 or 3 primary doses plus a booster of Hib conjugate vaccine has a greater effect on duration of protection than using three primary doses without a booster? Conclusion Although there is some evidence for decrease over time in the proportion above a set threshold (i.e. >0.15mcg/ml and >1.0 mcg/ml) there is limited evidence for this decline being associated with an increase in disease. Summary statement The rationale for the 3p+0 schedule is predicated on the induction of sufficient primary antibody responses after three doses in infancy to reduce carriage and thus confer indirect protection through the early childhood years when susceptibility is greatest. In the UK over a decade after Hib vaccine introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (at 3, 4 and 5 months, using PRP-T conjugate) and at the same time a catch up campaign with single dose of Hib (HbOC conjugate) given to those aged 13 months to 4 years, vaccine failures were observed primarily in children age 1-4 years who completed the primary vaccination series, despite the induction of immune memory. An increased in disease in previously non immunized children over 15 years of age was also seen, confirming the resurgence of Hib circulation. Enhanced national surveillance in England and Wales observed an increase in the number of reported invasive Hib disease cases in all age groups - peaking at 120 cases in children aged <5 years in 2002. The reasons for this increase included a decline in indirect protection offered by catch-up campaign conducted when the vaccine was introduced in 1992, a greater than expected decline in vaccine effectiveness among children who were only vaccinated in infancy and a temporary change in the Hib vaccine combination offered to young infants. During 2000-2001, a shortage of combined vaccines containing whole cell pertussis meant that less than half the infants received DTP-Hib combination vaccines containing acellular pertussis . This vaccine was known to have reduced Hib immunogenicity, but this was not felt to be clinically significant Quality of evidence We are uncertain about the estimate of the effect Although there is some evidence for decrease over time in proportion above a set threshold there is limited evidence to date for this decline being associated with increase in disease, except in the UK Caution As mentioned above, available data from developing countries on long-term duration of protection requires further evaluation. This is a complex issue. With high sustained vaccine coverage with a highly effective vaccine and a low force of infection, carriage may be reduced to a low level which results in less opportunity for boosting antibody levels by exposure but also a very low risk of disease. If VE in children drops then this might allow Hib to re-emerge. In countries, such as those in the developing world, with lower coverage and a higher force of infection, carriage of Hib may be still likely to be sufficiently common to result in continued boosting and maintenance of antibody levels and thus longer duration of direct protection in an individual but no indirect protection. Page 27238 The rationale for the 3p+0 schedule is predicated on the induction of sufficient primary antibody responses after three doses in infancy to reduce carriage and thus confer indirect protection through the early childhood years when susceptibility is greatest. In the UK over a decade after Hib vaccine introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (at 3, 4 and 5 months, using PRP-T conjugate) and at the same time a catch up campaign with single dose of Hib (HbOC conjugate) given to those aged 13 months to 4 years, vaccine failures were observed primarily in children age 1-4 years who completed the primary vaccination series, despite the induction of immune memory. An increased in disease in previously non immunized children over 15 years of age was also seen, confirming the resurgence of Hib circulation. Enhanced national surveillance in England and Wales observed an increase in the number of reported invasive Hib disease cases in all age groups - peaking at 120 cases in children aged <5 years in 2002. The reasons for this increase included a decline in indirect protection offered by catch-up campaign conducted when the vaccine was introduced in 1992, a greater than expected decline in vaccine effectiveness among children who were only vaccinated in infancy and a temporary change in the Hib vaccine combination offered to young infants. During 2000-2001, a shortage of combined vaccines containing whole cell pertussis meant that less than half the infants received DTP-Hib combination vaccines containing acellular pertussis . This vaccine was known to have reduced Hib immunogenicity, but this was not felt to be clinically significant. Although there is some evidence for decrease over time in proportion above a set threshold (i.e. >0.15mcg/ml and >1.0 mcg/ml) there is limited evidence for this decline being associated with increase in disease, except in the UK. As mentioned above, available data from developing countries on duration of protection requires further evaluation. In the UK, over a decade after Hib vaccine introduction of a 3p+0 schedule (at 3, 4 and 5 months, mostly PRP-T conjugate), vaccine failures were occurring primarily in children aged one to four years who completed the primary vaccination series, but an increase in disease in those over 15 years of age was also seen. In addition to the information on proportion above the set thresholds over time described above, we reviewed data on vaccine failures from observational studies. Furthermore, we discussed recent information from vaccine failures in the UK, South Africa and The Gambia in the section on experience with Hib vaccines use and long term impact of various schedules. Two case-control studies presented data on children who developed Hib disease despite having been vaccinated24 36. In one of these studies, from Uganda24, three children developed Hib meningitis after receiving two doses of Hib vaccine with DTwP, all within one year of the second dose. Three children who had received three doses developed Hib meningitis within three years of the third dose. These six vaccine failures ranged in age from 17 to 157 weeks (Lee et al 200824). Page 27339 The second case-control study to include data on vaccine failures was from the USA and reported 27 vaccine failures in total (Vadheim 199436). Eighteen children were diagnosed with invasive Hib disease after a single vaccine dose, all within one year of vaccination. Six and three children developed disease after two and three doses, respectively, again within one year of the most recent dose. Three cohort studies included data on the time since the last vaccine dose in vaccine failures two of these studies (from South Africa and Germany), Hib vaccine was given with DTwP 34, 36, 37. All children in the German study, and all but one of the South African children not infected with HIV, developed disease within a year of receipt of their final dose of Hib vaccine (irrespective of the total number of doses). In the South African study, children infected with HIV appeared to develop disease later than vaccine failures who were not HIV-infected, e.g. four HIV-infected children developed disease 2 years after receiving two or three doses (Madhi 200564 and Madhi 200239). Amongst cohort studies in which Hib vaccine was given with DTaP22 23, almost all vaccine failures occurred within two years of receipt of the last dose of vaccine. Vaccine failures also occurred in two children who received two doses of monovalent Hib vaccine (12-23 months after the second dose) and one child who received two doses of DT-Hib. Experience with Hib vaccine use and impact of various schedules Observational studies in countries using Hib conjugate vaccine for at least five years suggest that various Hib vaccination schedules in use worldwide have been very effective (Watt J et al 20125). There are limited data available to assess the interaction of different epidemiologic settings and vaccination schedule. Because instances of diminished vaccine effectiveness are few, there are limited data available to assess the relationships between different epidemiologic settings, vaccination coverage levels, vaccination schedules and vaccine effectiveness. To illustrate the impact of various vaccination schedules in different parts of the world we summarized the experience from a selected number of countries in each region. Page 27440 Table 11. Summary of evidence on long term impact of Hib vaccines with schedules with and without a booster dose Schedules without a booster dose Schedules including a booster dose Non - industrialized countries Most developing countries have implemented a primary series only (3p+0), with good effectiveness. In Kenya Hib disease incidence has declined since vaccine introduction. Reports indicate that Anti-PRP Geometric Mean Concentration has declined and yet nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of H. influenzae has remained low. In The Gambia preliminary reports of an increase in number of cases of Hib disease have led local investigators to ponder whether Hib disease protection may be waning 15 years after introduction. In South Africa following vaccine introduction, there was a substantial decrease in the number of Hib cases, however, from 2003-2009 investigation on vaccine failures suggested a possible resurgence of Hib disease. South Africa introduced a booster dose in 2010. Data from four Latin American countries found no difference in vaccine impact in the two countries which use a booster dose (Argentina and Uruguay) compared with the two which do not (Chile and Colombia). Industrialized countries Limited data are available on the use of a schedule without a booster dose (3p+0) in industrialized countries. The United Kingdom, experienced a resurgence of Hib disease approximately 6 years after vaccine introduction using a 3p + 0 schedule. While multiple factors likely contributed to this resurgence, addition of a booster dose resulted in decreased disease incidence. With a few exceptions, industrialized countries have implemented schedules that include a primary series and a booster dose (3p+1). In general, schedules used in industrialized countries have been highly effective. Data from Finland and other Scandinavian countries suggest that two vaccine doses in early infancy, followed by a late booster (2p+1), are efficacious in protecting children from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection, and will practically eliminate Hib meningitis. In Italy, Hib vaccination using a 2p+1 schedule has been in use since 1999. Overall, pediatric H. influenzae disease has become less common whereas there has been a slight increase of disease in the elderly. Among industrialized countries in Watt et al 2012, all but Italy (2p+1) and the Czech Republic (3p+0) reported higher disease incidence among children less than one year of age compared with children 1-4 years of age. Page 27541 Watt J and colleagues (20125) reviewed data on invasive Hib disease at least 5 years following vaccine introduction4. They limited the analysis to countries with at least 100,000 live births per year so that disease incidence estimates for young children would be stable. One hundred two countries introduced Hib conjugate vaccine into their routine infant immunization schedule on or before January 1, 2006. Of these, 50 (49%) had at least 100,000 live births in 2010. Data on Hib disease at least 5 years after vaccine introduction were available from 34 (68%) of these 50 countries. By WHO region, data were available from 4 countries in the African region, 18 countries in the Americas, 11 in the European region, and 1 in the Western Pacific region. Data on disease incidence at least 5 years after vaccine introduction was available from 21 countries. Data on case characteristics from sentinel sites was available from an additional 13 countries.

A catch-up campaign was not conducted. Coverage with three doses of vaccine by 12 months of age was estimated to be 87% in 2004 (Ndirtu BMC Pub Health 2006). Culture-based surveillance for invasive Hib disease at Kilifi District Hospital has been conducted from 2000 through present. Antibodies to Polyribosylribitol Phosphate (PRP), were assessed by ELISA on serum samples collected in 2009, from 471 children aged 0 to 15 years residing in the KDHSS. Long-term protective anti-PRP titres (>1mcg/ml) were detected amongst aged <1 year, of children aged 1-5 years and 52.9% (46.4-59.4) of children aged 5-15 years. Anti-PRP Geometric Mean Concentration declined from 3.9mcg/ml (95% CI 1.9-7.8) amongst children aged <1 year to (2.0-3.0) amongst children aged 1-5 years to 1.3mcg/ml (1.1-1.6) amongst children aged 5-15 years (preliminary analyses). (See GMC values and reverse cumulative distribution curves (below.). Analysis of anti-PRP antibodies is ongoing for ~1000 serum samples collected from children in 1998 - 2007. Nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of H. influenzae has been assessed in cross-sectional surveys conducted in the KHDSS in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The prevalence of Hib carriage in children <5 years of age in the KHDSS was 6 (1.7%)/349 in 2004 (Abdullahi PIDJ 2006) and 1(0.2%)/623 in 2009-2012 (preliminary analysis, personal communication A Scott and L Hermit65). 5 Summary courtesy of Dr L Hammit Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA and Dr A Scott London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK Page 27844 South Africa (3p+0 and then 3p+1)6 South Africa introduced Hib conjugate vaccine in 1999 as a 3 dose primary series without a booster dose. The initial vaccine was a PRP-T combination vaccine with a whole cell pertussis component. In 2009, this vaccine was replaced with a combination vaccine containing an acellular pertussis component and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).(Von Gottberg, 201266) Following vaccine introduction, there was a substantial decrease in the number of Hib cases identified by the national surveillance system (Von Gottberg, 200667) However, from 2003 through 2009, despite high vaccination coverage, detection rates of Hib disease in children <5 years increased from 0.7 per 100,000 population in 2003 to 1.3/100,000 in 2009 (p < 0.001). Among 263 episodes of invasive Hib disease among children with known vaccination status, 135 (51%) were classified as vaccine failures. Of vaccine failures, 55% occurred among case patients 18 months old. HIV status was documented for 90 children with vaccine failure; 53% were not HIV infected. Vaccine failures, which occurred in both HIV-infected and -uninfected children, comprised half of the rise in invasive Hib disease. In November 2010, children in South Africa began receiving a booster dose of HibCV as part of a pentavalent vaccine (Von Gottberg 201266). The introduction of the booster dose was driven by polio prevention since IPV was being used and not a response to change in Hib disease incidence. 6 Summary prepared using information kindly provided by Dr A von Gottberg, Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service, South Africa Page 27945 Figure 10: Number of reported cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) disease in children <5 years (n=1455), by serotype and year, South Africa, 2003-2009.

Sporadic cases were observed thereafter through incidental detection in hospitals but formal surveillance in The Western Region from 2007-2010, extending 14 years after introduction, confirmed a low incidence of invasive disease (Hib meningitis <3 per 100,000 under 5), a low rate of carriage (0.9% in 1 year olds), high community seroprotection (99.3% of 2-5 year olds with protective antibody levels), and high Page 28248 vaccine coverage (92% having 3 doses at 1 yo). These observations were not suggestive that a booster dose was required. In 2011 and 2012 formal clinical and microbiological surveillance in Eastern Gambia associated with PCV introduction (Aug 2009) detected over 20 cases, having detected one in the previous 2 years; this was accompanied by incidentally detected hospital cases in the Western Region where formal surveillance had stopped in 2010. Around half had had 2 or more doses of vaccine and half were under 1 year of age. Local investigators suggest that this resurgence raises the question of the need for a booster dose, and reinforces the need for continuing high quality surveillance of Hib disease Table 13.

Surveys of nasopharyngeal carriage were conducted among children in Argentina and Colombia to compare prevalence of Hib colonization several years after introduction of Hib conjugate vaccines (Garcia S et al 20126). Following Hib vaccine introduction, rates of Hib meningitis declined and were sustained at low levels through the study period in all four countries. Incidence of Hib meningitis during the post-vaccine study period varied from 2.3 to 1.2 cases per 100,000 among children <1 year and 0.5 to 0 cases per 100,000 among 1-4 year olds. Surveillance data from all four countries demonstrated that Hib meningitis cases continued to occur, albeit at low levels, 6-10 years following vaccine introduction. Contrasting Hib meningitis incidence during the post-vaccine period with the prevaccine base-line period, relative rates were similar in countries with and without booster doses. Page 28450 United States (3p+1) In the United States prior to Hib vaccine introduction, the annual incidence of H. influenzae meningitis was approximately 50-60/100,000, 25-35/100,000 and 5/100,000 for children <1 year of age, 1 year of age and 2-4 years of age, respectively.(Adams, 199368) Hib conjugate vaccine was introduced as a single dose at 18 months of age in 1987. Following vaccine introduction, there were declines in the incidence of Hib disease in vaccinated age groups. Incidence also declined in infants who were too young to be vaccinated, reflecting an indirect impact of the vaccine. (Adams, 199368) Infant vaccination was introduced in 1990. In the United States, a number of different vaccines and combinations and schedules have been used. However, since 1990, the basic approach to scheduling has been to use a 3p+1 schedule. Disease incidence has remained low. Of note, there was a resurgence of invasive Hib disease among Alaska Native children reported in 1996 associated with a change in Hib conjugate vaccine. Prior to vaccine introduction, Alaska Native children had among the highest rates of invasive Hib disease reported worldwide. Use of PRP-OMP vaccine, which is more immunogenic after a single dose than other Hib conjugate vaccines, resulted in a large decline in disease incidence. However, disease incidence increased after a switch to PRP-CRM197 vaccine, which is less immunogenic until the third dose of the primary series. The resurgence of Hib disease in Alaska Native children was associated with ongoing circulation of the organism in pre-school and school aged children, despite several years of routine vaccination. (Galil, 199956; Singleton, 200069) Disease incidence declined following reinstitution of a PRP-OMP based schedule. Italy- (2p+1) In Italy, Hib vaccination using a 2p+1 schedule (at 3, 5, and 11 months of age) was introduced in 1999 and coverage by 24 months of age was estimated to be 95.6% in 2009. An \"Active Surveillance of Invasive H. influenzae Disease\" was carried out in a sample of Italian regions during the period 1997-2002 and extended nationally following the rapid decline in Hib incidence. From 2003 to 2006, data on cases of invasive H. influenzae disease were detected through the National Surveillance Network of Bacterial Meningitis but, since January 2007, they have been collected as a part of the National Surveillance of Invasive Bacterial Disease. Both the latter surveillances used a passive reporting system. Ten years after Hib vaccination was introduced, the annual incidence of invasive H. influenzae infection was 0.06/100,000 in 2007, 0.08/100,000 in 2008 and 0.09/100,000 in 2009 in all age groups. A slight increase in disease incidence has been observed in adults 65 years since 2007 (Giufre M et al 2011)70. Page 28551 United Kingdom - (3p+0 the 3p+1)7 Prior to the introduction of routine vaccination, the incidence of invasive Hib disease in children aged <5 years in the UK was estimated to be 21-44/100,000. In October 1992, the UK introduced the Hib conjugate vaccine into the national immunisation programme. A Hib-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Hib-PRP-T) was offered to infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age alongside DTwP. At the same time, a catch-up campaign lasting 12 months took place, where three dose of Hib-PRP-T vaccine were offered to infants and a single dose of Hib CRM197 conjugate vaccine (HbOC) was given to those aged 13 months to 4 years. Unlike many other industrialised countries, a Hib booster in the second year of life was not recommended. Coverage of over 90% was rapidly achieved in infants and coverage in the catch up campaign was above 85% in most cohorts. This Hib vaccination programme led to a rapid decline in the incidence of invasive Hib disease within two years, initially in the age group targeted for vaccination, but soon followed by a reduction in all other age groups through indirect (herd) protection. In 1996, a Hib-OC conjugate vaccine was licensed to be mixed with DTwP but, in 1997, a combination vaccine containing Hib-PRP-T with DTwP was introduced. By 1998, invasive Hib incidence fell to its lowest level: 0.63/100,000 in children aged <5 years. From 1999, however, enhanced national surveillance in England and Wales observed an increase in the number of reported invasive Hib disease cases in all age groups - peaking at 120 cases in children aged <5 years in 2002. The reasons for this increase included a decline in indirect protection offered by catch-up campaign that was offered to children up to 4 years of age when the vaccine was introduced in 1992, a greater than expected decline in vaccine effectiveness among children who were only vaccinated in infancy and a temporary change in the Hib vaccine combination offered to young infants. During 2000-2001, a shortage of combined vaccines containing whole cell pertussis meant that less than half the infants received DTP-Hib combination vaccines containing acellular pertussis (aP). This vaccine was known to have reduced Hib immunogenicity, but this was not felt to be clinically significant. As a result of the increase, a number of control measures were taken. The implicated DTaP vaccine was withdrawn and DTwP vaccines were resumed. In addition, a Hib vaccination booster campaign using PRP-T was conducted between May and September 2003, offering one dose of vaccine to all children who were aged between 6 months and 4 years on 1 April 2003 and to those children who reached 6 months of age during the campaign. In September 2004, the infant combination vaccine was changed to one containing DTaP, inactivated polio and Hib. This vaccine has a different acellular pertussis component to the one previously used and was shown to have a satisfactory immune response against Hib. Together, these measures resulted in a rapid reduction in cases, initially in toddlers, but soon followed by a reduction in the other age groups. 7 Summary courtesy of Drs M Ramsay and S Ladhani, Immunisation, Hepatitis and Blood Safety Department, Health Protection Agency , UK Page 28652 From September 2006 onwards, a routine 12-month Hib booster administered as a Hib-MenC-PRP-T was introduced. After the 2003 booster campaign, however, an increase in Hib cases among 1-3-year-old children was noted (from 13 cases in 2004 to 32 cases in 2006), children too young to be vaccinated in the 2003 booster campaign and too old for the routine 12-month booster in September 2006. This group of approximately 1.5 million children, was subsequently targeted in a separate programme when a dose of Hib was given at pre-school age (3 years 4 months to 5 years of age) between September 2007 and 3 March 2009, Currently, control of Hib in the UK is the best that has ever been achieved. In 2010, there were only 30 invasive Hib disease cases across all age groups, with only 6 cases in children under 5 years. Hib cases in adults were also at their lowest levels since 1998 (n=23). Figure 16. Number of cases of invasive Hib disease in different age-groups diagnosed in England and Wales (1990-2010). Source: Health Protection Agency Centre for Infection Page 28753 Australia (3p+1 and 2p+1) Australia introduced Hib conjugate vaccine in 1993. Currently, an acellular pertussis PRP-T combination vaccine is used with a schedule of 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for non-indigenous children. Indigenous children receive PRP-OMP vaccine at 2, 4, and 12 months of age. Horby et al. reported national surveillance data showing that invasive Hib disease incidence fell sharply following vaccine introduction and remained low (<2/100,000 children less than 5) from mid-1996 through mid-2000.(Horby, 200371) Australia also participated in the EU-IBIS surveillance system from 1999-2006. Between these years, reported Hib disease incidence in children less than 5 years of age remained low, ranging from 0.5-1.6 cases per 100,000. Of note, incidence rates in indigenous populations living in Northern Australia who had very high levels of disease in the pre-vaccine era have fallen considerably, but remain higher than in non-indigenous persons (Menzies, 200872). Effect of age at administration of first dose of Hib vaccine on selected outcomes Limited available evidence suggest that schedules starting earlier (i.e. at 4-6 weeks of age) are comparable to schedules starting later (i.e. > 2 months of age).Trade-offs may exist between initiating vaccination earlier versus later in infancy in settings where Hib disease epidemiology data suggest that a large proportion of cases occur before 8 weeks of age. Another consideration in the choice of the age at first dose is the recognition of delays with the actual age at vaccination. There is no evidence to firmly determine the age limit for initiating vaccination but three years seems appropriate as it is in line with the evidence on the age distribution of Hib disease cases in the pre-vaccine era. Immunization schedules starting later (i.e. > 2 months of age) vs. immunization schedules starting earlier (i.e. at 4-6 weeks of age) There were no RCTs that compared these schedules and reported invasive disease, pneumonia or carriage data. A study which reported only GMC (Gambia- Mulholland 199419) examined PRP-T and compared doses at 2 and 4 months of age to doses at 1 and 3 months of age. GMC was measured 1 month after the last dose of vaccine. The GMC was 0.41g/ml (95%CI 0.28-0.61) in the 2 and 4 month group and 0.26g/ml (95%CI 0.19-0.35) in the 1 and 3 month group. There a few additional studies assessing the immunogenicity of neonatal doses of Hib vaccines. Page 28854 In (PRP-T) was given to 120 neonates at 2 days of age, followed by PRP-T or the Hib PS vaccine at 4 months and a PRP-T booster at 14 months. Their anti-Hib PS concentrations were compared with those in children receiving PRP-T at 2 and 4 months or at 4 months. TS: The geometric mean concentration of anti-Hib PS at the age of 2 days was 0.34 micrograms/mL and at 4 months was 0.12 g/mL. This was significantly more than the concentration in unimmunized infants at this age and 3.5 times more than expected, taking into account the natural decay of transplacentally acquired antibodies. Such a response was not seen in infants with a high (greater than 3.0 micrograms/mL) neonatal antibody concentration. The PRP-T vaccine given at 4 months elicited an antibody response in all infants and Hib PS in 62%, indicating immunologic priming. At 14 months, a higher percentage of the infants who had received PRP-T at 2 days and 4 months than of those who had received PRP-T at 4 months only had anti-Hib PS concentrations greater than 0.15 g/mL. All infants responded well to the booster at 14 months. There was no evidence of immunologic tolerance. A study in Papua New Guinea evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a lyophilized and a liquid form of Hib polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccines (PRP-T) given in diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine (Lehmannmexy D, 200174). As part 1 of the study 209 children were randomized to receive at ages 1, 2 and 3 months either DTP alone or a liquid formulation of DTP/PRP-T or lyophilized PRP-T dissolved in DTP suspension. A further 75 children were given the liquid DTP/PRP-T formulation at ages 2, 3 and 4 months as part 2 of the study. 54 children aged 15-18 months were given a booster of the same preparation of PRP-T/DTP as they had received during Part 1. Blood for antibody assays was collected at enrolment, before (Part 1 only) and one month after the third dose, then just before and 3 weeks after the booster dose. Results. Follow-up to age of 12 months showed that PRP-T was safe with no evidence of impaired response to individual vaccine components when combined with DTP. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of anti-PRP antibody before vaccination (n=64, mean age 41 days), after 2 doses (mean age 99 days) and after 3 doses (mean age 132 days) of the lyophilized formulation were 0.21, 1.48 and 5.04 g/ml, respectively, and 89% having anti-PRP antibody titres 1.0 g/ml after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. Anti-PRP antibody responses to the liquid Hib vaccine formulation were lower (GMT post-dose 3 = 0.48 g/ml) than to the lyophilized formulation, but better responses were elicited from older children (Part 2; GMT post-dose 3 = 0.78 g/ml, with 79% 0.15 g/ml). Both PRP-T preparations elicited excellent booster responses suggesting that children are likely to be protected if exposed to Hib infection. The liquid DTP/PRP-T formulation showed a lower immunogenicity than in earlier studies with this vaccine, which might have been due to exposure to low temperature during shipment or the younger age at immunization. Serum antibody responses to three Hib capsular polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccines (PRP-OMP HbOC and PRP-T) were evaluated in 102 Filipino infants. Vaccination was carried out at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age based on the national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule together with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, hepatitis B and oral poliomyelitis vaccines. Sera were collected at 6 weeks and I month after each vaccination. Anti-Hib polysaccharide antibody concentrations were determined by Farrtype radioimmunoassay (RIA) and Page 28955 enzymeimmunoassay (EIA). Following the first dose, the geometric mean concentrations (, pgml-') for PRP-OMP HbOC and PRP-T were 0.69, 0.27 and 0.38, respectively after two doses, there was a significant response (PcO.05) to PRP-OMP and PRP-T (0.89 and 1.47) but not for HbOC (0.37). Differences in the GMC after the primary series were significant (pair-wise PcO.05): GMC was highest for PRP-T (4.0) followed by HbOC (1.6) and PRP-OMP (1.1). All three Hib vaccines were immunogenic when given in the local EPI schedule in Filipino infants although significant differences in the kinetics and magnitude of antibody responses were noted. The anti-Hib antibody concentrations determined by RIA and EL4 were also compared in order to validate the latter for use in laboratories where it is feasible. There was a good correlation (r' = 76%; P = 0.0001) in the Hib antibody titres obtained by both assays. There is limited evidence from observational studies. Six cohort studies with intended age at initiation ranging from 6 weeks to 2-5 months provided VE estimates. Estimated VE may increase slightly with intended age at initiation. In Denmark, the intended age at initiation of vaccination 3 or 5 months of age, as opposed to 2 months of age in the other cohort studies which reported the intended schedule33 75 . In the Danish study 3-dose vs. 0 dose VE for PRP-T against Hib meningitis was 99.3% (94.87-99.90%)33. In the South African study, in which age at initiation of vaccination was intended at 6 wks., 3- dose vs. 0 dose VE against invasive Hib was estimated to be 83.2 % (60.3-92.9%); there was a high prevalence of HIV infection in the children in this study and effectiveness of 3 doses vs. none was estimated as 96.5% (74.4-99.5%) in children who were not HIV-infected39. The 3-dose (vs. 0 dose) VEs against invasive Hib from the Chilean, English and German studies, which all had intended age at initiation of 2 months, were slightly higher than the overall estimate from the South African study (ranging from 90.4 to 97.6%)20 22 23. From long term impact studies, we found that there is limited variability in first dose timing in currently used schedules. Developing countries recommend the first dose at 6 or 8 weeks. Industrialized countries recommend the first dose mainly at 8 weeks with a few at 12 weeks. Hib continues to cause disease in all countries reviewed, with incidence highest in the first year of life. This suggests ongoing risk in young infants. No clear evidence of the superiority of either schedule. Page 29056 Effect of the interval between doses on selected outcomes Effect of the interval between primary doses of Hib vaccine on selected outcomes Does using Hib conjugate vaccine schedule with a longer interval between primary doses (e.g. 8 weeks or more) have a greater effect on disease or immunological outcomes than a schedule with a shorter interval (i.e. 4 weeks) between doses? Conclusion Limited data available showed no consistent or clinically relevant differences between shorter (e.g. 4 weeks) and longer (e.g. > 8 weeks) intervals between primary doses of Hib vaccines. Summary statement In most reported schedules, 3 primary doses were separated by either one month (e.g. 6, 10, 14 weeks and 2, 3, 4 months) or two months (e.g. 2, 4, 6 months) whereas 2-dose schedules essentially included 8-weeks intervals. Available data on proportion achieving a set threshold (i.e. > 0.15mcg/ml and >1.0 mcg/ml) show no significant difference between short interval [e.g. 4 weeks] vs. longer interval [e.g. > 8 weeks] in the primary series on immunogenicity outcome for different types of Hib conjugates. There was no clear difference in effectiveness against Hib meningitis, invasive Hib disease or radiologically confirmed pneumonia between observational studies using different dosing intervals or different Hib conjugates. Two months intervals between doses in the primary schedule were not shown to be consistently more immunogenic than one month interval in the observational studies. From long term impact studies both a 4 week and 8 week interval have been used in a number of countries with good sustained long term impact. Quality of evidence We are moderately confident on the estimate of the effect. There were no RCTs or observational studies that compared various intervals and, types of vaccine conjugate and that reported effect on various disease outcomes. Caution Not enough evidence on schedules using 2p+1 at short intervals (e.g. 4 weeks) Immunization schedules with short (i.e. 4 weeks) versus longer (> 8 weeks) intervals between primary doses There were no RCTs that compared these schedules and reported invasive disease, pneumonia or carriage data. The trial which compared two-month intervals to one-month intervals using PRP-OMP reported GMC results only and could not be included in seropositivity graphs. This study used alternation for assignment of interventions and was therefore quasi-randomized. The mean age at first vaccination was unintentionally older in the two-month-interval group than in the one-month-interval group (4.1 months and 3.2 months respectively). Age adjusted Page 29157 GMCs one month after the second vaccinations were in (95%CI 1.48-3.64) in the one-month-interval group. The reviewers concluded that it has methodological problems (e.g. randomization was not effective) which should be mentioned noted. In most reported case control studies, doses were separated by either one month (6, 10, 14 weeks and 2, 3, 4 months) or two months (2, 4, 6 months and 2, 4, 12 months). There was no clear difference in effectiveness against Hib meningitis, invasive Hib disease or radiologically confirmed pneumonia between studies using different intended dosing intervals. A study carried out in Colombia30 compared the time between doses of Hib vaccine in pneumonia cases and controls17. The median delay between both doses 1 and 2 and doses 2 and 3 was slightly greater for cases than for controls, but the study did not find evidence against these being chance findings (p = 0.08 and p = 0.18 for doses 1 and 2 and doses 2 and 3, respectively). An interval of >90 days between doses 1 and 2 was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 - 3.5, adjusted for \"factors related to pneumonia. There are limited data from cohort studies to inform the optimal interval between doses. A Chilean20 had a schedule with 2-month intervals: the VE for 3 doses vs. 0 doses, quadrivalent vaccine, was 91.7% (64.8 - 100%). A German 22 23, English and South African64 studies included schedules that have 1-month intervals and report VE for 3 doses vs. 0 doses which ranges from 83.2% and 97.6 %9 50 10 . Since the VE estimate for a 2-month interval is nested within the range of VE estimates for a 1-month schedule, there is no strong evidence from cohort studies for a difference in VE according to dosing interval. From long term impact studies, both 4 week and 8 week intervals have been used in a number of countries with good sustained long term impact. Effect of interval between last primary dose and booster dose on selected disease outcomes We found no evidence of significant differences in effectiveness with various intervals between the primary doses and the booster dose Immunization schedules with long (> 8 weeks) vs. short (i.e. 4 weeks) intervals between primary doses No immunological data from RCTs: Minimal difference seen between the schedules. Schedules with a booster dose given in the second year of life have shown good sustained long term impact. Schedules with the booster dose ranging from 11 months to 18 months of age have all been successful. No clear evidence of the superiority of booster dose timing between 11 months and 18 months of age5. Page 29258 Effect of combination vaccines The available data do not suggested clinically relevant decreases in Hib efficacy or interference with other antigens with the use of combination vaccines compared with monovalent vaccines. There is some evidence of lower immunogenicity against Hib with the use of aP vaccines compared to wP vaccines, though little evidence of interference with other antigens in either combination. The clinical relevance of lower immunogenicity is unclear, as is the necessity of a booster dose with the use of aP containing vaccines. Combination vs. monovalent vaccines A recent COCHRANE meta-analysis8 including data from twenty RCT's (N=5874 children for immunogenicity analysis, N=5232 for reactogenicity analysis) concluded that the overall level of evidence comparing combination and monovalent vaccines was low, and could not conclude that the immune response to combination vaccines was different from or equivalent to monovalent vaccines. No studies presented data on clinical outcomes. Antibody responses to diphtheria, pertussis, polio, and hepatitis B were not significantly different. Antibody response to Hib and tetanus was lower in children receiving combination vaccines. However, when the results were analyzed distinguishing aP and wP combination vaccines, the differences in immunogenicity were seen only in the aP vaccines; wP vaccines had equivalent of better immune responses, although no differences were statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events. A small but statistically significant increase in pain and redness at the injection site was noted for combination vaccines. A review found in the textbook Vaccine (Plotkin, 6th ed.76) concluded that geometric mean titers for Hib/PRP have been seen to be lower in combination vaccines; however, there is no evidence that these differences are clinically meaningful as most (>95%) of children achieve antibody levels >1.0 ug/ml even with combination vaccines and observational and surveillance data do not support the hypothesis of lower effectiveness of combination vaccines. A review of 41 studies77 evaluating proportion of vaccine recipients achieving seroprotection, as opposed to GMT levels, found no consistent differences. 13 studies reported a significantly significant difference in seroprotection for one or more antigens; 8 found decreased seroprotection with combination vaccines while 5 found increased seroprotection with combination vaccines. Page 29359 Acellular vs. whole cell pertussis component A Cochrane meta-analysis8 found significantly lower Hib seroprotection in recipients of aP containing vaccines, but not in wP vaccines. Studies have consistently documented this reduced immune response in terms of GMT following the primary series, however, following a booster dose all combination vaccines are highly immunogenic76. In general, aP vaccines do not show additional interference with other antigens, although the meta-analysis did note a decrease in seroprotection against tetanus with aP. Most developed countries use aP vaccines and have effectively controlled Hib disease. The use of a booster dose in most of these countries may serve to augment lower immunogenicity such that the vaccine remains effective. Hib vaccines and herd immunity Available data suggest a very strong indirect effect with Hib vaccine, even at medium to low levels of coverage. Hib conjugate vaccines also have been shown to reduce carriage in vaccinated children. Widespread use of conjugate vaccines has led to decreases in disease incidence that were greater than rates of vaccination coverage and to decreases in Hib disease in unvaccinated age groups. The impact of herd effect can be seen by the tenfold reduction in Hib disease rates in the United Kingdom in unvaccinated children <1 year of age in 1998 compared with rates in similarly aged children before vaccination began (Heath et al., 2000b78). Another reflection of herd effect is the impact of childhood Hib vaccination on adult Hib disease. A review of adult cases of Hib disease in five English regions between 1990 and 1995 showed a halving of case numbers between the first three-year period and the last two-year period (Sarangi et al., 200079). Ongoing surveillance for Hib disease by Moulton and colleagues (Moulton et al., 200080) demonstrated that immunization of 40% of Navajo Indian infants (USA) between the years 1988 to 1992 resulted in a 75% reduction of Hib disease among infants that were living in the same community. This demonstrates that countries that implement Hib immunization programmes may receive greater benefits at the community level than those hitherto seen due to the direct protection conferred on the individual through vaccination. In Canada after several Hib vaccines were introduced within the last two decades. In Ontario, Canada authors reported that the incidence of invasive Hib disease in children, reflected in the submission of invasive Hib isolates to Ontario's Public Health Laboratory-Toronto, has fallen sharply since the introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine (Adam HJ 201081) . Furthermore, they concluded that herd effects were acting on all age groups in the population; using data to document a reduction in the risk of invasive Hib infection in older (unvaccinated) adults following vaccine introduction. Authors argued that this is a result of a reduced force of infection due to less Hib colonization among children. Page 29460 A systematic literature search for studies which included impact data (pre- and post-introduction measure(s) of disease), vaccine coverage, and sufficient methodology detail to judge study quality was conducted (Walker N et al 2012-personal communication82). Direct effect of vaccine was calculated as efficacy x coverage; indirect effect was calculated as study observed effect - calculated direct effect. Eight out of 10 included studies showed higher observed impact on Hib disease than would be expected given coverage levels of the vaccine, suggesting indirect effects (herd immunity). Excluding the studies with a negative effect, the calculated indirect effects ranged from 7% to 63%, representing 13% to 76% of the total vaccine impact in some settings. The lowest level of vaccine coverage was in Brazil in 1999, at 8%. At this coverage level a 26% reduction in Hib meningitis was observed. Most studies which showed a negative indirect effect (observed impact was lower than would be expected at the given coverage levels) were conducted in the first year of vaccine introduction and reported maximum coverage levels for that year, as opposed to median-year coverage. This likely caused an over-estimation of the true coverage for most of that year, and thus an overestimation of the expected direct effect. Page 29561 Limitations of the evidence Number of doses of Hib vaccine: Clinical and carriage data: no direct RCTs with comparisons within individual trials between these 2 schedules. Studies randomizing to 2p schedules are PRP-OMP, and those to 3p are PRP-T and PRP-HbOC. Limited control for confounding (particularly in cohort studies). There is no direct comparison of the two schedules from impact studies. Few countries use a 2p+1 schedule. Comparisons must be made between countries which may result in confounding. Comparisons are difficult because there are no long term data from developing countries using a 2p+1 schedule and few developing countries are using a booster dose at all. Also, no industrialized countries reviewed are currently using a 3p schedule. Likely long term effectiveness must be inferred from immunogenicity and efficacy data. Reasons for increases in incidence in countries using 3p are not known. There are no impact data on use of a booster dose prior to 11 months of age. Age at first dose: Clinical and carriage data: no data from RCTs, immunological data only: Only PRP-T and PRP-OMP in comparisons of proportion above a set threshold. Few data about birth dose and conclusions about birth dose differ depending on control group used (e.g. Lieberman 199553, HbOC).Observational Studies mainly reported intended schedules rather than actual age at vaccination. Limited range in intended age at first dose (6 weeks, 2 months or 2-5 months). The one study with intended age at initiation of 6 weeks and relatively low three-dose VE (83%) was carried out in a population with a high prevalence of HIV infection. Regarding impact studies, there is limited variability in first dose timing in currently used schedules. Developing countries recommend the first dose at 6 or 8 weeks. Industrialized countries recommend the first dose mainly at 8 weeks with a few at 12 weeks. Hib continues to cause disease in all countries reviewed, with incidence highest in the first year of life. This suggests ongoing risk in young infants. No clear evidence of the superiority of either schedule. Interval between doses Clinical and carriage data from RCTs: no data. Immunological data: Only proportion above a set threshold data from PRP-T studies. One study (Lenoir 1987 83, PRP-OMP) showed 2m interval better but 2m group vaccinated later. Limited evidence from observational studies. Comparison of VE estimates between studies. One case-control study compared intervals between doses in cases and controls. No evidence to favour any particular interval based on intended schedules. The one case-control which provided actual dosing intervals found no evidence of a different in the median interval between doses in cases and controls, but found an increased risk of pneumonia with a longer interval between doses (OR 2.1 if >90 days interval between doses 1 and 2 in a three-dose schedule). Both 4 week and 8 week intervals have been used with good sustained long term impact. There are no direct comparisons of different age at first dose using long term impact as an outcome. Data on the age and vaccine receipt in cases that persist in countries using vaccine for >5 years has not been systematically assessed. Page 29662 Interval between last primary dose and booster dose Clinical and carriage data from RCTs: no data. Immunological data: Data about PRP-T only. No data are available on earlier use of the booster dose from observational studies. Few countries recommend a booster dose prior to the first birthday. Comparisons must be made between countries which could result in confounding. Schedules with a booster dose given in the second year of life have shown good sustained long term impact. Schedules with the booster dose ranging from 11 months to 18 months of age have all been successful. No clear evidence of the superiority of booster dose timing between 11 months and 18 months of age. HIV infected children Limited data to inform policy. There are not studies to assess various immunization schedules Page 29763 Research needs Main research priorities include: ongoing surveillance for impact and possible disease resurgence in a small number of high quality surveillance sites; Evaluation of need for booster in HIV infected children; assessment of any impact on disease of switching to aP with various conjugate Hib vaccines, especially PRP-T. In addition, we list below additional research questions that will help address some of the identified evidence gaps are listed below: Studies are required to further assess the effect on Hib vaccine efficacy and effectiveness as well as carriage of co-administration with acellular pertussis vaccines (by type of aP), schedules, including assessing the need for a booster. It is important to conduct special studies to further monitor disease impact and evaluate disease surveillance systems. This evidence will help to inform policy as it will provide evidence on any changes on the age distribution of the cases and would provide further evidence on the impact of Hib immunization in various epidemiological settings. Over the long term, there is a need further assess the impact of various schedules, particularly looking at disease at later ages, ad secondarily serotype replacement. Therefore, there is a need to expand ongoing review of Hib disease surveillance data to assess vaccine impact by schedule. Planning of such studies should bear in mind the opportunities offered by ongoing or planned research including but not limited to carriage studies on Streptococcus pneumonia. Additional studies are needed (e.g. observational studies) to further assess vaccine effectiveness after various immunization schedules in low and middle income countries including: number of doses with or without booster, early vs. late start schedules, interval between doses and; duration of protection of primary series with and without booster. In addition, supplementary evidence on the immunogenicity of 1st dose at 4 weeks would be informative. In addition, we need to better understand the effect of vaccine coverage and force of infection on the optimal schedule. For example, some argue that in the UK they may have experienced and increase in Hib disease among older people because coverage was too high relative to baseline Hib carriage, leading to a lack of natural boosting. However, maybe in developing countries, a lower coverage with occasional boosting using a 3p+0 schedule will result in acceptable levels of Hib disease control. Over the short term, it is also important to assess what vaccine coverage is necessary and with what distribution through the population to achieve elimination or near elimination. Given the limited data on the Hib disease epidemiology and Hib vaccine response among HIV infected individuals studies to assess both elements are critical to define future immunization schedules. In order to determine whether a booster dose should be given to HIV-infected children in developing countries, well-designed studies need to be conducted to better determine the persistence of protective antibody concentrations, response to booster doses of Page 29864 vaccine as well as timing of and risk factors for vaccine failure in HIV-infected children both treated and naive to antiretroviral drug therapy (ART), though these studies are becoming more difficult to conduct due to prenatal ART programs. As the data on Hib vaccination in emergency settings are absent, generating such evidence is important. Evaluation of potential role of Hib vaccines should be conducted together with the evaluation of the impact of other health interventions. Lastly, evaluation should consider the effectiveness of different Hib vaccines.

Welcome, Meeting Background and Objectives/Introduction from secretariat This was the fourth meeting of JTEG. Objectives were outlined: Discussion with the Malaria Vaccine Development Partnership to help interpret the new data, To consider additional work required by the Secretariat to prepare for upcoming data, To determine if additional analyses should be requested, To receive JTEG input on external messages that will be available around the release of new data. With the new results, WHO policy process remains the same: no policy decisions will be made prior to 2015, based on data to become available in late 2014, and on additional analyses to be performed at WHO's request . All results are confidential and should not be discussed outside the meeting. Submitted DOIs were deemed not to represent real or perceived conflicts requiring exclusion of any members. Session 2. Presentation of Phase III data Overview and Clarifications Phase III study results from two analyses were shared: efficacy against clinical and severe malaria, and SAEs in 6,537 infants in the 6-12 week age group with one year of follow up, and immunogenicity for anti-CS, unsolicited AEs and rash, and solicited reactogenicity in 2200 (200 at each site) in the 6-12 week age group. Neither numbers of children enroll ed nor numbers of malaria cases occurring were distribut ed even ly across sites. For example, two sites taken together were responsible for over 50% of total malaria cases from the 11 sites in the older age group (5-17 months of age). It was clarified that all analyses are stratified by site, in the Cox regression analyses. A test for heterogeneity of efficacy by site was not performed. The protocol was written such that site- specific effects would be examined only at the end of the study. The Partnership stated that this reasoning was based on an assumption that there would be insufficient cases for earlier site- specific analyses, although the actual numbers of cases to date have been higher than the pre-trial assumptions about incidence rates. It was clarified that in the graphs of cumulative malaria incidence, the drop in the denominator at 12 months was due to some participants having their one-year follow-up at slightly less than 12 months at the time of this analysis. Page 336 4 Changes in VE with time since vaccination have not been analysed for all episodes of malaria but may be incorporated into analyses in 2014. For severe malaria, 65 of the 104 cases included were analyzed in the February 2012 presentation of results. Key Discussion Points Potential explanations for the results were discussed, as were strategies for aiding in their interpretation. It was posited that subdividing the 5-17 month age group help clarify the differences seen between the 6-12 week and 5-17 month groups. There was much discussion about the possibility of heterogeneity of efficacy by site, and what bearing the lack of analysis examining such heterogeneity may have on interpreting the current data. JTEG indicated having site or transmission strata-specific VE estimates was very important, as the results from one or two high transmission sites could greatly affect the pooled estimate of effect. GSK/MVI Partnership stated that for any additional analyses or altered timing, the protocol must be amended, and this must be reviewed by many ethical and scientific review committees. An amendment that will include VE by site (for 18 months follow up) has been submitted and, if approved, will allow for these analyses to be done by 2013[ Post-meeting note March 2013: this amendment has passed. Thus all analyses dependent on the amendment will occur in 2013 ]. It was clarified that even this amendment will not explore VE by site over 12 months. VE will be provided by site only over the full 18 month period, not including any breakdown by time period. The VE breakdown by time period will only be available in late 2014 [ Post-meeting note March 2013: the 2013 analyses will include VE by site and broken down by time period, as GSK/MVI included these reques ts in line with JTEG's feedback ]. The substantial difference in the pooled VE estimate between the older and younger age groups was noted, and it was suggested that one possible partial explanation could be that if VE wanes with time since vaccination, then the period of highest VE would coincide with lowest incidence of malaria due to the reduced malaria risk in young infants related to maternally acquired antibodies. Another difference between age groups discussed was that the older age group was enrolled more quickly while infants were enrolled over a longer period. Thus seasonality of malaria could impact VE in the 2 age groups differently. Furthermore, different sites contributed different proportions of cases for the two age groups. Indeed two sites did not contribute any children to the previously published analysis in 5-17 month olds. It was observed that the Kaplan-Meier curves appear different in Phase III compared to Phase II data; one possible reason was speculated to be the different transmission levels. Transmission in some sites in the Phase III trial is much higher than in any Phase II studies. In the Phase III trial, seasonality of malaria was not taken into account in the analyses to date. Most sites show some peaks in malaria but are considered perennial, with the exception of Nanoro in Burkina Faso where malaria is both highly seasonal and there is high transmission. It was proposed that analyses of the effect of seasonality on vaccine efficacy be included in future analyses. Broader issues were also raised, such as whether RTS,S should be delivered in the routine EPI schedule or potentially outside this schedule. Page 337 5 Discussion of Phase III data including available data on alternative schedules, including 4 doses. Overview and Clarifications Key differences between the 5-17 month age group and 6-12 week age group were highlighted including: Approximately three-fold higher anti-CS IgG responses to vaccination in the older age group Co-administration with DTwP/HepB/Hib and OPV in the younger age group Higher proportion with presence of maternally acquired antibodies to the CS sporozoite antigen in the younger age group (as measured by pre-vaccination anti-CS IgG) Greater naturally acquired immunity, and higher previous exposure to malaria in the older age group Prior Hepatitis B priming at the time of RTS,S/AS01 vaccination in the older age group (as part of prior pentavalent immunization) There has not been an examination of an association between immunological response and birth weight or other anthropometric indicators, but this can be done at the end of the study as the data are being collected. There are few data looking at the correlation between anti-HepB and anti- CS. There is some evidence from phase II trials that co-administration with DTwP/Hep B/Hib and OPV may adversely affect immunogenicity. The potential role of HepB as a prime for the anti-CS response was also discussed. A JTEG member pointed out that kinetics of decline of antibody responses could differ by age even when peak responses do not differ. Decline can be more rapid in infants compared to older children with some other vaccines. Key Discussion Points The distribution of children and cases is different between the 2 age groups and thus the pooled VE results for each of the 2 age groups are not strictly comparable. Site specific weighting in the analyses presented to date is imposed by the Cox regression model. An important question still being explored is the relationship between anti-CS titers and vaccine efficacy. No established correlate of protection currently exists for RTS,S/AS01, but a sense of the correlation (or lack of correlation) between titer and risk of disease would be helpful from the Phase III data. Challenge studies and Phase II field trials have found consistent statistically significant associations between total IgG titers and vaccine efficacy against infection but not consistently for morbidity. With this vaccine, it appears that the most useful immunological measure for associating with efficacy may not be peak titer, but IgG titers at the time of infection. Antibody levels at the time of infection could vary by age group. Because of the short time interval before the sporozoite reaches the liver, there is insufficient time to mount an anamnestic immune response. The Olutu et al. study in Kilifi was raised exploring the relationship between CS antibody titers and protection to assess whether it was a linear or a stepwise function/threshold effect. In that Page 338 6 particular setting, it appeared to be a step-wise function. However, these results have not been confirmed in other settings. The possible contribution of immune interference from EPI vaccines was discussed. A JTEG member stated that, even in 2-week staggered schedules (done with AS02 studies), interference can occur. Adjuvant use in different vaccines given could also have an effect, but since all co- administered parenteral vaccines given were alum-based, there are unlikely to be concerns about non-specific effects that would apply differently in the studies under discussion. There is evidence that RTS,S does not affect measles titers, but no evidence was available at the meeting on the effect of the measles vaccine on RTS,S response. A JTEG member indicated that interference between RTS,S and measles is unlikely, due to the contrast between live and subunit vaccine kinetics for induction of immunogenicity. Further analyses of association between immunogenicity and pre-existing maternal antibodies could be informative. The issue of timing between vaccination and infection was raised as an additional complexity that has not been fully looked at. The time interval between completion of the vaccination schedule and seasonal transmission is relevant if efficacy wanes. The relationship between vaccination and seasonality is likely different by age group given the rapid enrollment of the 5- 17 month age group and the longer enrollment of 6-12 week age group. There was a discussion about RTS,S kinetics of immunogenicity, suggesting that the vaccine does not appear to induce high, long-lived plateaus of immunogenicity, with boosters perhaps likely to provide multiple primary vaccination kinetics. The reasons for this are unclear, although it was raised that with RTS,S the malaria response may be subdominant to the Hepatitis B response (note that a plateau of anti-Hep B IgG is obtained with RTS,S vaccination). The Partnership was asked whether there were plans to test RTS,S in adults. For the moment the Partnership is prioritizing infants. The site-specific analyses should give a sense of what the potential role could be in a range of settings. Thus, the data to become available in late 2014 will only allow assessment of direct benefits against morbidity, but there may be advantages to generation of data in broader age ranges, so that whether or not there may be a role for RTS,S/AS01 as a contribution to elimination in some settings can be assessed after 2015. Availability of next data packages Overview and Clarifications Assuming the current protocol amendment is approved, 18 month post dose 3 results are expected in 2013 and will include efficacy pooled and by site over 18 months. The statistical analysis plan is under development and will be sent to JTEG for input in the beginning of 2013. The last child's last visit will occur in December 2013 (all children are followed for at least 12 months post booster). The final analyses in late 2014 will include WHO p re-specified requests, i.e. additional analyses that WHO indicated would be necessary for a policy decision in 2015. A Page 339 7 single-blind extension has been arranged to follow up all children to 49 and 41 months post dose 1 in the 5-17 month age category and 6-12 week age category, respectively. Key Discussion Points There was intense discussion about the process for requiring an amendment, timelines and regulatory limitations to doing unplanned analyses. It was clear that additional clarification on all of these issues would be of use. JTEG has previously emphasized the need for longer follow up. However, i f a decline in vaccine efficacy is apparent in one year of follow up and there is evidence of low vaccine efficacy after a year or two, the pressure to follow participants longer is reduced. Update on regulatory status & Phase 4 plans Overview and Clarifications Prior to the availability of these new data to the Partnership, much scenario planning and decision tree analysis had already been done by GSK/MVI in anticipation of the results. Both co-primary endpoints were met, but many questions remain as to what the optimal indication and the schedule (EPI co-administration with DTP1-3 or alternative) would be, which are important considerations for filing. The timing of regulatory submissions are under assessment. Plans for Phase IV studies are also under revision, as they will depend on the results of the Phase III trial and the indication of the vaccine. There was clarification about the impact modeling, which is based on the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute model and has been reviewed by a joint QUIVER/JTEG group. A JTEG member expressed caution in some of the assumptions used by the mathematical models [Post- meeting note: a second WHO meeting to assess the status of public health impact and cost- effectiveness models for malaria vaccines is being held in May 2013]. Key Discussion Points There was much discussion about the pros and cons of doing additional analyses not yet specified in the data analysis plan. Conducting a study in the context of submission to a stringent regulatory authority was noted to add a layer of complexity that makes data exploration more difficult. There are opportunities for scientific consultations with European Medicines Agency (EMA), but the Partnership has concerns that actions taken without a careful approval process could invalidate the file when submitted to a regulatory agency. Because of the time it takes to go through the approval process, quick answers cannot be easily obtained despite the potential usefulness of additional analyses with interpretation of the latest results. Although there do not appear to be ethical issues with the requested clarifying analyses (e.g. site-specific data), recently an ethical committee raised questions to even the 18 month analysis in the amendment, so it is not a given that such unplanned analyses would be approved [Post-meeting note March 2013: all ethical committees and national regulatory authorities did approve the amendment]. This is the only pivotal Phase III trial, and it is important not to call into question its integrity. At the same Page 340 8 time, waiting a year for the ability to do new analyses is a highly inefficient way to explore the important scientific questions raised by these results. It would be an ethical problem, it was argued, to have a vaccine that could save lives but was withheld because analyses were not done in a timely fashion that could have been. Furthermore some analyses could be done now, which could lead to generation of additional data that could accelerate timelines. There were also discussions of the potential impact on sites if site-specific vaccine efficacies were known. Theoretically, this knowledge could impact how investigators at a site follow up their patients. Many meeting participants did not think this would be a problem, but did acknowledge the theoretical possibility. The Partnership agreed to consider if there could be a different course of action that would satisfy JTEG, regulatory agencies, involved scientific and ethical review committees, and the Partnership to conduct analyses that would allow for better understanding of the latest results. It was noted that the Partnership 's decision to defer the regulatory submission, will also delay policy recommendation timelines by 6 months. Given the many questions that are raised by the latest results, it was suggested that publishing these results without further context and explanation could be misleading and confusing to the scientific community. GSK considers it is very important to publish data when they are available so no one accuses them of with-holding data, particularly data that are different than what was hoped for. In summary, there was strong support for looking at ways to improve flexibility for additional analyses that may help explain results or suggest further analyses or studies that are needed. Delay of these additional analyses could postpone timelines and access to the vaccine, depending on the results not yet to hand. It was appreciated that regulatory considerations are paramount. There was frustration that the publication speculates on questions that could be answered by analyses that could be performed on available data. Review of status of other Phase III and ancillary studies Malaria Transmission Intensity Study Overview and Clarifications Annual cross-sectional surveys will collect blood from 800 randomly selected children and adults for four years at eight sites. The results after one annual survey were presented. The peak prevalence of P. falciparum infection varied from over 60% to less than 5% across the range of sites, with different age patterns for prevalence of infection in the different sites. Bednet coverage also varied by site and impacted the odds of parasitemia differently by site. The results confirm the large heterogeneity in transmission intensity by site. Key Discussion Points Page 341 9 The transmission intensity study is a useful contribution that should facilitate extrapolation from the Phase III trial to non-trial settings in terms of transmission intensity. Such extrapolation may be necessary at the policy stage if VE varies with transmission intensity. Lot- to-lot consistency study Overview and Clarifications The first primary objective was to establish consistency of immunogenicity between three consecutive commercial scale lots of RTS,S/AS01, and the second primary objective was to establish non-inferiority of commercial scale lots to the pilot scale lot. Both were demonstrated. Key Discussion Points It was pointed out that the antibody titers seen in this study were lower than seen in other studies of the same age group. The study population was 5-17 month old Nigerian children thought to be living in an area of fairly high malaria transmission (although no data on the transmission intensity was presented). There may be several reasons that immunogenicity will vary by site or even within a site. These sites were chosen in Nigeria to support a filing that would include Nigerian data, which is required for licensure in that country. Hepatitis B indication, co-administration with Rotavirus and S. pneumoniae Overview and Clarifications This study, the goal of which is to establish the non-inferiority of the Hepatitis B response, is fully enrolled and in progress. Secondary objectives include establishing non-inferiority of immunogenicity in co-administration with pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines. The results should be available in 2013. Study in HIV-positive children Overview and Clarifications The primary goal of this study is safety for 14 months post dose 1. Two sites in Kenya are participating with a total of 200 study participants, and results should be available in 2013. Children are diagnosed before entering the study, and thus are on ART treatment. There is a subset of children in the Phase III trial who are now known to be HIV positive but were not diagnosed at the time of vaccination and were not on treatment. A case-control study will be done to look at safety and immunogenicity in this group of 125 children. Immunology study Overview and Clarifications Page 342 10 This study will follow the model of the HIV RV144 prime boost vaccine trial in Thailand to better understand vaccine-induced protection against malaria and identify a correlate of protection. Three working groups are involved in drafting a proposal for the study, which will be thoroughly reviewed by a number of experts. The study is framed in the larger systems biology context. Because samples are taken at a fixed time, they are not obtained at the time when infection occurs. Key Discussion Points It was noted that having serology at the time of infection would be helpful given the assumption that the immunological response changes over time since vaccination. Such samples will not be available, and analyses will be done using fixed timepoints for the sampling. Genotyping study Overview and Clarifications The aim of the study is to better understand the mechanism of action of RTS,S/AS01 and to evaluate whether the vaccine puts selective pressure on parasites resulting in variants that may be resistant to the vaccine or lead to a change in the number of parasite types. The study, to be performed in collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, will occur post-unblinding of the pivotal Phase III trial. Page 343 11 JTEG Recommendations to WHO JTEG indicated that the new data that have become available in Q4 2012 do not change the previously communicated policy timings. WHO policy recommendations can be expected in 2015, depending on the data available in 2014 and on the timing of regulatory submission. RTS,S/AS01 will be evaluated as an addition to, not a replacement for, existing malaria prevention, diagnostic and treatment measures. There is a range of policy decisions possible in the 2015 timeframe, depending on the 2014 results. JTEG highlights the following to be considered as part of the additional analyses for late 2014. These will also be revisited in review of the analysis plan for the 2013 analyses [Post- meeting note March 2013: some recommendations listed here were taken into account by GSK/MVI when the list of analyses to be conducted in 2013 was finalized] . Site-specific and transmission strata specific efficacy analyses Rates of disease in the vaccine vs control group broken down by time since vaccination Explorations of correlation between immunogenicity and efficacy Exploration of the interaction between seasonality and vaccine efficacy Correlation between pre-existing maternally acquired antibody to CS and immunogenicity Correlation between anti-CS and anti-Hepatitis B antibody titres Given the results to date, contingency plans for alternative schedules should be included, minimizing the number of additional routine immunization visits whilst maximizing expected efficacy. However it is unlikely that policy recommendations for use can be made on alternative schedules without clinical trial data on those schedules. JTEG recommends the Secretariat present to MPAC and SAGE: Available data (as soon as embargo period is over) Summary of issues JTEG has identified Pipeline of additional work that is ongoing or planned JTEG supports WHO's effort on communication about these results. JTEG could be included in such communication efforts by provision of slides. JTEG supports in concept a systematic review of the age pattern of severe malaria in sub-Saharan Africa if possible to do, noting that age-spectrum of hospitalizations can change at the same location as transmission changes, and this must be taken into account. This work may support considerations of alternate schedules during the 2014-2015 policy discussions.

ABSTRACT Background The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 reduced episodes of both clinical and severe malaria in children 5 to 17 months of age by approximately 50% in an ongoing phase 3 trial. We studied infants 6 to 12 weeks of age recruited for the same trial. Methods We administered RTS,S/AS01 or a comparator vaccine to 6537 infants who were 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination in conjunction with Ex- panded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines in a three-dose monthly schedule. Vaccine efficacy against the first or only episode of clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination, a coprimary end point, was analyzed with the use of Cox regression. Vaccine efficacy against all malaria episodes, vaccine efficacy against severe malaria, safety, and immunogenicity were also assessed. Results The incidence of the first or only episode of clinical malaria in the intention-to-treat population during the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine was 0.31 per person- year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.40 per person-year in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 30.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.6 to 36.1). Vaccine effi- cacy in the per-protocol population was 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3). Vaccine ef- ficacy against severe malaria was 26.0% (95% CI, 7.4 to 48.6) in the intention-to- treat population and 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the per-protocol population. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. One month after administration of the third dose of RTS,S/AS01, 99.7% of children were positive for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, with a geometric mean titer of 209 EU per milliliter (95% CI, 197 to 222). Conclusions The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine coadministered with EPI vaccines provided modest pro- tection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants.

In 2010, an estimat- ed 216 million cases of malaria and 655,000 malaria-related deaths occurred, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in African children.1 The RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine tar- gets the pre-erythrocytic stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. It was developed to reduce clinical and severe malaria in African children. Ideally, it would be administered through the well-established Expanded Program on Immuni- zation (EPI). In 2011, we reported the results for the first coprimary end point from an ongoing phase 3 trial, which showed that during 12 months of follow-up, RTS,S/AS01 had an efficacy against clinical and severe malaria of 55.8% (97.5% con- fidence interval [CI], 50.6 to 60.4) and 47.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 64.2), respectively, among children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment (per-protocol analysis).3 Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria among children 6 to 12 weeks of age and those 5 to 17 months of age combined was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 49.2) during an average of 11 months of follow-up (range, 0 to 22). We now report on the second coprimary end point from the same trial: efficacy against clinical malaria during 12 months of follow-up among infants 6 to 12 weeks of age at enrollment, when RTS,S/ AS01 was coadministered with EPI vaccines. Methods STUDY DESIGN Details of the study methods have been described previously3-7 and are provided in the Supplemen- tary Appendix and the study protocol, both of which are available with the full text of this ar- ticle at NEJM.org. This phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial is being conducted at 11 centers in 7 African countries with a range of malaria-transmission intensity (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The trial is designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, safety, and immuno- genicity for 32 months after the first dose of study vaccine in children 6 to 12 weeks of age or 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment. The trial includes three study groups in each age category: infants who received three doses of RTS,S/AS01 administered at 1-month intervals and a booster dose 18 months after the third dose, infants who received three doses of RTS,S/AS01 at 1-month in- tervals without a booster dose, and a control group of infants who received a non-malaria compara- tor vaccine. The analysis described in this report combines the first two groups (referred to as the RTS,S/AS01 group) and compares this group with the control group6 14 months after the first dose of vaccine administered in children 6 to 12 weeks of age (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The trial protocol was approved by all relevant ethics review boards and national regulatory au- thorities (Tables S1A and S1B in the Supplemen- tary Appendix). Written informed consent was obtained from the children's parents or guard- ians. The study was undertaken in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.8 STUDY OVERSIGHT The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Bio- logicals (GSK), the vaccine developer and manu- facturer, and funded by both GSK and the Pro- gram for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All study centers received study grants from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which also provided funding for authors' travel and accommodations related to this trial. All the authors reviewed all manuscript drafts, approved the final version of the manuscript, and made the decision to submit it for publication. No GSK authors were involved in the collection or analysis of the data; the analysis was performed by an independent statistician. The authors had full access to the results. The authors remain unaware of study-group assignments in this ongoing trial and do not have access to the raw data at this point. Details of the contributions of all the authors to the study are available in the Supplementary Appendix. The Clinical Trials Part- nership Committee and Writing Group vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data pre- sented and for the fidelity of this report to the study protocol. RANDOMIZATION AND VACCINATION From December 2009 through January 2011, a to- tal of 6537 infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were ran- domly assigned to one of the three study groups in a 1:1:1 ratio.

The study and pentavalent vaccines were admin- istered intramuscularly at different protocol-speci- fied injection sites. SURVEILLANCE FOR CLINICAL AND SEVERE MALARIA Passive surveillance for malaria began at the time of the first vaccination. Parents or guardians of the study participants were encouraged to seek care at a health facility if the child had any signs of illness, and transportation was facilitated. All participants who presented to a study facility with reported or documented fever during the previous 24 hours were evaluated for malaria. The primary efficacy end point for this analy- sis was the incidence of clinical malaria, defined as an illness in a child who was brought to a study facility with an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher and P. f alc ip ar um asexual para sitemia at a density of more than 5000 parasites per cubic millimeter or a case of malaria meeting the pri- mary case definition of severe malaria (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Different para- site thresholds were used for secondary case definitions (Table 1). Participants who were hos- pitalized were evaluated for severe malaria on the basis of a protocol-defined algorithm (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).4,10 SAFETY SURVEILLANCE Data regarding serious adverse events were re- corded by means of passive surveillance begin- ning after the first dose of vaccine. Verbal autop- sies were conducted for deaths that occurred outside study facilities.11 Information was col- lected on all unsolicited reports of adverse events that occurred within 30 days after vaccination and on reactogenicity (pain, swelling, redness at the injection site, drowsiness, fever, irritability or fussiness, or loss of appetite) within 7 days after vaccination among the first 200 participants en- rolled at each center. Symptom intensity was as- sessed with the use of standardized methods (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Infor-mation on related adverse events within 30 days after vaccination was collected for all partici- pants. Study clinicians used clinical judgment to decide whether an adverse event was likely to be related to the vaccine. In an analysis of previous RTS,S studies, rash was observed more frequently in children vaccinated with RTS,S than in con- trols.12 Rashes and mucocutaneous diseases oc- curring within 30 days after vaccination and sei- zures occurring within 7 days after vaccination were reported according to Brighton Collabora- tion guidelines13,14 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). IMMUNOGENICITY Anti-circumsporozoite antibodies were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay15 in the first 200 infants enrolled at each study center at screening and 1 month after dose-3. An antibody titer of 0.5 EU per millimeter or greater was considered to be positive. LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC PROCEDURES Laboratory and radiologic procedures have been reported previously5 and are described in the Supplementary Appendix. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical methods have been described in detail previously.3,7 We used Cox regression mod- els (1 minus hazard ratio) to evaluate vaccine ef- ficacy against the first or only episode of clinical malaria, using the study center as a stratification factor that allowed for differential baseline haz- ards. For the coprimary end point, vaccine effi- cacy against clinical malaria during 12 months of follow-up in the two age categories, 97.5% confidence intervals were used, ensuring an overall two-sided alpha level of 5%. The propor- tionality of hazards was evaluated by means of Schoenfeld residuals and models, including time- varying covariates. Secondary analyses, which included evaluations based on other case defini- tions and an analysis including multiple episodes of clinical malaria, were performed with the use of negative binomial regression. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio and is presented with 95% confi- dence intervals and Fisher's exact P values. Primary analyses of vaccine efficacy were based on the per-protocol population, which in- cluded all participants who received three doses The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION on February 18, 2013.

All end points are presented with 95% confidence intervals except for the coprimary end point, which is presented with 97.5% confidence intervals. The coprimary end point was de- fined as vaccine efficacy against a first or only episode of clinical malaria, according to the primary case definition. The primary case definition of clinical malaria was an illness in a child brought to a study facility with a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C and Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter or a case of malaria meeting the primary case definition of severe malaria. \u00a7 The primary case definition of severe malaria was P. falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter with one or more markers of disease severity and without diagnosis of a coexisting illness. The secondary case definition of severe malaria was P. falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter with one or more markers of disease severity, including cases in which a coexisting illness was present or could not be ruled out. Markers of severe disease were prostration, respirato- ry distress, a Blantyre coma score of 2 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of consciousness), two or more observed or reported seizures, hypoglycemia, acidosis, elevated lactate level, or hemoglobin level of <5 g per deciliter. Coexisting illnesses were defined as radiographically proven pneumonia, meningitis on analysis of cerebrospi- nal fluid, bacteremia, or gastroenteritis with severe dehydration.

The modified intention-to-treat population included all participants who received at least one dose of a study vaccine. In the ad- justed analyses, vaccine efficacy was adjusted for study center and distance to the nearest out- patient facility ( 5 km vs. >5 km). Data were censored 14 months after the first dose of vac- cine, or at the date of emigration, withdrawal of consent, or death. Serious adverse events were coded from clini- cian-assigned diagnoses according to the pre- ferred terms of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities16 and were based on available clinical and laboratory evidence. The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the per-protocol population. Anti-cir- cumsporozoite antibody titers were plotted and evaluated after the third dose of a study vaccine on the basis of seropositivity levels and geomet- ric mean titers. Results STUDY POPULATION In total, 6537 infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were enrolled; 6003 (91.8%) were included in the per- protocol analysis (Fig. 1, and Fig. S3 in the Sup- plementary Appendix). Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in the two study groups (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appen- dix). The numbers of participants and malaria episodes according to study center are shown in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. As ex- pected, the majority of malaria episodes were reported by centers in areas with the highest transmission; 43.5% of all clinical malaria epi- sodes were reported by two high-transmission sites in western Kenya. These two sites, combined with the site in Nanoro, Burkina Faso (where transmission is high but seasonal), accounted for 72.6% of clinical malaria episodes in this analy- sis. The rate of use of insecticide-treated nets was 85.8% overall and was similar in the two study groups. Indoor residual spraying was conducted as a public health intervention at four study cen- ters; at those centers, spraying coverage was low (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).VACCINE EFFICACY AGAINST CLINICAL AND SEVERE MALARIA In the per-protocol population, the incidence of a first or only episode of clinical malaria meeting the primary case definition during 12 months of follow-up was 0.37 per person-year in the RTS,S/ AS01 group and 0.48 per person-year in the con- trol group, for a vaccine efficacy of 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3). Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in Figures 2A and 2B. Vaccine efficacy was not constant over time (P<0.001 by Schoenfeld re- siduals), with efficacy higher at the beginning than at the end of the follow-up period (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Vaccine effica- cy against all clinical malaria episodes was 32.9% (95% CI, 26.3 to 38.8). Estimates of efficacy against clinical malaria were consistent across all case definitions and in both adjusted and intention-to-treat analyses (Table 1). At least one episode of severe malaria occurred in 58 of 3995 infants (1.5%) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and in 46 of 2008 infants (2.3%) in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the per-protocol popula- tion. In the intention-to-treat population, at least one episode of severe malaria occurred in 77 of 4358 infants (1.8%) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and in 52 of 2179 infants (2.4%) in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 26.0% (95% CI, 7.4 to 48.6) (Table 1, and Tables S15 and S16 in the Supplementary Appendix). SAFETY Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events were reported in 17.9% (95% CI, 16.8 to 19.1) of recipients of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and in 19.2% (95% CI, 17.6 to 20.9) of recipients of the meningococcal vaccine ( Table 2 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 94 infants died: 66 of 4358 infants (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 28 of 2179 infants (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) in the control group. Causes of death were similar in the two groups; none of the deaths were thought to be related to vaccination (Table S10 in the Sup- plementary Appendix). Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to a study vaccine occurred in 7 infants: 4 of the 4358 infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 3 of the 2179 infants in the control group; 4 events (2 in each group) The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION on February 18, 2013.

One infant (in the con- trol group) had anaphylaxis, one infant (in the RTS,S/AS01 group) had a suspected injection-site infection related to the pentavalent vaccine, and one infant (in the RTS,S/AS01 group) had repeat- ed febrile seizures associated with a respiratory infection. The frequency of seizures within 7 days after vaccination, reported previously, was simi- lar in the two study groups.3Meningitis of any cause was reported as a serious adverse event in 11 infants: 9 of the 4358 infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 2 of the 2179 infants in the control group (relative risk in the RTS,S/AS01 group, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.5 to 10.4). A pathogen was identified for 7 of the events (salmonella in 3 episodes of meningitis and pneumococcus in 4 episodes). The 4 remaining events, with no pathogen identified, were re- ported by a single study center (3 episodes of meningitis in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 1 epi- sode in the control group). Of the 11 episodes of meningitis, 2 were new (1 due to pneumococcus and 1 due to salmonella); the 9 other episodes have been reported previously.3 Investigator-driven medical review of previously reported meningitis episodes led to reclassification of 1 episode as an episode of pneumonia and reclassification of 4 episodes without cause as 2 episodes of pneu- mococcal meningitis and 2 of salmonella men- ingitis. Four of the episodes of meningitis oc- curred within 30 days after vaccination. Adverse Events Unsolicited reports of adverse events within 30 days after vaccination were recorded with similar fre- quency in the RTS,S/AS01 group (79.4%; 95% CI, 77.2 to and in the control group (81.3%; 95% CI, 78.3 to 84.1). No clinically important imbalances were observed (Table S11A in the Supplementary Appendix). Information on unso- licited reports of adverse events related to the vaccine or leading to withdrawal within 30 days after vaccination is shown in Table S11B in the Supplementary Appendix. The frequency of solic- ited reports of local symptoms was similar among infants who received the RTS,S/AS01 vac- cine and among those who received the menin- gococcal vaccine and was lower than that ob- served with the pentavalent vaccine (Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). Systemic reacto- genicity was higher in the RTS,S/AS01 group than in the control group (Fig. 3, and Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). Postvaccination fever was reported after 30.6% of doses (95% CI, 29.2 to 32.0) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and after 21.1% of doses (95% CI, 19.4 to 22.8) in the con- trol group. A temperature higher than 39\u00b0C was reported after less than 1% of doses. The inci- dence of mucocutaneous disease was similar in the two study groups (Table S14 in the Supplemen- tary Appendix).Cumulative Incidence (%)100 8090 70 60 40 30 1050 20 0 0 3 6 9 12 Months since 14 Days after Dose 3BIntention-to-Treat PopulationAPer-Protocol Population P<0.001 by log-rank 40 30 1050 20 0 0 3 6 9 15 12 Months since Dose 1P<0.001 by log-rank test No. 15101152 5352884 1325RTS,S/AS01Control vaccine Figure 2.

One month after the third dose of the study vaccine, 99.7% of infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group were positive for anti-circumsporozoite an- tibodies, with a geometric mean titer of 209 EU per milliliter (95% CI, 197 to 222).Discussion This phase 3 trial showed that in young infants, the RTS,S/AS01 candidate vaccine provided mod- est protection against malaria when coadminis- tered with EPI vaccines. The efficacy of RTS,S/ AS01 reported here is lower than that observed in a phase 2 trial involving infants at three of the phase 3 trial sites, in which RTS,S/AS01 was co- administered with EPI vaccines.

It is possible that the pooled estimate across the 11 centers in the phase 3 trial obscures differences in vaccine efficacy according to transmission in- tensity and that these two sets of results are com- patible with each other. The efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine re- ported here is also lower than that reported previ- ously among older children recruited for this trial at the same study centers.3 A likely explanation for the lower vaccine efficacy among infants is an age-dependent differential immune response to the vaccine. This concept is supported by the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers observed in infants (geometric mean titer, 209 EU per millili- ter; 95% CI, 197 to 222) as compared with titers in older children (621 EU per milliliter; 95% CI, 592 to 652), reported previously.3 Although the titer of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies is not an established correlate of the level of protection, an association with efficacy has been observed in several trials.17-21 Infants may have mounted a lower immune response than older children ow- ing to coadministration of RTS,S/AS01 with rou- tine nally derived anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, an absence of priming with hepatitis B vaccine or with P. f alc ip ar um infection, or the infant's imma- ture immune system. Coadministration of RTS,S/AS01 with the pen- tavalent vaccine and the oral poliovirus vaccine might have resulted in immune interference and contributed to the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers in the younger infants. Two phase 2 studies have explored the immunologic response to the related RTS,S/AS02 vaccine, either when co administered with a diphtheria-tetanus-pertus- sis-hepatitis B vaccine or when given 2 weeks afterward. The geometric mean titer of anti- circumsporozoite antibodies was lower when vac- cines were coadministered than when they were staggered (70 EU per milliliter [95% CI, 54 to 90] vs. 200 EU per milliliter [95% CI, 151 to 265]).20,21 However, vaccine efficacy against infection was similar in the two trials (65.2% [95% CI, 20.7 to 84.7] during 6 months after vaccination and 65.9% [95% CI, 42.6 to 79.8] during 3 months after vac- cination, respectively). An absence of priming with hepatitis B vac- cine or with P. f alc ip ar um infection may also have contributed to the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers. In this trial, infants simultaneously received a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- containing combination vaccine and the RTS,S vaccine, which contains HBsAg fused as a carrier protein to the circumsporozoite protein. Immune interference on concurrent administration of sim- ilar protein components has been described.22 In contrast, in older children vaccinated against hepatitis B, memory T-cell reactivation may have enhanced the anti-circumsporozoite antibody re- sponse to RTS,S/AS01.22 One study showed a tendency toward higher anti-circumsporozoite antibody responses in children who had been vaccinated against hepatitis B than in children who had not previously received hepatitis B vac- cine.23 Maternally derived antibodies can inter- fere with the immune response in young infants; such interference is common with live vaccines, such as the measles vaccine, but can also occur with some protein vaccines.24,25 S imilarly , pas -Percentage of Doses after Which Symptom Was Reported100 8090 70 60 40 30 1050 20 0 DrowsinessIrritabilityFever Loss of AppetiteRTS,S/AS01 (N=4252 doses)Meningococcal vaccine (N=2169 doses) Figure 3.

Finally, although most protein vaccines and polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are immunogenic in young infants, improved immu- nogenicity and efficacy have often been achieved when vaccination has extended beyond the first few months of life.22,26,27 As previously reported in older children,3 sta- tistical models indicated nonproportionality of hazards over time. This could be due to waning vaccine efficacy, differential acquisition of natu- ral immunity, or other factors that may influ- ence the model,28 such as heterogeneity of expo- sure, the vaccine effect at the individual level, or both.29,30 If vaccine efficacy does wane, this might contribute to the lower observed efficacy among infants than among older children, espe- cially because young infants may be less sus- ceptible to malaria in the immediate postvacci- nation period owing to maternally acquired immunity, fetal hemoglobin, lower exposure, and other factors.31 The 11 sites of the phase 3 trial cover a wide range of malaria-transmission intensity. The in- clusion of sites in high-transmission or seasonal- transmission areas and the large proportion of cases of severe and clinical malaria from these sites might have contributed to the lower vaccine efficacy among infants in this trial than in ear- lier trials involving infants. The implications of the large representation of malaria episodes from high-transmission areas may become ap- parent when site-specific data are analyzed at a later date, as specified by the protocol. Esti- mates of site-specific vaccine efficacy and the corresponding estimates of clinical or severe malaria episodes averted will help to determine what role this vaccine might have in malaria control. Exploration of factors that might affect vaccine efficacy, including the effect of maternal antibodies, the role of immune interference by EPI vaccines, the effect of the RTS,S/AS01 boost- er, and status with respect to previous exposure to P. f alc ip ar um parasites, will provide crucial in- formation for the further development of this vaccine and for other malaria vaccines under development.32 Overall, fatal, or vaccine-related serious ad-verse events were balanced between the study groups. In the previous analysis, which included infants and older children, the incidence of men- ingitis was imbalanced between the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups.3 The imbalance remains, but we now have clarified that the majority of cases had a bacterial cause. We will continue to mon- itor the incidence of meningitis throughout the trial. The imbalance in the incidence of rash, observed in previous RTS,S studies,12,33 was not confirmed in this larger trial. This phase 3 trial shows efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine. Data from the remainder of this trial and additional studies in progress will contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay among the intensity of exposure to ma- laria, the immune response, and vaccine efficacy.

Page 358 1 1 Questions and Answers on Malaria Vaccines November 2012 Malaria vaccines What is the current status of malaria vaccine research? There are currently no licensed malaria vaccines. Over 20 vaccine projects are in clinical trials. Of these, the most advanced vaccine is being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial. This vaccine is called RTS,S/AS01 and has been developed through a partnership between GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), with funds from the Bill & Melinda G ates Foundation to MVI. The clinical testing of RTS,S is at least 5 -10 years ahead of other candidate malaria vaccines. RTS,S/AS01 is a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum , with no protection expected against P. vivax malaria. In w hat populations is the Phase 3 trial being conducted? The Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 includes 15,460 infants and young children in seven sub -Saharan African countries namely Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania. These countries represent a range of different malaria transmission settings in order to be able to determine the vaccine's usefulness in these different settings. There are two age groups in the trial. One of these age groups is infants who receive three doses of th e malaria vaccine together with other routine childhood vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. The other age group in the Phase 3 trial is older children aged between 5 and 17 months at first dose of RTS,S /AS01. How well does the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine protect against malaria? As of November 2012, two sets of results are available from the Phase 3 trial. The first results were released in October 2011 and were in children aged 5-17 months at first immunization. The estimated overall efficacy was a 55% reductio n in all malaria episodes during the 12 months of follow -up, with 47% efficacy against severe, life- threatening malaria estimated in this same age group . Data for children vaccinated aged 6-14 weeks, in co-administration with other vaccines , were released in November 2012. Estimated overall efficacy in this age group over 12 months of follow -up was 33% for all malaria episodes, and 37% for severe, life-threatening malaria. So far data from follow -up of children for 1 year after vaccination have been published . There is evidence in both age groups that protection declines during this period, and we do not know how long the vaccine's protection lasts beyond 1 year. Furthermore, we do not know if a booster dose will be needed to enhance protection. No data a re available yet indicating whether or not the level of protection varies among countries with different intensities of malaria transmission. M ore information on all of these issues should be available by the end of the Phase 3 trial in 2014. Why is the efficacy apparently different in the 2 age groups? There has not yet been a detailed analysis to explore possible reasons for the apparent lower efficacy when the vaccine is given to infants rather than to older children. Possible factors that may relate to these differences include interference by co-administration with other vaccines, maternally acquired antibodies, transmission intensity and seasonality. An initial finding is that lower immune responses are induced by the vaccine in infants aged 6-14 weeks compared to children aged 5-17 months. Page 359 2 2 The implications of these apparent differences in level of protection according to the age at which the vaccine is administered include the need for a thoroug h assessment of the feasibility , safety and effectiveness of different possible schedu les and immunization strategies for this vaccine . No immunization visits currently exist in malaria-endemic countries to administer all the vaccine doses at 5-17 months of age. The new results also place emphasis on the importance of the site -specific efficacy and booster dose safety and efficacy information which will become available by 2014. How is WHO involved in malaria vaccine research efforts? WHO's role is to advise and guide the malaria vaccine development activities of the global research community. Once Phase 3 clinical trial data become available, WHO convenes its technical group to assess the safety and effectiveness of the malaria vaccine, and considers a WHO policy recommendation and prequalification, if advised that these are supported by the data. The technical group advising WHO on Phase 3 trials of malaria vaccines is the Joint Technical Expert Group on Malaria Vaccines, convened by the Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals Department and the Glob al Malaria Programme. Joint Technical Expert Group on Malaria Vaccines Licensing, policy recommendations and prequalification When could the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine be available for African children? If the results from the current Phase 3 trial provide sufficient evidence of the protective effect of the vaccine against malaria, RTS,S could be a \"first generation\" malaria vaccine. This means that RTS,S would be partially effective, reducing the number of cases of malaria in vaccinated children , but not preventing all episodes of the disease. There are still a number of steps that usually occur before new vaccines are introduced into immunization programmes in some endemic countries. These steps include: licensure of the vaccine by regulatory authorities; a WHO recommendation for use; WHO prequalification (for countries wishing to be supplied through the United Nations, or who use WHO prequalification as the basis for procurement eligibility); then decision-making by national public health authorities in malaria-endemic countries on introduction and use of the vaccine. An affordable price is one of the many additional factors beyond efficacy that will influence country decision-making on introduction. Based on what we know now, and depending on the final trial results, a WHO recommendation for use and subsequent prequalification may occur in 2015. When could the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine be licensed by a regulatory authority? The European Medicines Agency (EMA), under a process known as article 58, will perform a scientific evaluation of this vaccine and issue what is called \"a European scientific opinion\". This would not be licensure or registration, but provides a scientific opinion which African regulators may use to help their own regulatory processes. It will be African national regulatory authorities which will consider licensing the vaccine in their jurisdictions. It is not clear when African regulators will consider this, but evaluation for licensure becomes relevant when sufficient efficacy data for the target population for vaccination become available. What is article 58 and how does the EMA work with WHO in assessing the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine? Article 58 is a specific legal basis in the European pharmaceutical legislation, allowing the EMA to perform an evaluation of medicinal products which are intended to be used only outside the EU to prevent or treat diseases of major public health significance. The same processes are used by the Page 360 3 3 EMA as those used for marketing/registration of European Union (EU) medicinal products. This evaluation is performed with WHO and with involvement of the relevant national regulatory authorities. RTS,S/AS01 will be submitted to EMA under article 58 because it is being developed by an EU manufacturer specifically for targeted populations and against a disease which occurs primarily outside the EU. It is not expected that the manufacturer will seek to license this vaccine in European countries given its targeted intended use. When will WHO make a recommendation concerning use of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine? Information needed to make a recommendation for use includes how long the vaccine's protection lasts, and what the protection level is in different settings in Africa. In making recommendations , the efficacy of a booster dose may also be important. According to the vaccine developme nt partnership's timelines, the information needed for WHO to make an assessment will become available in late 2014, to allow possible recommendation for use in 2015, depending on the results. Vaccines that are currently licensed against human diseases are caused by either viruses or bacteria. Should RTS,S/AS01 be licensed, it will be the first ever licensed vaccine against a parasit ic disease in humans. RTS,S /AS01 would therefore be a novel health intervention. The role of WHO, as the United Nations health agency, is to fully assess its safety and effectiveness; WHO will recommend RTS,S /AS01 if and when all required conditions for such a recommendation have been met. The introduction of a new vaccine is a majo r public health and financial decision that needs to be thoroughly assessed. What is the difference between a WHO recommendation for use and WHO prequalification? A WHO policy recommendation is the global equivalent of a national public health authority's decision about use of vaccines. Many countries appreciate guidance from the WHO policy recommendation process on which vaccines they should seek to introduce in their national immunization programmes. Similarly, donor agencies, such as the GAVI Alliance, require a WHO recommendation for use before funding procurement of vaccines for developing countries. Before a WHO recommendation is made, the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy are reviewed by WHO technical expert groups and the risk/benefit to vaccinees in potential target countries is assessed. The role of new vaccines in the context of existing preventive and treatment measures plays a part in this assessment, as doe s cost -effectiveness. WHO prequalification ensures that a specific vaccine from a specific manufacturer meets international standards of quality, safety and efficacy and is appropriate for the target population. Only WHO prequalified vaccines can be supplied to countries through UN agencies. Malaria control measures What other interventions exist for malaria control? There are many effective interventions now available that can be used to reduce the burden of malaria in Africa. These include: prevention through mosquito vector control and use of long- lasting insecticidal bed-nets and , in some settings, indoor residual spraying with insecticides; seasonal malaria chemoprevention in some settings; intermittent preventive treatment for infants and during pregnancy; prompt diagnostic testing; and treatment of confirmed cases with effective anti-malarial medicines. These measures have dramatically lowered malaria disease burden in many African settings. The malaria disease burden can be lowered further by continuing to scale up WHO recommended control measures. Available malaria control measures represent some of the most cost-effective measures for public health. Page 361 4 4 The potential role of RTS,S/AS01 will be in addition to fully scaled-up access to and use of non- vaccine malaria preventive measures, prompt diagnostic testing and effective anti- malarial medicines. The need for high quality, safe and effective drugs to treat malaria will continue regardless of any deployment of a first-generation malaria vaccine such as RTS,S/AS01.
