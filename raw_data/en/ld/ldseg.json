This advance facilitated the develop- ment of novel, rational treatment options targeting terminal complement activation, e.g. , using an anti-C5 antibody (eculizumab). We review treatment and patient management issues related to this therapeutic approach. We present consen- sus clinical practice recommendations generated by HUS In- ternational, an international expert group of clinicians and basic scientists with a focused interest in HUS. We aim toaddress the following questions of high relevance to daily clinical practice: Which complement investigations should be done and when? What is the importance of anti-factor H antibody detection? Who should be treated with eculizumab? Is plasma exchange therap y still needed? When should eculizumab therapy be initiated? How and when should com- plement blockade be monitored? Can the approved treatment schedule be modified? What approach should be taken to kidney and/or combined liver -kidney transplantation? How should we limit the risk of meningococcal infection under C.

A pressing question today regards the treatment duration. We discuss the need for pro- spective studies to establish evidence-based criteria for thecontinuation or cessation of anticomplement therapy in pa- tients with and without identified complement mutations. Keywords Anti-factor H antibody .Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome .Thrombotic microangiopathy Major progress has been made since the early 2000s in the understanding of the pathophysiology of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and its treatment. In under a decade,complement alternative pathway (AP) dysregulation has emerged as the major cause of aHUS, responsible for 60 - 70 % of cases [ 1-4]. In addition, clinical characteristics and patient outcomes have been described and genotype- phenotype correlations established. This new knowledge has contributed to a more precise definition of aHUS, a term nowpreferentially reserved for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) without coexisting disease [ 3-8]. The genetic background of aHUS continues to unfold, and as an example, recently iden-tified mutations in the gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase (DGKE) [ 9] suggest that complement-independent forms of aHUS exist. Plasma therapy was the mainstay of treatment foraHUS until 2009, although controlled trials were lacking. Theguideline for the investigation and initial therapy in aHUS published by the European Pediatric Study Group for HUS in 2009, based on anecdotal case reports, retrospective seriesand expert consensus, advocated early, frequent and high- volume plasma exchanges (PE) [ 10]. The recently published audit of this guideline indicated considerable morbidity asso-ciated with plasma therapy in children [ 11]. Since 2009, four prospective trials and over 80 case reports have demonstrated that effective terminal complement blockade with eculizumabcan rescue native kidney function or allow successful kidney transplantation after renal loss due to aHUS [ 12-14]. Here we propose a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for pediatricpatients with aHUS in 2014. The availability of the tive anti-complement therapeutic agent, eculizumab, outlook of this often-dismal disease.However, its use in clinical practice raises important ques- tions, such as who should receive the drug, when to start such therapy, and is it safe to stop treatment once the disease iscontrolled. We are aware of the limitations of our recommen- dations in a world where clinician experience, diagnostic tools, and eculizumab availability vary between centers andcountries. The definition of atypical HUS Our group favors an etiology and pathophysiology-based clas- sification of the 1)[4-8,15-19]. Thrombotic thrombocyto- %)in ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with a ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, either due to congenital absence of functional protein or to the pres-ence of acquired anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, requiring dif- ferent and specific therapies. ADAMTS13 deficiency- associated TTP should no longer be classified as a variant ofaHUS, but as a differential diagnosis that has to be ruled out in patients suspected to have aHUS. Similarly, HUS caused by Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infec- tion and other specific infectious agents must be excluded before aHUS is diagnosed. However, until recent years, the aHUS acronym has been used variably to designate only HUSwithout a coexisting disease/condition, or any HUS not asso- ciated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency or STEC infection. This latter use of the term has resulted in the inclusion of \"secondary \"cases better explained by coexisting disease within aHUS cohorts. Illustrating this definitional heterogene-ity, one of the two series that analyzed phenotype -genotype correlations in aHUS patients included both secondary (17 % of cases) and non-secondary forms of HUS [ 1], while the other included only non-secondary forms [ 3]. The currently used definition is based on the emerging agreement among hema- tologists and nephrologists that the term aHUS should beV .

Van de Walle University Hospital Ghent, Ghent, Belgium HUS without coexisting disease [4-8]. There is an ongoing debate whether or not to limit the term aHUS to cases with dysregulation of the AP of comple-ment secondary to complement gene mutations or anti- complement factor H (CFH) antibodies. At present, definitive exclusion or confirmation of a complement-related ge-netic defect is time consuming and not ubiquitously possible. The following discussion and recommendations will therefore focus on the clinical management of chil-dren with aHUS without coexi sting disease or specific infection as defined above. Diagnosis of atypical HUS Biological assays to confirm the clinical diagnosis of aHUS In children, clinical presentation and baseline laboratory re- sults usually allow the diagnosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae , STEC and cobalamin C (cblC) defect-HUS or of TTP with a good degree of certainty to inform adequate treatment initiation (Table 1)[20-34]. Figure 2outlines con- firmatory investigations for each of the common differentialdiagnoses [ 35-47]. Commonly used ADAMTS13 activity assays are based the cleavage ADAMTS13 of thevon Willebrand Factor (VWF) substrate peptide containing cleavage and recognition site for VWF (Fret- VWF 73). These are commercially available and relativelyeasy to establish and give results within a few hours [ 40]. Results of different commercial kits show reasonable agree- ment with Fret-VWF73, with 80 -90 % concordance [ 41,42]. STEC infection should always be ruled out as soon as possible when aHUS is suspected, using stool culture and fecal PCR or immunologic assay for Stx [ 48]. In more than one-third of children with aHUS, diarrhea/gastroenteritis is the apparent trigger of onset. Initial biological sampling in any child with suspected aHUS, whatever their age, should includetesting (available in most university hospitals) for cblC defect (Fig. 2). Cases presenting with aHUS that are res- cued by hydroxocobalamin treatment appear to be at least as frequent in late-onset cblC defect as in neonatal forms [29-34]( T a b l e 1). Complement investigations in aHUS Sixty to 70 % of aHUS patients carry currently identifiable mutations in complement genes or anti-CFH antibodies that result in the loss of protection of endothelial cells and plateletsfrom complement attack and ultimately in TMA lesions [ 4, 49].

Approximately one-third of women with HELLP syndrome have a complement mutation [ 17]. Thirty percent of patients with de novo post-kidney transplant HUS have a complement mutation [ 18]. Eighty-six percent of women who have the first episode of HUS during pregnancy (mostly in the post-partum) have a complementmutation. Therefore, pr egnancy-HUS is classified as alternative complement pathway dysregulation -aHUS [ 19] Post-infectious Hereditary Autoimmune.

Table 3juxtaposes clinical features described in three subgroups of aHUS with pediatric onset: HUS with/without complement mutation, with anti-CFH antibody or DGKE mutation [ 3,9,50-59]. Most patients with HUS due to a complement mutation carry a heterozygous mutation. Due to variable penetrance, only 20 -30 % of patients report a fam- ily history of HUS [ 1,3]. Homozygous haplotypes (defined by five frequent ge- netic protein (MCP) (MCP ggaac) have been demonstrated to be significantly more fre- quent in patients with aHUS than in controls. Whiletheir role in the degree of penetrance of the disease is likely [ 59], their influence on the age at onset (pediatric versus adult) has not been demonstrated [ 3]. Some plas- minogen and ADAMTS13 variants may also have a predisposing role [ 60,61]. Lastly, 90 -95 % of patients with anti-CFH antibodies have a complete deficiency ofCFH -related proteins 1 (CFHR1) and 3 (CFHR3), due to a homozygous deletion of CFHR1 -R3[50-52,54, 62], a polymorphism carried by 2 -9 % of healthy peo- ple of European, 16 % of African, and 2%o fC h i n e s e descent [ 63]. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding DGKE, a protein of the lipid kinase family, which is expressed in the endothe- lium, platelets and podocytes, have been identified in an au- tosomal recessive form of aHUS occurring in the first year oflife [9,56,57]. The mechanism of HUS is most likely related to the activation of protein kinase C due to the loss of function of DGKE, leading to an upregulation of prothrombotic factorsand platelet activation [ 64]. Whether complement activation is indirectly involved in this form of aHUS, as suggested by decreased C3 levels in four of the 19 patients so farreported (three with an is olated DGKE mutation and one with a combined C3 variant), remains to be dem- onstrated [ 9,56,57].Rule out HUS with coexisting disease / condition Mostly bone marrow transplantation in children Anti-CFH antibodies and /or benefit from therapeutic complement blockade (eculizumab) reported in few cases of bone marrow transplantation - HUS (35-37).

ADAMTS13: A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase coli ;S t x :S x i nPediatr NephrolNormal C3, C4, CFH, and CFI plasma levels do not exclude the diagnosis of complement dependent -HUS and decreased C3 level can be observed at the acute phase of STEC-HUS andS. pneumoniae -HUS Decreased C3 levels are observed in only 30 -40 % of patients with aHUS [ 1,3,4,65]( T a b l e 3). Thus, a normal C3 level does not rule out a diagnosis of aHUS. A normal plasma C4concentration in the presence of a decreased C3 level suggests activation of the complement AP, as would a decreased factor B (CFB) concentration. Decreased CFH or complement factorI (CFI) plasma levels are observed in approximately 50 and 30 % of patients with mutated CFH orCFI,r e s p e c t i v e l y[ 3, 16]. Therefore, a normal CFH or CFI plasma level does not exclude a mutation in the corresponding gene. Recent data suggest that levels of C5a and soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9) are elevated at the acute phase of aHUS and may be biological markers to differentiate aHUS from TTP [ 66]. In- creased C5a and sC5b-9 plasma levels have been confirmed inapproximately half of aHUS patients during the acute phase of the disease and also during remission [ 67], while another group reported the normalization of complement activationproduct levels after remission, including sC5b-9 [ 68]. Thus further confirmation is required before these markers become part of routine clinical care.Of note, decreased C3 levels [ 38,39] and MCP expression (communication from author V. Fremeaux-Bacchi, unpub-lished) may be observed during the acute phase of STEC- HUS and S pneumoniae -HUS (Fig. 2). Anti-CFH antibody assay: a technique now standardized All patients with suspected aHUS should be tested for the presence of anti-CFH antibodies on blood samples collected before PE or plasma infusion (PI). A recent publication de- scribes the collaborative effort of 7 European laboratories tostandardize the detection and quantification of anti-CFH anti- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tech- nique [ 69]. It is hoped that similar initiatives will follow in other countries [ 53]. Assay results can be made available with- in a few days and guide treatment decisions. Anti-CFH anti-body titers at the acute phase (1,000 -50,000 Arbitrary Units (AU)/ml) (positive threshold 100 -150 AU/ml according to values in 50 and 90 normal plasma samples, respectively[50,52]), are inversely correlated with C3 levels. Who should undergo genetic screening, when and why?Genetic screening results are required in all patients for a number of reasons (Box 1). Although ideal, they are notTable 2 Frequency of complement and DGKE abnormalities according to age at onset in atypical HUS [3][ 1] Total Children Adults TotalaChildrenaAdultsa No. of patients 214 89 125 256 152 104 CFH (%) Homozygous Heterozygous27.5 1.8 25.721.3 6.513.5 5.6 7.86.4 0.8 5.67 9.2 3.8 CFI (%) 8.4 6.7 9.6 3.9 2.6 5.7 C3 (%) 8.4 7.8 8.8 4.6 3.9 5.7CFB (%) 1.4 1 2.4 0.4Anti-CFH antibodies (%) 6.5 11 3.2 3.1 3.9 1.9THBD (%) 0 0 0 5 7.8 0.9Combined (%) 4.2 3.4 4.8 3 Complement-mediated (%) 65.7 64.7 67.2 52.3 53 43 DGKE (%) 3.2 7.9 0No identified abnormality (%) 31.1 27.4 32.8 47.7 47 57 CFB: complement factor B; CFH: documentedNumber in brackets: reference numberPediatr Nephrolavailable immediately and can therefore not inform immediate therapeutic decisions. Mutations in 6 genes have been associ- ated with sequencing. Combined mutations are found in3-6%[ patients with aHUS. Multiplex ligation- dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is required to detect hybrid CFH genes (5 % of patients) and copy number varia-tions in the genes encoding CFH and CFH-related (CFHRs) proteins [ 3,4]. Lastly, screening for DGKE mutation should be performed in children with onset of aHUS before the age of1-2y e a r s[ 9,56,57], although the age of screening may need to increase if case reports suggest DGKE mutations in older individuals with aHUS.Next-generation sequencing analysis allows the si- multaneous study of all potentially relevant genes. It has the potential to accelerate the diagnostic process and decrease the costs of genetic analysis. The use of exome sequencing, which has been successfully appliedto identify HUS-causing mutations in the DGKE gene [9] is still limited to research laboratories. Due to low penetrance of the disease (only 50 % of family members carrying the same complement mutation as the propositus will have the disease), genetic screen- i n gi sn o tr e c o m m e n d e di ns i b l i n g s / f a m i l ym e m b e r so fapatient with a heterozygous complement mutation.

One patient had C3 level just below normal value [ 9]. Decreased C3 levels were also observed in two siblings with isolated DGKE mutation [ 56] and one patient with an associated C3 variant [ 57] dThe association of homozygous or compound heterozygous MCP mutation with common variable immunodeficiency has been reported [ 58]. Patients with homozygous/compound heterozygous MCP mutation should be investigated for immunodeficiency as they may have frequent relapses triggered by infections and require immunoglobulin therapy to prevent infections and thus HUS relapses. In patients with MCP mutation, the presence of mutations in other genes increases the risk of progression to ESRD compared to patients with isolated MCP mutation (50 vs. 19 % within 3 years from onset, respectively [ 59])Pediatr NephrolShould patients with anti-CFH antibodies be screened for complement mutations? This question has been raised after Moore et al. reported se- quence variants in complement genes in five of 13 patients with anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS [ 62]. In another se- ries, no complement mutation was found in 26 patients with anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS [ 50]. The current recom- mendation is to perform genetic analyses even when anti-CFHantibodies are present. If a mutation is identified in a patient with anti-CFH antibodies, the therapeutic management should be decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on the antibodytiter and the functional consequences of the mutation. Treatment options in the pre-complement blockade treatment era Plasma exchange/plasma infusion: uncertain benefit and a high rate of technique-related complications in children The European Pediatric Study Group for HUS published a guideline in 2009 advocating early (within 24 h) and intensivePE during the first month of diagnosis [ 10]. A recent audit of the effects of this guideline analyzing 71 patients treated for aHUS between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2010 inEuropean or North American university hospitals [ 11]r e - vealed that 51 children received plasma therapy through a central venous catheter. Sixteen children (31 %) experienced17 catheter-related complications (infection in eight, thrombosis/ischemia in four, hemorrhage in two, chylothorax in one). Eight patients became sensitized to plasma compo-nents leading to therapy withdrawal in one case. This con- firmed that despite technical improvements in the procedure, PE in children continues to be fraught with complications.Although the audit was not designed to measure treatment efficacy, outcome at day 33 suggested limited efficacy of plas- ma therapy on renal outcome [ 11]. A dozen case reports \u2014 mostly of children with CFH mutations \u2014showed that early plasma therapy, generally consisting of daily PE until platelet count, hemolysis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by mainte- nance PE/PI, could prevent relapses and preserve renal func-tion at follow-up, for up to 6 years [ 5,16,48]. However, although plasma therapy allowed complete or partial remis- sion (hematologic remission with renal sequelae) in 78 % ofaHUS episodes in children and 53 % in adults in the Italian cohort, 48 % of children and 67 % of adults had died or reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at 3-year follow-up[1]. Progression to ESRD during the first episode of aHUS was similar in children and adults with CFH mutation who received high-intensity plasma therapy compared to thoseWhen Why- First episode of aHUS: Start genetic screeni ng after confirmation that there is no causative disease, no STEC infection, no severe ADAMTS 13 deficiency and no hyperhomocysteinemia /methyl-malonic aciduria. - Start genetic screening without delay if Relapse of HUS Familial history of non synchronous HUS Pregnancy/post-partum-HUS De novo post-transplant HUS - Genetic screening required before kidney transplantation for aHUS.

ADAMTS13: A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with of PE/PI in DGKE-HUS is un- certain [ 9,56,57]. Kidney transplantation The overall rate of post-transplant recurrence in aHUS in the pre-C5 blockade therapy era was 60 % [ 1,70] and graft sur- vival was 30 % at 5 years follow-up in patients with recur- rence compared to 68 % in those without recurrence [ 70]. Forty-three percent of recurrences occurred during the first month and 70 % within the year after transplantation. Eightypercent of patients who had lost a prior graft from recurrence had recurrence after re-transplantation. The predominant inde- pendent risk factor for recurrence was the presence of a com-plement mutation. The risk was highest (approximately 80 %) in patients with CFH ,C3orCFB mutations, and approximate- ly 50 % in patients with CFImutation, compared to approxi- mately 20 % in patients with no identified complement muta- tion [ 70]. The risk of post-transplant recurrence in patients with MCP mutation has been shown to be low (<10 %) if the mutation was isolated (the graft expresses the non- mutated MCP protein), while it was approximately 30 % if theMCP mutation was associated with a CFH ,CFI,o rC3 mutation [ 59]. No post-transplant recurrence has been ob- served to date in three patients with DGKE mutation [ 9]. The recurrence risk is low in anti-CFH antibody-associatedHUS if the antibody titer is low (<500 -1,000 AU/ml) at the time of transplantation, while substantial if elevated [ 50,54, 62,71,72]. One patient with a THBD mutation has been reported to have post-transplant recurrence [ 73]. PE/PI for post-transplant recurrence generally failed to pre- vent graft loss [ 1,70]. Therefore prophylactic PE/PI (started just before transplantation) was recommended [ 74]. The effi- cacy of this strategy is not well documented. However, nine patients who received prophylactic PE/PI had a significantlyhigher graft survival rate free of recurrence than 62 patients without prophylactic PE/PI [ 70]. Terminal complement blockade treatment humanized anti-C5 antibody, pre- vents C5 cleavage and the of C5a and C5b-9, the C5a pro-inflammatory and the C5b-9 pro-throm- botic consequences of complement activation [ 12]. We are aware of approximately 180 aHUS patients treated witheculizumab reported in the literature, including 100 patients treated within four prospective, open-label, single-arm trials conducted by Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Eculizumab is ap- proved for the treatment of aHUS in many countries, includ- ing the European Union and the USA [ 75,76]. Recommended dosing regimen is indicated in Table 4.Prospective trials of eculizumab in patients with aHUS Table 5summarizes the trials 'designs, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the patients 'baseline characteristics, and Table 6 provides the primary efficacy endpoints and results [ 13, 77-81]. Results of the first two trials are published [ 13,77]. Only preliminary data are available for the subsequent trials(Abstracts, [ 78-81]). In trial 1 comprising 17 adult and adolescent patients with persistent TMA resistant to PE/PI, platelet count normalized7d a y s( m e d i a n ;r a n g e ,1 -218 days) and LDH activity 14 days (range, 0 -56 days) after the first dose of eculizumab. Remis- sion of hematological disease activity (platelet count, cessa-tion of hemolysis; see definition in Table 6) was maintained over the duration of the treatment (median 2 years) in 88 % of patients. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) im-proved by 32 ml/min/1.73 ml/min/1.73 m2)a 6w e e k s( p=0.001 versus baseline eGFR). The gain in eGFR was maintained over the treatment period. The extent of eGFR improvement correlated with shorter time to eculizumab initiation ( p=0.009). Only 12 % of patients (2/17) received chronic dialysis after a median of 2 years treatment duration [ 13,77]. Gains in eGFR were less in transplanted than in non-transplanted patients (14.8\u00b118.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2versus 48.3\u00b138.4), but earlier treatment initiation correlated with greater gain in eGFR in transplanted similar to non-transplanted patients [ 78]. In trial 2 comprising 20 adult and adolescent patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who switched to eculizumab after long-term PE/PI, 95 % of patients maintained hematologic remission andTable 4 Recommended eculizumab dosing regimen for patients with atypical HUS (aHUS) Patient body weight Induction regimen Maintenance regimen 40 kg and over 900 mg weekly x 4d o s e s1,200 mg at week 5; then 1,200 mg every 2w e e k s 30 kg to less than 40 kg 600 mg weekly x 2d o s e s900 mg at week 3; then 900 mg every 2w e e k s 20 kg to less than 30 kg 600 mg weekly x 2d o s e s600 mg at week 3; then 600 mg every 2w e e k s 10 kg to less than 20 kg 600 mg weekly x 1d o s e300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 2w e e k s 5k gt ol e s st h a n1 0k g 3 0 0m gw e e k l yx 1d o s e300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 3w e e k s The listed dosing regimen is from the product label [ 75,76] specified by the manufacturer.

Mean (95 % CI) gain in eGFR was only 6 (3 -9) ml/min/1.73 m2at However, eGFR gain wasmaintained after 2 years of continued treatment and correlated with shorter delay from onset of HUS episode to treatment initiation [ 13,77]. In both trials, patients with or without iden- tified complement abnormalities similarly met criteria for TMA event-free status and complete TMA response at the 1 and 2-year cut-offs [ 13,77]. Two subsequent trials comprised 22 children and 41 adults, respectively. Both trials allowed early treatment initiation (brief screening period, no obligation for the patient to receive plas-ma therapy). Fifty-five percent of children received eculizumab as first-line therapy without prior PE/PI, compared to 15 % of adults. Complete TMA response with improvedrenal function (see definition in Table 6) was maintained after 26 weeks of treatment in 64 % of children [ 79], while 80 % of adult patients had complete TMA response with preservedrenal function (see definition in Table 6) over 1 year treatment duration [ 80]. Renal function recovery was greater in thepediatric compared to the adult cohort (64 ml/min/1.73 m 2 versus 29.3 ml/min/1.73 m2at week 26, respectively). Only 9 % (2/22) of children and 12 % (5/41) of adults required dialysis at 26 weeks and 1 year of continued eculizumab thera-py, respectively [ 79,80]. As observed in trial 1, mean gains in eGFR were less in transplanted than in non-transplanted adult patients (19.0\u00b127.3 ml/min/1.73 m 2versus 31.5\u00b122.8) [ 81]. The systematic review of the first two trials by the Adviso- ry Group for National Specialized Services in the UK con- cluded that these studies indicated eculizumab was highlyeffective in patients with aHUS, despite study design limita- tions, including the possibility of a biased selection, the lack of control groups and the use of surrogate markers [ 82]. Trials 3 and 4 have the same limitations. The fact that only 40 -45 % of patients in trials 3 and 4 had a complement abnormality, com- pared to 65 % in recently published cohorts [ 3]a n d7 0 -75 % in trials 1 and 2, raises the question of whether a few adult patients with secondary HUS or children with STEC-HUS (negative, inadequate, or non-documented STEC/Stx-assays)might have been included. Due to the limited number of pa- tients in trial 3, no statistical comparisons could be performedTable 6 Efficacy of eculizumab in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Finally, the \"best of all \"recovery of renal function ob- served in children may have been due to early treatment initi-ation and/or a greater ability of pediatric kidneys to recover from TMA. However, results in trial 3 may have been biased by a few misclassified STEC-HUS cases, the high proportionof children without a complement abnormality or the lower proportion of children with post-transplant HUS compared to adults in trials 1 and 2. Despite these limitations, the four trialsoverall indicate that eculizumab is effective to stop the TMA process in patients with aHUS, allowing sustained remission of the disease and improved or preserved renal function in themajority of patients, including those resistant to PE/PI. Results also suggest that an early switch from PE/PI to eculizumab or the use of eculizumab as initial therapy may increase thechance of full recovery of renal function. Except for the oc- currence of meningococcal meningitis in two of the 100 pa- tients who entered these trials [ 80], treatment was well toler- ated, with no treatment emergent adverse events. Case reports of eculizumab to treat aHUS involving native kidneys Among approximately 35 case reports of non-transplanted patients who received eculizumab to treat aHUS (cases with anti-CFH antibodies not included), 19 described children (me- dian age 1.5 years (range, 11 days -11 years), 9 aged 1y e a r ; 83 % (15/18 documented) with 13 (66 %) requiring dialysis at baseline; 12 PE/PI-resistant and 2 PE/PI-dependent; first-line eculizumab in 5; median delay to eculizumab initiation, 19 (range, <1 - 225) days. After a median follow-up of 13 (range, 2.5 -42) months of eculizumab therapy, all patients demonstrated sustained hematologic remission, only one out of 19 (5 %) received chronic dialysis and the median serum creatininelevel was 43 (20 -90)mol/l in the remaining 18 children [12,55,83-92]. These results in children with severe forms of aHUS reinforce those of the prospective pediatric trialdiscussed above. In a recent series, the outcome of 19 eculizumab-treated adults was compared with that of paired historical controls treated only with PE/PI (63 % of cases). At 3-month follow-up, 17 % of the eculizumab group and 46 % of the \"conventional therapy \"group had reached ESRD ( p= 0.02). The ESRD rate was 25 and 63 % respectively, at 1-year follow-up ( p=0.04). Patients treated with eculizumab within 6 days of onset tended to have lower final serum creatininelevels than those treated later [ 93]. Of note, no benefit from eculizumab treatment was demonstrated in seven patients with isolated DGKE mutation [ 9], while the benefit wasuncertain \u2014clinical improvement but persistent proteinuria \u2014 in one patient with an associated C3 variant [ 57]. The efficacy of eculizumab in DGKE mutation-associated HUS needs to be studied in a larger number of patients. Case reports of eculizumab to treat or prevent post-transplant recurrence of aHUS Most of the 17 patients treated for post-transplant recurrence outside of prospective trials were adults who carried high-risk mutations and/or had lost prior grafts due to recurrence [ 71, 73,94-96]. Shorter interval between the onset of recurrence and treatment initiation was correlated with greater gain of graft function [ 71]. However, similar to transplanted patients included in prospective trials, many patients did not reach fullreturn of graft function. This may be related in part to a variety of factors \u2014predominantly ischemia-reperfusion injury \u2014that induce endothelial damage in the graft and activate comple-ment locally, particularly during the early post-transplant pe- riod and with more deleterious consequences in patients with preexisting complement dysregulation [ 97]. Prophylactic eculizumab treatment has been reported in 13 patients at high risk of post-transplant recurrence (previous grafts lost due to recurrence, 5/ 5; genetic CFI mutation), 13/13) [ 71,98-101]. The schedule used for the prevention of humoral rejection in highly sensitized patients, consisted of a first dose a few hoursbefore surgery and a second dose within the next 24 h, followed by standard recommended eculizumab dosing. Three patients received one PE before the pre-operative eculizumab dose(s).In three patients scheduled for living-donor transplantation and one on the urgent list for a deceased donor graft, eculizumab treatment was initiated 1 and 3 weeks before surgery, respec- tively [ 71,98,99]. Except for one patient with technically in- duced arterial graft thrombosis, w ho was ultimately successful- ly under prophylactic eculizumab therapy (communication of M. Hourmant, Nantes, France), all patients experienced a recurrence-free pos t-transplant course under con- tinued eculizumab creatinine level 72\u00b1 36mol/l at median follow-up of 17.5 (range, 2 -39) months. The risk of meningococcal infection under eculizumab Immunity against Neisseria meningitis depends on the lytic terminal complement complex C5b-9. The incidence of me- ningococcal infections in patients with congenital complete deficiency in terminal complement factors is 0.5 % per year,a relative risk of 5,000 compared to the normal population [102]. Prevention of meningococcal infection is therefore cru- cial in eculizumab-treated patients, vaccination andantibiotic 2)[103-106]. The tetravalent conjugated vaccines protect against serogroups A, C, W135 and Y, but not against serogroup B which predominates inPediatr NephrolEuropean countries, North America, Australia and New Zealand. While a vaccine against N. meningitis Bi sn o w available in some countries (Bexsero), data on its clinical ef- ficacy and duration of protection under complement blockade are still pending. Despite vaccination, the incidence of inva-sive meningococcal infection has been approximately 0.5 per 100 patient-years in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal he- moglobinuria (PNH) treated with eculizumab [ 107]. Two of the 100 aHUS patients treated within protocols [ 80] and one among approximately 80 case reports [ 106] had invasive me- ningococcal infection despite being vaccinated. However thelatter patient had been vaccinated using the polysaccharide vaccine. Neither vaccines nor antibioprophylaxis guarantee full protection, hence the importance of patient/family educa-tion on signs of meningococcal infection and of an informa- tion card to be carried by patients or their care-giver (Box 2). Clinical practice recommendations for patients with atypical HUS in 2014 What should be first-line treatment and when should it be started in a child with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS? For children with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS, we propose eculizumab as first-line treatment, to avoid PE and the com- plications of central venous double line catheters. In suchcases, confirmation of a complement mutation is not required prior to treatment initiation. Based on the reviewed literature,undue treatment delay may affect ultimate renal recovery and increase the risk of early progression to ESRD [ 13,77,93]. When possible, eculizumab treatment should be initiated with-in 24 -48 h of onset or admission. If eculizumab is not (or not immediately) available, PE (or PI if PE is not possible) should be started as recommended in the 2009 guideline [ 10]. While the indication of complement blockade treatment is not limited to aHUS patients with a confirmed complement mutation as this treatment is also effective in patients withoutcomplement mutation, genetic screening is required for the longer-term management of patients. Anti-CFH antibody test- ing is the only complement investigation urgently needed dur-ing the acute phase, as a positive result raises additional treat- ment options. Treatment of anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS: an area for future studies The first large series of patients with anti-CFH antibody-asso- ciated HUS treated mostly with PE without immunosuppres- sants reported a poor outcome including death in 9 %, relapses in 58 %, CKD in 39 % and ESRD in 27 % after a mean follow-up of 39 (range, 1 -168) months (Table 3)[50]. However, in a recent cohort of children with this form of aHUS who were treated early with PE, immunosuppressants and corticosteroids,Meningococcal vaccinationMeningococcal vaccination is mandatory, before eculizumab initiation or as soon as possible if urgent eculizumab therapy is indicated Quadrivalent conjugate vaccines (anti-A, C, Y, W) (MenactraTM Recent studies showed that Menveo\u00ae was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in healthy infants aged 2 to 12 months (103,104)a + Anti-B vaccine where available Efficacy of anti-meningococcal (vaccine) antibodies is uncertain in patients with complement de ficiency, complement blockade or immunosuppressive therapy. We therefore recommend additional antibiotic prophylaxis, allowing prompt initiation of eculizumab. Patients with ESRD due to aHUS should be vaccinated prior to re gistration on the waiting list (105,106). Also consider vaccinati on of household close contacts (at least siblings and parents)b.AntibioprophylaxisWhich antibiotics? Methylpenicillin (twice daily, full dose adapted to weight). Despite the reduced sensitivity of approximately 20% of meningococ ci towards penicillin, methylpenicillin retains its overall efficacy to prevent meningococcal infection. Macrolides in case of allergy to penicillin (however macrolides interfere with calcineurin inhibitors metabolism in transplante d patients) Avoid rifampicine or fluoroquinolone for long term prophylaxis, to limit the risk of inducing bacterial resistance (except in c ase of contact with a patient with invasive meningococcal infection) Other antibiotics may be recommended by local experts Which duration? Obligatory during 2 weeks after vaccination in patients receiving eculizumab Obligatory in some countries (France, UK) as long as the patient receives eculizumab (+ 60 days after eculizumab discontinuatio n) Discrepant current practice in other countries Continuous antibioprophylaxis is recommended by the majority of authors of this reviewEducation Information cardEducation on signs of meningococcal infection to ensure early recognition and treatment Consider prescription of ceftriaxone for immediate access at home in remote areas Travel/holidays should be carefully prepared (information on meningococcal epidemiology in the visited country, prior written c ontact with local teams, information to the patient of where to go, which doctor/department/phone numbers...) Information card to be carried by the patient or his/her care giver, to be shown to medical staff in case of symptoms suggesting infection Box 2 Prevention of meningococcal infection in patients treated with eculizumab. a. No official recommendation has been given for its use in children younger than 2 years of age b. Carriage rate of meningococci isthe highest in adolescents and young adults (up to 30 % between age 16 and 24)Pediatr Nephroloutcome was much more favorable, similar to that of MCP- HUS [ 3]. Another report of 138 Indian children with anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS confirmed that combined PE andimmunosuppression (oral prednisolone with cyclophospha- mide or rituximab in 77 % of patients) reduced antibody titer to1,000 AU at a median of 32 (interquartile range, 11 -84) days [ 52]. This was associated with hematological remission and significant reduction of adverse outcomes (defined as eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m 2or death) by the combined therapy, from 71 to 33 % after a mean follow-up 14.5 (range, 3 -95) months. Anti-CFH antibody titer and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)or azathioprine. Using a threshold of > 2000 AU/ml [ 50,52] significantly increased the probability of a relapse-free surviv- al, from 46 to 87 % at last follow-up [ 52]. Four patients have been reported who went into remission after a short cyclophos- phamide pulse therapy (0.5 g/1.73 m 2\u00d7 2 in three patients, 1 g/ 1.73 m2\u00d7 5 in one patient resistant to PE + rituximab) com- bined with PE and prednisone, and had full renal recovery up to 6 years, 4 years, and 4 months without any maintenance ther- apy [ 108]. Although experience is limited, eculizumab appears to be effective in anti-CFH antibody-HUS [ 93,109-111]. However, eculizumab is not expected to inhibit anti-CFH anti- body production and a spontaneous decline in anti-CFH anti- bodies is rare [ 50]. Lastly, eculizumab should be considered in patients with acute, severe injury of vital organs, such as brainand heart due to this form of HUS [ 110]. Figure 3proposes a practical treatment algorithm. However, additional studies arerequired to establish the respective place eculizumab, PE, antibody-associated HUS. What should be first-line treatment and when should it be started when presentation is incomplete or uncommonor the diagnosis uncertain? Some children with aHUS do not present with the full triad of HUS, as they may not be thrombocytopenic (15 %) or anemic (6 %) or they may have preserved renal function initially (17 %) [ 3,112]. Rarely, patients may present with heavy pro- teinuria and anemia without thrombocytopenia, or severe hy- pertension with or without hematological abnormalities or re- nal impairment. Kidney biopsy is useful in such cases to con-firm TMA lesions (thrombi, capillary walls thickening with double contours) [ 6,7,12]. differ- entiation between STEC-HUS, TTP, cblC defect-HUS andaHUS may be difficult, and initial treatment will rely on the clinician 's judgment. Rapid results of confirmatory assays should prevent undue delay of the best-treatment decision. Up to 30 % of typical/post-diarrheal HUS cases may not be confirmed as STEC-positive by stool culture, Stx detection or serological (anti-lipopolysaccharide antibodies antibody) as-says [ 26-28]. In such cases, the clinical diagnosis of presumed STEC-HUS entails supportive treatment only. The role of eculizumab in STEC-HUS is beyond the scope of this reviewand needs assessing in a clinical trial setting. First episode of aHUS Eculizumab (or PE if eculizumab not available) within 24-48 hours after onset Positive for anti-CFH antibodies Severe extra-renal manifestations Consider combining PE with eculizumaba + cyclophosphamide pulses or rituximab + corticosteroids No or mild extra-renal to or PE antibody < 1000 AU/mlb Maintenance treatment with MMF + corticosteroids, guided by anti-CFH antibody titer Continue eculizumab Consider adding corticosteroids and/or MMF in attempt to reduce antibody titer Efficiency / benefits to be established Consider treatment withdrawal after 1 year in patients with stabilized remission of HUS, anti-CFH antibod y titer < 1000 AU/mlband normal C3 Further studies are required to document wh ich option is the best for which patient Fig. 3 Proposed treatment algorithm for anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS. aAs PE clears eculizumab from the circulation, eculizumab has to be reinfused at the end of each PE. bThe titer required corticosteroids \u00b1 rituximab, and treatment of congen- ital TTP is PI 10 ml/kg that suffices to induce remission. Thedemonstration of complement activation in TTP [ 113-117] does not suffice to propose eculizumab as an alternative treat- ment [ 5-8]. The single adult patient with TTP resistant to PE and all current medications who went into remission under eculizumab [ 118] was subsequently found to have anti-CFH antibodies and no severe ADAMTS13 deficiency despite hav-ing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies [ 119]. This association, also reported in one child [ 11], suggests that screening for anti- CFH antibody might be indicated in children with antibody-associated TTP or whenever TTP does not respond to standard treatment. If first-line treatment has been PE or PI in a patient with aHUS, should the patient be offered eculizumab? In children who have commenced PE or PI as first-line thera- py during the acute phase, we propose a switch to eculizumabwhen the diagnosis of aHUS is established. Exceptions to this recommendation would be patients who have anti-CFH anti- bodies (Fig. 3). We also propose that patients who fail to respond to plasma therapy be switched to eculizumab: the patient who, after approximately five daily PE/PI has no con-stant upward trend of platelet count (particularly if the platelet count remains <150 \u00d7 10 9/l), or is without a constant down- ward trend of LDH level (particularly if LDH remains > upperlimit of normal (ULN)), or has no significant decrease (at a minimum 25 % decrease) in serum creatinine should be switched to eculizumab [ 7,12]. Our recommendation is based on the data which suggests that this offers the patient the best chance of optimal recovery of renal function. The an- swer is more difficult for patients on long-term plasmatherapy. Pragmatically, there is no reason to change therapy in patients who have full remission and normal renal function (eGFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m 2, no protein- uria, no hematuria, no hypertension requiring multi-drug therapy) under a schedule of PE/PI compatible with their daily activity, without catheter-bound complicationsor plasma intolerance. Conversely, the switch to eculizumab should be considered if any sign of subclin- ical hemolytic activity (LDH > ULN, haptoglobin <lower limit of normal (LLN)) or renal TMA (isolated proteinuria or slowly increasing serum creatinine level with active TMA confirmed at renal biopsy) appears[120]. This also applies for patients with normalized hematologic markers of TMA but residual CKD under long-term PE/PI therapy [ 13,77]. Extra-renal manifesta- tions of TMA (neurologic, cardiac, vascular, among others) are another reason to switch the patient from PE/PI to eculizumab.Is eculizumab effective for the treatment of extra-renal manifestations of aHUS? Experience in this domain is limited. However, eculizumab was impressively effective in two children with life- threatening aHUS and acute distal ischemia (digital gangrene)[55] and skin necrosis with intestinal perforation [ 121], and two adults with ulcerative skin lesions [ 122]. That eculizumab may be efficacious to rescue central nervous system involve-ment is suggested by nine case reports, including four in chil- dren [ 87,90,110,123-127]. Eculizumab also appeared life- saving in four children with myocardial involvement [ 83,90, 92,110]. The reports of four children who developed cerebral ischemic events due to stenosis of cerebral arteries after sev- eral years on dialysis have suggested that local complementactivation added to the vascular consequences of long-term dialysis may lead to such macrovascular complications [ 101, 128-130]. Two of these patients stopped having ischemic events under eculizumab therapy, with non-progression of ar- terial stenoses documented in one [ 101,129]. In dialyzed patients, when is it too late to start or useless to maintain eculizumab treatment in order to rescue renal function? The answer to this question is not well supported by evidence. We are aware of two patients who started eculizumab after 90and 225 days on dialysis and did not recover renal function [ 55, 131], but also of two patients who recovered normal [ 132]o r nearly normal [ 133] serum creatinine levels despite eculizumab initiation after 4 and 3.5 months on dialysis, respectively. Therefore eculizumab treatment is reasonable to consider for patients requiring dialysis for 3 -4 months or even more and should be maintained for at least 3 -6 months before concluding there has been no benefit. A kidney biopsy may be useful forthe decision of eculizumab initiation or maintenance in patients requiring dialysis for approximately 3 months, according to the presence of active TMA lesions suggesting therapy initiation,or diffuse irreversible sclerotic/fibrotic ischemic lesions, for which eculizumab would not be expected to be helpful. In patients on long-term dialysis, is it justified to maintain eculizumab treatment to prevent potential cerebral, cardiac, or macrovascular complications of aHUS? In our opinion, there is insufficient evidence to answer this question. Studies are required to document the frequency oflarge artery involvement and cerebro/cardio-vascular compli- cations in aHUS patients compared to patients on chronic dialysis for other reasons [ 134 ]. Alternatively, any new or ongoing vascular manifestation justifies complement blockade therapy when no other cause than the TMA process is identified.Pediatr NephrolIs it necessary to check that complement blockade is complete in patients under eculizumab? Which biological assays are available for that? Our recommendations here are based on data from the pro- spective studies reviewed earlier. Complement blockade isobtained within 1 h after the first dose [ 13]. Most patients under recommended treatment schedules (doses and intervals according to weight in children) (Table 4) have full comple- ment blockade between doses. Assessment of complement blockade may be justified at day 7, just before the second dose. If complement blockade is not obtained, identificationof the cause of incomplete blockade is needed. It may be due to insufficient dose, especially in children slightly below a weight requiring a higher dose. Another rare reason is leakageof the drug into the urine in the case of massive proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome, as observed in rare cases of aHUS. Lastly, non-blockade of complement despite appropriate doseof eculizumab may have a genetic explanation, such as the recently reported C5 variant which prevents the binding of eculizumab to C5. This C5 polymorphism (also found in thenormal Japanese population) has been identified in Japanese and Asian-origin patients with PNH who were resistant to eculizumab [ 135]. This variant might have to be considered in aHUS patients of Japanese or Asian origin with comple- ment non-blockade under eculizumab and/or a poor responseto eculizumab. For the long term, checking whether comple- ment blockade is maintained is unnecessary except if there are clinical concerns, particularly in situations known to triggercomplement activation, such as infection, immunization, elec- tive surgery, kidney transplantation or pregnancy and post- partum period. Checking complement blockade is also neces-sary in situations of apparent resistance to eculizumab, includ- ing full-blown relapses, but also when abnormalities occur in the platelet counts, LDH and/or haptoglobin levels when pre-viously normalized, or if a progressive increase in proteinuria or serum creatinine is observed, especially if renal biopsy shows signs of ongoing TMA. Checking the resolution ofcomplement blockade after eculizumab withdrawal may also be useful to decide when antibioprophylaxis can be stopped. The current available markers of complement blockade used to monitor eculizumab treatment are a CH50 or other hemolytic-based assays or the Wieslab Complement System [136]. A CH50 is the most available. Eculizumab treatment is expected to suppress CH50 activity, i.e., CH50 < 10 % of normal value. A relevant limitation is that CH50 cannot be used in patients with complete CFH deficiency (homozygousCFH mutation) in whom CH50 levels are permanently unde- tectable. Based on the site of action of eculizumab, a low C3 level such as seen in some mutations is not expected to nor-malize under eculizumab. Soluble C5b-9 plasma levels re- main detectable or increased in aHUS patients treated with eculizumab [ 67,88] and therefore cannot be recommendedto monitor the efficacy of eculizumab in clinical practice. Published data on the correlation between eculizumab trough levels and complement blockade, although limited, suggestthat eculizumab trough levels at or over 100 g/ml markedly reduce CH50 activity, while levels below 50 g/ml do not [107]. Notwithstanding their limited availability, eculizumab levels currently appear to provide an optimal way to monitor eculizumab treatment, when indicated. However, data on the relationship between drug levels and complement activity inaHUS patients are still required. Note that the majority of patients treated within the prospective trials according to the protocol schedule had suppression of CH50 activity andeculizumab trough levels 150g/ml [ 13]. In a patient in remission of aHUS under eculizumab, can the interval between doses be increased? The current treatment paradigm is that permanent C5 blockade with eculizumab should be maintained in aHUS patients to prevent relapses and reactivation of the renal TMA process. Therefore, increasing the interval between doses (or decreas-ing dose) should be considered only in patients who maintain CH50 activity <10 % despite longer intervals or lower doses, as recently reported [ 136]. The concomitant evaluation of trough levels of the drug will be very useful to guide modifi- cations of treatment schedule. In common clinical practice, lengthening the time between doses or decreasing the dosewithout confirming complement blockade will likely precipi- tate periods of inadequate complement blockade. In our opin- ion, it is more rational either to treat or stop treating, ratherthan provoking a sinusoidal coverage regimen. Notice that failure to maintain C5 blockade may not immediately induce a risk of relapse or reactivation of the renal TMA process. What duration of eculizumab treatment for aHUS in patients with their native kidneys, but not on maintenance dialysis? The 2014 issues of the Summary of Product Characteristics of the European Commission [ 75] and of the Full Prescribing Information of the Food and Drug Administration [ 76]d o not take position on treatment duration. They inform on the risk of relapse after discontinuation and how to cope with it. Reasons to reconsider the hitherto recommended \"life long treatment \"for all patients have emerged progressively and are summarized in Box 3.E x p e r i e n c ew i t he c u l i z u m a bw i t h d r a w - al today is limited. No data is published about the patients treated within the prospective trials who stopped treatment.In the early eculizumab era, three patients who received a single dose all had relapse of HUS after 1 to 2 months [ 83, 137,138]. A single dose regimen should no longer be consid- ered. As indicated in Table 7[84,87,93,125-127,139-142], three of four patients with a CFH mutation had relapse of HUS after eculizumab withdrawal. Early eculizumab re-initiationPediatr Nephrolallowed remission and rescue of renal function in all patients, but one of them required 3 weeks dialysis despite being re-treated within 3 days of relapse onset [ 139]. Conversely, the risk of relapse after eculizumab withdrawal seems to be lower in patients with isolated CFIorMCP mutation or no mutation identified. Last, as expected, the risk of relapse in anti-CFH antibody-associated HUS depends on the antibody titer. In summary, although limited, current published experience sug-gests caution when considering discontinuation of treatment in patients with CFH mutation. On the other hand, withdrawal after a few months of full recovery appears reasonable in chil-dren with an isolated MCP mutation, possibly also in those with isolated CFI mutations, no mutation identified or a rare variant of unknown functional consequences. The majority of the authors of this review agree that children with MCP mu- tations should be treated with eculizumab during acute epi-sodes, because an untreated episode can result in ESRD (17 % of children after a median follow-up of 5 years) [ 3]( T a b l e 3, row 4). Preventing ESRD in one out of five children is nottrivial. Possible exceptions to this recommendation could be children with mild renal impairment during acute episodes, long intervals (>1 year) between episodes and/or isolated het-erozygous MCP mutation [ 59]. In practice, prospective studies under strict monitoring, in- volving patients with and without mutations, are required toestablish whether treatment withdrawal is feasible and safe, in which patients and when. In our opinion, withdrawal shouldnot be considered in patients who had life-threatening initial presentation or relapses (e.g., severe neurologic manifesta- tions, myocardial failure) or in children who did not fullyrecover normal renal function. Except for children with MCP mutations, withdrawal should probably be postponed until the child is more than 3 to 5 years old, the age whenseasonal infections, which may trigger relapse, become less frequent. Kidney transplantation for patients with atypical HUS in 2014 Choice of the donor and practical issues for the prevention of atypical HUS recurrence after kidney transplantation As indicated above, the risk of post-transplant recurrence is mostly determined by genetics and, in patients with anti-CFH antibodies, the anti-CFH antibody titer. Complete genetic screening and anti-CFH antibody assay are required beforelisting the patient for kidney transplantation. However, a few aHUS patients at high risk of post-transplant recurrence (e.g., hybrid CFH and/or prior graft lost after recurrence) did wellBox 3 Reasons to reconsider the r ecommendation of life-long complement blockade treatment for all patients after a first episode ofatypical HUS involving native (CD46)Pediatr Outcome according to complement anomaly after ecu lizumab withdrawal in 20 patients with atypical h emolytic uremic syndrom e (HUS) involving their kidneys Author (Reference)Age (years)Complement anomalyEculizumab treatment after eculizumab withdrawal or re-initiation c (months) Carr et al.

Genetic screening of the recipient and the donor is also a prerequisite when transplan- tation with a living-related donor is considered. Lastly, mea-sures to protect endothelium from damaging factors that may trigger complement activation have to be taken into account (Box 4). In patients at high risk of post-transplant recurrence, should prophylactic eculizumab treatment be applied or should the physician wait for recurrence to start eculizumab? As indicated above, patients with post-transplant HUS treated with eculizumab often do not reach full return of graft func- tion. We consider that the aim in 2014 should be to offer thebest possible graft function to aHUS patients and therefore we favor prophylactic eculizumab in patients at high risk of re- currence. However, this pos ition raises the question oftreatment withdrawal when the period of maximum risk of recurrence, i.e., the first year [ 70], is over. Our position on this point is as follows: rigorously conducted studies of eculizumab withdrawal in patients treated for aHUS involvingnative kidneys is a more appropriate starting point. If this shows a high percentage of early relapses in patients with high-risk mutations, then stopping eculizumab in transplantedpatients with the same type of mutations will be contraindi- cated. If not, controlled withdrawal studies in transplanted patients treated prophylactically will be justified. As of today,we propose that withdrawal should not be considered in pa- tients treated for post-transplant recurrence of aHUS.

Box 4 Practical issues for the management of kidney transplantation in patients with atypical HUS (aHUS). a Including patients with no mutationidentified who experienced recurrence on a exchangePediatr Nephrolmutations of complement fact ors synthesized in the liver (CFH, CFB and C3) is the only option to cure aHUS. J. Saland recently summarized information he collected from 20 pa-tients with CFH (n=18), CFB t( n=1)one PE session just before eculizumab [ 145]. To date, 16 patients (80 %) were cured from HUS with both grafts functioning,three died in the post-operative period (3/19 CKLT, 16 %) and one had a non-functioning kidney graft due to per-operative hemodynamic instability. To our knowledge, the three deathswere related to vascular complications in patients who had been on dialysis for years. We were recently informed of an additional patient with a CFH mutation who died from fungal infection 3 months post-CLKT prepared with PE + eculizumab (personal communication from G. Lipkin, Bir- mingham, UK). Lastly, a child with a CFH mutation has re- cently been reported who was cured from aHUS after preemp- tive living-non-related donor LT under PE/PI coverage [ 146]. Although most groups would rather take the option of kidneytransplantation under ecu lizumab, CKLT should not be discarded and all options should be discussed with patients and families. The decision can only be taken on a case-by- case basis, determined by risks/benefits assessment and, for some patients, their country 's ability to cover the cost of long- term eculizumab treatment after isolated kidney transplanta- tion [ 12,97]. Preemptive LT may be an option for patients with preserved eGFR despite a severe/relapsing course andwith a CFH ,CFB,o rC3mutation, complications or no benefit from PE/PI and no access to eculizumab treatment. Conclusions Our understanding of the role of the complement AP in the pathogenesis of a large fraction of patients with aHUS and the availability of eculizumab, an inhibitor of the terminal com- plement pathway, has dramatically changed our approach toaHUS. In this review, we have addressed the questions faced by clinicians world-wide, and tried to give evidence-based answers where available, and use the published anecdotal lit-erature where such data were missing. Our discussion will raise as many questions as it answers, and ongoing clinical experience and trials will help answer some, while new trials will need to be designed to answer others. The geographical disparity in treatment availability due to the cost of the drug is today a major problem. We anticipate that the cost of eculizumab may fall with other indications and as new agents under development emerge. We expect careful-ly designed studies and data from registries to establish safe withdrawal of treatment in order to reduce treatment burden to the patient and the overall cost to health care systems.Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank DR MK Taha, Institute Pasteur, Invasive Bacterial Infections Unit and National Reference Centre for Meningococci, Paris, France, for his helpful insights on the debate ofmeningococcal infection prophylaxis Authors contribution C.
