Safe for long-term use. Children 4-10 years: 5 drops in water, three times daily Children 1-3 years: 2-5 drops in water, three times daily Lymf-A-Drop is used for lymphatic drainage, congestion, detoxification, and immune support. The lymphatic system plays an integral role in circulatory and immune function through the extensive network of lymphatic vessels, nodes, and ducts that maintain fluid levels, absorb fat from the digestive tract, and transport white blood cells (WBC) for host defense. (1)(2) Traditional European uses by Nestmann Pharma (Germany) include: - Allergies and urticaria: reduce capillary permeability to plasma proteins - Children: reduce lymph swelling, decrease susceptibility of infections - Edema, swelling, inflammation: reduce swelling and lymphatic congestion - Lymphatic Congestion: activate and facilitate flow of lymph fluid - Lymphatic Detoxification: promote lymphatic drainage, removal of waste products from lymph, extracellular matrix, and connective tissue - Sports injuries: reduce swelling and lymphatic congestion Immunoplex 2 capsules with food two times daily. Take a few hours before or after taking other medications. Safe for long-term use. Immunoplex contains a combination of herbs, minerals, and thymus glandular extract to strengthen the body's natural defenses and restore immune function. Immunoplex works to strengthen the immune system, support thymus gland function, decongest the lymphatic system, and decrease the frequency and duration of colds and flu. The thymus gland enhances the body's defenses against immune infections, with the efficiency of the thymus decreasing with age. Thymus glandular supplementation supports thymus gland function while enhancing T lymphocyte cell (WBC) production and maturation. (3)(4)(5) Zinc supplementation supports immune cell maturation and healthy immune function, with deficiency leading to impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to infections, atrophy of the thymus gland, reoccurring colds, and flu, slow wound healing, and chronic inflammation.
