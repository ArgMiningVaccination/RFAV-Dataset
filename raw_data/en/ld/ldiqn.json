Case fatality in developed countries averages 10%, and higher rates are reported in less prosperous regions. According to the World Health Organization, the most important pathogenic serogroups are A, B, C, W-135, X, and Y. Clinical features of invasive meningococcal disease make diagnosis and management difficult. Antibiotic measures are recommended for prophylaxis after exposure and for treatment of invasive meningococcal disease cases; however, resistant strains may be emerging. Vaccines are generally regarded as the best preventative measure for invasive meningococcal disease. Polysaccharide vaccines against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y using protein conjugation technology have clear advantages over older plain polysaccharide formulations without a protein component. The first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-D) was licensed in the US in 2005. More recently, MenACWY-CRM (Menveo\u00ae) was licensed in Europe, the US, the Middle East, and Latin America. MenACWY-CRM uses cross-reactive material 197, a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, as the carrier protein. MenACWY-CRM offers robust immunogenicity in all age groups, with a tolerability profile similar to that of a plain polysaccharide vaccine. Given its potential for protecting persons from infancy to old age, MenACWY-CRM offers the opportunity to protect broad populations against invasive meningococcal disease. The most optimal strategy for use of the vaccine has to be assessed country by country on the basis of local epidemiology, individual health care systems, and need.Keywords: invasive meningococcal disease, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, Neisseria meningitidis", "sitename": "Infection and Drug Resistance", "date": "2011-07-22", "cleaned_text": "Back to [Journals](browse_journals.php) \u00bb [Infection and Drug meningococcal serogroups A, C W-135 and Y (Menveo\u00ae) in the context of treatment and prevention of invasive disease Authors [Broeker M](author_profile.php?id=95951), [Cooper](author_profile.php?id=134923), [DeTora](author_profile.php?id=134921), [Stoddard](author_profile.php?id=134925) Published 22 July 137\u2014147 DOI [https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S12716](https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S12716) Review by [Single anonymous peer review](peer-review-guidelines) Peer reviewer comments 5 Michael Br\u00f6ker, Brian Cooper, Lisa M DeTora, Jeffrey J Stoddard Global Medical Affairs, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany, and Cambridge, MA, USA Abstract: Worldwide, invasive meningococcal disease affects about 500,000 people annually.
