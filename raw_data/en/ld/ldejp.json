A double blind, randomised blockdesign study George T Lewith, Julian N Kenyon, Jackie Broomfield, Philip Prescott, Jonathan Goddard, Stephen T Holgate Abstract Objective To evaluate whether electrodermal testing for environmental allergies can distinguish between volunteers who had previously reacted positively on skin prick tests for allergy to house dust mite or cat dander and volunteers who had reacted negatively toboth allergens.Design Double blind, randomised block design. Setting A general practice in southern England. Participants 15 volunteers who had a positive result and 15 volunteers who had a negative result on aprevious skin prick test for allergy to house dust miteor cat dander.Intervention Each participant was tested with 6 items by each of 3 operators of the Vegatest electrodermal testing device in 3 separate sessions (a total of 54 testsper participant). For each participant the 54 itemscomprised 18 samples each of house dust mite, catdander, and distilled water, though these wererandomly allocated among the operators in eachsession. A research nurse sat with the participant andoperator in all sessions to ensure blinding andadherence to the protocol and to record the outcomeof each test.Outcome The presence or absence of an allergy according to the standard protocol for electrodermaltesting.Results All the nonatopic participants completed all 3 testing sessions (810 individual tests); 774 (95.5%) of the individual tests conducted on the atopicparticipants complied with the testing protocol. Theresults of the electrodermal tests did not correlatewith those of the skin prick tests. Electrodermaltesting could not distinguish between atopic andnonatopic participants. No operator of the Vegatestdevice was better than any other, and no singleparticipant's atopic status was consistently correctlydiagnosed.Conclusion Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies. Introduction Unconventional allergy tests such as electrodermal testing are used widely in complementary and alternative medicine. We wanted to compare the reliability of one common method of electrodermal testing for IgEdependent allergy, the Vegatest, with that of the gold standard for evaluating allergies, skin prick testing. Theprotocol for the Vegatest has been outlined elsewhere. 1 Electrodermal testing was developed as an aid in prescribing homoeopathic remedies1but is now widely used to assess an individual's allergic status to foods and aeroallergens. It is based on the observation that small changes in electrical impedance in the skin occur on an acupuncture point in response to substancesplaced in an electrical circuit (fig 1). We estimate that more than 500 electrodermal devices are currently being used in the UnitedKingdom to assess sensitivity to potential allergens (seeBMJ 's website for further details). We have no reliable information on the use of electrodermal testing inother countries or the extent to which it is used todetect food allergens rather than aeroallergens.Electrodermal testing for allergic and intolerance responses to dietary and environmental allergens \u2014for which there are several different devices \u2014has become increasingly popular, possibly because of its safety, noninvasive nature, and simplicity; therefore rigorous evaluation of electrodermal testing is important. The suggested mechanisms range from pressure changesover the acupuncture point that are producedunconsciously by the examiner to more objective mechanisms that are independent of the operator and are summarised as \"quantum biology.\" 23Further details measurementprobe GalvanometerBatteryHand electrode Point regulator 1.5V Fig 1 The electrical used in the VegatestDepartment of Medicine,University ofSouthampton,Southampton SO16 6YD George T Lewith nurse Stephen of MathematicalStudies, Universityof Department of Medical Statisticsand Computing,University ofSouthampton Jonathan Goddard statistician Centre for the Study ofComplementaryMedicine,SouthamptonSO15 2DT Julian N Kenyon codirector Correspondence to: G T LewithGL3@soton.ac.uk BMJ 2001;322:131-4 131 BMJ VOLUME 322 20 JANUARY 2001 bmj.com on 15 June 2006 bmj.com Downloaded from There have been several scientifically inadequate studies of electrodermal testing as a potential means of evaluating \"allergy.\"4-9Because the evidence base for using electrodermal testing to diagnose IgE dependentallergy is limited in quality and size, we undertook a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that electrodermal testing distinguishes between individuals who are sensitised to aeroallergens, as determined by skin pricktests, and nonatopic people. Methods Selection of participants The study was carried out at a general practice, theHythe Medical Centre, in Southampton. The volun teers were recruited through advertisements and from a departmental database. Volunteers were entered ifthey were aged between 18 and 65 but were excluded ifthey had any uncontrolled systemic disease, had taken part in any drug trial in the previous 30 days, had taken oral corticosteroids in the previous month orH 1antihistamines one week before electrodermal test ing, or were pregnant. Those who reacted positively to a skin prick test for allergy to house dust mite or cat dander were entered as atopic. The skin prick test com pares the effects of the test substance and a negativecontrol when the skin is pricked through a drop ofeach substance. We defined a positive result as a wheal that 10 minutes after the puncture was 3 mm greater in diameter than that made by the control substance. Thefirst 15 eligible volunteers were entered into each ofthe atopic and nonatopic groups. Skin prick testing, amethod of evaluating allergic status that is reproducible and remains stable over a four month period, 10 11 was carried out under a standard protocol12between 2 and 16 weeks before the electrodermal testing sessions. Ethical approval was obtained from the Southampton and south west Hampshire joint research ethics committee. The Vegatest protocol The operators were experienced electrodermal testers,each having used this procedure in a clinical setting forover 10 years. The four operators provided their ownVegatest machines (Vega Medizinische Ger\u00e4te,Schiltach, Germany). The machines were set up in thestandard manner for evaluating allergic responses, 1 with four ampoules of homoeopathic D60 inthe testing honeycomb (figure 1). The individual to be tested held a hand electrode, and the \"Vega probe\" was placed on the terminal acupuncture point on thelateral aspect of the third toe (the spleen/pancreasmeridian). 1In each test the operator measured the skin impedance at this point as indicated in arbitrary units on the galvanometer while the patient held the hand electrode to complete the electrical circuit. Each time a new glass ampoule containing the experimentalsubstance was placed in the Vegatest honeycomb, theoperator again measured the skin impedance. At the beginning of each testing session, each operator adjusted the baseline recording on the galvanometer so that the scale registered 100 units. Theoperator then placed an ampoule containing a toxicsubstance (the disorder control), such as mercury orparaquat, into the honeycomb in accordance with thestandard Vegatest protocol. 1If the galvanometer read ing was 6070 units, the participant was diagnosed as \"allergic,\" and the operator instructed the research assistant to note that the individual being tested was sensitive to the substance within the ampoule. If thegalvanometer read 100 units, the classification \"notallergic\" was recorded. The magnitude of the readings is not considered to be proportional to the extent of allergic sensitisation. If the operator was unable todefine the individual's allergic status on more than twoampoules tested at any testing session, that person'sdata were not included in the analysis. Outcome, power calculation, and statistical analysis The measured outcome was the operator's assessmentof the presence or absence of \"allergy\" for each of theampoules tested on each individual participant. Fromprevious reports, 7-9we expected that the sensitivity of the Vegatest would be about 0.7 and the false positive rate 0.15, with little variation among participants. Assigning 12 people to each of the two groups would achieve a statistical power of 90% (a two sided normaltest at a 5% level of significance) even if the varianceamong participants was as high as 0.14. Thus, to com pensate for dropout we recruited 15 volunteers to each group. The statistician (PP) processed the data beforebreaking the randomisation codes. Intervention A pool of four operators performed the electrodermaltests over three fixed dates and a fourth flexible date for those who had difficulty attending one of the prebookedsessions. On each day three of the four operatorsattended the sessions at the clinic. At each session theparticipants were tested by each operator for their allergic reaction to six ampoules. Each participant was therefore evaluated for their response to 18 individualampoules at each visit. The contents of the test ampouleswere changed for each operator on each day. Eachampoule contained only one item, either an allergenextract (house dust mite or cat dander; Bayer Dome Skin prick tests for allergy to house dust mites or cat dander Electrodermal tests: each volunteer tested by 3 operators on each of 3 sessions with 6 ampoules per tester per session 9 tests for each volunteer 54 ampoules tested per volunteer Order of testing of ampoules and contents of individual ampoules randomised for each volunteer Overall each volunteer tested with 18 ampoules each of house dust mite, cat dander, and distilled 810 tests completed 100% compliance with Vegatest protocol Fig 2 Study designPapers 132 BMJ VOLUME 322 20 JANUARY 2001 bmj.com on 15 June 2006 bmj.com Downloaded from Hollister Stier, Washington, DC) or a nonallergen (distilled water). Over all the tests in each session eachparticipant was tested with six ampoules containing house dust mite extract, six of cat dander extract, and six of distilled water, but the contents of each individual setof six ampoules were randomised (fig 2). Assignment\u2014blinding and randomisation The order of testing and the specific content of theampoules was determined by random numbers generated by a computer. The order of presentation of theampoules was randomised for each participantindividually, and the order of testing was randomisedin blocks of six ampoules. The sets of ampoules were made up at an independent homoeopathic dispensary(the Centre for the Study of Complementary Medicine,Southampton) with numerical codes on each of thebottles. The ampoules containing the two allergenscould not be distinguished from one another or fromthe distilled water. To ensure complete blinding thetrial manager was not present at any of the individualtesting sessions. A research assistant stayed with theoperators throughout each session to ensure that theydid not question the participants on their medical history. The research assistant also placed each ampouleto be tested into the Vegatest honeycomb and recordedthe operator's identification of the participant as either allergic or not allergic. The research assistant thenreturned the set of six ampoules to the trial manager atthe end of each clinical session. Results A total of 1596 individual tests were completed. All 15 nonatopic participants completed all the tests andcomplied with the testing protocol (810 tests). The atopic participants completed 786 tests, of which 774 complied with the protocol (figure 2). The percentagesof \"allergic\" and \"nonallergic\" participants as determined by the operators are shown in table 1. Overall the operators reported a positive (allergic) response (a reading of 6070 units of the scale) in a quarter of thetests and a negative (nonallergic) response in nearlythree quarters; they were unable to assess 1.0% of theresponses as either allergic or nonallergic. The Vegatest readings from the atopic group did not differ significantly from those of the nonatopic groups. The mean percentage of Vegatest results that accordedwith the results of the skin prick tests was normally distributed, and the Vegatest was unable to differentiatebetween atopic and nonatopic groups for each of theallergens: 24% of atopic participants versus 22% of nonatopic participants were diagnosed by the Vegatestoperators as being sensitive to cat dander; 28% versus29% to house dust mite, and 26% versus 23% to distilledwater. No individual participant's allergic status as determined by skin prick testing was consistently correctlydiagnosed by all the Vegatest operators. We also analysed each operator's results for each substance tested in both groups of participants and found no significant differences from the overallpatterns. The operators' overall results are shown intable 2. There was no difference in reliability among theoperators, no significant differences in the accuracy ofindividual operators, and no significant positive or negative correlation between the results of the Vegatest andthose of the skin prick test for any operator (data not shown). Analysis of false positive and false negative datadid not show any significant differences among theoperators or any significant correlation between theresults of the Vegatest and those of the skin prick test. Discussion This double blind, randomised block design study, which comprised over 1500 observations, showed thatelectrodermal testing could not distinguish atopic from nonatopic individuals. No operator was more reliable than any other, and no participants were consistently correctly diagnosed. As IgE dependent food allergy \u2014for example, to milk, eggs, or nuts \u2014has the same pathophysiological basis as mucosal responses to aeroallergens, we conclude that the Vegatest is an inappropriate tool for diagnosing any form of immediate hypersensitivity. However, we recognise that electrodermal testing,when used to assess \"antigens\" in a nonblinded manner, is usually used to evaluate food intolerance rather than to diagnose allergies in the traditional sense of the term. 8We did not investigate food intolerance, partly because there is no universally recognised conven tional test for food intolerance against which to evalu ate electrodermal testing. Nevertheless, it should be possible to design an appropriate trial to study thediagnostic usefulness of the Vegatest for foodintolerance reported by patients, although it is difficult to envisage a unifying mechanism to explain how the test would be able to detect this heterogeneous groupof disorders. Furthermore, we recognise that electrodermal testing was developed to aid the prescription ofhomoeopathic and herbal remedies and not primarilyas an allergy test; we made no attempt to evaluate theseclaims. 1The phenomena involved in electrodermal testing may make it difficult to evaluate in an entirely blind manner, as the person conducting the test may be an important part of the process.23Such issues can be addressed by appropriate randomised, controlledTable 1 Allergic status of atopic or nonatopic* participants as reported by operators of the Vegatest.

(Accepted 20 October 2000) Treatment for the premenstrual syndrome with agnus castus fruit extract: prospective, randomised, placebocontrolled study R Schellenberg for the study group Abstract Objectives To compare the efficacy and tolerability of agnus castus fruit ( Vitex agnus castus L extract Ze 440) with placebo for women with the premenstrual syndrome. Design Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group comparison over threemenstrual cycles.Setting General medicine community clinics. Participants 178 women were screened and 170 were evaluated (active 86; placebo 84). Mean age was 36years, mean cycle length was 28 days, mean durationof menses was 4.5 days.Interventions Agnus castus (dry extract tablets) one tablet daily or matching placebo, given for threeconsecutive cycles.Main outcome measures Main efficacy variable: change from baseline to end point (end of third cycle)in women's self assessment of irritability, moodalteration, anger, headache, breast fullness, and othermenstrual symptoms including bloating. Secondaryefficacy variables: changes in clinical globalimpression (severity of condition, globalimprovement, and risk or benefit) and responder rate(50% reduction in symptoms).Results Improvement in the main variable was greater in the active group compared with placebo group (P < 0.001). Analysis of the secondary variablesshowed significant (P < 0.001) superiority of activetreatment in each of the three global impression items. Responder rates were 52% and 24% for activeand placebo, respectively. Seven women reported mildadverse events (four active; three placebo), none ofwhich caused discontinuation of treatment. Conclusions Dry extract of agnus castus fruit is an effective and well tolerated treatment for the relief of symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome. Introduction The premenstrual syndrome is a complex combination of psychological symptoms, including irritability, aggression, tension, anxiety, and depression, and somatic changes such as fluid retention, breast tenderness, head ache, feeling of bloating, and weight increase. 1Women are affected irrespective of socioeconomic status, race, or cultural background, and family clusters are well documented.23The causes of the premenstrual syndrome have not been clearly elucidated4but have been attributed to hormonal change, neurotransmitters,What is already known on this topic Unconventional testing for allergy, such as electrodermal testing, is widely available Few clinical trials have evaluated unconventionaltesting What this study adds Electrodermal testing cannot distinguish betweenatopic and nonatopic individuals as previouslydetermined by skin prick testsPapers Institute for Health Care and Science,35625 H\u00fcttenberg,Germany R consultant Correspondence to: rued.schellenberg.med@tonline.de 134 BMJ VOLUME 322 20 JANUARY 2001 bmj.com on 15 June 2006 bmj.com Downloaded from "}
