They are the original water treatment media and were being used decades before polystyrene resins became the media of choice. Our sister company, [Mineral-Right\u00ae](http://www.mineral-right.com/), is the only manufacturer of man-made zeolite in the world. You know it as Crystal-Right. Water-Right\u00ae has exclusive rights to use this patented media here in the United States, which is something that gives Clear Choice Water Group dealers a clear advantage. The way this unique media came into the hands of Water-Right is an interesting story that's best told by our founder, Glenn Gruett. For this article, we'll give you the quick version and explain how we continue to find innovative ways to use this seemingly magical product that is sometimes called \"voodoo media.\" The History Behind Crystal-Right Crystal-Right was actually the first media used for ion exchange in water treatment. Resin didn't enter the picture until after World War II. Two pioneers in water treatment, Emmett Culligan and Fred Lindsay, helped develop the media and bring it to market. However, Water-Right would eventually lead the way in realizing the full potential of this zeolite. In the 1960s, Culligan owned the only two companies that produced synthetic zeolite for water treatment. Culligan sold it as a commodity throughout the industry. Eventually, Culligan began focusing on treating municipal water and serving city-dwelling residents, which was more efficiently accomplished using resin as the media. Then in the early 1980s, a contamination issue in California prompted Culligan's parent company to shut down production of a zeolite plant. Culligan soon announced it would stop producing zeolite completely, leaving companies specializing in well water treatment wondering what to do next. \"Water-Right was based in the Midwest and we grew the business using zeolite,\" says Guy Gruett. \"So, we had a lot of customers treating well water. Our company believed in zeolites probably more than any of our competitors.\" Fortunately, Glenn Gruett had obtained documentation explaining how to manufacture zeolite. He contacted Culligan about purchasing its zeolite operation and eventually struck a deal. In 1985, Water-Right built its own zeolite production facility in Phillipsburg, Kansas, the home of Mineral-Right. It offers ideal conditions for crystal growth. We call it \"a zeolite paradise.\" How Crystal-Right is Applied in Water Treatment What makes Crystal-Right so effective at treating water is that it has the ability to remedy multiple problems all at once. This zeolite can remove high amounts iron and manganese, soften water, and reduce odor from things like sulfur. It is the perfect media for well water. Mineral-Right's Vice President of Sales, Greg Gruett, coaches dealers to explain Crystal-Right units as iron filters that can also soften the water. That's partly because nearly every homeowner with a private well already has a water softener, but Crystal-Right can do multiple jobs with one unit. What you're competing against is other businesses that are only offering softeners, with iron and manganese filtration sold as separate equipment. CCWG dealers have access to equipment containing one of two types of Crystal-Right: [CR100](http://www.mineral-right.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MR_CrystalRight_SS_2015.pdf) and [CR200](http://www.mineral-right.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MR_CrystalRight_SS_2015.pdf). CR200 has a higher capacity for reducing hardness than CR100 and is useful in regions where water is considered extremely hard. CR100 is still effective at reducing levels of calcium and magnesium, it simply has a lower capacity when compared to CR200. What CR100 offers is the ability to raise the pH level of water. \"CR100 is useful in specific areas of the country, like coastal regions and even in Central Wisconsin where there is sandy soil,\" Water-Right Vice President, Guy Gruett says. \"They don't have high hardness, but the water is so acidic and aggressive that it eats away at copper plumbing.\" Greg Gruett explains that Crystal-Right is best at removing manganese first, then iron, then the calcium and magnesium, and then correcting pH. \"So it will continue removing manganese from the water until the media is exhausted,\" he says. But, exhausting the media could take quite awhile. Guy Gruett says there are units in Indiana that have been using Crystal-Right for 35 years without needing to replace it. Because Crystal-Right is a multi-functional media, it gives you a distinct edge over the competition. In a situation where a competitor would need to install a water softener for hardness, a filter for iron and manganese, and an acid neutralizer to raise the pH level - all a CCWG dealer needs to do is install a system using CR-100 in the media bed. \"One of the biggest obstacles in selling this to homeowners is getting them to believe that one unit really can take care of all these problems. It almost seems too good to be true,\" Guy adds. Yet another advantage of Crystal-Right is that these units sanitize themselves. The media bed can be cleaned using chlorine. Water-Right's chlorine generator makes chlorine directly from the brine solution, sanitizing the media during the backwashing process of regeneration. While natural zeolites exist, and are mined by other companies, they are not as useful or reliable. What distinguishes custom-engineered Crystal-Right from natural zeolites is that we can control the purity of it, while you can never be sure what Mother Nature is adding to natural zeolites. The Bright Future of Crystal-Right Water-Right is a company full of outside-the-box thinkers. We didn't sit around and get comfortable using a product like Crystal-Right for just one purpose. We've been exploring other applications, both in water treatment and other industries. Treating city water: Water-Right is researching and developing ways to use Crystal-Right for removal of ammonia from municipal water. As more municipalities use chloramines instead of free chlorine as a disinfectant, a new opportunity for Crystal-Right has emerged. Chloramines are compounds of chlorine and ammonia. While a carbon filter can remove the chlorine, ammonia still gets through. Water-Right's plan is to introduce a way to combine carbon pre-filtration with Crystal-Right units to develop a system that filters out both. Air Filtration: Crystal-Right has potential in products designed to remove airborne contaminants. Airline: Commercial airlines have life rafts equipped with systems that use Crystal-Right to desalinate sea water and make it drinkable in case of an emergency water landing. Pharmaceutical: We are excited about the potential for Crystal-Right to support human health! Clinical trials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are exploring the media's use as a detoxifier in the body. Crystal-Right also has uses for odor removal (check out [Odor-Z-Way](http://www.odorzway.com/)) and reducing contaminants in specific fuels. Find out more at [Mineral-Right.com](http://www.mineral-right.com/industries/). Because Crystal-Right is custom-engineered, we can impregnate the zeolites with other elements, like silver and copper. This makes it possible to create materials that fit the specific needs of other industries. What's next for Crystal-Right? We'll keep you updated!
