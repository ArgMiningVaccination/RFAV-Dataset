In addition, the University has an obligation to take reasonable steps to combat the spread of COVID-19 in our working, learning and living environments. The Directive is a foundational piece in the University's long-term plans towards pandemic recovery, built to ensure the ongoing safety and resilience of our campus communities. Even though almost 96% of the university's employees are compliant with the Directive and have uploaded proof of a fully vaccinated status, COVID-19 (including the recent Omicron variant and the potential need for booster vaccinations) remains a dynamic and challenging risk that health professionals have made clear requires ongoing vigilance to protect our University community, the larger community and our healthcare system. In light of this, it is critical that the University continues to enforce compliance with the Directive . Q: Who does this Directive apply to?

Q; How long will the directive be in effect? A: The Directive came into force on September 27, 2021 . It is scheduled for review in September 2022 . It may be reviewed and revised sooner if circumstances warrant. Q: Does being fully vaccinated exempt me from pre-shift screening, wearing a mask and/or physical distancing? A: No. Employees who are fully vaccinated or who have an approved accommodation are still required to adhere to all other University of Alberta workplace COVID-19 hazard controls. These may change depending on public health orders and guidelines. Vaccine Status Q: What does it mean to be fully vaccinated? A: Fully vaccinated means a status that an individual achieves 14 days after they have received the recommended number of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by Health Canada or the World Health Organization, and requires the individual to maintain the recommended number and type of vaccine doses as updated and required by Health Canada thereafter. Note that if Health Canada requires booster doses, those will be required to achieve/maintain fully vaccinated status. Q: What is my deadline to become fully vaccinated ? A: To be considered Fully Vaccinated by November 1, 2021, you must have received your second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by Health Canada or the World Health Organization by no later than October 18, 2021. Employees working remotely were granted an extension to January 4, 2022, to comply with the Directive.

COVID-19 VACCINATION DIRECTIVE - Employee FAQs | Last updated: December 20, 2021 | 2Q: I recently had COVID-19, but I'm better now, so why do I need to be fully vaccinated? A: All employees must be fully vaccinated regardless of whether they have had COVID-19. You are also not considered fully vaccinated until 14 days after you have received the recommended number of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by Health Canada or the World Health Organization. Q: I am currently working from home. Why do I need to be fully vaccinated? A: A temporary current arrangement to work from home does not create an exemption from the vaccination requirements in the Directive, nor is it permitted as a specic response to the Directive. Most employees currently working from home are doing so pursuant to a temporary arrangement, may need to attend work in person for a variety of different reasons, and are subject to be called back to work in person at any time either temporarily or permanently. Such an employee cannot be in a situation where they are required to attend in person and are not fully vaccinated. In addition, it signicantly hinders planning and resource deployment if the University is unable to have such a person available to return to the workplace when required on relatively short notice. An employee's preference to stay working from home is not a means to address the requirements of the Directive. Certain employees who are not in the above-described situation may be able to defer compliance with the Directive, though the University will need to receive and consider such a request at its discretion and subject to any additional terms it may deem appropriate. No employee is permitted to unilaterally decide to work or continue to work remotely for any reason. Rapid Testing Q: I am currently on an approved accommodation and I am required to participate in weekly rapid testing as part of my accommodation. Will rapid testing still be available to me after January 4, 2022? A: If you are on an approved accommodation and are required to participate in weekly rapid testing, then rapid testing will still be available to you as part of your accommodation. Q: I am not willing to disclose my vaccination status or I am unvaccinated, why can't I participate in weekly rapid testing? A: Rapid testing is only available for persons with an approved human rights-based accommodation which exempts them from the vaccination requirement set out in the Directive. In the absence of a human rights-based exemption, the Directive requires employees to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of their vaccination status.
