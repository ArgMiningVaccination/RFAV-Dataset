It's sometimes used to treat infertility, for example for women going through vitro fertilization (IVF). Although research hasn't confirmed it improves your odds of getting pregnant, it's safe to try acupuncture for fertility. What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that's been used to treat everything from labor pain and [period cramps](/getting-pregnant/ovulation/how-your-menstrual-cycle-works_20002896) to [nausea](/pregnancy/your-body/when-does-morning-sickness-start-peak-and-end_40005756) and [infertility](/getting-pregnant/fertility/common-causes-of-fertility-problems-in-women_1228906). The practice is based on the theory that vital energy (or \"qi,\" pronounced \"chi\") flows through the body along certain pathways. Acupuncturists try to re-balance this energy and restore health by stimulating specific points along those pathways with thin needles. Although acupuncture has been a staple of Chinese medicine for some 3,000 years, it has only become more accepted and popular in America over the past few decades. From a Western medicine perspective, acupuncture appears to work by stimulating the release of natural painkillers that have a variety of effects on the body. What does acupuncture feel like? Acupuncture needles are very thin, about the width of a hair. They're solid, not hollow like the needle your provider uses when giving you a vaccine, so they don't hurt as much (if at all). You might feel a small pinch, an aching feeling, or a sensation of pressure when each needle goes in, but most people don't find the process painful. Some people do have an emotional reaction to acupuncture. It's normal to suddenly feel elated, energized, or sad. These feelings are temporary. Alternative types of acupuncture apply heat (moxibustion), pressure (acupressure), suction (cupping), or a mild electric current through the needles. These techniques might feel a little different than traditional needling. All acupuncturists have slightly different practices, but many times they'll start your visit by discussing your symptoms or goals to determine which pressure points they think would be beneficial to target that day. Typically, your acupuncturist will then insert the needles and let you relax or sleep for 30 minutes or so until they take them out. Can acupuncture help with infertility? Whether acupuncture has any fertility benefit is a hard question to answer. Some research suggests the practice may be helpful during [in-vitro fertilization (IVF)](/getting-pregnant/fertility/fertility-treatment-in-vitro-fertilization-ivf_4094), but the existing evidence isn't sufficient or high-quality enough to confirm these findings. We need more research before we can say for sure that this age-old therapy can [improve the odds of a pregnancy](/getting-pregnant/how-to-get-pregnant/are-your-chances-of-getting-pregnant-better-if-you-have-sex_1334780). In theory, acupuncture has effects on the body that can promote pregnancy. For example, studies have shown that it lowers cortisol levels. Having high levels of this stress hormone can make it harder to conceive. Acupuncture also stimulates the release of [gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)](/getting-pregnant/ovulation/how-your-menstrual-cycle-works_20002896) and gonadotropin, hormones that are essential for getting pregnant. Advertisement | page continues below But in reality, studies haven't been able to prove that acupuncture works for fertility specifically. A Cochrane review of eight studies that included more than 1,500 women with [polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)](/getting-pregnant/fertility/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos_7432) couldn't confirm that acupuncture had any effect on [ovulation](/getting-pregnant/ovulation/ovulation-calculator), pregnancy rate, or [birth rate](/pregnancy/your-body/surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273). The authors said the evidence was simply lacking. Acupuncture during IVF doesn't have proven results, either. In one large study, women who had acupuncture around the time of their ovarian stimulation process and embryo transfer weren't any more likely to give birth than those who had sham (fake) acupuncture. When researchers in China analyzed the evidence on acupuncture done without [assisted reproductive technologies (ART)](/getting-pregnant/fertility/fertility-treatment-assisted-reproductive-technologies-art_4093) like IVF, they concluded that it might be effective. However, they couldn't say so for sure due to the low quality of the studies. Where acupuncture might have the greatest benefit is for reducing stress and [anxiety](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/anxiety-during-pregnancy_10415701) during IVF (or even while [trying to conceive](/getting-pregnant/ovulation/how-to-get-pregnant-fast_10337115)). Since stress has been shown to interfere with getting pregnant, it makes sense that reducing your stress with acupuncture could theoretically improve your odds of conceiving. Research has also investigated acupuncture for boosting [fertility in men](/getting-pregnant/fertility/common-causes-of-fertility-problems-in-men_1228908). Although one study showed an improvement in sperm count and blood flow to the testicles, the treatment didn't affect sperm movement and concentration, and there was no evidence that it increased the odds of a pregnancy or birth. Most experts believe that we need larger and better studies, using fake needles for some patients and real ones for others, to truly know whether acupuncture is effective. In studies where patients and health care providers knew that acupuncture was performed, the success of the treatment might have been due to what's known as the placebo effect. Perhaps it was the patients' belief in acupuncture - rather than the acupuncture itself - that caused the treatment to be successful. Are there any risks to having acupuncture for fertility? There are very few risks to trying this treatment, as long as you go to a licensed and experienced acupuncturist who uses sterile needles. The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture has a [database of licensed acupuncturists around the countryOpens a new window](https://medicalacupuncture.org/find-an-acupuncturist/). The most common side effects from acupuncture are mild and don't last long, including: - Soreness at the needle sites - Minor bleeding - Bruising - Dizziness or feeling like you're going to faint Let your acupuncturist know if you have a bleeding disorder or you're on a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin), which could increase your bleeding risk. You may need to avoid acupuncture if you have a metal allergy or an infection in or around the area where the needles will be inserted. Acupuncture points for fertility For treating fertility, acupuncturists place needles along points that are related to the reproductive organs and nervous system. The aim is to balance your hormones, improve how your ovaries function, and increase blood flow to your uterine lining. Some of the acupuncture points that have been used for fertility in studies are located: - On the top of the hand, near the thumb - Just below the knee on the front and sides of the leg - Above the ankle - In the lower belly - Next to the belly button - Behind or in the ears - In the middle of the back along the spine The exact points used vary from one acupuncturist to another, and from one treatment to another. Depending on where you are in your [cycle](/getting-pregnant/ovulation/how-your-menstrual-cycle-works_20002896), your acupuncturist may target different points. Is acupuncture safe if you become pregnant? For most women, acupuncture is safe during pregnancy. Some women find that acupuncture makes them feel more relaxed and helps with pregnancy discomforts like [lower back](/pregnancy/your-body/lower-back-pain-during-pregnancy_9402) and [pelvic pain](/pregnancy/your-body/pelvic-pain-during-pregnancy_10423823). But having any kind of medical procedure during pregnancy, even one that's as safe as acupuncture, is worth considering carefully. Evidence shows that acupuncture is safe during pregnancy, provided that your acupuncturist is experienced and follows the proper precautions, which includes using sterile needles. In one review of 105 studies, the main side effects during pregnancy were mild - including pain and slight bleeding at the needling site. Any severe side effects that women in the studies experienced were likely not caused by acupuncture, the experts concluded. You might have heard about \"forbidden points\" - areas like the lower belly that have raised concerns during pregnancy because they theoretically might induce labor early. Studies of women who received acupuncture in these points at all pregnancy stages showed no increased risk of [miscarriage](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/miscarriage-signs-causes-and-treatment_252) or [preterm labor](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/preterm-labor-and-birth_1055) compared to women who didn't have acupuncture. But if you're at all worried, ask your acupuncturist to avoid the \"forbidden\" points. What to expect at your acupuncture appointment Your experience will differ based on which acupuncturist you see. Every provider has their own unique style. Some follow a more traditional approach, while others blend elements of Western medicine into their practice. Your practitioner will likely start your first visit by learning about your health and what you're hoping to accomplish. They'll use that information to figure out the right treatment approach for you. Before the needles go in, the acupuncturist will clean each treatment area. Then they'll place the needles into various points around your body. Some acupuncture treatments add heat, pressure, or an electric current. Expect the needles to stay in place for a total of 25 to 35 minutes. Acupuncture is often given in a series of visits. You might see your acupuncturist once or twice a week for a total of six to eight sessions. And some women have regular acupuncture appointments for even longer than a few weeks or months. Each appointment will last for about an hour. How to prepare for your acupuncture appointment The best first step to treating any fertility problem is to contact a [fertility specialist](/getting-pregnant/fertility/fertility-treatment-getting-started_4089). If you decide to try acupuncture, look for a certified acupuncturist. The National Institutes of Health offers [tips on finding a licensed acupuncturistOpens a new window](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth). You don't need to do any special preparation for your appointment, other than wearing loose-fitting clothing so that your acupuncturist can access different areas of your body. Eat a light snack about two hours before your appointment. You don't want to be too hungry or too full. And bring along a list of the [medications and supplements](/pregnancy/health-and-safety/safe-medications-during-pregnancy_1486462) you take, including herbal remedies, to share with your acupuncturist.
