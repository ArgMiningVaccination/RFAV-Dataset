Inmate Participation 1. Opportunities for religious activities are open to the entire inmate population, without regard to race, color, nationality, sexual orientation, or creed.1 2. An inmate may designate his/her religious preference upon intake and may request to change his/her religious pr eference once every six months by signing an Inmate Request to Change Religious Preference Form (Attachment 1 -A) in the presence of his/her Facility Chaplaincy Program Director (FCPD). Noting a religious preference on this form is for self -identification purposes only and does not bind the Department to accommodate any religious belief or practice, other than respecting the inmate's right to believe as he/she chooses . The FCPD will forward the completed Inmate Request to Change Religious Preference Form to the Inmate Records Office. Inmate R ecords will note changes in religious preference in the mainframe within 30 calendar days of submission. Religious accommodations and participation by inmates in primary religious gatherings and activities may be limi ted to those inmates who are formally registered as identifying with that respective religion and who have demonstrated a sincerely held religious belief. 3. Religious services and programs shall be centralized for General Population status inmates. Partici pation or non- participation in religious programs is voluntary on the part of each inmate. 4. Custody Level 5 inmates will receive visitation from faith group chaplains at their cells as noted in Subsection D. below . 5. An inmate desiring to participate in a religious activity may request to attend a scheduled activity by submitting a DC- 135A, Inmate's Request to Staff Member , to the FCPD. 6. Upon request, a General Population inmate is to be excused, without pay from work , up to once a week to attend one scheduled primary religious gathering. As institutionally feasible, and upon request, an approved General Population inmate is also to be excused, without pay from work, to participate in a special holy day service (e.g., Mass on a Catholic Day of Obligation, Evening Prayers during Ramadan, the Passover Seder, Hanukah candle lighting, Holy Thursday/Good Friday/Christmas Eve services, etc.). Only with the permission of an inmate's supervisor, may an inmate be excused from work, without pay, to attend other religious activities (e.g., instructional classes, studies, retreats, seminars, etc.). 7. Facilities with segregated housing units (e.g., Young Adult Offenders [YAO], Diagnostic Classification Centers [DCCs], initial Receptio n Units, Forensic Treatment Centers [FTCs], Outside Service Units, etc.) and/or other units with limited access to the Religious 1 4-4517, 4 -4217 DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-2 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 Services Area should make every attempt to accommodate inmates in segregated housing units with opportunities separate from the General Population to practice their faith communally. 8. Facilities may elect to summon inmates for scheduled religious activities via an \"all call\" and/or a \"call -out\" system. For those religious activities for which a call -out is used, failure on the par t of a General Population inmate to attend at least half of the scheduled activities within a designated time period, as set by the facility, or the inmate missing a consecutive number of scheduled activities, will result in the inmate being automatically removed from the \"call -out\" for that faith group for a period of six months. After six months, the inmate may request to be added to the call -out for that particular religious activity. 9. While the Department does not ordinarily require an inmate to profes s a religious belief, when the nature of the religious activity or practice (e.g., at tending a holy day observance, participating in a sacred ritual/religious fast/ceremonial meal, ordering or possessing religious devotional articles and/or wearing religious headgear, etc.) pertains specifically to a particular belief, only those inmates who have designated their religious preferences and who are recommended for participation in said religious activity by the faith group leader will be included. Minimally, participation in special holy day observances, including ceremonial meals, will be limited to those inmates who have participated in at least half of the primary worship gatherings which have taken place six months prior to the observance (as applicable). 10. When considered necessary for the security and good order of the facility, the Facility Manager, in consultation with the FCPD, may restrict or limit attendance or suspend a religious activity. 11. If a state of emergency exists, the Facility Manager/desig nee will determine the appropriate level of religious activities to be offered. B. Religious Services Area 1. Each facility will provide a separate physical location for use as a Religious Services Area that shall be made available for religious activities.2 This space will be faith- neutral when not in use. F aith group symbols will be displayed only when a respective faith group is using the Religious Services Area and will be stored at the conclusion of the religious activity. As approved, other areas in the facility may be used for religious gatherings, including the gym and classrooms. At the discretion of the Facility Manager/designee, secure outdoor areas within the perimeter of the facility may be authorized for use by nature- based faith communities (e.g. , Native American, etc.). 2. Reasonable, accessible, secure and separate storage space for faith group communal sacred objects will be provided by the facility in the Religious Services Area and 2 4-4520 DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-3 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 maintained by the FCPD/designee. The Communal Sacred Objects Chart (refer to Section 3, Attachment 3- C) summarizes the approved sacred objects for use in religious gatherings. 3. Communal sacred objects stored in the Religious Services Area are subject to search. To ensure sacred objects are respected, the searching of communal sacred objects used in religious gatherings shall be done in the presence of the FCPD/designee. 4. All religious activities will be under the supervision of the FCPD, a Facility Chaplain, a Religious Contract Service Provider, or an approved des ignated corrections employee. Security personnel will be present as determined by the Facility Manager/designee. 5. Religious Vendors, Public Visitors and approved volunteers may facilitate religious gatherings, provided they are supervised by a FCPD, a Fac ility Chaplain, a Religious Contract Service Provider, or an approved designated corrections employee. Security personnel will be present as determined by the Facility Manager/designee. At the discretion of the Facility Manager, the use of security cameras may be used to monitor religious activities. 6. All religious activities will be scheduled through the FCPD and approved by the Facility Manager/designee. As is feasible, primary religious gatherings and holy day observances will be scheduled at a time consistent with the religious practices and beliefs of each respective faith group. For holy day observances which take place at times that conflict with formal count times (e.g., ceremonies, fast -breaking, prayers, etc., that take place after sunset or at ni ghtfall), facilities may elect to adjust their formal count time or to place inmates participating in the holy day observances on an out -count. 7. Religious Library With the approval of the Facility Manager/designee, facilities may provide a Religious Library to facilitate the lending of religious literature and audio/visual resources as permitted by policy. Religious music, instruction, and sacred language teaching tapes may be lent to inmates. a. The FCPD will ensure that all resources in the Religious Library have been screened and inventoried on a basis determined by the facility. Resources available for loan or for viewing only in the Religious Services Area must meet the content standards of DC-ADM 803, \"Inmate Mail and Incoming Publications.\" b. The FCPD will maintain a record of borrowed resources. c. Facilities may opt to place all non- reference religious reading materials in the facility's general library for easy access to all inmates. d.

Such donated publications may come from any source to the extent that the publications will enhance religious offerings without compromising security operations. f. Donated religious literature in a language other than English will need to be reviewed first by a staff person who is fluent in that language and who is able to verify that the content of the literature meets all specifications in Department policy DC- ADM 803. If no staff member is fluent in the language of the donated religious literature, the FCPD may contact the Religion, Volunteer, and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, for assistance. g. Inmates may donate sacred texts and religious literature to the Religious Services Department for placement in the Religious Library, as the FCPD deems appropriate. 8. Display of Religious Literature Religious literature, displayed in the Religious Services Area, will reflect the faith groups in the facilit y, will be labeled according to faith group and will be displayed in an equitable fashion. 9. If a state of emergency exists, the Facility Manager/designee will determine the appropriate level of religious activities to be offered. C. Religious Worship and/or Ritual Practices 3 1. Sacred and Foreign Languages a. Sacred texts and prepared liturgical/formal prayers may be recited in the sacred language required by the respective religion (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic, etc.). b.
