Heath, MD, MPH, Risk Management Program Director, Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, IndianHealthServiceNationalPrograms,Albuquerque,New Mexico;and EY Hooper, MD, MPH, Agency Risk Manager, ClinicalSupport Center, Phoenix, Arizona Introduction The Indian Health Service (IHS) Risk Management Program (RMP) is responsible for coordinating the clinicalpeer reviews of all medical malpractice tort claims filedagainst the Federal government that involve care provided atfacilitiesdirectlyoperatedbytheIHSorbyatribecarryingoutcontracts,grants,orcooperativeagreementspursuanttoPublicLaw 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and EducationAssistance Act. Since the mid-1980s, the IHS-RMP hasmaintainedadatabaseofinformationonalltortclaimsthatithas processed; by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2006, data hadbeenaccumulatedonover1440cases. Althoughanalysesofportionsofthedatahavebeenaccomplishedinthepast,formerreviews focused primarily on claim volume, regionalincidence,andoutcomeinformation. Thisarticleisbasedonan assessment of our agency's 20-year experience ofprocessingmedicalmalpracticetortclaims,withtheintenttoidentify what types of care and adverse outcomes mostcommonlygiverisetoallegationsofmedicalmalpractice,andfrom where within the network of IHS- and tribally-operatedfacilitiesdothemajorityofthesetortclaimsarise. Finally,theauthorsofthisarticlewillsharetheirexperiencewithrespectto the recurring risk management issues that have beenidentified during the reviews of these medical malpracticeallegations. Although it is not uncommon for individuals to file multiple claims with respect to one incident of allegedmalpractice, the focus of the RMP database and this reviewreflectthenumberofincidents(cases),ratherthanthenumberoftotalclaimsfiled. Thisisanimportantdistinction,becauseit is the incident itself that deserves the scrutiny of a riskmanagement program; the number of claims filed by variousparties affected by an alleged malpractice incident is a poorindicator of the merits of the case in question. It is alsoimportanttonotethatthisreviewincludesall allegedcasesofmedical malpractice during the 20-year period, even thoughmanyoftheclaimsweredeterminedtohavelittleornomeritafter careful and considered review. All of the recorded tortclaims were included because often significant riskmanagement issues can also be uncovered from cases wherethe accusations of improper care were shown to be invalidduringthemedicalreviewprocess. Methods There were a total of 1,444 cases of alleged medical malpractice in the database from FY1987 through FY2006. Thedatabasequeryfeaturewasusedtoextractandcompilethedataofinterest,andinturnthisinformationwastransferredtoa spreadsheet for manipulation and tallying. The mostcommon examples of each allegation category weredetermined by examining the allegation text entry for eachclaim. InformationonthenumberandtypesofIHSandtribalfacilitieswasprovidedbytheOfficeofClinicalandPreventiveServices,IHSHeadquarters. Allegation Classification. When a tort claim is entered intotheRMPdatabase,theclaimallegationisclassifiedusingone of eight categories. Table 1 shows the number andpercentage of tort claim cases within each category, listed indescendingorderofprevalence.

The most common examples includedmissed/delayed diagnosis of a cancer, an infectious disease(suchasmeningitis,sepsis,orpneumonia),anacutecoronaryevent, an acute abdomen (especially appendicitis), and boneandjointinjuries. Thenextmostcommonallegationtypewasthe alleged failure to timely or properly treata condition, representing23%ofcases. Inthiscategory,themostcommonentities included the improper management of an infectiouscondition, traumatic injuries including wounds with retainedforeign bodies (e.g., glass or wood fragments), respiratoryillnesses such as asthma or pneumonia, and gastrointestinalillnessesincludinggallbladderdisease. Sincemanytortclaimsallegeboththefailuretotimelyorproperlydiagnose andtreat, these two categories overlap considerably. Combined, theyaccountedfor59%ofallcases. Thesurgeryclassificationreferstocasesthatinvolvedan allegation of improper surgical intervention or peri-operativecare(excludingobstetricalsurgeries). Thesecasesaccountedfor 17% of the total cases. The most frequent conditionsincludeddamagetothebiliaryductsduringgallbladdersurgery(primarily laparoscopic), improper surgical management oforthopedicconditions,impropersurgicalmanagementofotherabdominalconditionssuch as colonsurgeryorappendectomy, and retained foreign bodies at surgery (primarily surgicalsponges). Cases alleging improper perinatal care (during the prenatal, labor, delivery, and post-partum periods) accountedfor 10% of cases. Most commonly, this included improperlabor management with an inadequate assessment of fetalwellbeing. Other examples relate to the improper choice ofdelivery method, failure to properly perform a delivery, andimproper prenatal care with inadequate assessment of fetalwellbeing. Themedication-related category refers to the alleged improper prescribing or dispensing of a drug, or the allegedadversereactiontoadrug. Theseaccountedfor6%ofthetotalcases. The most common examples included the wrongmedication prescribed (often related to not assessing drugallergies)anddispensingerrors. Thedentalcategoryreflectscareprovidedbydentalclinic staff, primarily dentists and oral surgeons. These casesaccountedfor3.5%oftotalcases. Commonexamplesincludethe alleged improper performance of extractions resulting incomplications, infections as a consequence of various dentalprocedures,andthewrongtoothbeingextracted. The \"other\" category was used to classify cases that did notfitintoanyofthespecificcategories;theseaccountedfor3% of cases.

Onlyninecases(lessthan1%ofthetotal)hadbeencoded asanesthesia-related , most having to do with airway management at the time of surgery. Two others involved theuse of fluids or sedation during surgery, and another twoinvolved alleged complications from spinal anesthesia. Itshould be noted that there were several surgery and perinatalcases where a component of the allegation also referred toanesthesia-relatedissues. Injury Classification. Knowledge of the degree of the allegedinjuriesprovidesanappreciationfortheseverityoftheadverse outcomes that resulted in a tort claim being filed.Table 2 shows the number and percentage of cases for eachalleged injury type, in order of decreasing prevalence. Themost common injury class was permanent 29%,thentemporaryphysicalinjury with26%ofcases. Non- physicalinjury alleging primarily psychological harm orpurelyeconomicdamages.

The risk managementissuesrelatedtoeachincidentofallegedmedicalmalpracticearerecordedintotheIHS-RMPdatabaseasfreetextnotesinamemofield. Therewasnofacilewaytoelectronicallyquerythe database to compile a list of common risk managementissues. However,whatfollows(innospecificorder)areshortexplanations of 24 commonly encountered risk managementconcerns, in accordance with the experience of this article'sauthors(SWHandEYH),whohavecollectivelybeeninvolvedwiththeseactivitiesforover24years. 1. Know and conscientiously practice the standard of care for your discipline. This goes without saying,but it is worth emphasizing. It is difficult to defendcarethatisoutdatedordoesnotconformtoaccepted standards of practice. Ensure that you are properly credentialed and privileged to provide the servicesrequired. 2. All new health care practitioners (including all temporary hires) should receive orientation withrespect to the recognition and treatment of locallyprevalent disease entities, such as hanta virus andplague in the southwest and tick-borne diseases inOklahoma. 3. Acknowledgeandrespondappropriatelytoabnormal vital signs identified during the screening ormonitoring of patients. If an adverse outcome does June2008 THEIHSPROVIDER175occur,significantlyabnormalvitalsignsonanurse's screeningprofilethatdonotreceiveanydocumentedrecognition by the patient's provider create major challenges for the defense of a claim. Especially intheacutecaresetting,itisextremelyimportanttobothacknowledge and then reassess any abnormal vitalsigns before discharging a patient from your care,includingdocumentationofwhatwasdonetoaddressthem. 4. Similarly, the chief complaint, as identified by the triage health professional during the screeningprocess, must be acknowledged and fully addressedby the examining practitioner, including a review ofsystems appropriate for all the symptoms expressedbythepatient. 5. Acknowledge and respond appropriately to all abnormal laboratory values and imaging studies. Inthe acute care setting, all abnormal studies must becommented on, and your facility must have aworkable process that enables all practitioners to benotified of abnormal lab results that are generatedafter a patient leaves the facility. Initial and datelaboratory slips, medical imaging reports,electrocardiograms,etc.whentheyarereviewed. Thesystem must also accommodate notification of thepatienttoreturnforreevaluationofabnormalstudieswhennecessary. 6. Avoid focused diagnoses in the setting of an acute illness or new patient complaint, but rather considerand document a differential approach to themanagement of the patient's signs and symptoms.When a particular disease entity is being considered(suchascardiacoriginofchestpain),thepatientmustthenbeappropriatelyscreenedforthatdiagnosis. 7. Chart comprehensively and legibly, whether it be a handwrittenpaperrecordoratypedelectronichealthrecord (EHR). Legible signatures are also critical -print or rubber-stamp your name below all writtensignatures. AstheEHRbecomesmorecommonplace(at least in the outpatient clinic setting) illegibilitywill become less of an issue, but accurate andcompletedocumentationmaystillbeachallengeforproviderswhoarepoorkeyboarders. 8. All entries should be timed, including inpatient and outpatientnotesandorders. Alwaysindicatethetimewhenmedicationsareadministered. 9. All encounters should have follow-up plans that are clearlydocumentedinthemedicalrecord,and(whenappropriate) discharge instructions provided topatients - this holds true for all clinic visits andhospital discharges. Carefully document patienteducation efforts, and who received the information(patient,parent,guardian,etc). 10. Chartassoonafterthecareeventaspossible. Entriesmust be reasonably contemporaneous with the care that was given, including operative and procedurenotes. If necessary, a late entry must always beidentifiedassuch,datedandtimedaccordingly. 11. Never attempt to alter a medical record after an episodeofcare. Whenacorrectionneedstobemade to the medical record, use acceptable practices tomakethosechanges. 12. Fetalmonitorandcardiacmonitortracingsshouldbe carefully dated and timed, and note on the strips allinteractionsperformedduringthemonitoringprocess(e.g., when medications were given, or when aprocedurewasperformed). 13. Obtainproperwritten,informedconsentpriortoany non-emergency invasive procedure. Every facilityshould have a formal written policy regardinginformed consent, indicating those procedures thatrequirewrittenconsent. 14. Before any invasive procedure is initiated, follow prescribed\"time-out\"protocolstoensurethecorrectprocedure is being performed on the correct patient,and that the correct side (left versus right) has beenclearlyidentified. 15. Be cognizant of the known complications for all the procedures you perform. It is not necessarily negligence when a known complication occurs, butthe failure to recognize and treat complications in atimely manner when they do occur may often beconsideredbelowthestandardofpractice. 16. Treatallinjuriesrelatedtopossibleglassand/orwood fragments, i.e., foreign bodies, with due diligence.Document a thorough exam and cleansing of thewound and always consider appropriate medical imaging. 17. The appropriate choice of medical imaging is also important when evaluating bone and joint injuries(plain films, CT, MRI). Non-improvement in thepatient'ssymptomsshouldpromptadditionalimagingand/ortimelyconsultation. 18. Referencepastmedicalrecords,orattemptstolocate past medical information that is not available.Regularlyseekwrittensummariesofalloutsidecarerelevant to the patient's ongoing medical problems,including past specialty consultations, procedures,andsurgeries. 19. Documentinthechartallconsultationsand/oradvice obtained by phone or other means from in-house oroutsidecolleaguesandspecialists. 20. Advice to patients given over the phone should be documentedinthechart,includingthedateandtimetheinformationwasgiven. 21. Medication prescribing and dispensing errors are an increasingly common target for tort claims. Eachfacilityshouldhaveanactivepatientsafetyprogram June 2008 THEIHSPROVIDER176tomonitorandminimizetheincidenceofmedication errors. Individuals who prescribe, dispense andadminister medications should work as a team toensure drug allergies and drug interactions arecarefullyappraisedbeforeanymedicinalisgiventoapatient. UseoftheEHRwillbeofgreatbenefitinthisregard. 22. Achild who will not bear weight or who has hip or knee pain without antecedent trauma should receivecareful consideration for the possibility of occultinfection,Osgood-Schlatterdisease,orslippedcapitalfemoralepiphysis. 23. Younger males with genitourinary complaints: if a urinary tract infection is diagnosed, further testingmaybeindicatedforanunderlyingcause;iftesticulartorsionispartofthedifferentialdiagnosis,itmustberuledinoroutemergently. 24.

Conclusions Missed or delayed diagnosis and/or mismanagement of commonly encountered medical conditions account for themajorityoftortclaimsfiledinrelationtocareprovidedatIHSand tribal facilities. Surgical and perinatal incidents accountfor an additional 27% of the tort claims. Most tort claimsreflect adverse outcomes that result in permanent injury ordeath of the involved patient. Most tort claims arise fromincidents at hospital-based facilities with a wider rage ofservices,includingemergencyroomcare,operatingrooms,andhigher volume obstetrical deliveries. Ambulatory healthcentersonlyencounteranoccasionaltortclaim,reflectingthelower volume of care and lack of higher-risk patientinterventions. However, no facility or provider is immunefrom being involved in a federal malpractice tort claim, andmany risk management issues are common to allegations ofimproper medical care. Better awareness of these commonissuesmayhelptoimprovepatientcareoutcomesandprotecthealthcarepractitionersfromclinicalperformancethatisnotdefensibleinacourtoflaw.

The IHS Health Education Program has developed a unique, interdisciplinary approach to standardizing theprovision and documentation of health education services,which can be easily replicated in other settings. Thiscomprehensive program utilizes nationally developedprotocolsbasedonpublishedarticles,clinicalguidelines,andstandards of practice, in coordination with locally developed,culturally sensitive lesson plans and an innovative procedurefordocumentingtheeducationprovidedtoindividualpatients. AllpatienteducationisdocumentedintheRPMSsystem. The process of documenting patient education enablesclinicians to receive \"credit\" for the education they provide,provides a means of evaluating the workload of variousdisciplines providing patient education, and provides data forperformanceimprovementefforts. Thisdocumentationispartofthepatient'smedicalrecordandinformsothersthatagivenpatient received education on a specific topic(s). Consistentuseofthesecodesencouragessubsequenthealthprofessionalstoperformappropriatefollow-up. NationalProtocolsandLocalLessonPlans Education protocols, developed by IHS clinicians across the country, serve as guidelines or templates for providing patienteducation. ThePatientEducationProtocolsandCodes(PEPC) Committee is a multidisciplinary team that includesphysicians, pharmacists, dieticians, health educators, andquality management coordinators, which meets regularly toestablishandreviewsubmittedpatienteducationprotocolsforclinical appropriateness and cultural sensitivity. Figure 1sh ows an example, the protocol for an asthma self- management plan. Each protocol contains an objective andfrom two to six standards that provide the educational pointsthat should be reviewed with the patient or family member.Protocolsaredetailedinamanualtitled IndianHealthService Patient and Family Education Protocols strategies detailing specifically how patienteducationisprovidedtothetargetpopulation,aswell asthehandoutsoreducationalaidstobeused. Lessonplansare developed by local programs and are designed to beculturallyrelevantandspecificforthepopulationserved. Forexample, the Cherokee Indian Hospital has created a lessonplan to ensure delivery of consistent and complete educationon insulin administration and glucometer use across caresettings,includingtheoutpatientclinic,theinpatientward,andan off-site diabetes education program. Sample patienteducation handouts developed and submitted from IHS sitesacrossthecountryareavailableontheIHSwebsite 3;handouts that are targeted to a less than 6th grade reading level areidentified, and all handouts are correlated to appropriateeducationprotocolsandstandardizedpatienteducationcodes. June 2008 THEIHSPROVIDER178StandardizedCodes An innovative coding system is used to document health educationencounters. Thepatienteducationcodeconsistsofa string of mnemonics, as defined in the PEPC manual.2 Documentation is simple and efficient, and use of codesreducesthetimerequiredtodocumenttheprovisionofpatienteducationineitherthepaperorelectronicmedicalrecord. Fiverequired and three optional components of the patienteducation documentation coincide with recommendationsmadebytheJointCommissiononprovidingpatienteducation 4 aswellaswithbillingrequirementsestablishedbytheCentersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The eightcomponents are defined in Figure 2. A hypothetical patienteducationencountermightbedocumentedas: ASM-SMP-RCPT-G-[Provider willchecktwicedaily codes andtheiradoptionbyclinicians,requiresanongoingprocessof training,monitoring,andevaluation. Extensivetrainingefforts areprovidedthroughouttheIHStoincreasedocumentationof patient education. Barriers to documentation that have been cited by IHS clinicians in the field include: 1) providers' perceptionofdocumentationasatime-consumingactivitythatencroachesonthelimitedtimetheyhavewiththeirpatients;2) providers'perceptionthatdocumentationofpatienteducation is not essential to providing good patient care; and 3) misconceptions about the difficulty of completing the documentation. These barriers are addressed through livemeetings, presentations at conferences, and incorporation ofpatienteducationdocumentationwithothertrainingtopics. TheIHSisabletoutilizethedocumentationofthesecodes in national reporting as well as local monitoring of clinical performancemeasures. ThroughanRPMSapplicationcalled the Clinical Reporting System (CRS), the agency routinelyparticipatesinnationalqualitydatacollectioneffortsincludingcollection of Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), ORYX, and Health Plan Employer Data and InformationSet(HEDIS)data. Forseveraloutcomemeasures,reporting is based on documentation of patient educationcodes, e.g., those for tobacco use assessment, tobaccocessation, alcohol education, intimate partner/domestic violencescreening,depressionandanxietyscreening,nutritionandexerciseeducation,comprehensivecardiovasculardiseaseassessment, and medication education/counselling. A new\"patient education report\" has become available in 2007 thatenables sites to view, for a given time period, the number ofeducation codes recorded, time spent providing patienteducation, patient level of understanding of educationprovided, top diagnoses and/or topics for which education isdocumented,andtypeofproviderwhogavetheeducation. In addition to allowing the IHS to track achievement of national clinical benchmarks, the system allows tracking ofhow many patients met their personally established goals, atthefacility,Area,ornationallevel. Discussion,Evaluation,andNextSteps Patient education has become a standardized component of documentation in the patient's medical record. Currently, morethan3,900patienteducationcodetopicsareavailablefordocumentation, each one submitted by IHS clinicians in thefieldandreviewedbythePEPCCommittee. TheIHSDirectorincludedincreasingthedocumentationofpatienteducationby five percent as a part of his performance measures in fiscal year 2006. Documentationexceededthistarget,withamean increase of 17 percent across facilities nationally.Documentationhasincreasedfrom101,410codesdocumentedin 1998 to 3,130,000 documented in 2006.

Introduction The American Indian community in the Bay Area organized and incorporated the Urban Indian Health Board (UIHB) in 1972 to open its first Native American Health CenterinSanFrancisco. In1976,asecondsitewasopenedinOakland. TodayNativeAmericanHealthCenter(NAHC)isafull-service clinic with locations in Oakland, San Francisco,andAlamedadedicatedtomakinghealthservicesavailabletoAmerican Indians and non-Indians in the Bay Area. TheNative American Health Center has 17 different funding sources,local,state,Federal,andprivate. Themajorsourceoffunding is revenue collected from services provided throughMedicaid. The ethnicity of patients served in 2005 (San Francisco and Oakland clinics) was as follows: NativeAmerican, of served in 2005 were as follows: SanFrancisco Clinic, 3,313 patients with 10,504 total visits; the staffmembermustbeontimeandbepresentthewholeday.

An employee incentive program was implemented in Native American Health Center, San Francisco, in January2003. During this time the Oakland clinic did not have anincentive program and acted as a control. This incentiveprogramwasputinplacetoguidethedentalteamofsalarieddentists and dental auxiliaries in achieving their goals and tomotivate the staff. The problems faced during the pre-incentiveperiodwerethefollowing: 1. Providers preferred to reschedule their patients who were late rather than attempting to accommodatethem. 2. Dental staff members were unwilling to see walk-in patients. 3. Theno-showratewas45%. The Dental Employee Incentive program plan was to collectandanalyzedatatomeasuretheincreaseofincomeand patientvisits. InMay2004,thesameincentiveprogramwithsimilargoalsandpre-incentiveproblemswasinstitutedattheNative American Health Center, Oakland. The two dentalprograms are operated by the same entity, but are consideredseparate sites. Both sites had two full time salaried dentists,twodentalassistants,andareceptionist. A Medline search (1981-2006) utilizing the key words incentive plans, bonuses, financial rewards, productivity,dental/dentist/dentistry/ other health professions wasperformed.

Each dentist,inthisexample,wouldreceive$10forthedayforthetwoincentivepatients. TheHealth-Prosoftwaresystemwasused to track patient visits, and our fiscal department tracksrevenue. A prospective study was designed at the time ofimplementingtheDentalIncentiveprogram. Thepre-incentivedataandthepost-incentivedatawereanalyzedandcomparedon a quarterly basis. Staffing patterns for both the pre-incentive and post-incentive years were the same: 2.0 FTEdentistsand3.0FTEdentalassistantsforeachclinic. Results In Table 1, the San Francisco pre-incentive revenue averaged $102,376 per quarter. Since the incentive program was initiated, the amount of revenue collected has averaged$152,579perquarter,anincreaseof49%,or$50,203moreperquarter. InSanFrancisco,theaveragenumberofpatientvisitsincreased from 946 patient visits per quarter before theincentive program to 1,311 patient visits under the incentiveprogram(Table2).Thisisanincreaseinpatientvisitsof365perquarter,a39%increase. As seen in Table 3, the Oakland pre-incentive revenue averaged $114,698 per quarter. Since the incentive programwas initiated, the amount of revenue collected averages$182,762 per quarter, an increase of 59%, or an average of$68,069increaseperquarter. InOakland,theaveragenumberof patients seen increased from 984 patient visits per quarterpre-incentiveprogramto1,474patientvisitsperquarterunderthe incentive program (Table 4). This is an increase of 490patientvisitsperquarter,a40%increase. TheOaklandclinicactedasacontrolfortheSanFrancisco incentiveprogramduringthefirstthreequartersof2003whilethe San Francisco clinic was implementing the incentiveprogram. The Oakland clinics patient visits remainedconsistent during that time period, and revenue stayedconsistent for the first and third quarters and Levin, in an article entitled Employee Incentive Program, states that one great benefit of employee incentiveprogramsisthattheyconnectteamcompensationwithpracticeperformance. Options are always available to keep theprogram exciting and motivating. 2In order to encourage desiredstaffbehaviors,incentivesystemscanbedesignedforany or all employee dentists, assistants, hygienists, andmanagers. 4 OurDentalIncentiveprogrampositivelyaffectedrevenue and patient visits, and maintained a high level of patientsatisfaction.

Pleasenotethattherevenuecollectedfromthethirdpartiesrollsovertosubsequentmonthsdue to billing issues. Patient visits and revenues vary frommonth to month, typically being lowest during the holidaymonths of November and December, when patients arereluctanttocomeinandtherearemanydaysthattheclinicsareclosed.Patient satisfaction surveys are taken annually. During each year of the incentive program, the patient satisfactionsurveys demonstrated that patients were very satisfied withtheircareandtreatment;92%ofpatientsrespondedpositively. The incentive program was only studied over a 9-month period because there was an increase in staffing after the 9months. There is always the risk that providers would provide fewerservicesinordertoseemorepatientsandreceivemoreincentivepay. However,theamountofincentivepaid,$5,wasnotaverysignificantpercentageofthedentistsalaries,soitdidnotseemtomotivatethemtodoless. Ontheotherhand,the$2 incentive that the dental auxiliaries received was asignificantmonthlybonusforthem,rangingbetween$150and$200permonth. Itseemsthatthedentalteam,whichismainlymade up of auxiliaries, controls patient flow into the clinic.The receptionist made sure patients showed up for theirappointments,andifnot,thenscheduledotherpatientsintheirplace. The dental assistants did not complain when an extraemergency or a late patient was taken into the clinic. Thedental team worked as a whole to see more patients and thisincreased revenue and provided a significant incentive bonustotheauxiliariesandtoalesserextent,thedentists. Thisstudydidnotmeasurethenumberofproceduresorserviceminutes,butweusedrevenueindollarsasameasureofservices. Sincethe revenue increased significantly, it seems reasonable toassumethatservicesalsoincreasedwiththeincentiveprogram. There were several potential confounding variables that werenottakenintoaccountinthisstudy. EventhoughweusedtheOaklandclinicasacontrolattheoutset,therecouldhavebeen specific local variations in that clinic that would not beaccounted for in our study. Also, there could be increases inpatient visits and revenues due to a specific dentist that wasvery productive, and worked in a certain clinic at a certaintime. There are different managers in each clinic that exertdifferentmotivationalskills,andthiscouldaffectrevenuesandpatientvisits. Thestaffcouldhaveperformedatahigherleveljust because they were being studied, and there was a statedgoalofincreasingproduction. Thiswouldmakemanagementhappier. Given that this is a pilot study and many variableswere not controlled, further study would be appropriate inordertoseeiftheseresultscouldbereplicated. Conclusion Ourdentalincentiveprogramhelpedincreasethenumber ofpatientsservedperday,therebyincreasingtherevenuetothe clinic. Motivatingdentistsandstafftoseeatleasttenpatientsper day per dentist promotes buying into the program,teamwork,andcooperation. The average number of patients seen prior to the dental incentiveprogramwas946perquarterattheSanFranciscositeand 984 at Oakland site. Under the incentive program, theaveragenumberofpatientvisitsincreasedattheOaklandsitebyabout40%andrevenuecollectedincreasedby59%overa June2008 THEIHSPROVIDER185periodofninemonths. AttheSanFranciscosite,therevenue generatedincreasesby49%andpatientsservedby39%overthe 9-month period. This study suggests that an incentiveprogram can be an effective method of increasing clinicrevenues and seeing more patients while maintaining patientsatisfaction.

Giventhisfrequency,mostprimarycareproviderswillcare for several patients with this disorder. ASDs, like otherneurodevelopmental disorders, are generally not curable, butcanbenefitfrommanagementlikeotherchronicdiseases. ThegoalistominimizethedeficitsassociatedwithASD,suchasspeechimpairmentandsocialinteractivity,whilemaximizingthepotentialofpatientstofunctionindependently. There are a variety of modalities used to treat ASDs. Relatively few of these have been rigorously evaluated. Themost work has been done with applied behavior analysis, aform of behavior modification. Studies have shownimprovementinIQmeasurements,academicperformance,andsocial adaptiveness. For interventions to be effective, theyneedtobeintensiveandsustained,whichisdefinedasone-on-oneteachingforaminimumof25hours/week. Medicalmanagementisalsodiscussed.

SSRIs have been used for the past decade.RecentlyrisperidonehasbeenlicensedbytheFDAforuseforsymptomsofirritabilityandaggressioninchildrenwithASDs. Lastly, a large number of biological and non-biological treatments have been offered for treatment of ASDs.Appropriately designed trials have show no benefit fortreatment with dimethlyglycine, vitamin B6,magnesium, secretin, andfacilitated communication. Many other treatments have notbeen rigorously evaluated but offered to patients; to choose therapies with proven benefit and avoidtherapieswithpotentialrisks. EditorialComment There is no cure forASDs. Medical therapies forASDs are limited but may be of benefit for specific indications. Educational interventions have the most potential but requirepersonnel who are familiar with ASDs and can devoteintensivetimetreatment. Thereisgoodevidencethatchildrenneed intervention as soon as the diagnosis of ASD isentertainedandthattheinterventionneedstobeintensivewitha minimum of 25/hours a week. This kind of expertise andintensive treatment could be made available through HeadStart or public schools.

Duringthefirsthalfofthe20 thcentury, multiple surveys attempting to assess the health statusofAmericanIndiansandAlaskaNatives(AI/AN)citedalackofwaterandwastedisposalservicesassignificantcausalfactorstothehighratesofinfectiousdiseasesamongAIsandANs. 1In1959,TheIndianSanitationFacilitiesAct(P.L.86- 121)authorizedtheIndianHealthServicetoprovidewaterandsanitation services to homes and communities. Since itsinception,theimpactonNativehealthhasbeendramatic,withreductionsinmorbidityandmortalityfrominfectiousdiseasesamongAI/ANs. This study investigates the relationship between modern sanitation services (in-home water services and wastewater disposal services) and hospitalization rates for respiratory,skin, and gastrointestinal tract infections in rural Alaskavillages. Between 2000 and 2004, in-home water and wastedisposalservicesweresurveyedandanalyzedinruralvillageswithin defined regions inAlaska. Water service data for oneregion (Region A) was further examined on a village level.Additionally, regional and village level (Region A)hospitalization rates for infectious gastroenteritis, pneumoniaor influenza, RSV among children less than 5 years, skin orsoft tissue infection, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA)infectionswereobtainedandcompared. Overall,in-homewaterservicewaspresentin73%(range 57% - 100%) of 71 % (range 55% - 100%) ofhomeshadwastewaterservices. Thisisincomparisontothe99.4% of homes in the US with modern sanitation services.Unevenly distributed, 61% of homes had in-home waterservice within Region A (designated a low service area).Thirty percent of the population (less than 10% of homes)withinRegionAlivedinhomesthatlackedmodernsanitation.The largest town had 99.5% of homes with in-home waterservice,accountingfor23%oftheRegionA'spopulation. Regional hospitalization rates differed by water service level. Childrenlessthan5yearsofagelivinginlowserviceregionswere3.4timesmorelikelytobehospitalizedforRSVthan children living in high service regions (95%CI=3.0,3.8).This trend can also be seen in all ages with pneumonia orinfluenza (RR=2.5; 95% CI= 2.4, 2.7)), skin or soft tissueinfections(RR=1.9;95%CI=1.8,2.1)),andMRSAinfections(RR=4.5;95%CI=3.6,5.7)). Hospitalization ratesbetween high and low service regions for infectiousgastroenteritis showed no difference. This may be related tothe adequate availability of safe drinking water to all homes,low temperature of the water, and nutritional status of thepopulation. Within RegionA, hospitalization rates for lowerrespiratory tract infections (LRTI), pneumonia, and RSVamonginfantswerethehighestinvillageswhereless10%ofhomes had in-home water service. Significant trends ofdecreasing rates of hospitalizations of infants with LRTI and LRTI with pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections,Staphylococcus aureus infections and MRSAinfections were seen with increase proportions of homes with in-home water service. Despite the inability to draw causal conclusions, the results strongly suggest an association between water service andinfectiousdisease. In-homewaterserviceisanimportant public health intervention. The authors conclude from the results of this study that the simple intervention of providing modern water and sanitation to all homes in rural Alaska villages would significantly improve health ofAlaska nativechildren.

Participants werecategorized based on their condom use behavior using the Transtheoretical Model. Multiple logistic regressions found that progression to consistent condom use was predicted by continuing to perceive more advantages to condom use, reporting greater condom use communication with partners, and less perceived invulnerability to HIV. Movement away from adopting consistent condom use was predicted by a decrease in perceived advantages to condom use, increased perceived condom disadvantages, and fewer condom discussions.
