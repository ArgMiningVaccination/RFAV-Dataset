ARE YOU READY TO LEARN HOW TO TREAT YOURSELF? In an increasingly confusing world what we need is a simple, integrated medical/health system that is easy to understand and practice. It is not only doctors and other healthcare professionals who need an evolved system to take care of their patients, it is all of us who are patients or don`t want to become patients who have to learn to take care of ourselves. There is an incredible amount of medical and health information on the internet. New developments, new methods, new drugs, new ways to treat diseases and the body. But how do you put it altogether? What Is the Natural Allopathic Protocol? The protocol that Dr. Sircus will teach you acts through the fulfillment of nutritional law, emotional law and understanding of solid medical parameters that lead to workable diagnosis and effective treatment that actually does something more than just covering up symptoms. The Natural Allopathic protocol resolves the most basic issues in our physiology. Medicinals like magnesium, selenium, sodium bicarbonate, hydrogen, oxygen, CO2, potassium and iodine can be used to great effect in dealing with the worst diseases. These substances all heal through fulfillment of nutritional law, which is much more intelligent and rational than pharmaceutically based medicine, so much of which is tainted with improper and fraudulent research. Bottom line. Do you want to learn how to take control of your health and body, in a safe, simple and affordable way? If so you need to learn how to use the above medicinals. Intensive care doctors use many if not all of them and call it medicine but because all of the above are nutritional we can legally practice on ourselves and our loved ones. What is so different about Natural Allopathic Medicine? It pays special attention to treating the underlying causes of sickness where mainstream medicine does not. Its an approach that uses concentrated nutrition and the basic elements of life to heal. It is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches! It is powerful and at the same time extraordinarily safe because natural medicines found in emergency and intensive care wards, not pharmaceuticals, are employed. Most of the items in the protocol can be taken orally, transdermally or, in more desperate medical situations, administered intravenously by a doctor or nurse. Transdermal applications include topical application directly on the skin, massages, medical baths, nebulization into the lungs and suppositories. Where do you Begin? Want to go deeper?

A big thank you Dorothy Perger Gold Coast Australia Deborah Piel I am a firm believer that what you put into your body (and what you don't too) is so important. I know that the anatomy and physiology workings of each cell in our bodies are the basis of life and the ions, nutrients, enzymes etc. all work together to create the perfect environment for optimum health.

I have passed on much of Dr. Sircus's information to persons that I come in contact with throughout the last 15 years. Thank you wholeheartedly........sincerely, Deborah Piel RNC Diane Kostelac Dr Sircus has validated my innate understanding of health & healing.
