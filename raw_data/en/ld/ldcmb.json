Verywell Fit / Kevin Liang Eating healthy, balanced snacks between meals can be an effective way to keep your energy levels up throughout the day. While it may be tempting to grab a coffee or an energy drink to get through an afternoon slump, you don't want to end up with the subsequent \"crash\". Instead, reaching for your water bottle and a nourishing snack, like a natural energy bar, may help to provide more sustained energy. The FDA has not established a formal definition for \"natural,\" but its policy states: \"The FDA has considered the term 'natural' to mean that nothing artificial or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food that would not normally be expected to be in that food.\" It's important to know that the term 'natural' is not synonymous with \"USDA Certified Organic,\" a regulated label with established criteria. Our selection of natural energy bars contain real, whole foods providing carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats to help keep you fueled between meals. When selecting our top choices, we considered overall nutritional content, ingredients and taste. We also had a registered dietitian from our Review Board review this article for accuracy surrounding natural energy bars, ingredients to look for, including protein, fiber, and sugar content, and the best way to evaluate them.

Ingredients include peanuts or almonds, sea salt, dried whole food powders and others. All of the bars are sweetened with honey, which provide a natural source of sugars. These bars also include about 4 grams of fiber, so when natural sugars are digested with fiber, they are absorbed into your bloodstream more slowly; this would not cause the same spike (and subsequent drop) in blood sugar like processed, concentrated sweets would.

These come in both snack size and whole bar versions, so depending on your hunger level, you can pick and choose the size!

In addition, we chose products with primarily simple ingredients, including fruits, nuts, seeds and natural sugars. Taste, price, and convenience were also considered when choosing the best natural energy bars. What to Look for in Natural Energy Bars Ingredients When purchasing energy bars, make sure to check out both the nutrition label and the ingredient list. Look for simple ingredients like whole foods; these include nuts, seeds, fruits, and spices. Stick to short lists (10 ingredients or less), and remember that the order in which the ingredient list is written reflects the abundance of the ingredient in the product. Sugar Although natural bars may have higher amounts of sugar than others on the market, it's best to choose products sweetened with natural sugars from dried fruits, like dates. The recommendation for added sugar is to stay below 25 grams per day for women and less than 37 grams per day for men. Consider how much added sugar you consume through other foods and try to choose products with less than 15 grams of sugar. Protein and Fiber Select bars with at least 3 to 5 grams of protein and at least 5 grams of fiber to help you stay fuller longer. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines recommend 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for adults. Many of us don't reach that goal, so looking for bars with a higher fiber content can help contribute to that goal. Most people reach their protein goals through other sources, but an energy bar with some added protein can help you stay fuller for longer! Frequently Asked Questions What makes an energy bar nutritious? The ingredients are what make an energy bar nutritious. Energy bars are a convenient way to fuel your busy life. When searching for a nutritious energy bar, check out the food label. Select a bar that contains a short list of familiar ingredients, like nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dried fruit. You also want to look at the sugar, fat, and fiber content of your energy bar. Choose a bar that's low in added sugar and saturated fat and a good source of fiber. What should you avoid in energy bars? In general, be cautious about consuming energy bars that contain high amounts of added sources of caffeine, which may cause adverse effects like headaches and anxiousness. Also, be mindful of sugar alcohols like xylitol, mannitol, or sorbitol in energy bars, used to add sweetness without extra calories. Though safe to consume, your body can't completely break down sugar alcohols which may cause gas, bloating, and diarrhea if you eat too much. It is best to consume energy bars that contain whole, real foods that you personally tolerate well. How do energy bars impact your body? It depends on the ingredients in the energy bar but typically, they provide the energy (from carbohydrates), protein and healthy fats to keep you fueled and satisfied between meals. Consider the context of your whole diet, and supplement meals with healthy snacks like natural energy bars to meet your individual nutritional needs. Why Trust Verywell Fit?
