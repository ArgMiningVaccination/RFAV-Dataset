Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in Cancer Care In recent decades, cancer treatment has made remarkable progress with targeted therapy applied on targeted subpop-ulation [1]. Though the life expectancy of the general popu- lation is increasing, cancer is still one of the most commoncauses of death worldwide [ 2]. The sophisticated treatments are often accompanied with increased adverse events, andt h es u r v i v a lr a t ei ss t i l lu n s a t i s f a c t o r yi ns o m ec a n c e r s .I nadvanced or recurrent cancers, the goal of cancer treatmentis often not curing the disease but prolonging survival timewith good quality of life. The health-related quality of lifeis getting value as a cancer outcome, and the effect ofearlypalliativecareisemphasizedimportantly[ 3].Nowadays medical information is easily accessed by patients, and mostof patients are looking for treatments with less side effectsand all available information to prolong survival time andto improve quality of life. Therefore, complementary andalternative medicine (CAM) for cancer is increasingly being demanded by patients, and more physicians are getting interestedintheuseofCAMincancertherapies. TheuseofCAMincancertherapiesdiffersfromcountry tocountry,butupto80%ofcancerpatientsusesomekindsofCAM to support their conventionalcancer treatments[ 4,5]. In Southwestern China, the prevalence of Chinese herbalmedicine use is up to 53.0% during cancer treatment [ 6], a n di ts e e m ss i m i l a rt ot h a to fH o n gK o n g[ 7]. In Taiwan, up to 98% of the cancer patients use any kind of CAM [ 8].In Korea, 78.5% of cancer patients use CAM [ 9]. A Japanese study revealed that 44.6% of cancer patients use CAM[10], while 83% of cancer patients or cancer survivors use 11].AnEuropeansurveyin13 countriesshowed35.9%ofaverageCAMprevalenceincancerpatients(rangeamongcountries14.8%to73.1%)[ 12].Inother partsoftheworldsimilarresultswereobtained[ 13].CAMis also used by cancer [ 14]. This usage ofCAMforcancerismorecommonamongeducatedpeoplewithbetterhealthbehaviour[ 15,16]aswellasamongwomen [17] .I nt h ec a s eo ff e m a l ec a n c e r s ,m o r ep a t i e n t su s eC A M ; forexample,60-80%ofbreastcancerpatients(incomparisonto50%amongcancerpatientsingeneral)and75%offemalecoloncancerpatientsuseCAM[ 18]. Patients mostly use CAM as a complement to their conventional therapy, not as an alternative treatment [ 19]. Only very few patients replace conventional treatment byalternative medicine [ 20]. Even though the use of CAM is a factworldwide,theviewonCAMvariesenormously,andtheintegration of CAM therapies into conventional therapies isextremelycomplicatedindifferentcountries. Although the governmental support on the research on CAM for cancer therapies differs among various countries,the use of CAM for cancer patients is still debated in anideological way by supporters and opponents of CAM. OneofthecausesforthereluctanceofWesternacademiatowardsC A Mi ss t i l lt h ei n s u ffi c i e n tn u m b e ro fc o n v i n c i n gc l i n i c a lstudies providing evidence for the efficacy and safety ofCAM therapies. The Western concept of \"evidence-based2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine medicine\" does only poorly match to the clinical practice of CAM.Nevertheless,anincreasingnumberofclinicalstudiesare being conducted during the past years to gain credibilityandreputationofCAM.IllustrativeexamplesonthepowerofCAMhavebeendocumentedincancerresearchwithafocusonthreemajorfields[ 21]: (i) acupuncture is widely applied for treating pain, a prominent side effect encountered during cancertherapy; (ii) reductionofsevereadverseeffectsofstandardchemo- therapy; (iii) unwanted interactions of standard therapy with herbalmedicines. Another reason for critical opinions towards CAM re- gards the quality of herbal products according to interna-tionalqualitystandards[ 22]. Therefore, an important question for recognition and implementation of CAM into general medical practice con-cerns the clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of CAMtreatments. Thisinducesconfusionandfearinpatientsandprovides aburdenforthecommunicationbetweenpatientanddoctor.Only 2.4% of patients used their healthcare professionalrecord as primary source of information on CAM in can-cer care [ 23] and 92% of American breast cancer patients withheld information about the CAM treatment from theirmedical oncologists [ 24]. Similar results were found in a survey in Taiwan, where more than two out of three cancerpatients never informed their physicians of their CAM use[8]. Reasons for this might be the expected inflexibility of medical oncologists and patients' fear of harming the rela-tionshipwiththeironcologistscausedbytheuseofCAM.Itisnot common for patients to have a communication betweenWestern medicine-oriented doctors and CAM practitionersin clinical practice. However, the integrative cancer care isincreasingly required by patients and recently it is gettingpopularincancertreatment. 2. Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine for Cancer Patients Acupuncture and herbal medicine are the most qualified CAM treatments. Their effectiveness is still under debate,althoughtheyhavebeenusedinmanyfieldsofcancertreat- mentandpalliativecare[ 25,26].Theefficacyoftheacupunc- ture and herbal treatment is not currently well recognizedby the Western academia and clinical scholars, so thatadvantagesofthesetherapiesintreatingcancerorsupportingcancertreatmentarenotadequatelyreflected.Onereasonofthis estimation is because of the quality of clinical research.Many studies still have the level of case studies [ 27], which seemlikeananecdotal,andthegeneralizationofCAMresultsmightbequestionableforscholarswhoarefamiliarwithwell-designedclinicaltrials. Acupunctureandherbalmedicinehavebeenusedforthe treatment of cancer pain [ 25,26] and for attenuation of side effectsofcancertreatments.Acupuncturehasbeenshowntobe effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [28], as well as acupressure [ 29] and herbal medicine [ 30]. However,acupuncturehasnotbeensystematicallyevaluatedwithwell-designedclinicaltrialforitseffectonit,whilenewdrugsgotapprovalsfromFDAforthereliefofchemotherapy-induced nausea. Other studies showed an effect of acupunc- tureonxerostomiaafterradiationtherapy[ 31,32].Thereare reportsthatacupuncturewaseffectiveonthechemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [ 33] and herbal medicine w a se ff e c t i v eo nt h eo r a ls t o m a t i t i s[ 34], which lead patients to higher acceptance of Western cancer treatment with lessinterruptionordiscontinuationoftherapy.Manystudiesweref o c u s e do nt h er e l i e fo fc a n c e r - r e l a t e ds y m p t o m ss u c ha sfatigue[35-37]andtheimprovementofqualityoflife[ 38]. Recently,randomizedcontrolledtrials(RCTs)havebeen c o n d u c t e dt os e e ke v i d e n c e so na c u p u n c t u r ea n dh e r b a lmedicine [ 39-41]. These therapies are usually considered as supportive for major treatment, in order to attenuate sideeffectsofsurgery,radiotherapy,andchemotherapy. One of the issues of RCTs on acupuncture and herbal medicine is how to deal with the individualized approachof treatments based on the Asian tradition. Asian herbaltherapyiscommonlyacombinationofmultipleherbs;some-times approximately up to 15 herbs are in one prescription,whileasingleherbalreadycontainsmultipletentativeactivecompounds. The daily practice in acupuncture and herbalmedicine with its individualized approach cannot be easilytransferred into standardized controlled trials. The conclu-sionofsystematicreviewstudiesthatbetterqualifiedstudiesare necessary [ 42-44] is not so surprising. The study design tosolvetheseissuesshouldbedeveloped. Even though the effects of acupuncture and herbal medicine are still under debate and further clinical researchis necessary, the clinical use of acupuncture and herbalmedicine has already been recommended to control cancer-relatedsymptomsinsomeoftheclinicalpracticeguidelines.Accordingtotheevidence-basedguidelinesofthe American CollegeofChestPhysiciansforLungCancer ,acu p unct ur ehas been recommended as a complementary therapy for lungcancer when pain is poorly controlled or when side effectssuch as neuropathy or xerostomia are clinically significant[45]. Acupuncture and herbal treatment have been used as a complementary treatment in combination with highlyeffective and partly aggressive Western medicine such aschemotherapy or hormonal therapy. But interactions arequite unknown, underestimated, or under debate. For in-stance, the herbal treatment with hormone-active herbs inpatients with hormone-sensitive cells of breast or ovariancancersisanimportanttopicofongoingdebates[ 46,47].The interaction of acupuncture and especially herbal medicinewith conventional treatments is not all known. Guidanceon the safety of herbal medicine to prevent potential risksto cancer patients is necessary, but data have not yet been collectedsystematicallyinMainlandChinabutarenowbeing establishedinH ongK ong. InJapan,Kampo,traditionalJapanesemedicine,isexten- sively used for cancer patients as supportive measures, cov-eredbyNationalHealthInsurance.JapanesemedicaldoctorsEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 can prescribe both Western and Kampo drugs, knowing the natural history of diseases and the indication and limitationof Kampo. But, there are no strong recommendations onthe Kampo use based on high-quality evidence in clinicalpractice guidelines in Japan [ 48]. The Japanese medical sys- tem is a unitary one, and Kampo is practiced in this system. F r o mt h i sp o i n to fv i e w ,t h es y s t e mo fJ a p a n e s et r a d i t i o n a l medicine is different from those of China and Korea, wheretraditional medicine is generally practiced in a dual system,but in the recent years integrative approaches were devel-oped. Japanese Kampo practitioners take advantage of thisunitarysystem,conductinghigh-qualityclinicalpracticeandresearch.Thissituationconsequentlyleadstotheintegrativemedicinebyasingledoctor,whereastheintegrativemedicinein other countries is usually done by a Western medicinedoctor and a traditional medicine practitioner. The systemof Japanese Kampo medicine well fits the methodologiesof modern medicine, and many clinicians utilize Kampo,accumulating evidence data. This unified situation might bean inspiring example for countries with a unitary medicalsystem. In Korea, the government health insurance covers only acupuncturetreatmentforcancerpatients.InWesterncoun-tries, acupuncture and herbal medicine, in spite of frequentuse, for years were not in the main focus of the medicalacademicsociety.So,researchinthisfieldwaslimitedleadingin consequence to a situation that especially treatmentswith Asian herbs often had a lack of scientific controls.But due to increasing interest of patients and practitioners,acupuncture had partly become an integrative therapy in pain management, and, for example, in Germany the use of WesternherbsasacomplementarymedicineiscommonandAsianherbsareincreasinglyused. S i n c eh e r b a lt h e r a p yi st h em o s tc o m m o n l yu s e dC A M treatment [ 49], in recent years, the search for active com- pounds has mainly focused on Asian herbs, whereby theemphasis has been on classical product-based leads forWestern drug discovery, usually performed by screening theextractsorcompoundsfromdiversebiologicalsources.Manyin vivoexperiments showed effectiveness on cell cultures and in animal models [ 50-53], but translation from bench to bedside is still a difficult challenge. This research, mainlyfocusing on single active compound, has been done oftenwithout regard to preexisting knowledge of the therapeu-tic utility of the plant source [ 54]. While interactions of ingredientsduringthepreparationprocedurearesometimesessentialtothetherapy,anextractionoftheactiveingredientsis often not a simple task, and evidence shows that singlecomponents extracted from plants are less potent than thecrude extract [ 55]. Scientists of many countries worldwide havetriedtoapplymodernexperiment-basedresearchmeth-odstoisolatingactivecompoundsfromherbs,characterizingtheirpharmacodynamicandpharmacokineticpropertiesanddefining their molecular modes of action with limited suc- cess.Thisreductionistparadigmofa\"singlechemicalentity\" is not easily applicable to the multidimensional complexityof Asian herbal prescriptions. Researchers often do not useany concepts of traditional theory as the basis for theirinvestigationsonthesecompounds[ 56].Studies on the influence of single herbs or their com- ponents on different microbiological pathways of humanphysiology are necessary and important, but this researchi sn o tl i k e l yt ol e a dt os i n g l e - c o m p o n e n tt r e a t m e n t sf o rm u l t i f a c t o r i a ld i s e a s e ss u c ha sc a n c e r .C a n c e ri sas y s t e m i cdisease of the entire body. A single-target approach has limitedeffectiveness,andthereisevidencethatamultitarget approach might be more effective [ 57,58]. It seems only rational to apply a multitargeted therapy to a multifactorialdisease.Therealizationthatmulticomponentmedicinesmayhaveadvantagesoversingle-componentdrugshasascientificfoundation. The pharmacological advantages of mixturesmay lie in the potentiating action of their multiple bioactivecomponents and the advancement of individualized therapy[59,60]. Modernresearchmethodsonasingleherbaimedatiso- latingactivecompoundsfromherbhavetobethefundamentfor future researches in herbal medicine. But when basicinformation is found and made available, experiments withherbal combinations might be the productive direction forfurther research to control cancer. While cancer is a mul-tifactorial disease with diverse heterogeneous mechanisms,a combination of components might provide a promisingopportunitytofocusonmultipletargets.Furthermore,thesee ff o r t sm a ye v e n t u a l l yo ff e ra ni n d i v i d u a l i z e da p p r o a c ht othetreatment.Basicresearchonsingleherbsandtheiractivecompounds is still essential for the scientific understandingof traditional herbal medicine. But research should not stopatthislevelbutcontinuewithresearchonmulticompounds,their interactions, and increasing or decreasing activity in combinations. Gaining knowledge from tradition might be helpful, not ending in a dead end. This approach is ambi-tious and time-consuming but has a chance not to fail likeconventionaldrugdiscoveryprocedureinthefieldofherbalmedicineinrecentyears. While it is difficult to get a patent on natural products, the further interest of pharmaceutical companies might belimited. Progress in this research area can only be foundin intense national as well as international cooperation,foundinginternationaljointworkinggroupstoovercometheobstaclesofthissophisticatedchallenge.

Introduction Oral mucositis is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy treatment with potentially severe implica- tions. According to the American National Cancer Institute, ulcerative oral mucositis occurs in approximately 40% ofpatients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy [ 1]. Medical interventions are required in about 50% of these patients, including changes of medication or chemotherapy dose reduction.Severemucositissymptomsoccurinupto80%inhighdosechemotherapytreatmentsofleukaemiaorinstemcelltransplantregimens[ 1].Mucosal damages may be induced for example, by antimetabolitessuchasmethotrexate,5-fluorouracil,anthra-cyclinessuchasdoxorubicinandbleomycin,alkylatinganti-neoplastic agents such as cyclophosphamide and busulfan,taxanesandtheplatinumcomplexes,includingcisplatinandcarboplatin[ 1,2].Allofthemmayhavepossibletoxiceffects on rapidly dividing mucosal cells, partly related to drugs e c r e t i o ni nt h es a l i v a .S a l i v av o l u m ea n dc o n s i s t e n c ea swell as the oral microbial flora may be altered, affecting themucosal metabolism [ 3]. Several molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of mucositis, such as oxidationandapoptosismediatedbynitricoxide(NO),cyclooxygenase2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine (COX), protein kinases, cytokines, and nuclear factors [ 4]. The research field involves also genetic-based risk factors[5]. Epigenetic changes of DNA methylation are discussed as being responsible for inflammatorial precancerous condi-tions[6].Acancerdiagnosisitselfmayleadtoposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), causing depression and anxiety as well as an increased level of biomarker expression, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor protein.

Mucositis grading is thenutritionalstate,asseenin Table 1.GradesIIIandIVare consideredasseveremucositis[ 9,10]andinmorethanone- third of these patients the next chemotherapy cycle needs tobe delayed leading to a possible deterioration of treatment[11]. When uncomplicated by infections, mucositis may be self-limiting in about 2 to 4 weeks [ 1]. Mucosal damages and local factors such as periodontitis and suboptimal oralhygieneincreasetheriskofinfections.Systemicexacerbationis facilitated by the commonly decreased immunologicalstatus [12,13]. Consequences are an increased mortality risk aswellasaprolongedhospitalisation,includingthenecessityof fluid replacement and parenteral nutrition, causing anincreaseofcosts[ 9]. 1.1. Preventive and Treatment Methods by Conventional Medicine. The detailed guidelines for prevention and treat- ment of mucositis are depending on the chemotherapyregimensusedineachcase.Generalpreventioninstructionsincludepriordentalexaminationsandtreatmentandoptimaloral care [ 10,16], as well as avoidance of spicy, hard and hot foodsandsaline-peroxidemouthwashes[ 16]. There are numerous western experimental preventive and therapeutical interventions for oral mucositis. Updatedclinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of mucositis were published by the Mucositis Study Section of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care inCancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology(MASCC/ISOO) in 2007 [ 10], suggesting the use of ker- atinocyte growth factor-1 (KGF-1) for preventing mucositisinhigh-dosechemotherapyregimens.Cryotherapywassug-gestedformelphalan,5-fluorouracil,andetidronate.Systemicglutamine was not because of severe toxicity.Mouthwashing with granulocyte-macrophage-colony stim-ulating factor (GM-CSF) did not show consistent effect.Updated results are frequently published by MASCC/ISOO[17]. According to a Cochrane review from 2010, nine interventions for prevention and treatment of mucositisshowed statistical benefit: allopurinol, eitherplacebo ornotreatment[18] .Th eu p d a t e dC o c h r a n er e v i e w ,p u b l i s h e di nF e b r u a r y 2013, came to the conclusion that cryotherapy and ker- atinocyte growth factor had some benefits in preventing mucositis and sucralfate showed effects in reducing theseverity of mucositis. Aloe vera, amifostine, granulocytegrowthfactor,honey,laser,andPTAdidnotshowconsistenteffects[19]. Even concerning the progress achieved during the last years, chemotherapy-inducedoralmucositiscontinuesto bea challenge for a positive cancer treatment outcome [ 2,18, 19]. The development of further treatment options for oral mucositisremainsanimportantresearchobjective. 1.2. Complementary Medicine with Western Herbs. In west- ern complementary medicine several herbal treatmentapproaches Up to 80% of cancer patients use some kinds of Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies tosupporttheirconventionalcancertreatments[ 20 ,21].Herbal treatment is the most frequently used CAM therapy andmany of the used herbs originate from TCM [ 22,23]. TCM offersempiricalherbalformulasfortreatingmouthulcersandstomatitis which have frequently been used in complemen-tary treatment of oral mucositis in the last decades, but theevidence of these therapies is unclear. While standard con-cepts for this kind of treatment do not exist and acceptanceby conventional oncologists is still low, we conducted thisreview to critically examine the evidence of Chinese herbaltreatmentinoralmucositis. 2.

Herbal flos andGlycyrrhizae radix are two important ingredients of the traditional herbal formula Yin Qiao San (Chinese) (Honey- suckle and Forsythiae Powder (English), e nB i n gT i a oB i a n (Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases) [ 38]. It is used in inflam- matory conditions including those of skin and mucosa [ 39, 40]. In TCM tradition, Lonicerae flos is used for abscesses, swelling, ulcers and erysipelas [ 24-26]. It offers antioxidant properties, suppressing interleukin 1-beta (IL-1 ), IL-6, and COX-2 gene expression in human umbilical vein cells [ 41]. In traditional treatment, Glycyrrhizae radix is known to be useful for abscesses, scores, and ulcer treatment [ 24-26]. Anti-inflammatory effects are 42,43]. This herbal combination has been investigated by two authors. In one randomized, controlled, two-armed clinicaltrial,thecombinedtopicalandinternalusewascomparedto borax mouth washing in chemotherapy patients ( =190; treatment:=97;c o n t r o l :=93). Mucositis symptoms were found in 19.4% of treatment group patients and in85.2%ofcontrolgrouppatients,measuredbytheWHOscalefor mucositis [ 44]. The study did not establish a control for the internal use of herbal medicine, comparing a dual-mode treatment to a single control. In another clinical trialon chemotherapy patients (=86;t r e a t m e n t :=43; control:=43), herbal gargling solution was compared to hydrogen peroxide mouth washing [ 45]. Positive effects on mucositis symptoms were found in 95.3% of the herbaltreatment group and 76.7% of the control group, measuredby a subjective scale. Further investigation by high-qualitystudiesisrequired. Plus Astragali membranacei radixis used to the herbs described above, Lonicerae flos andGlycyrrhizae radix .I nt r a d i t i o n a lu s e , Astragali membranacei radix clears toxicity and is used for abscesses and promoting skin regeneration [ 24-26].

Discussion Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis continues to be achallengeforanticancertreatment[ 8,9,12-15],representing oneofthemostcommonproblemsforchemotherapypatients[1]. Despite of the dedicated research on this field [ 1-7]a n d some resulting guidelines for prevention and treatment oforal mucositis [ 9,10,16,17], therapeutic results are not yet satisfactory. Chemotherapy side effects in general representan additional physical and psychological burden to patientsdiagnosed with cancer, reducing their quality of life andleading to the risk of anticancer treatment delay with fatalconsequences[ 7,8].Ontheotherhand,posttraumaticstress r e a c t i o n sa ss e e ni nc a n c e rp a t i e n t sl e a dt oad e c r e a s e ddefence against oral mucositis, determined by the alterationofseveralbiomarkers[ 6,7]. Medicinal herbs are commonly used for complementary treatment when there is no sufficient western treatment concept. A Chinese review identified diverse approaches regardingoralmucositisbyapplyingherbalmedicine,includ-ing various gargling preparations, sprays, formulas for oraladministration, acupoint application or intravenous injec-tion, resulting in a generally positive effect [ 111], but the evidenceofherbaluseonoralmucositisstillremainsunclear. Generally, systematic review studies on Chinese herbal medicinecometotheconclusionthatbetterqualifiedstudiesare necessary [ 112-114]. At the clinical level, study designs used to be mostly suboptimal but even on pharmacologicallevel, the study quality is criticized as being sufficient. Thisisnotsurprising,becauseclassicalpharmacologicalresearchis generally focusing on single active compounds and thismethod of approach is not easily transferred to the multi- dimensional complexity of Asian herbal prescriptions. Butin some aspects this view is short sighted, as a single-targetapproach can have limited effectiveness, and there is someevidencethatamulti-targetapproachmightbemoreeffective[115,116]andmixturesmayhavepotentiatingactionsoftheir multiplebioactivecomponents[ 117]. I nt h i sr e v i e w ,o nt h eo n eh a n dw et r i e dt os u m m a r i z e the state of knowledge of Chinese herbal treatment forchemotherapy-inducedoralmucositisbasedonclinicaltrials.On the other hand, we tried to examine the TCM traditionbasedrationalityoftheparticularherbsusedformucositis. While aggressive treatments like chemotherapy have not been used in the history of TCM, application of traditionalChinese herbal treatment to these side effects of moderntherapyrequiresanintentionaltransferofhistoricalconceptsto modern treatment procedures. In daily practice, Chineseherbal medicine has an individualized approach that cannotbe easily transferred into standardized controlled trials dueto the uniform treatment concepts usually required by con-trolledtrials. Forafullunderstandingofthemechanismsofherbalpre- scriptions,theeffectsofeverysingleherbmustbeknownona molecular basis. Based on these data, herbal combinationsshould be investigated for detecting synergisms that mayresult in molecular effects which are not found in the singleherb components [ 118,119]. Further elaborated research is necessaryforclearingmultiplequestionsaboutsingleaswellas combined herbal use, resulting in the aim of rationalprescriptionratherthanapplicationbasedonlyonempirical knowledge. E v enth o ughallr eview edc linicaltrialsr epo rt edposi ti v e effects of Chinese herbal treatment, they did not show ade-quatestudydesignsproportionatelywithregardtotheinves-tigated questions. Some studies used complex multi-herbalformulasthatleadtodifficultiesinunderstandingthedetailedeffects. Formula complexity should be well elaborated inordertoachievesignificantresults.Monoherbalapplicationsofferclearresultsonthebasisofwellelaboratedstudydesigns.Herbal combinations may be even more effective in clinicalresults [115-117], while under clinical study conditions the evidenceofexaggeratedmulti-herbalapplicationisnarrowedby numerous interferences between the single compounds,especiallyincombinedprescriptionsofvariantformulas(see5.2,5.10,5.11,5.12,and5.13). Theuseofindividualizedherbalcombinationshasalong traditioninTCMonanempiricalbasis.Oneoftheevaluatedtrials tries to take this classical approach into account byadditional prescriptions depending on the accompanyingsymptomatology, resulting in extremely complex treatmentprocedures (see 5.13). In consequence, the general overviewgets lost. In other trials treatment procedures of topicalapplication and internal or even intravenous administrationwere combined (see 5.1a, 5.3, 5.6, and 5.10 and 5.11), making itimpossibletodrawapplicableconclusionsaboutoneofthe interventions. One trial used a formula mixed with vitamins(see5.12),whileothersusedvitaminB2,B12,and/orvitaminC application for controls without discussing the rationale(see 5.3, 5.6, 5.11, 5.12, and 5.13). In the same manner, it is12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine difficulttojudgetheefficacyonherbaliceapplicationversus ambienttemperedgarglesolution(see5.4).Antibioticswereused for control groups in some studies (see 4.3, 5.6, and5.11)whilebasicuseofantibioticschallengedtheresultofonestudy(see5.7). Only in one study a non-treatment group had been established (see 4.2) and in only 6 studies the same typeof application was used for treatment as well as for controlgroups (see 4.3, 4.4, 5.1b, 5.2, 5.5, and 5.7). Two authorsreporteduncontrolledcasestudies(see4.1,5.8,and5.9). In summary it is almost impossible to evaluate which parts of the treatment concepts are responsible for the measuredeffectsinthereviewedtrials. Another problem for judging study results is the fact that oral mucositis is a severe but short term side effect ofchemotherapy, typically self-limiting in about 2 to 4 weeksif not complicated by infections [ 1]. Study designs have to considerthatevenwithoutanyspecifictreatments,symptomspossiblyimproveinthistime. In general, the investigated trials showed low-quality designs.Controlgroupswereestablishedinmostinvestigatedtrials but control interventions did not represent any stan-dards. It has to be admitted that the mucositis guidelines sofar existing are limited, so it is not easy to find valid controlinterventions for some treatment concepts. But in general,clinicalstudiesshouldofferastandardbasictreatmentforallpatients or placebo non-treatment groups in order to gathervalid data on the investigated intervention. In the case ofmucositis,establishingnon-treatmentgroupscouldcauseanethical dilemma for having possible severe consequences [ 9, 12,13]butitispossibletoestablishbasictreatmentconditions forallpatientstakingpartofthestudywhichdonotinterferewith the investigated intervention. This approach includesplaceboadministrationforcontrolgroupsinordertoachievevalid data. In the case of Chinese medicinal herbs, the useof capsules containing herbal extractions or placebo is agood option. In the case of gargling solutions, fabricatinga valid placebo may be more complicated but should notbe impossible. Patients and medical practitioners should beblinded regarding the applied intervention in order to min- imize placebo effects. The blinding technique has not been reported in any of the investigated studies. Randomisationhasbeenreportedinallcontrolledstudiesthoughtheprocesshasnotbeendescribedexceptverybrieflyintwopublications(5.1b and 5.12). For proving a strict randomisation protocolso as not to create bias, it is necessary to provide a detaileddescription. Summarizing the collected data so far, results of Chi- nese medicinal herbal administration for chemotherapy- induced oral mucositis are potentially promising, but poor study designs do not allow valid conclusions. Conductinga meta-analysis is not possible with the present database. Further investigations are necessary on molecular mecha- nismsofmulti-herbalformulasandthecorrespondingsingleherbs as well as in well designed clinical trials. Providingadequate study designs are developed, traditional Chineseherbalmedicinehasthepotentialofcomplementingwesternregimens such as chemotherapy in order to achieve lowerlevels of side effects, thus enabling patients to better resist chemotherapyimpacts. 7. Conclusion All evaluated trials in this review reported positive effectsabout Chinese herbal treatment for chemotherapy-inducedoral mucositis, but the value of these treatments remainsunclear. Study designs are generally poor, some herbal pre-scriptions are far too complex and adequate controls aremissing.Mechanismsofactionarerarelydescribed. While basic research provides data about anti- inflammatory and protective effects of some herbs orherbal compounds, further research is still promising, butstudy designs need considerable improvement. So futureresearchshouldstartwithmechanismbasedstudiesfirst.Thefollowingclinicalstudiesshouldreducethecomplexityofthetreatmentproceduresinordertoproduceclearresults,before Chinese herbal medicine can become an evidenced based partofthetreatmentofchemotherapyinducedmucositis.

Introduction Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer- related mortality in China and other Asian countries [ 1, 2]. Surgery and chemotherapy are the standard treatment modalities for gastric cancer [ 3-5]. The 5-year survival of gastriccancerpatientsiscurrentlyestimatedatapproximately30%;therefore,thedevelopmentofnoveltreatmentstrategiesto improve patients' prognoses is urgently required. Themajority of gastric adenocarcinomas express high levels ofcyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [ 6-9]. Houghton et al. reported that angiogenesis and Helicobacter pylori infection are both associated with COX-2 expression in gastric cancer patients[10]. The knockdown of COX-2 in a SGC-7901 gastric adenocarcinoma cell line by RNA interference inhibitedproliferationandinducedapoptosis,indicatingthatsuppres-sion of COX-2 might represent an effective approach forthe treatment of gastric cancer. The majority of selectiveCOX-2 inhibitors exert pronounced side effects that limittheir administration. Based on this clinical phenomena,AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cell line which constitutivelyexpressed COX-2inducedbyIL-1topotentiallymakeitanexcellentmodelfor assessinggastrointestinaltoxicityofCOX-2inhibitorswasanidealmodeltoevaluatethepotentialcompoundforadjuvanttherapyingastriccancer[ ok n o w na s MIC-1,GDF-15,p l a c e n t a l TGF-,a n dPLAB). NAG-1 is a transforming growth factor--like secreted protein, initially characterized as a p53-regulated gene [ 12-14]. Overexpres- sionofNAG-1inbreastcancercellsresultedingrowtharrestandapoptosis in vitroandin vivo.Previousstudiesobserved similar results in colon cancer cells [ 15-17]a n df o l l o w i n g the treatment of prostate cancer cells with purified NAG-1[18]. These findings suggested that NAG-1 is associated with apoptosis and that the downregulation of arrest, and proapoptoticactivity in A549 human lung cancer cells [ 19]. We also observed that NSAIDs upregulated the expression of severalisochaihulactone-induced genes and that isochaihulactoneupregulated NAG-1 protein expression in a time-dependentmanner.TheupregulationofNAG-1byisochaihulactonewasassociatedwiththeupregulationofEGR-1expression;there-fore,thesilencingofEGR-1expressionbysiRNAscouldalsobe associated with downregulated NAG-1 RNA and proteinexpression. In our PD98059reduced the inhibitory effects of isochaihulactone signifi- c a n t l y ;h o w e v e r ,t h ep 3 8i n h i b i t o rS B 2 0 3 5 8 0a n dt h eJ N K inhibitor and SP600125 hadnonsignificanteffectsonEGR-1andNAG-1expression.Thesedata supported the concept that isochaihulactone-inducedERK1/2 activity is critical for the regulation of EGR-1 andNAG-1 expression. The induction of ERK1/2 activity Saussureainvolucrata Kar.etKir.,orthesnowlotus,grows inmountainousrockyhabitatsat2600melevationorhigherin the Tian Shan and A'er Tai regions of China. Because ofexcessive harvesting of the wild plants for use in pharma-ceutical preparations and their remarkably slow growth, thewildpopulationof S.Involucrata hasdepletedinrecentyears. S. Involucrate is currently close to extinction and, therefore, listed as a second-grade national protected wild plant inChina [20,21]. According to the theories of traditional Chi- nese medicine, S.

Subsequent is a potential modulator of CNSactivity,promptingourowninvestigationofitsantineoplasticactivityagainstGBM[ 28]. In this study, we identified that Hispidulin treatment markedly upregulated NAG-1 protein expression and down-regulatedCOX-2proteinexpressionsignificantly,inAGSgas-tric cancer cells. After various durations of exposure of cellstoHispidulin,theexpressionofEGR-1andthatofNAG-1wasupregulated in a time-dependent manner. downregulated NAG-1 inhibitory effects of Hispidulin in AGS cells. Theseresults suggested that the apoptotic effects of Hispidulinin human gastric cancer cells might be directly associatedwith the upregulation of NAG-1 expression through ERK1/2activation.OurfindingsindicatethatHispidulinexertsther-apeutic effects on human gastric cancer cells through theactivationofNAG-1throughtheERK1/2signalingpathway. 2.

Results 3.1. Hispidulin Inhibits Human Gastric Cancer Cell Growth.TotesttheinhibitoryeffectofHispidulin(40,5,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone) on cancer cell, we treated human gastriccancer AGS cells with Hispidulin. Twenty-four, 48, and 72h o u r sa ft e rt r e a t m e n tf o l l o w e db yM T Tc e l lv i a b i l i t ya s s a y , we observed that Hispidulin displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity to AGS cells than other drugs such as rutinand Aspirin ( Figure1). The IC50 of Hispidulin to AGS cell was 50M at 48h after treatment and 20 Ma t7 cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2)wasoftenoverexpressedingastricadenocarcinomas, we also treated AGS cells with COX-2inhibitor (celecoxib or NS-398).

However, treatedAGS cells with COX-1 inhibitor, Aspirin, had less inhibitory effect on cell viability (IC50 >1mM)(Figure1(e) ). Taken together, Hispidulin can be more effective in gastric cancersurvivalinhibitionthanwell-knownCOX-2inhibitors. 3.2. Hispidulin Induces AGS Cells Apoptosis and G1/S Phase Cell Cycle Arrest. We then evaluated the association between Hispidulin-induced inhibition of cell growthand induction of apoptosis. After Hispidulin treatment,the percentage of cell apoptosis was significantly elevated in dose and time-dependent manners ( Figure2(a) ). In addition, activation phenomena cell line was a caspase-dependent manner. Thewestern blot analysis also more supported that Hispidulininduced apoptosis included activation of caspase-9, cleavageofcaspase-3,andpoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase(PARP)withintime-anddose-dependentmanners(Figures 2(d)-2(e)). 3.3. Hispidulin Induces AGS Cell Cycle Arrest during the G1/S Phase.Toelucidatethemechanismsunderlyingtheactivities of Hispidulin, we evaluated its effects on cell cycle progres-sion. Our results from flow cytometric analysis showed thatHispidulin treatment induced the accumulation of cells inthe G1/S phase in a time-dependent proteins, includingcyclinD1andcyclinE,inAGScells( Figure3(b) ). 3.4. COX-2 in Hispidulin-Induced Inhibition of AGS Cell Growth. The IC50 for Hispidulin was 50Mi nA G Sc e l l s( Figure1(a) ); therefore, we used the same concentration in this study's experiments. To evaluate the involvement of EGR-1 in theupregulation of NAG-1 expression induced by Hispidulintreatment in AGS cells, we used western blotting to analyzeEGR-1andNAG-1proteinexpression.AftervariousdurationsofexposureofcellstoHispidulin,theexpressionofEGR-1,aswellasNAG-1,wasupregulatedinatime-dependentmanner.E G R - 1w a su p r e g u l a t e ds i g n i fi c a n t l ya ft e r6ht r e a t m e n ta n dthis effect remained until 24h treatment.

Discussion NSAIDs are effective chemopreventive agents for various cancers via the inhibition effect on prostaglandin synthesis.Previous studies identified the chemopreventive andantitumorigenic activities of NSAIDs against colorectal andother human cancers; however, the molecular mechanismsresponsibleforthesepropertieshaveyettobefullyelucidated[31-33]. It has been reported that NAG-1is a target gene for NSAIDs and a unique member of the transforming growthfactor superfamily. Increases in NAG-1 expression result intheinductionofapoptosisinseveralcancercelllines[ 14,16]. Also, NAG-1 expression is induced not only by NSAIDs butalso by several antitumorigenic compounds. These includedietary compounds, peroxisome proliferatoractivatedreceptor-ligands, and phytochemicals sw a novel lignin, isochaihulactone, increased NAG-1 mRNA and protein expression and inhibited cell proliferation onh u m a nl u n gc a n c e rA 5 4 9c e l l s .I nt h i ss t u d y ,w er e p o r t e dthat the flavonoid Hispidulin upregulates the expressionof results indicated that NAG-1 is an important targetg e n ef o rH i s p i d u l i n .O u rs t u d yr e s u l t sc o u l di n c r e a s eunderstanding of the mechanisms by which Hispidulin canaffecttumordevelopment.Duringouranalyses,weobservedtheHispidulin-inducedupregulationofNAG-1expressioninthehumanAGSgastriccancercelllinehadrelativelyreducedCOX-2 activity repression. Our results demonstrated thatHispidulin-treated cells had NAG-1 elevated expression andreducedCOX-2expression.However,theregulatoryrelation- shipbetweenNAG-1andCOX-2stillremainedtobeinvesti-gated although drugs variousgenes,iscriticalintheinflammation[ 38].NF-Bisa redox-sensitivetranscriptionfactorthatregulatesamultitudeof inflammatory genes, including cytokines, chemokines,adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins. Under basalconditions, NF-Bi si n a c t i v ea n dp r e v e n t e df r o mD N A binding and nuclear translocation by tight association inthe cytoplasm with inhibitory proteins.

In our study, after treatment with hispidulin, the expression of nuclear factor B( N F -B)-p65 in cytoplasm extract fractions decreased, as compared tothat of the control ( Figure4). Taken together, the results suggest that hispidulin may exert anti-inflammatory effectsin vitroin AGS cells through inhibition of NF- Bs i g n a l pathway activation. Induction of EGR-1 expression by anti-tumorigenic compounds is known to involve members ofthefamilyofmitogen-activatedproteinkinases(MAPKs)orphosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) dependent pathways.For example, induction of EGR-1 expression by per-oxisome proliferator-activated receptor-(PPAR)l i g a n d troglitazone occurs by the ERK phosphorylation pathway ratherthanbythePPARpathway[ 15,16].

We foundthatLY294002didnotreversetumorgrowthinhibitioncaused by hispidulin (data not shown). Compared with theeffectsofotherphytochemicalagents,thisresultsuggeststhatthe ability of our drug to cause tumor apoptosis might notgo through this pathway. Results from analyses of COX-2proteinexpressioninAGScellsfollowingtheirtreatmentwithHispidulin showed that Hispidulin induced morphologicalchangesintheAGScells(datanotshown),inhibitedAGScellgrowth (Figure1(a) ), and arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S phase (Figure3(a) ).

Hispidulin induces apoptosis in A549 cells following mitotic arrest. The mechanism by which microtubule- damaging agents induce apoptosis is not well understood.The activation of aspartate-specific cysteine protease (cas-pase) represents a crucial in drug-induced apoptosis, with the cleavage of PARP by caspase-3c o n s i d e r e do n eo ft h eh a l l m a r k so fa p o p t o s i s .I nt h i ss t u d y ,the pan caspase-3 inhibitor FMK reduced the apoptosis-promotingeffectsofHispidulin(Figures 2(b)and2(c)).These resultssuggestedthatacaspase-dependentpathwaymediatesHispidulin-induced apoptosis (Figures 2(d)-2(e))a n dc e l death.

In a randomized trial with a group sequential adaptive design in patients (EA),1.7\u00b11.7(HB),1.6\u00b12.0(VitB),and1.3\u00b11.3points(placebo)ona10-pointnumericratingscalewithoutsignificantdifference between treatment groups or placebo. In addition no significant differences in sensory nerve conduction studies or quality of life(EORTC QLQ-C30) were found. Conclusions . The used EA concept, HB, and VitB were not superior to placebo. Since, contrary to our results, studies with different acupuncture concepts showed a positive effect on CIPN, the effect of acupuncture on CIPN remainsunclear.Furtherrandomized,placebocontrolledstudiesseemnecessary.Thistrialisregisteredwith a stocking-glove shaped distribution pat-tern.

No studies have shownconvincing evidence of substantial are ineffective for the treatmentof the typical sensory CIPN symptoms and cannot induceneuroprotectionorneuroregeneration[ 5-8]. A recently published survey revealed that approximately 43% of patients with chronic peripheral neuropathy use or have used complementary or alternative medicine (CAM),including high doses of vitamins, magnet therapy, herbalremedies, and chiropractic treatment. In addition, 30% ofpatients used acupuncture. Approximately a quarter of thepatients stated that their symptoms improved after usingCAMtherapies[ 9]. The WHO and leading German acupuncture societies havelong-listedneuropathyasanindicationforacupuncture[10].Fewreportshavepublishedonitseffect.Severalstudies demonstrated beneficial effects of acupuncture in diabeticneuropathy [ 11-14], HIV-associated neuropathy [ 15,16], and in peripheral neuropathy with an unclear etiology [ 17]. The very limited conclusions from these studies resulted eitherfrom the small number of treated patients, the uncontrolledstudy design, or the publications in Chinese journals withmerelyanabstractinEnglishandthereforenoteasytoevalu-ate.Acupunctureincombinationwithelectrostimulationfortreating CIPN has rarely been evaluated [ 18,19]; however i th a sb e e nd e m o n s t r a t e dt oi m p r o v en e u r o p a t h i cp a i ni npaclitaxel-treated rats at both low (10Hz) and high (100Hz)frequencies[ 20]. In German-speaking countries, hydroelectric baths are traditionallyusedinmanyrehabilitationcentersforthetreat- ment of peripheral neuropathy [ 21]. However, their effec- tiveness has not been proven via controlled studies. The useof vitamin B supplements to treat neuropathy is also verycommonbutalsowithoutrigorousclinicalevaluation[ 22].

All patients received detailed information aboutthe study and provided written informed consent beforeparticipation. 2.3. Treatments. Treatment protocols spanned 3 weeks and wereasfollows. 2.3.1. Electroacupuncture (EA). 8\u00b11sessions of in the upper and lower extremities weretreated with the complete point combination. According tothe practices of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theacupuncture needles were deeply inserted bilaterally untilthe deqi phenomenon (sensation which spreads over thewholebodypartdescribedas\"aching,\"\"soreness,\"\"pressure,\" or \"tingling\" [ 24]) was triggered. Each session included 15 minutes of electrostimulation (50Hz) consisting of a com-bination of rectangular currents and high amplitude waves.The stimulus strength was increased until the deqi phe-nomenon was triggered again. The acupuncture was carriedoutbytwospeciallytrained,highlyexperiencedphysiciansatthe University Medical Center Freiburg who had completedtraininginacupuncturewiththeGermanPhysiciansAssoci-ation. 2.3.2. Hydroelectric Baths (HB). 8\u00b11sessions of HB were scheduled to treat the affected extremities. The patientsdipped their arms up to a hand's width above the elbow andtheir feet up to a hand's width above the ankle into a specialwater basin with water at a temperature of about 35 C.

By means of detailed questionnaires, patients were interviewed before the start of the therapy(day 0), after treatment on day 21, and during follow-up onday 84, about extension and intensity (non, mild, moderate,or severe) of their CIPN complaints (numbness, swelling,tingling,pain,andsubjectiveimpairmentineverydaylifeandatwork). Finally, patients were asked to describe how heavily they suffered at the respective point in time from CIPN com-plaints altogether and to rate the severity of neuropathicsymptomsonanumericalratingscale(NRS)\u2014rangingfrom0 (no complaints) to 10 (highest imaginable complaints).Th ec h a n g ef r o md a y0t od a y2 1o nt h i sp a t i e n t - r e p o r t e dnumericalratingscalewastheprimaryoutcomeofthestudy. 3.2. Secondary Outcomes. Before the start of the study (day 0) and after completion of the treatment (day 21), thepatients were examined by an independent neurologist. Theneurologist ascertained a neuropathy score and performedelectroneurographicaltests. Theneuropathyscore(0-15points)wasbasedonsensory symptoms(0-3points),pinsensibility(0-3points),vibratoryt h r e s h o l d( 0 - 3p o i n t s ) ,s t r e n g t h( 0 - 3p o i n t s ) ,a n dd e e ptendonreflexes(0-3points).Theelectroneurographicaltestsincluded sensible nerve conduction studies of the median (upperextremities)andthesuralnerve(lowerextremities). Finally, the neurologist evaluated the intensity of the CIPN complaints by classification according to the NCIcommontoxicitycriteria(CTC)[ 25].

Con-sequently, there were no large margins for many patients toimproveconsiderably,andourstudyresultsmighthavebeeninfluencedbyaflooreffect. In spite of the limitation of this study, we are convinced that reporting negative results is of importance. Studies re-porting positive results are more likely to be published [ 29], while negative results more often have to be published in journals with lower impact factors [ 30]. By publishing our negative results, we hope our data will have an impact ont h ec r i t i c a ld i s c u s s i o no ns t u d yd e s i g n sa n da c u p u n c t u r econceptsforCIPN. In 2006, a small case series(=5) reported encour- agingly positive results on acupuncture without electricalstimulation for the treatment of CIPN [ 31]. All five patients showed improvements in pain, numbness, and tingling. Incontrast to our study, all patients suffered from painfulperipheral neuropathy with high symptom scores and weretreated over a time period of 12 weeks. The authors pointedo u tt h a tt h e ya r ec a r r y i n go u tal a r g e rt r i a l ,t h er e s u l t so fEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine eagerly awaited. A randomized controlled trial on acupuncture for the treatment of CIPN without electricalstimulation was conducted in Beijing, China. The authorsdescribe significant better treatment effects in the acupunc-ture group in relation to the control group treated withadenosylcobalamin [ 32]. A recently published small pilot study on acupuncture for the treatment of CIPN (=11) reportsimprovementsinnerveconductionstudiesaswellasinthesubjectiveratingofthepatients[ 33]. Several different acupuncture concepts have been used in the treatment of CIPN. Different to our protocol, other s t u d i e st h a tr e p o r t e dp o s i t i v ee ff e c t so fa c u p u n c t u r et r e a t - ments in CIPN used local points on the extremities like EX-LE 10 (Bafeng), EX-UE 9 (Baxie), and EX-LE 12 (Qiduan)[31,33-35] ear for neuropathic pain [ 36]. In particularthelocalpointsontheaffectedlimb/regionmightactivate local, segmental, and spinal and central reflexes inaccordancewithresultsonanimalmodels[ 20]. In traditional Chinese medicine an individualized approachwithpersonalizedacupuncturetreatmentisusuallyexpected, while in acupuncture studies there is the necessityof standardization of the procedures, as done in this study.So our results only indicate that our particular standardizedacupunctureprotocolmightnotbeeffectiveinthetreatmentof CIPN, but the results cannot be generalized to other acupunctureconcepts. This study was embedded in a routine care rehabilita- tion program delivered at a specialized clinic in SouthwestGermany. Participating patients came from many regionsin Germany and thus were only available for a three-weektreatmentandobservationperiod.Consideringthefrequentlong-term chronic course of the CIPN symptoms it cannotbe excluded that a longer treatment period might haveyieldeddifferentresultsforelectroacupunctureoroneoftheother therapies under study. Prior studies on acupuncturetreatment in peripheral neuropathy have shown that mea-surable results can only be found after a longer period oftreatment up to 10 weeks [ 17]. While peripheral neuropathy is a disease with structural damage of the nerves, any stablesuccessful treatment has to induce neuroregeneration. Thetimeoffunctionalrecoveryvaries,rangingusuallyfrom3to6 months, depending on the level of the lesion and factorsin regeneration [ 37]. So effects of treatment naturally take longer than in other indications of acupuncture treatmentwithfunctionalstateslikeinpainorvegetativeimbalance. All participating patients were not treated exclusively by the therapies under study but concomitantly receivedvarious medical and psychological interventions, dependingon the individual need of each patient. This included regu- lar participation in sport therapy sessions, psychoeducative groups, art therapies, ergotherapies, relaxation methods,physiotherapies, massages, and lymph drainages. Effects ofthese interventions may have contributed to a remarkablee ff e c ti nt h ep l a c e b og r o u p \u2014 a sw e l la st oa l lo t h e rg r o u p s \u2014thus possibly diminishing the estimated group differences.Positive effects of this program\u2014as delivered in the studycenter\u2014havealreadybeendemonstrated[ 38]. Nevertheless further studies are necessary, to evaluate the role of acupuncture in the treatment of CIPN. The use of nerve conduction studies as an objective parameter forthe evaluation of treatment effects [ 17]a sw e l la sr e c e n t l y introduced better outcome measures for the standardizationof studies of CIPN will be helpful to offuturestudies[ 39].8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Table8:Qualityoflife(EORTCQLQ-C30)day0-day21-day84.

CIPN involves damage to the peripheral nervous system and can produce severe neuropathic pain [2,3],sensorydeficits,orgaitimpairment[ 4]andcanseverely decrease the patient's quality of life [ 5]. Sensory symptomsusually develop before motor symptoms, because motor neuronsaremoremyelinated[ 6,7].Distalpartsoftheaxons are the first affected, so sensory symptoms typically startsymmetricallyandbilaterallyfromthetipsofthetoesandfin-gers and progress proximally in a \"stocking-glove\" distribu-tion [8]. The incidence of CIPN can reach a preexisting other cause of2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine peripheral neuropathy develop more severe and persistent CIPN[10-12]. The development of CIPN is usually dependent on the cumulative dose and symptoms may progressively aggravate[10]. After sustaining therapy symptoms are usually rever- sible, but in some cases they may be irreversible [ 10,13]a n d or the afferent andefferentdistalperipheralaxonsaredamaged[ 16]. Some differences concerning the mechanisms of CIPN aredescribedfordifferenttherapeuticdrugs. In platinum compounds the dorsal root ganglia are the main parts of the nervous systems that are injured [ 17]a n d apoptosis is induced via structural alterations of DNA andof cell-cycle kinetics [ 18], triggered by oxidative The taxanes and docetaxel are antitubulins and mainly damage the soma of the sensory neurons andthe nerve axons. This is induced by an interference withthe axonal transport, which is caused by enhancement ofmicrotubule polymerization [ 23]. Microglial activation in the spinal cord and high concentration in the dorsal root g a n gl iati s s u ei n d u c eC I P N[ 24]. Like platinum compounds, t a x a n e sc a nd a m a g ed o r s a lr o o tg a n g l i a .Th i si si n d u c e dby macrophage activation in the dorsal root ganglia tubulin dimers loss of axonal microtubules andalterations in their length, orientation areproduced [ 27,28]. This alters the neuronal cytoskeleton, leading to abnormalities in axonal transport and axonaldegeneration [ 28,29]. Decreasing affinity for tubulin of the different neurotoxicity are damage the ganglion soma cells andperipheral axons through disruption of microtubules of themitotic spindle and interfere with the axonal transport inthe neurons [ 31] and can also induce of tubulin dimers of eosinophilic material [ 36] and interferes with the transcription, nuclear processing and transport, as well as with the cytoplasmic translation of messenger RNAs [ 38,39].

Bortezomib can induce changes in all majorprimaryafferentfibres[ 41].

Noconclusive reports confirming their effectiveness have beenprovided [ 44,45] and a reduction of anticancer activity was suspected [ 46]. Several neurotrophins were tested but there wasnoevidenceofneuroprotection[ 47-50].Erythropoietin, amultifunctionaltrophicfactor,showedpromisingresultsinpreclinical studies [ 51,52] but has relevant safety problems [53]. Antioxidants have been tested as neuroprotectants [ 54- 59], but no conclusive evidence of neuroprotection has yet beenfound. Neuropathicpainisconventionallytreatedbyantiepilep- tic and tricyclic antidepressant drugs, but these drugs areineffective for treatment of decreased sensation and cannotinduce neuroprotection or neuroregeneration. Other com-pounds with different mechanisms (e.g., acetyl-L-carnitine,glutamate carboxypeptidase II inhibitors, calpain inhibitors,a solution of calcium and magnesium) have now beeninvestigated in preclinical stages with unknown value forclinicalroutine[ 59-63]. Thus specific and effective curative treatments for CIPN are lacking, especially those meant for enhancing neurore-generationorneuroprotection[ 64-67],andtheevaluationof further treatment options is of great importance. While the effectiveness of herbal treatment is not well known yet, thisreviewwasdonetoilluminatetheactualandpotentialfutureroleofherbaltreatmentinCIPN. 2. Methods To review the existing clinical and experimental studies ofherbal treatment in CIPN, a systematic literature searchwas performed from the databases from inception up untilJanuary 2013 using MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CochraneDatabase,CINHAL(CumulativeIndextoNursingandAlliedHealthLiterature),CNKI(ChinaNationalKnowledgeInfras-tructure),andWanfangMedOnlineandISIProceedingsforconferenceabstracts.Thekeywordssearchedwereasfollows: (Chinese herbs or herbs or plants or Chinese medicine as MeSH term) AND (neuropathy or chemotherapy).

Multiple clinical trialsexamined the effect on neuropathic pain and found positive effects on centraland peripheral neuropathic pain with different forms ofapplication[ 73-82]. 3.1.3. Matricaria chamomilla. Th i si sac o m m o n l yu s e d herb in western as well as in eastern phytopharmacologicaltradition. Flavonoids from Matricaria chamomilla seem to have an antispasmodic effect and main components such as-bisabolol or chamazulene have anti-inflammatory effects [83]. En-In-Dicycloether has both antispasmodic and anti- inflammatory effects together [ 84]. In a mouse model it was shown that Matricaria chamomilla extract- treated mice had a significant reduction of cisplatin-induced peripheral pain[85].Matricaria chamomilla hydroalcoholic extract was able inflammation betterthanmorphine[ 85]. 3.1.4.

The flavonoid apigenin, for example, has been shown to protectneurons against A-induced toxicity [ 116]. In addition to antioxidant activity, many salviaspecies and their isolated constituents showed anti-inflammatory properties [ 117,118].

A modification of this recipe was used in a Chinese randomized trial in which48 patients with ovarian cancer were examined parallel tochemotherapy with placitaxel. They were divided into atreatmentgroupwithpaclitaxelaloneandatreatmentgroupwith paclitaxel plus a combination of oral Chinese herbaldecoction treatment and external washing of half as in the patientstreatedadditionallywithChineseherbsasevaluatedbyclinicaltesting(<0.05)[94]. 3.2.4.

NGF was increased, substanceP decreased in the group treated with Geranii herba and Aconiti radix extract additionally to oxaliplatin compared to oxaliplatinalone[ 95]. In the following randomized clinical study 58 patients with CIPN from oxaliplatin, taxol, or capecitabine were assigned prospectively in a controlled randomized trial: 30 patientswereassignedtothestudygroupand28wereusedasa control.

GJG furtherratanimalstudiesshowedapositiveeffectofGJGoncoldallodynia[ 97]. 99,100]. In a noncontrolled study 14 patients received GJG every day after the first oxaliplatin infusion. GJG seemed to prevent acute oxaliplatin-inducedneurotoxicity [ 99]. In a retrospective analysis of 45 patients, 22 received GJG during their FOLFOX regimen against nonresectable or recurrent colorectal cancer, while 23 did not get this additional therapy. The incidence of grade 3PN in the GJG group was significantly lower than in the control group ( < 0.01 , log-rank test). The incidence of grade 3 PN after 10 courses of chemotherapy was 0% in the GJG group and 12% in the control group, and after 20 courses was 33% in the GJG group and 75% in thecontrol group [ 100]. A further retrospective analysis was performedin90patientswhoweregivenaFOLFOXregimen for metastatic colorectal cancer. Two treatment groups were compared: plus GJG and FOLFOX plus GJG plus Ca 2+/Mg+, and two control groups: FOLFOX without additional therapy and FOLFOX plus Ca2+/Mg+.W h e na cumulative dose of oxaliplatin exceeded 500mg/m2,t h e incidenceofPNwas91%intheFOLFOXwithoutadditional therapy group, 100% in the FOLFOX group with additional Ca2+/Mg+therapy, and 79% the plus Ca2+/Mg+group,respectively,and255mg/m2inbothcontrol groups.Theauthorsconcludedthatconcomitantadministra- tionofGJGreducedtheneurotoxicityofoxaliplatinwithout h a vi n gan e g a ti v ei n fl u e n c eo nth er e s po n ser a t e[ 101], so for further validation of these data a concept for a prospective, controlled,doubleblindedrandomizedstudywasdeveloped [130]. GJG was also tested for paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in breast and gynecological cancer. A retrospective study on 82 patients found that GJG was possibly effective for thetreatment and the prevention of peripheral neuropathy and seemed to be more effective when administered from the beginningofchemotherapyusingpaclitaxel[ 102]. In a prospective study in paclitaxel/carboplatin treated patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer, patients were randomly divided into two groups. 14 patients received vitamin B12 and 15 patients vitamin B12 plus GJG. The observation period was 6 weeks following treatment initi- ation. A NCI-CTCAE ( National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity criteria) grade 3 of neurotoxicity developed in 2 patients (14.3%) after 6 weeks in the vitamin B12, whereas no neurotoxicity was observed in the vitamin B12/GJG group. The change in the frequency of abnormal current perception threshold (CPT) ratio was significantly lower inthe VB12/GJG group in Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3.2.6.

This was supported by animal studies in a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced pain.

Tested or Herbal Ingredients for Neuropathic Pain, Not Specifically Tested to CIPN. Capsaicin is the active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging tothe genus Capsicum . Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain. Following applicationto the skin capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity, followedby a period with reduced sensitivity and, after repeatedapplications,persistentdesensitisation. Topical capsaicin is used to treat postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy and has been inmultipletrials.Therearerisksofepidermalinnervationuponrepeatedapplicationoverlongperiods[ 137].

One main problem of doing research on herbs and understanding the mechanisms of their action is the factthat herbs contain a number of active compounds and bytradition,especiallyinAsianherbaltherapy,combinationsofmultipleherbsarecommon. Classical research mainly focusing on a single active c o m p o u n dh a sb e e nd o n eo ft e nw i t h o u tr e g a r dt oh i s t o r i c a l knowledge of the therapeutic utility of the plant source[146]. This does not reflect the complexity of traditional Asian herbal recipes, while there is some evidence thatsingle components extracted from plants are less potentthan the complete extract [ 147] and a multitarget approach might be more effective than a single target approach [ 148]. Pharmacological mixtures can also have the advantage ofpotentiating the action of their multiple bioactive compo-nents and the option of an individualized therapy [ 149,150]. For scientific understanding of the mechanisms of actionthere is still a need for basic research on single herbs andt h e i ra c t i v ec o m p o u n d s ,b u tr e s e a r c hs h o u l dn o ts t o pa tthis level but continue with research of multicompounds, their interactions, and increasing or decreasing activity incombinations.

Active components are alkaloids, for example, aconitine by dynorphin, an endogenous opioid substance released byprocessed aconite [ 148]. hand, these effects werestronger,whenusingofthefullrecipeincomparisonto theuseof Aconitilateralispraeparataradix alone[155]. GJG is the best tested herbal recipe for CIPN. But not all details of its mechanism have been clearly identifiedand for some ingredients the effects are unknown. It isconsidered that the analgesic effect is exerted through theimprovement of peripheral nocireceptor sensitivity, vasodi-lation, and peripheral circulation by the promotion of NOproduction due to the effects of Alismatis rhizoma and Dioscorea opposita rhizoma m e d i a t e db yt h eb r a d y k i n i nB 2 receptor and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [ 148]. AnothersubstancefromGJG, Rehmanniaepraeparataradix, couldpromotethefunctionoflearningandmemoryofMSGrats, and its mechanism may be related to the increase oftheexpressionofhippocampalc-fosandnervegrowthfactor(NGF)[156],whichcanberelevantforregenerationinCIPN as well, while NGF exhibits potent biological activities suchaspreventingneuronaldeath,promotingneuriteoutgrowth,and supporting synapse formation [ 157].

GJG has also been compared to another herbal recipe, Shakuyakukanzoto, and both were found to be effective in the treatment of CIPN, but there was no negative controlgroup [107].Shakuyakukanzoto was analyzed in a mouse model[106]andinaretrospectiveanalysisof23caseswithout controls [ SinceShakuyakukanzoto contains only two herbs,Paeonia alba radix andGlycyrrhizae radix, the future evaluation of its role for treating CIPN might be easierthan for other herbal recipes. While neuronal apoptosiscan be triggered by oxidative stress and mitochondrialdysfunction, substances with an antioxidative potency arepossible candidates for CIPN [ 19-22], so the factthatpaeoniflorinasonebioactivecomponentof Paeonia albaradix has been positively tested as an antioxidant in a nonneuronal cell model might be relevant [ 159]. It has also neuroprotective effects which are closely correlated to acti-vating the adenosine A1 receptor, neurocytes, andpromoting nerve growth [ 160].Paeonia alba radix was used in another recipe (see Section3.2.7 )a n di nt w or e c i p e s Paeonia rubra radix (see Sections 3.2.1and3.2.2)h alba radix andPaeonia rubra radix have a lot of similarities in their components and paeoniflorin is abioactivecompoundofbothherbs[ 161].While the reason for using herbal recipes derives from historical knowledge or transferral of historical concepts tomodern diseases, interestingly four of eight herbal recipestested for CIPN contain Glycyrrhizae radix .T ofi n dt h e scientific ratio behind this decision, analyses of its action inthecontextofneuralcelldamagemightbefruitful. Another herb that has been used in four of eight herbal recipes tested for CIPN is Astragalus membranaceus radix . This might be rational, while Astragalus membranaceus radixwater extracts caused a marked enhancement of the NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth and the expression ofgrowth-associated protein 43 from PC12 cells in vitro [ 162]. Astragalus membranaceus radix extracts can be a potential nerve growth-promoting factor, being salutary in aiding thegrowth of axons in the peripheral nerve [ 162]. bioactive compound of Astragalus mem- branaceus radix ,i sa na l d o s e - r e d u c t a s ei n h i b i t o ra n daf r e e - radicalscavengerwhichsuppressedadecreaseinmyelinatedfibers, promoted an increase in myelinated fiber density andanincreaseinsegmentaldemyelinationindiabeticrats[ 163].

Theherbalrecipe BuYangHuan andamodifiedextension controlled randomized trials[92,93] (3.2.1 and 3.2.2, see above) and was found to be effective in both. The formula used is very complex, and little is known about the mechanism of its compound, combinationwherepossiblemechanismsaredescribed(3.2.1,3.2.2, 3.2.5, 3.2.7, see above), so at least something is knownaboutitspossiblemechanismsofeffect. Another study used a modified classical prescription namedChai Hu Long Gu Mu Li Wan (seeSection3.2.3 ) a n df o u n dp o s i t i v er e s u l t sa sw e l l[ 94]. Even though it is a controlled randomized trial, the treatment protocol is verycomplicated, combining oral intake of medical herbs andexternal washing with other herbs. So also with this herbalcombination little is known about the mechanism of itsaction. Two other herbal recipes have been reported for suc- cessful clinical use, Keishikajutsubuto =Gui Zhi Jia )andOgikeishigomotsuto= HuangQi Wu Wu Tang (seeSection3.2.7 ). But these studies are either uncontrolledoracasereport,sothequalityoftheevidenceisverylow. The trials on the single herbs and herbal combinations tested so far do not provide a clear recommendation forclinical use. But research on some single herbs as well as on combinationslikeGJGispromising,eventhoughthelevelof knowledgeislimitedtobasicresearchonthemechanismsofactionandevidencefromclinicaltrials.Butitisnecessarytocontinue research on this field, while treatment concepts forCIPNarelacking.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 11 The most used herbs of herbal recipes in clinical trials on ceusradix issupportingtheQi,whichmeansinwesternterms supporting the general energy level of the body, which isusuallyreducedinCIPNbyactivatingthevegetativenervoussystem.R e h m a n n i ap r a e p a r a t ar a d i x is basically supporting theYin,whichinwesterntermsreflectsthestructuraldamageof tissue, in the case of CIPN the peripheral nerves. Paeonia alba radix andPaeonia rubra radix promote the flow of the Xue, which in western terminology has its correlate inenhancing the microcirculation which might be reducedin enhance theregeneration. Aconiti lateralis praeparata radix supports in Chinese medicine theory the Yang. A typical symptom of Yang defi-ciencyisice-coldness,whichisprominentintheextremitiesinsomecasesofCIPN. Glycyrrhizaeradix supportsthefluids andhasabalancingeffectonthewholerecipe. So in spite of using different terms, Chinese medicine theory describes physical reactions of the body that can beexplained by western physiology and has found its proof byexperimentalstudies[ 138,139,148,151-156,159-164]. So using these herbs has as rational foundation on the basisofChinesemedicaltheoryaswellasfromexperimentalstudies, but unfortunately still little is known about thecomplex physiological mechanisms of herbal combinations,the interactions of the substances, and the mechanisms ofactionofmanyothersubstancesusedinherbalmedicine.Thechallengeforfutureresearchisbringinghistoricalknowledgeandmodernscientificanalysistogether. Duetothislimitedknowledgeonthemechanismsofthe action of herbs, we additionally collected data on herbs thatare a putative treatment option for CIPN. While oxidativestress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote CIPN, sub-stanceswithanantioxidativepotencyarepossiblecandidatesfor the treatment of CIPN. So in the list below we listherbalantioxidantstestedinneuronalcellordiseasemodels.Additionally we added herbs for enhancement of nervegrowthasputativetreatmentoptionsforCIPN.NGFexhibitspotentbiologicalactivitiessuchaspreventingneuronaldeath,promoting neurite outgrowth, and supporting synapse for-mation [157], which has a relevance for the development of CIPN[39]. Putative Herbs or Herbal Compounds for the Treatment of CIPN (1)Herbal Antioxidants Tested in Neuronal Herbal Compounds That Enhance Nerve Growth.C i s t a n c h e sh e r b a[ 157,188], Huperzine A or herbal combinations has to describe themechanismofactionforsingleherbsandsinglecomponents,investigate the interactions of combinations of substances,andanalysethepromotingeffectsofcombinations. From this viewpoint, research in this field has not very muchprogressed,butifresearchdoesnotprovidethesedata,herbal combinationswill not find acceptance in mainstreamtreatmentsinnon-AsiancountriesinEurope,NorthAmerica,orAustralia. Thischallengecouldbetakenifmoreinternationalcoop- erationofinterestedresearchgroupswouldbeorganized. 5. Conclusion Experimental and clinical studies have not yielded enoughevidence to establish a standard practice for the treatmentof CIPN, but from this literature review, a lot of promisingsubstances,mainlyChinesemedicalherbswithpossibleeffectinCIPNoraputativeinfluenceonmechanismsofCIPN,havebeenidentifiedinthelastyears. Theknowledgeofthemechanismsofactionisstilllimited and the quality of the clinical trials needs further improve-ment. In the future not only the mechanisms of action forsingleherbsandsinglecomponentshavetobedescribed,butinteractionsofcombinationsofsubstancesaswellasinterac-tionswithchemotherapyhavetobeinvestigatedandanalysedin depth. While CIPN has multiple possible mechanisms ofneuronaldegeneration,a combinationof componentsmightbe a promising opportunity focusing on Dutcher et al., \"Taxol produces apredominantlysensoryneuropathy,\" Neurology ,vol.39 ,no .3, pp.368-373,1989.

Introduction Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect after patient exposure to chemotherapyagents such as vinca alkaloids, platinum derivatives, andtaxanesandtoneweragentssuchasbortezomibandthalido-mide. CIPN is the second most important side effect infrequencyafterhematologictoxicityandcanlimitordelaythedoseofchemotherapythatcanbeadministered[ 1].Sensory, motor,and/orautonomicneurotoxicitycanbeverydisablingand/or painful, creating a major impact venouscalciumandmagnesium,withoutreducingtreatmentresponse. Pharmacological treatment of other CIPN symp- like numbness or palsies is not usually effective, butthere are some other options for treatment of neuropathicpainsuchastheuseofantiepilepticandtricyclicantidepres-santdrugs(e.g.,carbamazepine,lamotrigine,gabapentineorpregabalin,andvenflaxine).Thereisnoestablishedpharma-cologicaltreatmentforneuroregeneration[ 2,3]. The mechanism of neurotoxicity of the antineoplastic agents is unclear. CIPN generally arises as a consequence ofthe disruption of axoplasmic microtubule mediated trans-port, distal axonal degeneration, and direct damage sensory nerve cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglia(DRG).MitochondrialdamageintheDRGneuronhasbeendescribed as well [ 4]. The DRG neurons lack a vascular2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine barrier,incontrasttothoseinthecentralnervoussystem,and aremoreexposedtotheneurotoxiceffectsoftheantineoplas-tic agents. Both central and peripheral mechanisms seem tobeinvolved. Acupuncture stimulates areas of the skin using different methods including the insertion of thin needles that are thenmanipulatedmanuallyorelectrically.Inanimalmodels acupuncturehasbeenshowntoreduceneuropathicpaininavariety of experimental conditions. Cold allodynia has beenreduced in rats treated with electroacupuncture through themediation of spinal alfa2-adrenergic receptors [ 5], while in mechanicalallodyniaelectroacupuncturehasbeenshowntoa c tt h r o u g hm ua n dd e l t ab u tn o tk a p p ao p i o i dr e c e p t o r s[6]. Another possible effect of electroacupuncture in an experimental model of neuropathy may be the inhibitionof COX2 expression [ 7]. It has been shown at expression profile of hypothalamic proteins, that havebeen mainly identified as being involved in inflammatoryprocesses, metabolism and signal transduction [ 8]. Ko and colleagues[ 9]examinedthemechanismofneuropathicpain and the analgesic effects of acupuncture at the molecularlevel by cDNA microarray analysis. They observed that theexpression of 68 genes had more than doubled in a modelo fn e u r o p a t h i cp a i ni nt h er a tb u tr e t u r n e dt on o r m a lafter treatment with electroacupuncture. The genes wereinvolved in biological processes such as signal translation,gene expression, and nociceptive pathways [ 9]. Also the expressionofthesigmaopioidreceptorwasdecreasedby50% in the neuropathic pain model and was returned to normal after acupuncture. This could explain the poor responseof neuropathic pain to the treatment with opioids, sincet h eo p i o i dr e c e p t o ri sd o w n r e g u l a t e di nt h i sc o n d i t i o n ,a n dcould partially explain the analgesic action of acupuncturein neuropathic pain, because acupuncture normalises theopioid receptor expression and also increases the release ofendogenousopioidpeptides. Cancer patients often seek additional help for their disease or for treatment-related side effects. A Europeansurvey in 13 countries [ 10]s h o w e dap r e v a l e n c eo f3 5 . 9 %o f complementary therapy use (range among countries 14.8%to 73.1%). Acupuncture was used by 3.9% patients beforecancer diagnosis and by 3% patients after cancer diagno-sis. Acupuncture has also been shown to be effective forchemotherapyinducednauseaandvomiting[ 11],xerostomia induced by radiation therapy [ 12,13], fatigue [ 14], anxiety, depression, and insomnia [ 15]. Furthermore, acupuncture has been used encouragingly to treat peripheral neuropathyassociatedwithdiabetesandHIV[ 16-22]. In this paper the existing evidence of acupuncture effec- tiveness and/or efficacy for CIPN has been systematicallyreviewed. 2. Methodology To review the existing clinical and experimental studies ofacupuncture in CIPN, the systematic literature search wasperformed from the databases inception up until January2 0 1 2u s i n gM E D L I N E ,G o o g l eS c h o l a r ,C o c h r a n eD a t a b a s e , CINHAL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastruc-ture),WanfangMedOnline,andISIProceedingsforconfer-ence abstracts. The keywords searched were (acupoint OR acupuncture OR electro-acupuncture OR Wanfang Med Online Databases didnot allow logical searches with AND, so we used simplecombinations of the search words. Historical searches ofreference lists of relevant articles were also undertaken. Tobe included in the review, a study had to explore either theefficacyortheeffectivenessofacupunctureneedlingforCIPNineitherhumanoranimalmodelsirrespectiveofdesign.Allpapers with at least an abstract in English were included.Study selection was performed by two reviewers (GiovannaFranconi and Luigi Manni) with disagreement resolved bydiscussionandadjudication. 3. Results A total of 3989 articles were retrieved from electronic searches and subsequent examination of reference lists of the clinical and review articles. After screening titles and/orabstracts, 3891 articles were excluded for the following rea-sons: the focus was on an intervention other than acupunc-ture, the neuropathy was not related to chemotherapy, theacupuncture treatment plan included additional interven-tions/modalities that were not acupuncture related, therewere duplicated studies, or they were not relevant. Froma total of 98 articles which were retrieved for detailedevaluation, 7 clinical studies and 1 experimental study wereincludedinthereview.ForasummaryoftheclinicalstudiesseeTable 1. Only one study was identified that addressed the topic of electroacupuncture (EA) and its effects on CIPN in ananimal model. Meng and colleagues [ 30] demonstrated that EAatbothlow(10Hz)andhigh(100Hz)frequencieswasableto improve neuropathic pain in paclitaxel-treated ti sc o n c e i v a b l et h a tc e n t r a l - m e d i a t e de ff e c t so f acupunctureareinvolvedinsuppressionofneuropathicpaininCIPN. Forasummaryoftheclinicalstudiessee Table 1. Thefirstpublishedclinicalstudythatexploredtheefficacy ofacupunctureincancerpainusedauricularacupunctureina population of 90 patients with neuropathic pain (despitestable medication) [ 23]. A small minority of patients also presented nociceptive pain. The patients were randomlydividedinto3arms:onearmwithsteelimplantsonauricularpointselicitinganelectricalresponseand2placeboarmswitheither steel implants or vaccaria on response. Patients were treated for 2 one-month cycles. After 2 months the pain VAS score wassignificantly decreased in the true acupuncture group, whiletherewasnoeffectofplacebo. In one prospective case series 5 patients were treated with manual acupuncture for their chemotherapy-inducedneuropathy [ 24]. Acupuncture was performed once a week according improvement in pain score and on theWHOgradeofneuropathyaftertreatmentwithacupuncture.Therewerenoobservedsideeffects,andbenefitspersistedfor6monthsoffollowupin4/5patients. Xu et al. [ 25] studied 64 patients with CIPN induced by paclitaxel or oxaliplatin. The patients were randomizedto an acupuncture group or a control group treated withcobamamide. The acupuncture treatment performed for an unspec-ified length of time. The outcome was an evaluation of neurotoxicity assessed by a CIPN questionnaire. The twenty patients in the acupuncture group significantly improved,comparedtothe12patientsinthecontrolgroup. Ac a s er e p o r t[ 26] described one patient with multiple myeloma and bortezomib-induced CIPN who was treatedw i t h6w e e k l ys e s s i o n so fa c u p u n c t u r e ,f o l l o w e db ys u b -sequent 8 sessions over the next 5.5 months. The treat-ment protocol included body treatments. The patient remained pain-free for at least one year. There were no observed sideeffects. A retrospective case series examined 18 patients affected byCIPN[ 27].Patientsweretreatedby6weeklyacupuncture sessions, with acupoints selected on the basis of patientpresentation at each session. No validated questionnaireswere used, and side effects were not recorded. The mostcommonly used points were SP6 (Sanyinjiao) and ST36(Zusanli), followed by LV3 (Taichong). After 6 reported improvement of their neurop- athysymptoms,18%(=3)reportednochange. Inapilotcontrollednonrandomisedstudy[ 28],6patients with CIPN accepted acupuncture treatment, and 5 patientswithCIPNwhohadrefusedacupuncturetreatmentservedascontrols. All patients received the best medical care, and the6patientsintheacupuncturegroupwerealsotreatedwith10 weekly acupuncture treatments with a fixed protocol (ST34 Liangqiu,EX-LE12Qiduan,andEX-LE10Bafengbilaterally).Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were done to confirm thepresence of CIPN at baseline and 6 months later, that is, 3monthsaftertheendofacupuncturetreatment.Acupuncturesignificantly improved nerve conduction velocity and meanamplitude of NCS in treated patients, while there was nodifferenceafterthesametimeinthecontrolgroup.Therewerenoobservedsideeffects.4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The last study included in this review was a randomized controlled trial of 76 patients with gastrointestinal cancerand CIPN induced by oxaliplatin [ 29]. The intervention group received warm acupuncture and moxibustion, andthe control group was treated with Neurotropin 4mg givenintramuscularly every day for 21 days. The intervention receiving acupuncture and moxibustion reported a signifi- cantly improved quality of life and reduction in neurotoxicsymptoms. 4. Discussion Complementarytherapiesincancercareareusedprimarilytotreatthesymptomsassociatedwithcanceranditstreatments.Thisreviewsuggeststhatalthoughtherearesomeindicationsthat acupuncture may be effective in improving symptomsand neural damage associated with CIPN, the current evi-denceavailableislimited. The positive effects of acupuncture in CIPN consist in a reduction in the pain score in most studies. Painis the most common and the best studied indication foracupuncture, and acupuncture has been recommended as a complementary therapy for pain control or for reducing the amount of pain medicine in cancer patients. Accordingto the evidence-based guidelines of the American Collegeof Chest Physicians for lung cancer [ 32], acupuncture is recommended as a complementary therapy for lung cancerwhen pain is poorly controlled or when side effects such asneuropathyorxerostomiaareclinicallysignificant(grade1Arecommendation). The rationale is based on the analgesicactionofacupunctureinacuteandchronicpainandincancerpain.Furthermore,studiesonpainusingfunctionalmagneticresonance (fMRI) showed that acupuncture could modulatethecognitive-affectiveaspectsofpainperception[ 33]. Improvement was also reported for other symptoms of CIPN in the paper by Wong and Sagar [ 24], where the effects of acupuncture were measured by the WHO CIPNscore, which takes into account both the sensory and motorabnormalities of CIPN. One study [ 28]e v a l u a t e da c u p u n c - ture effects with nerve conduction studies, which alloweda separate measurement of motor and sensory signals andshowedasignificantpositiveeffectofacupunctureonmotorandsensoryparameters. The studies included in this systematic review were very heterogeneous: 3 studies [ 23,25,29]w e r ep r o s p e c t i v er a n - domizedcontrolledtrials,whileanother[ 28]wasaretrospec- tive analysis of a controlled study. These controlled studies showed a specific effect of acupuncture, unrelated to skinpenetration. The remaining studies were uncontrolled casereportsorcaseseries.Suchuncontrolledstudiesmaypresentbias and lead to false positive results. The issue of choosinga control in acupuncture research is not a simple one, asplacebo/sham acupuncture shares many pathways with trueacupuncture(i.e.,activationofopioidsystemaswellasotherpain-controllingneurotransmitterssystemsandactivationofcerebral areas on fMRI), the placebo/sham DifferentprotocolswereutilizedtotreatCIPN:auricular acupuncture only, and somatic acupuncture only, combinedauricular and body acupuncture, each applied on different combinations of acupoints. Acupuncture protocols are usu-ally standardized in acupuncture research, but this may notreflect what clinical acupuncturists do every day in theirclinics, as acupuncture in TCM is a very individualizedmedicine[ 38].Furthermorethechoiceofacupuncturepoints in a protocol depends on the reference system, which com- prises many different schools and different approaches toacupuncture, such as acupuncture according to traditionalChinese medicine, medical acupuncture, Japanese acupunc-ture, French auricular acupuncture, trigger-point acupunc-ture, acupressure, electroacupuncture, and stimulation (TENS) of acupuncture points,among others [ 39], each one with a different approach to comparableproblems.Futurestudieswithsufficientnumberof patients should also address the issue of whether a prag-maticapproachoraprotocolapproachshouldbeemployed. Heterogeneity was also present when considering the outcome measurements, which ranged from subjective eval-uationtopainVASscoretonerveconductionstudies(NCS),whichmakeitimpossibletocomparestudies.Moreobjectiveoutcome measurements are advisable, and among themNCS which measures the number and conduction velocitiesof large myelinated fibers and relates to both the clinicalsubjectiveimprovementandthehistologicalnervehealing. Neuronaldamagebyantineoplasticagentsprobablyacti- vates second messenger systems which cause hyperalgesia,allodynia, and pain, because it may be relieved by supple-mentation with trophic factors such as NGF, insulin growthfactor 1 (IGF-1), and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) [ 41-44]. NGF promotes physiological maturation, survival,andexpressionofthespecificphenotypeinprimarysensory neurons located in the DRG [ 45]. Acupuncture analgesia is an effect that has been amply demonstrateda n do c c u r sv i at h ea c t i v a t i o no fd i ff e r e n ts y s t e m s ,i n v o l v i n gnerves, hormones, cytokines, and other mediators [ growth factor (IGF) [ 53]. It is possible that the action of acupunc- t u r eo nn e u r o p a t h i cp a i nb em e d i a t e db ye n h a n c e m e n to fspinal/central GABA-ergic, serotoninergic, and adrenergicneurotransmission [ 54-58]a sw e l la sb yt h ea c t i o no f acupuncture on the NGF system, driving NGF signallingtoward its downregulation with parallel decrease in sen-soryneuronshypersensitization[ 59].Thus,acupuncturecan modify the expression of different genes and the expressionof genes that control transcriptional factors that are crucialfor cell homeostasis [ 60]. InFigure1,w es u m m a r i z e dt h e acupuncture mechanisms and mediators in CIPN based onwhat we know from animal studies of diabetic neuropathy[59,61] and from human studies of brain imaging during acupuncture[ 62]. It is interesting to note that all the studies which used somatic acupuncture and described their protocol [ 24,26- 28] employed local points.

The limitationsof the studies reviewed include the small sample size of most studies, the presence of poor controlsor no controls, poor randomization, and lack of blinding.However,thepresenceofsomestudiesofgoodqualitywhich suggestapositiveeffectofacupunctureinCIPNsupporttheplanning of more rigorous randomised controlled clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in CIPN. The advantages of acupuncture are its safety and low cost, and itwould be very important to demonstrate its efficacy in sucha disabling and potentially dangerous side effect of cancertreatmentsuchasCIPN.

Introduction Traditional medicinal plants belong to the characteristics of mostculturesonthisearth.Medicinalplantshelpedtosecuresurvival of our ancestors in a noncivilized world, which was not dominated by the technological achievements of the 20th and 21st centuries. Medicinal plants were not onlyindispensable for as basic health care of indigenous tribes in former ages as modern medicine was not in place. Even nowadays, phytotherapy is still used by a majority of the world's population. Over 50,000 plants would possess ther-apeutic virtues in the world and about 80% of humanuse herbal medicines at least once in their life [ 1,2]. Thepharmacological screening of plants is an important mean forthediscoveryofnew,safe,andeffectivedrugsinclassicalpharmacology [ 3]. Hence, it comes as no surprise that research on medicinal plants and natural products derivedfromthemexperiencesathrivingrevivalinthepastyears. Complementaryandalternativemedicineandtraditional medicinesarewellacknowledgedamongthegeneralpopula-tioninindustrializedcountries[ 4,5].Manypatientsusecom- effective productsfromcomplementaryandalternativemedicine.Clinicaltrialsandcellularandmolecularmechanisticstudiesonmedicinal2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine herbs will help to improve their rational use and to better understandtheirmodesofaction.Thiswasthemotivationformanyscientistsfrompharmacyandpharmacology,includingour own group, to investigate the bioactivity of medicinalplants and phytochemicals isolated from them using tech-niques of molecular pharmacology and molecular biology [6-11]. With a strong commitment to traditional Chinese medicine[ 12-14]andtraditionalAfricanmedicineinthepast years[15-17],wenowfocusontraditionalKoreanmedicine. TraditionalKoreanmedicineiswidelyusedinKoreaand is the primary health care system for more than 20% ofthe population [ 18,19]. Demographic studies confirm that traditional Korean medicine flourishes in modern Korea.Oneregionalsurveyfoundthat36%oftheKoreanpopulationhadusedcomplementaryandalternativemedicineina5-yearperiod, although traditional Korean medicine use was notspecified [ 20]. Forty percent of hypertensive patients used complementary and alternative medicine including tradi-tional Korean medicine after discharge from hospitals [ 18]. A South Korean national survey was performed among 79%of people who are older than 18 years old and have healthproblems within one year. The result showed that 40% ofthose did not do anything, 23% of them visited westerndoctors' offices or western hospitals, and 19% used comple-mentaryandalternativemedicineonly(includingtraditionalKoreanmedicine),with18%usingbothwesternmedicalandTKMservice[ 20]. It was reported that excessive angiogenesis is an impor- tantfactorofthepathogenesisofmanyindustrializedwesterncountries [ 21]. Plants with anti-angiogenesis macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and Basedontheantiangiogenicactivityoftheplantextracts in a modified in vivochicken chorioallantoic membrane assay,selectedphytochemicalswereanalyzedinmoredetail.A molecular docking approach was applied to investigate in silicothe binding of selected phytochemicals to the vascular angiogenesis-regulating genes was correlatedto the IC 50values of 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, USA, for selected phytochemicals derived fromtraditional Korean medicine to identify possible cellularfactorsassociatedwiththeirantiangiogenicactivity. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant Material and Extraction. Medicinal plants used in the present work were collected at different localities ofSouth Korea and provided by Professor Ik-Soo Lee (CollegeofPharmacy,ChonnamNationalUniversity,Gwangju,SouthKorea).Theplantswereidentifiedatthenationalherbarium,where voucher specimens were deposited under the refer-ences numbers (see Supplementary Table 1 in SupplementryMaterials available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/ 131306). The extraction of the air-dried and powdered plantmaterial was conducted using methanol (HPLC grade) with eitherASE300(Dionex)orasonicator(BransonUltrasonics)at50 C.Theextractswerethenconservedat4Cuntilfurther use. 2.2.AngiogenesisTest 2.2.1. Cultivation of Quail Eggs. Quail eggs were cultured accordingtoadescribedmethod[ 27].Briefly,fertilizedquail eggs were incubated for 70h at 38Ca n d8 0 %r e l a t i v e humidity.After70hofincubationtheeggswereopened.Fort h i sp u r p o s e ,t h ee g g sw e r ep l a c e di nav e r t i c a lp o s i t i o nt oguaranteethattheembryofloatsintheupperpartoftheegg.Afterwards,aholewascutintothetopoftheeggandthecom-plete content of the egg, was transferred into a Petri dish. Byusing this method, it could be guaranteed that the albumingets first into the Petri dish followed by the yolk with theembryoontopwithoutexposingtheembryotoshockforceswhichcoulddamagethevitellinemembrane. 2.2.2.ChickenChorioallantoicMembraneAssay(CAMAssay). Plant extracts were tested for their antiangiogenic effects on quaileggsaspreviouslydescribedforchickeneggswithmod-ifications[ 28,29].Briefly,theexplantedembryowasplacedin an incubator for 2h at 38 Ct oa c c l i m a t i z ei tt ot h en e w ambience. Subsequently, the test substances were placed onthe CAM. Therefore, 2% agarose solution was prepared andmixed1:10withtheplantextractpriordilutedinDMSO0.1%final concentration. The final concentration of the extractwas 10g/mL. Pellets with 0.1% DMSO served as control. The agarose-pellets were then placed on the CAM after theycooled down to room temperature. The Petri dishes withthe quail embryos were placed in the incubator again andincubated at 38 C and 80% relative humidity for 24h before documentingtheeffectoftheappliedsubstances. Imaging of the vascularized quail eggs was performed usingadigitalcamerawith3xmagnificationobjective(Can-on eos 500 with a Canon mp-e 65 2.8 macro objective). Forillumination, a mercury arc lamp was used which provideda high fraction of blue and UV light to obtain good con-trast values between yolk and vessels. The pictured imagesectionhadasizeof5\u00d75mm.Followingimageacquisition, quantitativeanalysiswasperformedusingaroutinesoftwarewhich was written in the ImageJ-macro language, then thetotal small vessel number (or area) was then determined by the system, and the percentage inhibition of vascularization wascalculated[ 30]. 2.3.

Pearson'scorrelationtestwasusedtocalculate significance values ANOVA at endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1-TK)structure was retrieved from PDB database (PDB code:3HNG), which was submitted in complex with N-(4-chlo-rophenyl)-2-[(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amino]benzamide).Chem-Spider and PubChem were referred for the 3Dstructures of control drugs and the Korean medicinecompounds.Moleculardockingcalculationswereperformedwith AutoDock4 [ 35]. Axitinib, which is an antiangiogenic compound and a known VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 inhibitor,was selected as the control drug to compare the binding energies and the docking sites of the candidate ligands. The residues of VEGFR1, which the N-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amino]benzamide and controldrugs in the literature make hydrogen bond with, wereselected for the defined docking. Drug binding residues ofVEGFR1 drug interaction residues forVEGFR2 were Leu 840, Ala 866, Lys 868, Leu 889, Ile 892,Phe918,Cys919,Leu1019,Leu1035,Cys1045,Asp1046,and Phe1047. Grid maps were created covering those residues. For the docking calculations, the number of energy evaluationswas set to 2,500,000 and the number of runs was set to100. The lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was chosen for thedocking calculations. For the visualization of the dockingresults, AutoDock Tools and Visual Molecular Dynamicswere used. The surface representation image showing thebindingpocketofhumanVEGFR1-TKwasmadewithVMDsoftwaredevelopedwithNIHsupportbythetheoreticalandcomputational biophysics group at the Beckman Institute,UniversityofIllinoisatUrbana-Champaign. 3. Results 3.1. Antiangiogenic Activity In Vivo.

Five compounds were found in the databaseandwereexemplarilyselectedaspossibleantiangio-genic candidate these phytochemicals were with the baseline mRNA expression levels of 89 genesinvolvedinangiogenicpathwaysfortheNCIpaneloftumorcell lines by the Pearson rank correlation test. Only thosegenes,whoseexpressioncorrelatedwith >0.3or<0.3 with the IC 50values of the five compounds were considered forfurtheranalyses( Table 2). The gene expressions of these genes were then subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis. The dendrograms for ver- bascoside, apigenin, and emodin are shown in Figure5.T o investigate whether these gene expression profiles containrelevant information, we correlated them with the distribu-tion of IC 50values for these three compounds of the cell lines.TheIC50valuesthemselveswerenotusedforgenerationof the cluster dendrograms. Therefore, we could address the questionwhetherornotthegeneexpressionsalonepredictedtheresponseofthecelllinepaneltothesephytochemicals.Asshown in Table 3, the distribution of the cell lines sensitive or resistant to the three natural products was significantlydifferent,indicatingthattheseangiogenesis-regulatinggenesindeed determined the response of tumor cells to verbas-coside, apigenin, and emodin. These analyses were alsoperformed for resveratrol and eriodictyol tetraacetate, butsignificantrelationshipswerenotfound,indicatingthatthesegene expression profiles were not predictive for response oftumorcelllinestothesetwocompounds( Table 3). 3.3.MolecularDockingofPhytochemicalsfromKoreanPlants to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Since antiangiogenic effects may not only be mediated by up- or downregulation of geneexpressions but also by direct binding to angiogenic tar-get molecules, we addressed the question whether the fiveselectedphytochemicalsmaybindtoVEGFR1andVEGFR2.For this reason, we applied an in silicomolecular docking approach. As a control drug, we used axitinib, h o l e p l a n t HH HO OHHO O OOH HO O OO O O OO O OOOH HOO OOH cophores of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Remarkably, all fivenatural products bound to the same pharmacophores asaxitinib, albeit at lower binding affinities ( Table 4). Erio- dictyol tetraacetate showed the lowest binding energy forbothVEGFR1andVEGFR2.QuercetinmightbeanefficientVEGFR1 inhibitor since it made hydrogen bond with drugbinding residues (Glu878 and Cys912) with low bindingenergy. Apigenin was observed to make hydrogen bondwith drug to be a promising candidateas an antiangiogenic compound. Moreover, it was foundthat resveratrol interacted with VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 withhigh affinity showed moderately low bindingenergiescomparedtoothercompounds.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 Table 3: Separation of clusters of the NCI cancer cell lines obtained b y hierarchical cluster analysis for selected phytochemicals from antiangiogenic plants derived from traditional Korean medicine.

Antiangiogenic com- poundsaregainingmoreandmoreinterestasanewapproachinthepreventionandtreatmentofcancerandinflammatorydiseases [ 48]. The CAM assay is a sensitive, easily feasible, andcheap invivotestforinvestigationsoftheantiangiogenic potential of individual compounds and plant extracts [ 49]. The assay does not only provide information on the efficacyoftestsamples invivobutalsoontheirtoxicity invivo. Tothebestofourknowledge,theirantiangiogenicprop- erty is being reported here for the first time. The best anti-angiogenic effect was recorded with the extract from Acermono(11.14% proliferation), this activity being better than thatofcaptopril(23.54%proliferation),highlightingitspossi- bleimportanceincancertherapy.Captoprilservedascontroldrug, since its antiangiogenic activity is well known and thedrug also inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM-assay [ 50,51]. Schisandra chinensis exhibited a good but different extent of angiogenesis inhibition with both leaves and stems extracts,strengthening the hypothesis that it is necessary to screenvarious plant organs when evaluating their pharmacologi-cal activities. A comparison of our Korean plant extractsshowed that there was no correlation between cytotoxicityand antiangiogenic activity [ 52]. Therefore, these extracts mightnotonlybeusedtoinhibitangiogenesisintumorsbutalso for treatment of noncancerous diseases such as diabeticretinopathy or macular degeneration.

It is reason- abletospeculatethatplantextractswithantiangiogenicprop-erties may not only be candidate for cancer therapy but alsofortherapeuticapplicationsinophthalmology. 4.2. Microarray-Based Gene Expression Profiling. In the presentinvestigation,theIC 50profilesoffivephytochemicalsfor the panel of 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, were correlated with the microarray-basedexpression profiles of the cell lines. The intention was toidentifymoleculardeterminantswhichpredictsensitivityorresistance of tumor cells to these compounds. This concept was developed in the 1990s at the DevelopmentalTherapeu- ticsProgramoftheNCItoextractmeaningfulinformationoflarge-scale drug screenings [ 53]. During the past years, this concept provided a fertile ground to unravel mechanisms ofaction of new drugs and to use gene expression profiles forthe prediction of chemosensitivity of tumor cells [ 54-56].

In the present investigation, we focused on compounds derived from traditional Korean medicine. It was a strikingfeature that genes with diverse functions correlated with theresponse of the NCI cell apigenin, emodin, quercetin, eriodictyol, and resvera-trol). This result may be taken as a hint that these naturalproducts affect several targets and intracellular signalingpathways.

While some scientists from conventional academic medicine have called natural products as \"dirty drugs\" for their multiplemodes of action, the past years of intense research on syn-thetic and monospecific drugs showed that synthetic drugsare not superior. Tumor cells readily develop resistance tomonospecific drugs, for example, by point mutations in thecorresponding target proteins preventing drug binding, bydownregulation of target gene expression, or by activationof alternative signaling routes and bypassing of inhibitedpathways [ 75]. The probability is much less that tumor cells escape treatment with multifactorial drugs, since resistancetoonemodeofdrugactiondoesnotaffectthedrug'sactivity onothercellularsignalingpathways.Thefactthatorganismsdevelopedrathermulti-thanmonotargetcompoundsduringe v o l u t i o no fl i f eo ne a r t hm a yb et a k e na sac l u et h a tt h econceptofmultitargetedtherapyissuperior[ 76,77]. 4.3. Molecular Docking of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Antian- giogenic compounds may not only exert their blood vesselinhibiting effects by up- or downregulation of angiogenesis-regulating genes, but also by targeting and binding tokey regulators of angiogenesis. The specific targeting ofgrowth factor receptors by therapeutic antibodies and smallmoleculesiscurrentlyoneofthemostthrivingfieldsindrugdevelopment with a plethora of new drugs on the market.This is also true for antiangiogenic therapies [ 22].

ThenumberofVEGFRinhibitorswassteadilyincreasing over the past few years [ 78]. One of them is axitinib, which specifically binds to all three VEGF receptors, VEGFR1,VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 [ 79,80]. Therefore, this drug served as control for our bioinformatical docking studies.

Objective.ToconductacomprehensivePRISMA-compliantsystematicreviewandmeta-analysistoevaluatetheefficacyandsafety of Chinese medicines (CMs) as adjuvant for unresectable HCC during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods. Main databases were searched up to October 2012 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of CMs plus TACE on unresectable HCC compared with TACE alone. References of relevant reviews and eligible studies were also assessed.Riskratioswith95%confidenceintervalsandmeandifferencewerecalculated.Heterogeneityandpublicationbiaswereexamined. Results.Sixty-seventrials( N=5,211)wereincludedinthemeta-analysis.Se nsitivityanalysisandrandom-effectsmodel were performed for assessing significant heterogeneity. CMs plus TACE showed beneficial effects on tumor response, survival at 6,12,18,24,and36months,qualityoflife,andTACEtoxicityreductioncomparedwithTACEalone. Conclusion .Theresultsshow that the use of CMs may increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of TACE in treating patients with unresectable HCC. Thesefindings suggest that CMs could be considered as an adjuvant therapy for unresectable HCC patients during TACE. Larger-scale Annually, more than 748,000newcasesarediagnosedand695,000diedwithliver cancer. HCC is mostly unresectable as many were detectedat advanced stage with poor liver function, high tumor recurrence rate, and metastasis [ 3]. As most HCC patients arenotsuitablecandidatesforcurativeresection,transarterialchemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly usedfor unresectable HCC patients as a primary and palliativetherapybecauseofimprovementinsurvival[ 4-6].However,severe side effects including liver and renal failure, bone marrow depression, postembolization syndrome, and liverabscesswereobservedwiththeuseofTACE[ 4,7]. Chinesemedicines(CMs)werecommonlyusedintreat- ingHCCwithsideeffectsseldomreported.Increasingnum-ber of studies was conducted in assessing the effects of CMson HCC. Experimental studies found the chemopreventiveeffects and anti-HCC properties of CMs mainly through systematic review was conducted2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) [ 82]. Moreover, two of these reviews included nonrandomized controlled trialswhich probably overestimated the beneficial effects of CMs[79,81]. Another review had not focused on specific stage of HCC [ 80]. In addition, a significant proportion of related randomized controlled trials (RCTs), especially those pub- lishedrecently(2007afterward,27studies),werenotincludedin these reviews. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensiveandPRISMA-compliantsystematicreviewandmeta-analysisto investigate the efficacy of CMs on unresectable HCCincludingupdatedtrialspublishedafter2007.Specifically,weaimtocriticallyappraisetheefficacyandsafetyofCMsasanadjuvanttherapyforunresectableHCCpatientsduringTACEtreatmentfocusingonoutcomesofsurvival,tumorresponse,qualityoflife(QoL),andTACEtoxicity. 2. Methods This systematic review was conducted according to thePRISMAstatement[ 82]. 2.1. Search Strategies. TCMOnline(1949-2012),ChineseMedicalCurrentContents(CMCC, 1994-2012), and WanFang Data (1989-2012) weresearchedforeligiblestudies.Thelatestsearchwasperformedon languageand publication type. Free-text and MeSH terms were usedwhen allowed. The search strategies in Chinese and Englishwere slightly adjusted to suit the instructions of differentdatabases. 2.2. Study Selection Criteria. Eligible RCTs examining the e ffi c a c yo fC M sp l u sT A C Ei nt r e a t i n gu n r e s e c t a b l eH C Cwere assessed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) RCTs; (b) participants in treatment group received combination therapy consisting of CMs and TACE and TACE alone incontrol group; (c) participants had unresectable or stage IIoraboveprimaryHCCwhichwereconfirmedbycytologicalor pathological results, or met the criteria of the Europeanassociation for the study of the liver guideline; (d) reporteddataonatleastoneoftheoutcomesincludingsurvival,tumorresponse,QoLusingtheKarnofskyperformancescale(KPS),orTACE-relatedtoxicity. Primary outcomes were 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month, and 36-month survival and tumor response.SecondaryoutcomesincludedKPS(QoL)andTACEtoxicity.Survival was defined as the number of patients in eachi n t e r v e n t i o ng r o u pw h ow e r ea l i v ea t6 ,1 2 ,1 8 ,2 4 ,o r3 6 months. Tumor response has to be assessed using the WorldHealthOrganization(WHO)criteria,whichwerecommonlyusedtoevaluatetherapeuticefficacyonsolidtumors[ 83,84]. According to the results of CT and/or MRI, the efficacy ofanticanceragentswasclassifiedasfollows:completeresponse (CR) refers to the disappearance of all visible tumor lesions; partial response (PR) refers to 50% or more decrease inthe lesions; no change (NC) refers to either less than 50%decrease in total tumor size or at least 25% increase in thelesions; and progressive disease (PD) refers to at least 25%increaseinthesizeofthelesions.Tumorresponsewasdefineda sC Rp l u sP Ra n dc o m p a r e db e f o r ea n da ft e rt r e a t m e n t .TACE-related toxicity including gastrointestinal and bonemarrowtoxicitieswasevaluatedusingthe5-pointWHOscale(grade0-4)onreportingacuteandsubacutetoxiceffects[ 85]. Exclusioncriteriaincludedthefollowing:(a)usingother complementarymedicinesintreatmentorcontrolgroup;(b)metastatic HCC; (c) inconsistency of reporting on methods,results,orboth;and(d)duplicatedorredundantpublications. 2.3. Study Selection. All searched titles and abstracts were screened independently by two authors (Fan Cheung andXuanbinWang)accordingtothepredefinedeligibilitycriteria.Disagreements were resolved by consensus or consulting athirdauthor(YibinFeng).Fulltextsofthepotentiallyeligiblestudies were retrieved and further assessed by these twoauthors (Fan Cheung and XuanbinWang) using the samemethod. 2.4. Data Extraction. Data of the included studies were extracted independently and cross-checked by two authors(FC and XBW) using a standardized extraction form whichwasgeneratedattheprotocolstage.Theextracteditemscom-prised (1) authors and year of publication; (2) study design;(3) participant characteristics; (4) intervention details, and(5)outcomemeasures. 2.5. Study Quality Assessment. Study quality was indepen- dently evaluated by two authors (Fan Cheung and Xuanbin-Wang) using the six dimensions of Cochrane \"risk of bias\" assessment [ 114]. The assessment criteria included sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incompleteoutcome data, selective outcome data, and other bias. Eachdimension was rated as \"yes\" (low risk of bias), \"unclear\"(unclearriskofbias),or\"no\"(highriskofbias).Studieswith3 or more \"yes\" were classified as high quality with low risko fb i a sa n d0 - 2p o o rq u a l i t yw i t hh i g hr i s ko fb i a s .A sb i a sofblindingmaybemoresevereforsubjectiveoutcomes(e.g.,QoL)thanforobjectiveoutcomes(e.g.,survivalandtumourresponse), separate analyses for different outcomes wereconductedasrecommendedbyCochranecollaboration[ 114]. 2.6. Statistical Analysis. Review Manager 5.1 (The Nordic CochraneCentre,Copenhagen,Denmark)wasusedfordataanalysis. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals(CIs)andmeandifference(MD)werecalculatedfordichoto-mous and continuous data, respectively.

Results A total of 2802 potential trials were identified for thisreview, of which 891 were duplicate records and 1514 wereexcluded because of narrative/systematic review, nonclinicaltrials, irrelevance, no comparison group, or not meeting theinclusion criteria of this study ( Figure1). The full text of 397 articles was retrieved for further evaluation, of which 330 were excluded for the reasons of not RCTs ( =101), not according to the inclusion criteria ( =255 ), incomplete outcome data (=3), or duplicate publication (=1). Finally, 67 RCTs with a total of 5211 patients (study samplesizerangedfrom25to236)[ 8-74]wereincludedinthisstudy. Twooftheincludedstudieswereretrievedfromtherelevantreviewsandstudies[ 20,21]. 3.1. Study Descriptions. All studies were conducted in hos- pital settings in China, of which 6 were multicentre studies[18,36,39,57,58,67] and the remaining were single-centrestudies (Table 1). All studies adapted parallel-arm group design.Nearly,allstudies,exceptone[ 18],werepublishedin Chinese from 1999 to 2011. Participants aged from 18 to 78yearsold.Nearhalf(=32)describedtheenrollmentcriteria (diagnosis,inclusionandexclusioncriteria).

The duration of CMs treatmentrangedfrom14daysto3years. 3.2. Methodological Quality. Of the 67 included studies, only 15 studies reported the methods of allocation sequencegeneration, which included using a random number table [11,26,43,60,65], drawing of lots [ 17], shuffling [ 30,63], and referring to thesequenceofadmission[ 12,49,64,69,70].Theremaining 52 studies described that the participants were \"randomlyallocated,\" but the allocation procedures were not reported.None of the studies mentioned the method of allocationconcealment. Twenty studies reporting objective outcomeswereratedasatlowriskofblindingbias.Moststudies(82%)reported no significant difference of baseline characteristics.Nostudydescribedintention-to-treatanalysis.Only6studies[21 ,38,47,59,60,65] reported the informationof dropouts, inwhich3studies[ 21,38,59]providedreasonsofwithdrawal.

Thirty-nine studies(58%) were rated as at low risk of bias for selective outcomedata, 3 (4%) at high risk, and 25 (37%) did not providesufficientinformationtopermitjudgment.Consequently,29studies were assigned as high quality with a low risk of bias(Table 2). 3.3.Meta-AnalysisofPrimaryOutcomes 3.3.1. Tumor Response (Short-Term Effectiveness). Fifty-eight RCTs involving 4482 participants reported tumor responseas an outcome for testing the short-term effect of CMsplusTACE(combinationtherapy).Thecombinationtherapywas found to be superior to TACE alone in increasing theshort term effectiveness (RR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.25 to 1.41; <0.00001 )(Figure2). The fixed-effect model was used to combine the data, whereas both 2and2test suggested a lowriskofheterogeneity(=1.00;2=0%). 3.3.2. Survival (Long-Term Effectiveness). Thirty-two trials presenting3038participantsreportedthenumberofpatientssurviving for 6 to 60 months. Survival at 48 and 60 monthswere not evaluated as only 1 study [ 45]r e p o r t e dt h er e s u l t son this. Significant increases of survival at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months for combination therapy were found with corre-spondingRRs(95%CI)of1.12(1.07to1.16),1.39(1.31to1.48),1.89 (1.44 to 2.49), 1.75 (1.55 to 1.97), and 2.51 (1.97 to 3.19),all<0.00001 (Figure3). The results were homogenous althoughsignificantheterogeneitywasobservedforsurvival at 18 months (=0.03; 2=63%). However, similar estimates (RR 2.52; to KPS. KPS was measured in 36 studies for assessing the effect on QoL, in which continuous data was reportedin 9 studies (=477 participants) and dichotomous data (KPS>10) reported in 27 studies (=2041 participants). Significant differences in favor of combination therapy werefound for continuous outcome of KPS <0.00001, 2=95%).

Discussion TACE is one of the few therapeutic treatments for unre-sectable HCC patients. Although CMs are increasingly used toenhancethetreatmenteffectsofTACEandreducetheside effects,theeffectivenessisuncertainastheupdatedevidence hasnotbeensystematicallysummarized. This is the first PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis for examining the efficacy of CMs plus TACE (combination therapy) in treating unresectable HCC patients. Sixty-seven studies involving 5,211 participantsmet the study selection criteria. The meta-analysis showed that thecombinationtherapywassignificantlybetter thanTACEalone in increasing tumor response, prolonging survival, improving QoL, and reducing TACE toxicity. CM-related sideeffectsweremildandrarelyreportedinthestudies.The above findings suggested that CMs might play a potentiallybeneficial role in assisting TACE therapy to improve tumorresponse, survival, and QoL, as well as reduction in TACEtoxicity. The results are robust as the analyses were based on 67 RCTs with a large sample size of more than 5000 subjects, and both short-term (tumor response, QoL, and TACE toxicity reduction) and long-term (survival) effectivenesswere assessed. Although most of the included studies ( = 66) were published in Chinese, the trials in this review represent the best available evidence on the efficacy of CMsasanadjuvanttherapyforunresectableHCCpatientsduringTACEtreatment.Moreover,thisreviewwasconductedusingcomprehensive, rigorous, and PRISMA-compliant methods.AnextensivesearchwasconductedforRCTspublishedbeforeOctober 2012. Between-study heterogeneity was furtherassessed by sensitivity analysis and random-effects model.Publication bias was investigated by both visual funnel plotsandEgger'stest.ConsiderablevarietyintheingredientsoftheCMformu- laewasfoundinthisreviewwhichmightbeduetodifferentTCM diagnosis and the CM practitioners' personal expe- rience. However, a common consensus in TCM diagnosis and treatment principle was observed among the includedtrials.Accordingtoourreview,CMherbsmightenhancethetumorresponsebyinhibitingtumorangiogenesisandcancercellproliferation,inducingapoptosis,andincreasingimmuneresponse( Table 3).Theenhancementoftumorresponsemay contribute to the improvement of survival. Moreover, CMsmayreducetheacuteandsubacuteadversereactionsinducedby TACE, thus improve the QoL. Further investigation onthetherapeuticmechanism,pharmacokinetics,pharmacody-namicsandtheirpossibleactivecomponentsofthefrequentlyused herbs could bring new insight into the treatment ofHCC. 4.1. Limitations. Although extensive searches and strict methodswereusedtoselectstudiesandestimatetheeffects,there are several potential limitations. First, only studiespublished in English or Chinese were included, and studiesp u b l i s h e di no t h e rl a n g u a g e sc a n n o tb ea s s e s s e d .S e c o n d ,a smost studies were conducted among Chinese, the general-izability to other population needed to be further assessed.Third, clinical heterogeneity may be detected as CM prepa-rations, dose, and treatment duration are varied across the includedstudies.Furtherstudiesarewarrantedtoinvestigate the effects of different CM preparations in treating middleo rl a t es t a g eH C C .F o u r t h ,s a m p l es i z e ,s e l e c t i o nc r i t e r i aof subjects, and TACE drugs varied across the includeds t u d i e s ,a n dt h eh e t e r o g e n e i t yw a sn o tr e fl e c t e di nt h edata analyses. Fifth, most of the studies did not report themethodofrandomization,andallstudiesfailedtoreportthemethod of allocation concealment and blinding (subjectiveoutcomes), which might lead to the 4.2.ImplicationsforPracticeandResearch. Asmostincluded u d i e sh a v ep o o rq u a l i t y ,f u t u r et r i a l ss h o u l db er i g o r -ously implemented using standard procedures following a standardized trial protocol (e.g., consolidated standards of reporting trials statement) [ 117,118]. Another crucial issue is the quality control of CM preparations which consist of various CMs from different batches. As different propertiesof CMs might exist in different batches in the same CM formula, the quality control of further CM preparations should be established based on scientific practice including chemical and bioresponse fingerprint to ensure the qualityandconsistencyofCMpreparationsandthevalidityofstudyresults [119,120]. In addition, CMs should be provided by a consistent and reliable supply to maintain the effectivetreatmenteffectofCMpreparations.Giventhatoraladmin-istration and intravenous injection of CMs were used byall included studies, further reviews should compare the effects between these routes. Moreover, as no data on the possible interaction between TACE and CMs preparationswasreported,theinteractionshouldbeassessedfurther.Onlyasmallnumberofstudies(33%)showedthattheresultsofatleast12-monthsurvival(thelong-termeffectiveness)ofCMstreatment need to be determined in more RCTs with long- termfollow-up.AcuteandsubacuteCMs-relatedsideeffectsi nt h es t u d i e sw e r es l i g h ta n da l l e v i a t e ds p o n t a n e o u s l ya ft e rsymptomatic treatment. However, these were only reported infewstudies(4%).Onlyshort-termCMs-relatedsideeffects were reported. And all the side effects were not measuredby standard criteria. Additional researches should evaluatebothacuteandchronicCMs-relatedsideeffectsaccordingtostandard criteria to confirm the safety of CMs treatment intreatingpatientswithHCC. 5. Conclusion The positive results in this meta-analysis show that CMstreatment appears to increase the efficacy of TACE by pro-longingsurvival,increasingtumorresponse,improvingQoL,andreducingTACEtoxicityforunresectableHCC.Althoughmaking a definitive recommendation is currently prematurewith low quality of the most studies, these findings suggestthat CMs could be considered as an adjuvant therapy forunresectable HCC patients during TACE treatment. RCTswith rigorous methods, long-term follow-up, and standardEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 21 reporting (consolidated standards of reporting trials state- ment) are recommended to further evaluate the clinicaleffects of combining CMs and Acknowledgments The authors are grateful for the support of Professors Yung-chi Cheng, Sun-Ping Lee, Sai-Wah Tsao, and Allan SY Lau.TheauthorswouldliketoexpressthankstoMissOiyeeChowforhertechnicalsupport.ThestudywasfinanciallysupportedbyGrantsfromtheresearchcounciloftheUniversityofHongKong (Project code: 10401764) and Hong Kong HospitalAuthority's funding for Chinese Medicine (Project code: 20006345).

Amongthe7,677lungcancerpatients,230(31.17%)and1,826(26.32%)whohaveandhavenotundergonesurgeryhaveusedTCM outpatient services, respectively. For lung cancer patients who have not undergone surgery, patients who are aged 70 years and older, males, occupational members, and farmers and fishermen are less likely to avail of TCM services. For lung cancer patientswho have undergone surgery, the likelihood of TCM users is higher in residents who used TCM one year prior to lung cancer diagnosis and in patients with insurance amounts ranging from NT$60,000.

Introduction 1.1. Incidence and Mortality of Lung Cancer. Lung cancer i st h el e a d i n gc a u s eo fc a n c e r - r e l a t e dm o r t a l i t yw o r l d w i d e . Northern America, Eastern Asia, and Western Europe have the highest incidence of lung cancer, whereas the Eastern, Western, and Middle Africa have the lowest incidence oflungcancer.Inparticular,Hungary,FrenchPolynesia,United States of America, Poland, and Serbia have the highest incidence rates of lung cancer in the world; their age-standardized incidence rates in 2008 were 52.0, 43.6, 42.1,40.9, and 40.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively [ 1]. About 55% of lung cancer cases occur in less developed countries. Lungcanceraccountsformorethan28%ofthetotaldeathsinTaiwan [2].Lungcanceralsoranksfirstasthemostcommon cancer in both men and women, accounting for about 20%of all cancer deaths. In addition, the annual standardizedmortality incidence increased from 22.7/100,000 in 1991 to25.9/100,000in2009[ 2].Lungcanceraccountsformorethan 20%ofallcancerdeathsinHongKongandranksfirstasthemostcommoncancerinthecountry[ 3]. 1.2. Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Worldwide. The use of CAM has gained worldwide popu- larity. According to a survey across a number of Europeancountries, the top three motives for using CAM in cancerpatientsinclude directly fighting the disease with alternativetherapy for decreasing the tumor, increasing the ability of2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine thebodytofightthecancer,andimprovingthephysicalwell- being of the patient [ 4]. CAM, which is commonly used withconventionalmedicineforcancercare,iscoveredbytheNational Health Insurance (NHI) Program of Taiwan [ 5-8]. Accordingtothe2007NationalHealthInterviewSurvey,theprevalence of CAM use was 42% in Asian Americans and 38%inAmericanadults[ 9].ThepercentageofCAMusewas 23.6% for lung cancer patients, which is slightly higher thanthatforheadandneckcancer(22.7%),butlowerthanthatforpancreaticcancerpatients(56.3%)[ 4]. 1.3. Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in Asian Countries. T C Mi so n eo ft h em o s tp o p u l a rf o r m so fC A M worldwide. Cancer patients use TCM because they believe that TCM is a self-help cultural process and because they believe that conventional therapy has adverse effects andindividualized and tailored prescriptions are important [ 10]. TCM is commonly used with conventional medicine andhas entered the mainstream society and culture. TCM iseven covered by the NHI program of Taiwan. In addition,TCM plays an active role in the modern health care systemof Chinese and East Asian societies. One important featureof the NHI program is the coverage of both biomedicine(WM) and TCM. By 2003, more than 99% of the 23 millionresidents of Taiwan had been covered by the NHI programafter the implementation of this universal health insuranceplan.Thus,TCMhasahigherlevelofaccessibilitybecauseofless financial barrier. A study on the determinants of TCMand acupuncture utilization of patients with cervical, breast,lung, liver, or colorectal cancers in Taiwan has shown thattheprevalenceofTCMandacupunctureuseforlungcancerpatientsis16.03%and2.53%,respectively[ 11]. 1.4. Therapeutic Effect of TCM against Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Previous Studies. TCM is commonly used in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapyin treating patients with unresectable NSCLC [ 12-16]. The effect of treatment with TCM has been focused on thestimulation of the host immune response, thus activatinga cytotoxic response against NSCLC. A systematic reviewincludingpublicationsin11electronicdatabasesand24trialshasevaluatedtheefficacyofChineseherbalmedicine(CHM)combined with conventional chemotherapy (CT) in treat-ment of advance NSCLC therapy can reduce CT toxicityin terms of reduction of nausea and vomiting, decrease ofhemoglobin, inhibition of white blood cells, and decrease ofplatelet, prolong one-year survival rate, enhance immediatetumor response, and improve Karnofsky performance scoreinadvancedNSCLCpatients[ 17].Anothersystematicreview on oral CHM trials involving 862 patients with NSCLCs h o w e dt h a tT C Mp l u sc h e m o t h e r a p yi m p r o v e st h eq u a l i t yof life, tumor response, and survival rate of patients, as wellas alleviate the symptoms experienced by patients [ 12]. The systematic review also demonstrated that aidi injection, atype of TCM, combined with cobalt-60 or navelbine andplatinol has adjuvant therapeutic effects in improving the response rate, bone marrow hematopoietic function, andquality of life but not the survival rate of patients [ 13]. In a randomized control, TCM by stages plus chemotherapysignificantly increases the survival demon-strated oncologic and immunologic pharmacology for lungcancer [14,15]. These ingredients either inhibit lung adeno- carcinomacellmigrationandinvasionorhaveananticancereffect by inhibiting human cancer cell growth and inducingapoptosis [ 14-16]. The possible anticancer mechanisms of theseingredientsincludecellcyclearrestfollowingapoptoticdeath ingTCMUse. Severalstudieshaveexploredtheprevalenceof 18-23],inasingleclinicalsetting[ 24], or for Two studies have explored TCMuseinTaiwanin1996-2001[ 26]andin1997 -2003[ 27] in a general population by using complete NHI datasets forTCM. Two recent studies have explored TCM use amongpatients with prostate [ 28]a n dl i v e rc a n c e r s[ 5]. However, TCM use among patients with lung cancer has not yet been r e p o r t e da n dt h ei m p a c to fs u r g e ryo nT C Mu s eh a sn o ty e tbeen explored. This study aims to compare the differencesbetween the characteristics, types of care provider, existingdiseases, and expenditures for outpatient services of TCMand non-TCM users with lung cancer enrolled in the NHIprogram. This study, which is stratifiedby the surgery statusoflungcancerpatientsinTaiwanfrom1996to2010,utilizeda population-based random sample of one million insuredpatients. 2. Methods 2.1. Data Sources. This study used NHI Research Database (NHIRD) claim datasets from the NHI program of Taiwan.The NHI program was initiated in Taiwan in March 1995and covers approximately 99% of the 23.74 million Tai-wanese residents [ 29]. The national government-run Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) had contracts with 97% of the hospitals and 92% of the clinics all over the nation.TheNHIRDprovidesregistrationandclaimdatasetsfrom a random sample of one million beneficiaries forresearch use. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database2005 (LHID2005) contains all the ambulatory and inpatientclaim data of one million beneficiaries who were randomlysampled from the entire enrollees in the NHI and wasreleased in 2007. Similar distributions of beneficiary age andgender in the LHID2005 and the original NHI databasewere observed. The registration and claim datasets fromthe LHID2005 for the years 1996 to 2010 were used in thecurrentstudy .TheLHID2005databasecontainscomprehen-sive information, such as the demographic data, dates ofEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 clinical visits, diagnostic codes, details of prescriptions, and expenditureamountsofbeneficiaries.Thedataforregisteredbeneficiaries, expenditures of ambulatory care visits, andinpatient admission were obtained for analysis. Every indi-vidual has a unique personal identification number (PIN).Thedataonpatientidentitiesandinstitutionswerescrambled cryptographically by the NHIRD to protect the privacy of the beneficiaries. All datasets can be interlinked by using anindividual's PIN. The BNHI conducts an expert review ofrandomsamplesofevery50to100ambulatoryandinpatientclaimsineachhospitalandclinicquarterly;severalpenaltiesare given to hospitals and clinics that generate false reportsofdiagnosis[ 30].TheInternationalClassificationofDisease, NinthRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM)wasusedindiseasediagnosis. 2.2.StudySubjects.

Variables for Expenditures and Coexisting Diseases. The NHI covered TCM outpatient care, but not TCM inpatientcare. Therefore, only TCM and WM ambulatory care wereanalyzed in this study. The outpatient datasets containedencounter forms based on dates of visit, patient gender anddate of birth, medical facility visited, department visited,prescribing physician, dispensing pharmacist, three itemsfrom the ICD-9-CM codes, primary procedure (e.g., drugor diagnostic procedure), type of copayment, and billedand paid amounts. All outpatient visits within one year,particularlybeforeandaftertheindexdate,wereanalyzedforexpenditureandcoexistingdiseases. 2.4. Sociodemographic Factors and Urbanization Levels of Residential Area. The sociodemographic factors studied included age, gender, insurance premium, and insured unit. A g ew a sc a t e g o r i z e di n t of o u rl e v e l s : <50, 50-59, 60-69, and70 (in years). Amount of insurance premium was categorizedintofourlevels:<20,000,20,000-39,999,40,000- 59,999, and60,000. The insurance premium amount of an individual was determined by his/her work salary. Theresidential areas of study subjects consisted of 6 areas:Northern, Taipei, Central, Southern, Eastern, and Kao-Pingareas. The Kao-Ping area is located at southwestern Taiwan,consisting of Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County, and Ping- TungCounty.Theurbanizationlevelof365Taiwantownships was classified into seven levels according to the methoddeveloped by Lin et al. [ 31]. The seven levels of urbanizationwere high-density urban area, medium-density urban area, newly developed area, general area, aging society area, ruralarea,andnondevelopedarea(seclusionarea).Theindicatorsused in developing the township stratification for urban- ization level included the population density (people/km 2), population ratio of people with an educational level ofcollege or above, population ratio of elder people over 65years old, population ratio of agricultural workers, and thenumber of physicians per 100,000 people, among others.The insured unit consisted of governmental departmentand public school, private enterprise, occupational member,farmers and fishermen, and low-income households andveterans. 2.5.StatisticalAnalysis. Themeanand95%confidenceinter- val (CI) were reported for the continuous variables, whereasthe number, percentage, and 95% CI were reported for thecategorical variables. The chi-square test or the two-sample-test was used to compare the differences in proportions a n dm e a n so ft h ev a r i a b l e s .Th ea d j u s t e do d dr a t i o s( O R s ) of TCM use for each factor were estimated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results 3.1.FactorsAssociatedwithTCMUse. Amongthe7,677lung cancer patients, 1,826 (26.32%) lung cancer patients whohavenotundergonesurgeryhaveavailedofTCMoutpatientservices,whereas230(31.17%)lungcancerpatientswhohaveundergonesurgeryhaveavailedofTCMoutpatientservices.Among the lung cancer patients who have not undergonesurgery, participants aged 70 years and older (OR = 0.60,95% confidence interval, CI: 0.49-0.73), males (0.69, farmers andfishermen(0.72,0.53-0.97)arelesslikelytoavailofTCMservices. By contrast, patients who are TCM users one yearprior to lung cancer diagnosis (4.55, 4.00-5.17), who haveinsurance amounts ranging from NT$20,000 to NT$39,999(1.34, 1.12-1.60), who are residents of urban levels 2 (1.35,1.03-1.77) and 4 (1.47, 1.14-1.91) and Central (1.55, 1.21-1.97) and Kao-Ping areas (1.32, 1.02-1.71) are more likely to avail of TCM services. Among the lung cancer patients who haveundergone surgery, the likelihood of TCM users is higherin residents who used TCM one year prior to lung cancerdiagnosis (4.07, 2.74-6.04) and in patients with insuranceamountrangingfromNT$60,000(3.18,1.18-8.56)(Table 1). 3.2. Medical Institutes. F o rp a t i e n t sw h oh a v en o tu n d e r - gone surgery, most WM and TCM lung cancer diagnosis were provided by private hospitals (43.76% for WM; 36.07% 40.46% for TCM) (Table 2). For patients who have undergone surgery, most WM outpatients e r v i c e so n ey e a ra ft e rl u n gc a n c e rd i a g n o s i sw e r ep r o v i d e dby private hospitals (45.65%), followed by public hospitals (32.14%). Most TCM outpatient services one year after lung cancerdiagnosiswereprovidedbyprivatehospitals(45.22%),f o l l o w e db yp r i v a t ec l i n i c s( 2 9 . 9 1 % ) .Th eo u t p a t i e n ts e r v i c e sone year before lung cancer diagnosis of patients who haveand have not undergone surgery had similar patterns: mostWM and TCM outpatient services were provided by privateclinics,followedbyprivatehospitals. 3.3. Coexisting Diseases. The diagnoses in all ambulatory claimdatawererecordedintheICD-9-CMformat.Oneyearafter lung cancer diagnosis, lung cancer was the top diseasecode for WM and TCM patients who have and have notundergone surgery. Except in TCM users who have under-gone surgery, the three most frequently recorded coexistingdiseases in patients were essential hypertension, diabetesmellitus, and acute upper respiratory infection. For TCMuserswhohaveundergonesurgery,thethreemostfrequentlyrecorded coexisting diseases were essential hypertension,diabetesmellitus,andgeneralsymptoms.Themostfrequentlyrecorded coexisting diseases of patients one year beforelungcancerdiagnosiswereacuteupperrespiratoryinfection,followed by essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, andgeneralsymptoms(seeTable 3). 3.4. Expenditures. Table4shows the expenditure details of the lung cancer patients. For the patients who have notundergone surgery, the WM outpatient services accountedfor 64.40% of all outpatient visits and 71.15% of the totalexpenditures for one-year outpatient care after cancer diag-nosis, whereas the WM outpatient services accounted for70.12% of the visits and 66.67% of the expenditures for one-yearoutpatientcarebeforecancerdiagnosis.Forthepatientswho have undergone surgery, the WM outpatient servicesaccountedfor61.64%ofalloutpatientvisitsand43.21%ofthetotal expenditures for one-year outpatient care after cancerdiagnosis, whereas the WM outpatient services accountedfor 63.05% of the visits and 48.25% of the expendituresf o ro n e - y e a ro u t p a t i e n tc a r eb e f o r ec a n c e rd i a g n o s i s .Th ecost of consultation, treatment, medical supplies, drugs, and visitations of TCM nonusers who have not undergone surgery were much higher than those of TCM users whoundergone one-year outpatient care before and after cancerdiagnosis. The average total expenditure of TCM nonuserswas NT$2990.92 (US$98.39) per visit after cancer diagnosisandNT$1257.98(US$41.38)pervisitbeforecancerdiagnosis.TheaveragetotalexpenditureofTCMuserswasNT$2193.82(US$72.17) per visit after cancer diagnosis and NT$982.16(US$32.31)pervisitaftercancerdiagnosis(US$1=NT$30.4in 2010). For patients who have undergone surgery, the feefor consultation, treatment, and medical supplies, as well asthecostforthetotalamountpervisitofWM,wasalsomuchhigherthanthoseofTCMforone-yearoutpatientcarebeforeand after cancer diagnosis. The average total expenditure of TCM nonusers was NT$3104.64 (US$102.13) per visit aftercancerdiagnosisandNT$1270.36(US$41.79)pervisitbeforecancerdiagnosis.TheaveragetotalexpenditureofTCMuserswas NT$2783.77 after 3.5. Overall Table5shows the univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses of TCM use for overall mortality stratifiedbysurgerystatus.Wefoundtherewasnostatistical difference in overall mortality between TCM and non-TCMusers with surgery. On the contrary, TCM users were asso-ciated with lower mortality than non-TCM users in patientswithout surgery (adjusted hazard ratio for mortality: 0.64;95%CI:0.55-0.76). 4. Discussion This study is the first large-scale survey in the literaturet h a tf o c u s e so nT C Mu s ef o rl u n gc a n c e rp a t i e n t sw h oundergoone-yearoutpatientcarebeforeandafterlungcancer diagnosis.Inthisstudy,forpatientswhohavenotundergone surgery, the proportions of TCM outpatient visits increasedfrom 29.88% before lung cancer diagnosis to 35.60% afterlung cancer diagnosis. On the contrary, the proportionsof TCM outpatient expenditures decreased from 33.33% to28.85%. For patients who have undergone surgery, the pro-portionsofTCMoutpatientvisitsandexpendituresincreasedfrom 36.95% and 51.75% before lung cancer diagnosis to38.36% and 56.79% after lung cancer diagnosis, respectively.The possible explanation for this finding is that TCM use isassociated with longer survival in lung cancer patients withsurgeryasfoundinourstudy. Amongthelungcancerpatientswhohavenotundergone surgery, TCM use was lower among 70 year old patients, males, occupational members, farmers, and fishermen. Onthe contrary, the percent of TCM use was higher amongthose who reside in the regions of central Taiwan. Thesefindings are similar to those of a previous study on patientswith mild diseases or prostate cancer [ 5,26-28]. The overall prevalence of TCM utilizationin the current study is higherthan that reported by Lin et al. for patients with prostatecancer (26.78% versus 2.6%) [ 28] and that by our previous results for patients with liver cancer (26.78% versus 19.50%)[5].Linetal.consideredonlytheoutpatientvisitsspecificfor prostatecancer.Bycontrast,thecurrentstudyconsideredall outpatientvisits.Therefore,thecurrentstudyreportsahigherprevalence of TCM use compared with that of Lin et al. Onthebasisofourpreviousworkonlivercancer,aslightlyhigherprevalence of TCM utilization was shown in patients withlung cancer compared with patients with liver cancer. Thepossibleexplanationforthishigherprevalenceisthatpatientswith lung cancer were associated with higher prevalence ofrespiratory disease, and the Chinese are more likely to seekTCM to relieve symptoms caused by respiratory diseases.In this study, we further consider the effects of the surgerystatus of TCM users prior to cancer diagnosis on their TCMu s ea ft e rc a n c e rd i a g n o s i s .R e s u l t ss h o wt h a ts u r g e r ys t a exert a significant effect on TCM utilization. Prior TCM use before cancer diagnosis is shown to be the mostsignificantfactorforTCMuserswhohavenotundergoneandhaveundergonesurgery.ThesignificantfactorofpriorTCMu s eb e f o r ec a n c e rd i a g n o s i s ,as o c i o - c u l t u r a lc h a r a c t e r i s t i c sof individuals that exist prior to their illness, corresponds tothe predisposing factor that proposed by Andersen's healthbehaviormodel[ 32]. On the basis of the ICD-9-CM codes, and with the exception of the malignant lung neoplasm, we found thatacute upper respiratory infections, diabetes mellitus, andessentialhypertensionweretheprimaryindicationsinTCMusers and nonusers. In TCM users who have and havenot undergone surgery, the other primary indications weresymptoms involving the respiratory system and other chestsymptoms.PulmonarytuberculosiswasshowntobeanotherindicationforTCMuse.ThesefindingsondiseasepatternofhealthcareusemaybeexplainedbythefactthatpatientsseekTCMtorelieverespiratorysymptoms. Using the prevalence of surgery and difference in total costs for each TCM and WM user per year from our study,andnumberoflungcancerincidencecasesin2008reportedby Department of Health, Taiwan, we estimated that TCMuse would save at least 7.1 millions per year. Given thatcosts for TCM and WM use per session in other developedcountries are much higher than those in Taiwan, we believet h a tT C Mu s ew o u l dp o t e n t i a l l ys a v em u c hm o r ec o s t si notherdevelopedcountries. This study is the first large-scale study of TCM use in Taiwanese society, in which a million residents were randomlyselectedfromthe23millionpopulationofTaiwan. The NHI database has high comprehensiveness because theNHIcoversmorethan99%ofthepopulationofTaiwanand 93%ofthemedicalinstitutes.Previousstudiesofhealthcareutilization in cancer patients did not consider the status ofTCM use prior to cancer diagnosis. Several previous studies onTCM/CAMusehavebeenconductedviatelephoneinter- views, self-administered interviews, household interviews,andhospital-andclinical-basedsurvey .Thesestudiesusually hadlimitedsamplesizesandwereconductedincountriesinwhich TCM/CAM was not covered by insurance. Thus, thepatternandcharacteristicsofTCM/CAMusemaybeaffectedbythesocioeconomicstatusofindividuals. This study has several limitations. First, several herbal medicines were not covered by NHI, and visits at clinics notincontractwiththeBNHIwerenotconsideredinthisstudy.About 10% of the TCM clinics do not have contracts withNHI because of the low insurance amount given by NHI. Inaddition, cancer patients need rare and expensive Chineseherbalmedicine,whichisnotcoveredbyNHI.TheNHIRD data may lead to an underestimation of TCM costs. Second, thedatafortheclinicalstages andtypesoflungcancerwerenotavailableforthestudy;thus,TCMuseandcostsstratifiedby these factors cannot be explored. We also observed thatthe pattern of TCM use varied according to surgery status.However, we did not observe a significant correlation ofsurgeryandothercovariatesbecauseoflimitedsamplesizeofTCMuserswhohaveundergonesurgery.Thus,wedescribedtheutilizationpatternofTCMaccordingtosurgerystatus. 5. Conclusions Our study reports the prevalence and pattern of TCM use underNHI,acomprehensiveanduniversalhealthinsurance program in Taiwan. The NHI program covers both con-ventional WM and TCM services. The prevalence of TCMuse among lung cancer patients who have and have notundergone surgery is similar. The factors associated withTCM use varied according to surgery status. The total costsof insurance-covered TCM were lower than those of WMforbothpatientswhohaveandhavenotundergonesurgery.ThisstudyprovidesinformationaboutthefrequencyofTCMu s ea n dt h ec o e x i s t i n gd i s e a s e st r e a t e db yW Ma n dT C Mi nlung cancer patients according to surgery Theauthorsdeclarethatthereisnoconflictofinterests.

Aim. The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity of a panel of 280 Korean medicinal plants belonging to 73 families and 198 species against human CCR F-CEM leukemia cells. Selected phytochemicals were investigated in more detail for their mode of action. Methods. The resazurin assay was used to determine cytotoxicity of the plant extracts. Microarray- based mRNA expression profiling, COMPARE, and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to identify which genes correlate with sensitivity or resistance to selected phytochemicals of the Korean plants. Results. The results of the resazurin assay showed that cytotoxicity extracts tested at 10 g/mL from 13 samples inhibited proliferation more than 50% (IC50<10g/mL) and the most active plants are Sedum middendorffianum (15.33%)and Lycoris radiata (17.61%). Out these plants, hopeaphenol and deoxynarciclasine were the most cytotoxic ones. Genes from various functional groups (transcriptional or translational regulation, signal transduction, cellular proliferation, intracellular metabolism,endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum function, etc.) were signific antly correlated with response of tumor cell lines to these two compounds. Conclusion . The results provide evidence on the possible use of selected Korean medicinal plants and chemical constituentsderivedfromthemforthetreatmentoftumors. 1.

Material and Methods 2.1. Plant Material and Extraction. Medicinal plants used in the present work were collected at different localities of theRepublicofKoreaandprovidedbyProf.Ik-SooLee(CollegeofPharmacy,ChonnamNationalUniversity,Kwangju,SouthKorea).TheplantswereidentifiedattheNationalherbarium,where voucher specimens were deposited under athttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/341724 ). The extraction of the air-dried and powdered plant material was conducted usingmethanol(HPLCgrade)witheitherASE300(Dionex) or a sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics) at 50C. The extracts werethenconservedat4Cuntilfurtheruse. 2.2. Cell Culture. Human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were obtained from Professor Axel Sauerbrey (University of Jena,Jena, Germany).

The assay tests cellular viability and mitochondrial function.Briefly,aliquotsof5\u00d710 4cells/mLwere seeded in 96-well plates, After24h incubation, 20L resazurin 0.01% w/v solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 1-2h. Fluorescence was measured on an automated 96-well Infinite M2000 Pro plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim,Germany) using an wavelength of 544nm and anemission wavelength of 590nm. Doxorubicin was used aspositive control. The concentration of DMSO was kept at orbelow 0.1% in all experiments.

COMPARE analyses were performed by a web-based algo-rithm (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/ ) to produce rank-ordered lists of genes expressed in the NCI cell lines. The methodologyhas been described previously in detail [ 15]. Briefly, every gene of the NCI microarray database was ranked for sim-ilarity of its mRNA expression to the IC 50values for the correspondingcompound.Scaleindicesofcorrelationscoef-ficients (-values) were created.

Out of these extracts, 207 ex- tracts showed no or a weak inhibition of cancer cell pro- liferation (<50%) at the tested concentration of 10 g/mL. However, 13 samples induced the proliferation of less esea r c h edth el i t e r a t u r eo nth ec h e m i calc o n - stituents of the cytotoxic Korean plants (Table 1).

If the average IC50values over the entire range of cell lines were diversified regarding their tumor types, coloncancer and melanoma cell lines were most sensitive towardshopeaphenol,whereasleukemiaandkidney cancercelllineswere most resistant (Figure 3(a)). The cell lines reacted in a different manner towards deoxynarciclasine. Leukemia andcolon cancer were most sensitive towards this compound,whereasbreastcancerandprostatecancercelllinesweremostresistant(Figure 3(b)). 3.3. Cross-Resistance of the NCI Cell Line Thelog hopeaphenol andthese standard drugs, indicating that hopeaphenol might beuseful for the treatment of otherwise drug-resistant tumors(Table2). Interestingly, an inverse correlation was found be- tween the log 10IC50values for hopeaphenol and the epi- dermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor,erlotinib. Such a relationship was not found between deoxy-narciclasineanderlotinib(Table 2).Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 Table 3: Genes identified by standard or reverse COMPARE analyses, whose mRNA expression in a panel of 60 cell lines from the OMIM database, NCI, USA, ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/ ) and from the GeneCard database of theWeizmannInstituteofScience,Rehovot,Israel( http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/index.html ). 3.4. COMPARE and Hierarchical Cluster Analyses of mRNA Microarray Data. We further investigated the microarray- basedtranscriptomicmRNAexpressionbyCOMPAREanal-yses to test whether the responses of the tumor cells linesto hopeaphenol and deoxynarciclasine were associated withspecific gene expression profiles. For this reason, we minedthe transcriptome-wide mRNA expression database of theNCI and correlated the expression data with the IC 50values forbothcompounds.Thisrepresentsahypothesis-generatingbioinformatical approach, which allows the identification ofnovel putative and< 0.50for inverse correlations. The genes fulfilling these criteria are shown in Table 3(for hopeaphenol) and Table 4 (for deoxynarciclasine). These genes were from diverse functional groups for hopeaphenol (Table 3). For deoxy- narciclasine, genes not the IC 50values of the compounds for the cell line panelwere used for cluster analyses. Four cluster branches were foundinthehopeaphenol-relateddendrogram(Figure 4)and three clusters were obtained in the deoxynarcilasine-relatedclusteranalysis(Figure 5).Remarkably,thedistributionofcell linessensitiveorresistancetobothdrugsconsiderablyvariedbetween the different clusters of the dendrograms. Sincethe IC 50values of the compounds were not included into the cluster analysis, we could address the question whetherthe gene expression profiles alone are sufficient to predictsensitivityorresistanceofcelllinestothecompounds. As shown in Table 5, the distributions of cell lines sen- sitive or resistant to hopeaphenol and deoxynarciclasine,respectively, were significantly different between the clusters of the dendrograms, indicating that the expression of these geneswasnotonlyresponsibleforthebranchingoftheden- drograms,butalsopredictedsensitivityorresistanceofthese celllinestowardsthesecompounds. 4.

Also, the ethanol extract of Lycors radiata exhibited significant antiproliferative effect against B16F10 melanomacellsandinducedapoptosisthroughtheactivationofp38andAP-1pathway[ 17].Thepresentreport,therefore,providesevi- dence on the activity of L. radiata not only against cell lines derived from solid tumors but also derived from the8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Table 4: Genes identified by standard or reverse COMPARE analyses, whose mRNA expression in a panel of 60 cell lines l c y c l e c o n t r o l Information on gene functions was taken from the OMIM database, NCI, USA, ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/ ) cytotoxic towards HepG-2 cells via inductionofapoptosisandcellcyclearrest[ 18],andevidence this activity towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells is pro-videdherein.

It is note-worthythatonly Lycorisradiata exhibitedasignificant(<50% growth proliferation) activity with both aerial and subter-ranealparts,suggestingthatdifferentpartsoftheplantshouldbe considered when screening the cytotoxicity of medicinalplants. Tothebestofourknowledge,thecytotoxiceffectofsev- eralactiveplants(Table 1)againstleukemiacellswasreport- ed here for the first time. Nevertheless, some of the ana-lyzed plants contain compounds with known cytotoxicityagainst cancer cells. In ,showedcytotoxicactivitiesonhuman,B16mouse melanomacellsandSNU-1gastriccancercelllineswithIC 50 valuesvaryingfrom17.02to55.47 M[20].Interestingly,the extract of the stem bark of this plant exhibited significantantiproliferative activity on leukemia CCRF-CEM cells(Figure1), inducing less than 25% growth at 10 g/mL. In addition, Kim et al. [ 21] reported the presence of two well- known cytotoxic compounds, betulin and lupeol [ 22]i this viaFas-medi- atedpathwaywasalsoreportedinhumanMCF-7breastade-nocarcinomacellsbyprodelphinidinB-23,3 -di-O-gallate,a constituent of M. rubra [23]. The presence of such cytotoxic compounds could explain the good activity of the crude ex-tract ofA. japonica andM. rubra.

For example, cytotoxic compounds such as in-canone{k n o w nt ob ea c t i v eo nH L 6 0l e u k e m i ac e l l s( I C 50 value of 6M) [25])}or verbascoside [ 27]{active on human rhabdom-yosarcoma and human adenocarcinoma cell lines [28]}were reported in Caryopteris incana. But extract fromCaryopteris incana did not show significant activities againstCCRF-CEMleukemiacellsinthepresentstudy. We screened the NCI database of the Developmental TherapeuticsProgramoftheNCIfortheconstituentsofourpanel of Korean medicinal plants. The two most cytotoxic compounds were hopeaphenol and deoxynarciclasine. Both compounds have been previously reported to be cytotoxic [29-32].Whilehopeaphenol'sactivityhasbeendemonstrated in mouse tumors in vitroandin vivo[31,32], the present investigation shows that this compounds also active against humantumorcells.Tothebestofourknowledge,themech- anisms of action of these two compounds have not beeninvestigatedinthepastandareaddressedinouranalysisfor thefirsttime.4.2. COMPARE and Hierarchical Cluster Analyses of mRNA Microarray Data. To gain insight into possible modes of action of both phytochemicals, we investigated gene expres-sion profiles of the NCI cell line panel. By microarray-based gene expression and COMPARE analyses, we correlated the IC 50values for both compounds of 60 tumor cell lines with transcriptomicmRNAexpressionlevelsofthiscelllinepanel[12]. This approach has been successfully used to unravel t h em o d eo fa c t i o no fn o v e lc o m p o u n d s[ 33]. Cluster and COMPARE analyses are also useful for comparing geneexpressionprofileswithIC 50valuesforinvestigationaldrugs to identify candidate genes for drug resistance [ 34,35]a n d toidentifyprognosticexpressionprofilesinclinicaloncology[36,37]. Elevengenespassingthecorrelationthresholdsof >0.5 growthfactor9[ 38],noneofthemhavebeenassociatedwith responseoftumorcellstocytostaticdrugs.Thispointofview is supported by the fact that the NCI cell lines did not exert cross-resistancebetweenhopeaphenolandanticancerdrugs,suchasdoxorubicin,vincristine,cisplatin,andothers.

Clinical Uses of Herbal Medicine with Anticancer Effects A range of clinical studies have indicated that a spectrum of anticancer activities from various herbal medicines can be detected.Inthissection,wehaveorganizedandclassifiedtheclinical use of a number of herbal medicines according totheirsuppressiveeffectonspecificcancertypes(Table 1). 1.1. For Breast Cancer. Although a specific role for vitamins andseleniuminthepreventionofbreastcancerhasnotbeen established, some anticancer activities have been shown in vitro[1-3]. In a randomized controlled trial, 2972 patients withinvasiveornoninvasivebreastcarcinomareceivedeither 200mg of vitamin A preparation (Fenretinide) per day or no therapy. At 97 months posttreatment there was a signif-icant reduction in recurrence of local breast cancer in pre- menopausalwomen(HR:0.65;95%CI:0.46-0.92).However, nosignificantdifferenceinmetastasisoroverallsurvivaltimec o u l db ed e m o n s t r a t e d[ 4]. Interestingly, lignans. Isoflavones are found in highabundance in soy beans, and lignans are found in linseedswheat, fruit, flaxseeds, and vegetables [ 8,9]. Among six related clinical trials conducted so far, only one concludedthat isoflavone was associated with a reduced risk of breastcancer[10].Soy-derivedphytoestrogensarepopularlyrecom- mended for treating postmenopausal symptoms in womenwithbreastcancerundergoingtamoxifentherapy.Theprinci-palconstituentsofsoybeanplantextracts,includingisoflavo-nes genistein and daidzein, are structurally similar to 17 - estradiol and can confer weak estrogenic effects [ 11]. How- ever,thereisnoevidencetosupporttherecommendationofu s eo fp h y t o e s t r o g e n se i t h e ri nt r e a t i n gb r e a s tc a n c e ro rf o reasingclimactericsymptoms[ 12]. Investigations of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) have uncovered a number of antibreast cancer agents,although most of their mechanisms of action have not yetbeen elucidated. These Compounds inthese categories have been taken as health foods or dietary supplement for decades. However, evidence-based in vivo studies and clinical trials are still recommended for routinepublicuseorspecificclinicalapplications. 1.2. For Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer is characterized by alonglatencyperiod,astrongdietaryinfluence,andlimitedtreatmentstrategiesfortheadvanceddisease;therefore,manypatients turn to complementary and alternative medicine(CAM)withthebeliefthatthesemedicinesrepresentaviabletherapeutic option that may be free of adverse side effects[22]. This folkloric belief, strongly upheld in many Asian cultures,needstobesubstantiatedwithsystematic,evidence-based research. Vitamins, including vitamins A-D and reti-noids,areorganiccompoundsthatcannotbesynthesizedbyhumans and must be ingested to maintain homeostasis andpreventvariousmetabolicdisorders[ 23].Emergingevidence i n d i c a t e st h a ti n fl a m m a t i o nm i g h th a v eac r u c i a lr o l ei nt h e genesis of prostate carcinoma [ 24-26] .An u m b e ro fc l i n i c a l trialshavesoughttoevaluatetheanti-inflammatoryactivitiesofvitaminsonprostatecarcinogenesis[ 27].Despitealackof convincing evidence, vitamin and mineral supplements areusedextensivelybypatientsthatarediagnosedwithprostatecancers [28,29]. The belief is that such supplements might actuallypreventortreatinflammation-associateddiseaseandat the very least not cause harm [ 22]. Among smokers, daily ingestion of>1 00I Uo fv i ta m i nEw a sr e po rt edt op r od u c ea 56% reduction in risk in lethal or advanced prostate cancerrelative to nonusers [ 30]. On the other hand, a selenium and vitamin E chemoprevention trial (SELECT) that aimedto determine whether vitamin E and/or selenium supple- mentation could reduce prostate carcinogenesis showed thatdietary supplementation with vitamin E in fact statistically increasedtheriskofprostatecanceramonghealthymen[ 31, 32]. Together these clinical data suggest that the application ofvitaminEmaybespecificforonlytreatinginflammation-associated features in prostate cancer patients, rather thanaffecting anticancer activity. Future studies are needed toaddress such an apparent contradiction between effects inhealthyandcancerpopulations. The use of medicinal herbs and their derivative herbal extracts that contain numerous polyphenolic compoundsmay contribute to the lower incidence of prostate cancerin Asian populations relative to Caucasians and AfricanAmericans [ 33].

Some specific compounds, in particular the four active polyphe- nolic compounds in , [ 22].

In a Phase II study of green tea in the treatment of patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate carcinoma, one patient achieved a prostate-specificantigen(PSA)responseof >50%thatlasted4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine for approximately one month. Patients, however, suffered marked symptoms of toxicity in this study, most notablydiarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Investigators concluded thatgreen tea has limited antineoplastic activity, as defined by adeclineinPSAlevels,againstandrogen-independentprostatecancers [36]. For soy isoflavones, they have been shown to inhibit 5-reductase activity, the enzyme that is function- ally responsible for the conversion of testosterone to themorepotentandrogendihydrotestosterone[ flavone glycoside that inhibits enzymatic synthesis of eicosanoids, which are important mediatorsof inflammation and prostate tumor cell proliferation [ 38]. Baicalein (a flavone) impairs the proliferation of androgen-independent PC-3 DU145 prostate cancer cells in cul-ture and induces cell-cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase [ 39] and apoptosis at concentrations achievable in humans [ 40]. Baicalein drastically suppressed the expression of specificandrogen receptor in prostate cancer at clinically achievableconcentrations [ 40]. For lycopenes, although most studies have used mixtures of tomato products, the association ofdecreasedprostatecancerriskandtomatoproductintakehasled to the specific focus on the use and effect of lycopene[41].Chenandcolleaguesstudiedtheeffectoflycopenelevels and measures of oxidative damage in patients undergoingprostatectomyforlocalizedprostatecancer [ 42].Theyfound t h a to x i d a t i v ed a m a g ei nl y m p h o c y t e sf r o mt h e s ep a t i e n t swas diminished after dietary intervention compared with pretreatment levels and that the prostate tissues in treated patients revealed significantly decreased levels of PSA andlessoxidativedamage.Sinceitstillremainsuncertainwhetherlycopene itself causes the effect, or whether a more complexfood extract is responsible, additional randomized trials areneededtoassesstheefficacyoflycopeneinchemopreventionactivities.

Moreover, oral administration of W. chinensis extract impeded prostate cancer tumorigenesis. This anticancer actionofW. chinensis extractwassubsequentlydemonstrated to be due to three active compounds that can inhibit theandrogen receptor (AR) signaling pathway [ 47]. Recently, ourownstudyshowedthatadifferentsetofphytochemicalsextracted from W. chinensis p l a n t sc a nc o n f e rp o t e n ta n d specific anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitroandin vivo. These activities resulted in strong anticolitis activities in testmice[48].Futurestudiesof W. chinensis forchemoprevention or as a complementary medicine against prostate cancer inhumansarewarranted. 1.3. For Lung Cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most deadly cancers,andthelungisacommonsiteofmetastasisoftumors from other tissues in the body. Standard to have lower or little toxicitymay provide an attractive strategy for lung cancer therapy. Traditionally, herbal plants such as cancer is as high as 77% [ 52]. Herbs are mainly used in lungcancertoreducetherapy-associatedtoxicityandcancer-related symptoms and sometimes to directly increase anti-cancer effects [ 4]. However, it is important to note that someCAMmethodsorremediesmayhaveadverseeffectsorreduce the efficacy of conventional treatment, and the pri-mary justification for use of traditional herbal medicinesremains empirical evidence, case studies, deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has steadilyincreased over the last decade. Unfortunately, there are no successful,clinicallysatisfactorytherapiesforpatientssuffer- ingHCC.Herbalmedicinesarebeingconsideredasonepos-siblestrategyagainstliverfibrosisandHCC.Threemedicinal herbs are already used as official drugs in China, Japan, and other parts of Asia. Different chemically induced fibrosismodelsweredesignedusingtheratliversystemtoassessthe preventive effects of specific herbal extracts on liver fibrosis.

Although someoftheseherbalmedicines,suchasYGJ,aretraditionally used to treat human liver fibrosis, the therapeutic or clinicalanticancer effect of these herbal mixtures in liver tissuehasnotbeenfullyelucidated.Thefurtheridentificationofasyet unknown effective components in these herbal extract iscriticalfortheirpharmacologicaluseandimprovement. A combination of 10 herbs (named compound 861), including Salvia miltiorrhiza (sage),Astragalus membrana- ceus,andSpatholobussuberectus knowninTCMasthe\"king herb\" that is, the herbs thatare pharmacologically active, and seven others (modifiers oftoxicitythatactsynergisticallywiththekingherbstoimproveimmune function), has been tested in a number of experi-mental studies for antifibrotic properties. Two uncontrolledopen trials of 60 and 22 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with compound 861 reported a beneficial effects on liver fibrosis, with the majority of treated patientsshowingbothclinicalandhistologicalimprovement[ 58,59]. Since these clinical studies of compound 861 did not satisfyquality control criteria, clinicians consider that additionalwell-designed trials are needed for routine and authorizedc l i n i c a lu s eo fc o m p o u n d8 6 1f o rt h et r e a t m e n to fh e p a t i t i sB-inducedliverfibrosis. Alargenumberofclinicalreportshaveindicatedthether- apeutic effects of one Japanese traditional medicine ( kampo yaku) Sho saiko-to (TJ-9). This medicine is a combination of seven herbs traditionally used for treating liver diseases[66,67]. However, little clinical data on the efficacy of TJ- 9 in preventing human liver cancer has been reported. In a long-term (5 years) randomized controlled study, patientsthat were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) receivedadoseof7.5g/dayaqueousTJ-9extracttogetherwith thestandardtreatmentusinginterferon.Uponfollowup,thecumulativedevelopmentofhepatocellularcarcinoma(HCC)was found to be significantly lower than that of the controls (i.e., patients without TJ-9 treatment) [ 60]. Unfortunately, TJ-9 is contraindicated for patients with hepatic cirrhosisor acute respiratory failure in Japan, because some of these patients were found to contract interstitial pneumonia after drug administration [ 68]. Therefore, well-designed future trials that can address the specificity of TJ-9 or its majoractive components in inhibition or suppression signaling pathway,has been shown to play a key role in the cellular behavior ofcancerstemcells[ 70].ThederegulationofSHHwasconsid- ered as an important factor that can drive or maintain theprogression of pancreatic cancer [ 71]. There are some SMO antagonists that, such as GDC-0449, IPI-926, XL-139, andPF-04449913, are being evaluated with high hope for treat- ment of pancreatic cancers Veratrumcalifornicum SHH signaling by directly binding to the 7-helixbundleoftheSMOprotein.Thiscomplexcanfurtherimpact upon the function of 12-transmembrane receptor patched-1 (PTCH-1) and thereby influence the structure of SMO [ 62]. It needs to be noted here that cyclopamine not only can weaken the recruitment of bone marrow precursor cells (BMPCs)intocancercells,butalsocanreducetheformationof tumor vasculature [ 63]. The cancerous vascular system becomes unstable after treatment with cyclopamine due to the expression of angiopoietin-1, an angiogenic factor foundin the tumor microenvironment, which is under the regu-lation of SHH. Cyclopamine has been explored as an SMO activity suppression agent and to arrest the growth of pan- c r e a t i ct u m o r s[ 63]. Encouraging findings suggest that this phytochemicalobtainedfromatraditionallyusedTCMherb shouldbesystematicallyexploredinthefutureforefficacious SMO-targetinganticancerdrugs. 2. Use of Herbal Supplements as Adjuvants in Conventional AntiCancer Therapies Numerous Chinese herbal medicines are being used in combinationwithchemotherapyorradiotherapytoimprove theefficacyofcancertherapyandreducesideeffectsandcom- plications(Figure 1),althoughthispracticeishighlyfrowned uponbymanywesternphysicians.Understandingoftheuseof specific herbal medicines as adjuvants to conventional therapy,therefore,needstobeincreasedinconsultationand coordinationwithphysiciansandotherhealthcareproviders.This section outlines evidence for use of herbal medicinesas adjuvants to conventional drug-based, chemo- or radio-therapy regimes in cancer treatment. On the other hand,thissectionalsosummarizesthechallengesorlimitationsforclinicaluseoftheseherbalmedicines. 2.1. Common Use of Herbal Medicines as Adjuvant Treatment inChemo-orRadio-CancerTherapy. For the above adjuvant anticancertherapystudies,herbalmedicationingeneralwasapplied as a combination therapy with the conventionalchemotherapy to hopefully increase the therapeutic benefitandqualityoflife(QoL)aswellastodecreasethesideeffects or complications. Between 28% and 98% of ethnic Chinese cancerpatientsinAsia[ 72-74]and25%to47%ofthoseliving inNorthAmericaarereportedtohaveusedherbalmedicinesas part of their cancer care [ 75,76]. Although a number of herbalmedicineshavebeenfoundtobeadjunctiveinchemo-and radiotherapy, most clinical trials or studies have beenreportedmainly,ifnotonly,inChinaorotherAsiancountriesa n dt h e ya r ev i r t u a l l yn o tc i t e do nP u b M e d .I n2 0 1 0 ,Q ia n dcolleagues [ 77] provided a systematic review of Chinese herbal medicines in clinical trials, mainly as adjuvant treat-ments to reduce complicationsand side effects tumor [ 93,94] ,a r ec o m m o n l yu s e db yc a n c e rp a t i e n t st o either \"treat\" cancer and/or \"reduce the toxicity\" induced bychemotherapy or radiotherapy.

However, most studies to date are empirical(i.e.,notwellcontrolled)clinicalstudiesorobservationsthatmainly report reduction in side effects and complicationsduringorafterchemotherapyandradiotherapy.Sometradi-tional herbal formulations, including Bojungikki-tang or \"claimed\" to protect liverf u n c t i o n ,r e d u c ec a n c e r - r e l a t e df a t i g u ea n dp a i n ,i m p r o v erespiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal side effects,and even ameliorate the symptoms of cachexia.

Inarandomizedcontrolledtrial(RCT) with 63 patients with non-small-cell Granule (Jiangyin were observed to enhance median survivaltime(=0.014 )andresponserateincreaseto48.5%(16/33), compared to the untreated control (32.2% = 9/28) in thecontrol group ( = 0.0373 ), while all test groups were treated with a combination of navelbine and cisplatin (NP)chemotherapy [ 98]. In another clinical trial with Shenqi- fuzheng injection (Lizhu Co., China) among 232 NSCLCpatientsenrolled,herbalinjectionsignificantlyimprovedthe response rate and QoL of lung cancer patients, evaluated byusing the QoL scale of European Organization for Researchon Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C30) [ 99]. Furthermore, the randomized controlled trial for Feiji Recipe treatment wasalso observed to enhance the clinical therapeutic efficacyand alleviate side effects of chemotherapy [ 100], as shown with an increase on scores in role, social, and economic status (<0.05 or<0.01 ), again based on QLQ-C30 questionnaire [ 101]. Recently, Xu et al. [ 102]a p p l i e dah i g h q u a l i t yo fc l i n i c a lt r i a lm e t h o d o l o g yt oe x a m i n et h ee ff e c to fT C Mo ni m p r o v i n gQ o Lo fp o s t o p e r a t i v en o n - s m a l l - c e l llung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

Oneofthemajorrisksofconventionaltreatmentinlung cancer patients is radiation pneumonitis, caused by radio-therapeuticintervention[ 103]. Increasing evidence has g u r e 1). These herbal formula- tions were reported to significantly lower the incidence ofradiation pneumonitis and improve clinical radiographicphysiologic(CRP)dyspneascoreandtheRadiationTherapyOncologyGroup(RTOG)gradingscore,ingroupsofNSCLCpatients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. These findingsalsorevealedsomeofthepossibleadverseeffectsandpoten-tial uses of specific herbal medicines in combinational ther-apy alongside conventional chemotherapy.

For Colon Cancer. In oncology, drug interactions are importantbecauseofthenarrowtherapeuticindexandinher-enttoxicityofmanyanticanceragents[ 109].Previousstudies indicatedthattheactivityofcytochromeP450enzymes(CYPenzymes) in the gastrointestinal wall is one of the mostimportant factors that can alter the bioavailability of orallyadministeredanticanceragentsthataresubstratesofCYP3A[110]. A inducers of CYP [ 111]( F i g u r e 1). Because of the increased use of herbal products by cancerpatients, more consideration needs to be given to theircombined use with anticancer agents [ 109,112]. The admin- istration of St. John's wort was shown to induce intestinaland hepatic expression of CYP3A [ 113] and be beneficial for themetabolismofirinotecan[ 114],acamptothecinderivative that can result in DNA damage on interaction with topoi- somerase I. St. John's wort is hence used empirically in the treatmentofmetastaticcarcinomaofthecolonorrectum. Recent studies based on epidemiological modeling have demonstrated interesting patterns suggesting that herbaltreatment may improve prognosis in advanced colon cancerpatients when used as an adjuvant therapy [ 115,116]. The therapeutic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine inmetastatic cancer have been discussed in terms of a hypo-thetical, dualistic antiproliferation and immune-stimulationmodel of tumor progression and regression [ 117]. Clinically, between 30%and75%ofpatientswithcoloncancerareesti-mated to use CAM, but systematic or statistical evidence ofsurvivalefficacyisstilllimited.Inonestudywitha10-yearfol-lowupofcoloncancerpatients( =193)whopresentedtoa SanFranciscoBayAreaCenterforChinesemedicine,authorscomparedthesurvivalrateinpatientschoosingashort-termtreatmentregimelastingforthedurationoftheirchemother-apy/radiotherapy period with those choosing a continuinglong-term treatment. They also compared the survival ofpatients treated with Pan-Asian medicine plus vitamins(PAM+V) with that of concurrent external controls fromthe Kaiser Permanente Northern California and CaliforniaCancerRegistries[ 118].Inthisstudy,somemodernmethods, includingKaplan-MeierandtraditionalCoxregression,were usedforanalysesofcausalinference,namely,propensityscore and marginal structural models (MSMs), which have notbeenpreviouslyusedinstudiesofcancersurvivalinresponsetotreatmentwithChineseherbalmedicine.Resultsindicatedthat PAM+V combined with conventional therapy, as com-pared with conventional therapy alone, reduced the risk ofpatient death at stage I by 95%, stage II by 64%, stage III by29%, and stage IV by 75%. No significant difference wasobserved between short-term versuslong-term PAM+V administration [ 118]. This was apparently a sound clinical investigation and suggests that prospective trials combiningPAM+Vwithconventionalchemotherapy/radiotherapymaybeclinicallyjustifiableinfuturesystematicstudies.Accumulating clinical studies show that some TCM preparations,includingPi-ShengDecoctionandYi-Qi-Zhu-Yu Decoction, may be useful in reducing side effects andenhancing the drug effect of chemotherapy for colorectalcancer[119].Forpreventingrecurrenceandmetastasis,Jian- Pi-Xiao-LiuDecoction,Fu-ZhengCapsule,andQu-XieCap- sule were used to decrease the life, antitumor \"curative\" effect of chemotherapy,reducethesideeffectsofchemotherapy,improvetheimmunefunction, and extend survival time in colorectal cancerpatients.However,withtheadvancementofcolorectalcancertreatment model, TCM theories and clinical studies on thetypingofsyndromedifferentiationapparentlyarestilllaggingbehind.Inaddition,currentstudiesoftenhavenotaddressedthe issues on the anticancer properties or the observedbeneficial health maintain/survival effects of treated TCMs. It is not only desirable, but also in fact necessary to further study the action model and the associated biochemical and physiologicalmechanismsoftheseanticancermodeherbs,asamilestoneforfutureTCMresearch[ 119]. 2.4. For Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The traditional Chinese medicine term or pathological classification of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (UHCC) is \"liver stasis\" [ 120]. Many clinical studies from China have indicated that TCM,such as Shentao Ruangan pills and hydroxycamptothecin, plus chemotherapy can significantly alleviate the symptoms, enhance therapy tolerance, stabilize tumor size and aug- ment immunological function, reduce the incidence rate ofadverse events, andprolongsurvival timeof UHCC patients[121-123]. Although these studies may be criticized individ- ually for lacking quality at the international level, togetherthey do seem to suggest that the administration of TCMmaywarrantadditionaltrialsforpatientswithUHCC.Futureclinical trials with TCM for UHCC need to have sufficientmethodologicalqualityandshouldbepursuedinaccordancewith the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CON- SORT) statement (see Section 3). In particular, rigorously designed,multicenter,large,randomized,double-blind,con-trolledtrialsarenecessary[ 124]. 2.5.ForOtherCancers. Overthepasttwodecades,anumber of Chinese herbal medicines have been noted for their radiosensitization and radioprotection conferred therapeutic effects in the treatment of metastaticbonetumors.TheyfoundthatcombinedGLCand Sr-89 treatment was effective against metastatic bone tumor braintumormetastases.Thesefindingsfurtherindicatethepoten- tial application of TCM in the therapy of different cancers (Figure1). 2.6. Challenges for the Use of Herbal Medicine in Cancer Therapy. Althoughtraditionalherbalmedicines,phytomedi- cines, medicinal foods, and complementary or alternative medicines have been increasingly used over the past decadein European and North American countries, they seem to have not generated interest or been accepted by mainstream medicine practitioners in western countries, especially instandard care for cancer patients. The key issue considered bymanybiomedicalscientistshasbeenthelackofevidence- based information/guidelines for routine and regulatory application of herbal medicines as \"drugs\" for use in publichealth. The sticking points hindering the use of phytomed-icines can be attributed to six major issues: (1) lack ofconsistent and reliable sources of authentic medicinal plantmaterials,withrespecttospeciesverificationandauthentica-tion, cultivation using good agricultural practice protocols,and standardized/normalized methods and technology forplant extraction/mixture preparation; (2) lack of definitionsandroutinepreparationofthebiochemical/biologicalingre-dients and compositions of herbal medicines or the phyto-chemicals/phytocompounds derived from medicinal plants,with respect to identification of metabolite profiles, indexcompounds, and putative active compounds or metabolites; (3) general and specific safety considerations, including tolerablehighdosage, minimaleffectivedosage, andspecificusage; (4) proof of efficacy in treating or assisting specificcancerpatients,includinglackofresults/datafrompreclinicalanimal studies, execution of bona fide, and double-blind,placebo-included, statistician-assisted clinical trial studies;(5) highly complex \"personalized\" prescriptions or formula-tionsfortheuseofsometraditionalmedicines(e.g.,inTCM)that may be mystified by a \"secret ingredient\" in specificformulations; and (6) the criminal act of supplementation/\"spiking\" highly potent western chemical drugs into herbalmedicinesincounterfeitactivities.Withoutaddressingalloftheaboveissues,wecannotmeetthechallengesofmoderniz-ingherbalmedicines.Althoughwehavereviewedaspectrumof laboratory, preclinical and clinical studies on potentialapplications of herbal medicines for cancer patients' care inan inclusive fashion, a great many of these studies did notfollow the stringent requirements, procedures, and protocolneededfordevelopingwesternstyledrugormedicinalfoods.Systematic and correlated efforts among researchers of ourscientificcommunitiesarethereforeurgentlyneeded. Itisalsoimportanttonotethatthecentraltenetinrecent westernmedicineisthatadrugshouldbecomposedofwell-known chemical components or a pure single compoundthat selectively interacts with known and specific moleculartarget(s) in our body system. However, the search for singlemoleculesthatcanmodifysingleorhighlyspecifickeyfactorsinadiseaseprocessisnowrecognizedasadifficultandsome- timesinappropriatestrategy,becausealargevolumeofstud-iesongenomics,proteomics,andmetabolomicsstudieshaveshown that many clinically used commercial drugs (e.g.,aspirin,doxorubicin,etc.)mayinfactbindandworkonmul-tiple molecular targets. Multiple cell types, target molecules, and/or multiple signaling pathways are known to contribute to various diseases. Herbal extracts /mixtures prepared as traditionalphytomedicinesrepresentacombinationalchem-istry and \"thus claimed\" to encompass a vast and usefulrepertoireofchemicalentitiesthatcanconferacomplexandyet integrated effect on a spectrum of molecular and cellularcomponents and functions, resulting in a profound andbalanced medicinal activity. Unfortunately, according to thecurrent FDA and NIH cancer clinical trial regulations inUSA, such \"claims\" often directly conflict with the presentguidelines or guidance. One major drawback in the integra-tionofherbalmedicinesintomainstreamwesternmedicinesis, therefore, the lack of defined molecular targets. Withregardtothisconcern,recentresearchfindingsrevealedfromaspectrumofomicsstudiesstronglysuggestthatamultifac-torialmodeofactionandmultitargetpharmaceuticalactivitymayinfactalreadybethe\"norm\"foraspectrumofcurrentlyused clinical drugs. As a result, there may be much less dif-ferenceintermsofthecomplexityofmoleculartargetsaimedby single compound drugs versus complex herbal medicineextracts than was originally assumed, as we previouslydemonstrated in a cancer cell line study [ 129]. We may then further project that the \"multi-target\" approach or activitybelieved for various herbal medicines may in fact be \"rea- sonableandunderstandable\"andthereforebepositivelycon- sideredandpreparedinbotanicaldrugdevelopment.Poolingdatafromindividualtrialsbyusingameta-analysisapproachmaybeausefulstrategytointerpretattheresultsofagroupofinconclusivetrials[ 130]. The uncertain or not well-defined composition of herbal products also raises questions about their safety, such asthe evidence indicating that some herbal extracts may haveharmful interactions with specific prescription drugs [ 131]. To address this issue, the establishment of optimized CMC(chemistry, manufacture, and control) conditions for eachherbal preparation will need to be considered as importanttechnology for confirming and standardizing the composi-tionofspecificmedicinalherbcomponents.Towardthisaim,we believe that the pattern-oriented approach (fingerprintanalysis) is a good strategy, because it can evaluate theintegrative and holistic properties of test herbal medicinesbycomparingthesimilarities,differences,andcorrelationofthe results from analyses of the whole production process,including manufacture, processing and storage of raw mate-rials for preparation, intermediate products, finished prod-ucts, and the distribution products [ 132,133]. Yongyu and colleagues [ 134]h a v es y s t e m a t i c a l l yr e v i e w e dfi n g e r p r i n t methods for analyses of herbal medicines. The fingerprint profiling of therapeutically used herbal medicines can be employedasareferenceorindexforqualitycontrolofphyto-chemical composition, and the results can be used in futureclinicalapplications.Furthermore,thefingerprintingprofilescan also be coordinated with and employed for therapeuticEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 efficiency. This study approach was recently evaluated by an investigation of randomized controlled clinical trials (seeSection3). Inordertotreatspecificdiseases,itisdesirablethat\"mod- erndrugs\"canbegenerallyappliedtomostpatientswiththesame disease, although personalized medicine is becoming more popular.

Evidence of the Effect of Herbal Medicines in Randomized Controlled Trials Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (or randomized com- parative trials) currently serve as the gold standard for mostclinicaltrialsandprovidethebestevidenceoftheefficacyofhealthcare interventions [ 136]. Carefully planned and well- executed RCTs often obtain the best estimates of treatmenteffectandthushelpguideclinicaldecisionmaking;therefore,considerable effort is put into improving the design andreporting of RCTs [ 137,138]. Linde et al. [ 139]c o m m e n t e d that reporting quality may vary across different types ofcomplementary therapies, with herbal medicine trials beingapparently superior to homeopathy and acupuncture trials.Also, reporting quality differed among different individualbotanical medicines and improved continuouslyfor decadesfrom the 1980s to the 2000s [ 140]. With these controversies, in June 2004 an international group of pharmacologists,methodologists, pharmacognosists, and trialists met for aconsensus-making meeting, which then led to the devel-opment of recommendations for the reporting of herbalmedicine trials in Toronto, Canada [ 141]. An elaboration of CONSORT statement was put forward that aimed to aid researchers to more accurately assess the internal/externalvalidityandreproducibilityofherbalmedicinetrials,toallowa more accurate assessment of safety and efficacy of herbalmedicines [ 141,142]. Among the 22 CONSORT checklist items,9ofthemwereelaboratedtoenhancetheirrelevancetothe trials of herbal interventions, including the detailed rec-ommendationsfor1item(item4(interventions))andminorrecommendationsfor8items(item1(titleandabstract),item2 (background), item 3 (participants), item 6 (outcomes),item15(baselinedata),item20(interpretation),item21(gen-eralizability), and item 22 (overall evidence)) [ 141]. Specif- ically, the detailed recommendation in item 4 addressedthe concerns of the herbal medicine intervention, which is stillneedextensiveelaboration.TheserecommendationshavebeendevelopedtoimprovethereportingofRCTs. Although TCM and other herbal medicines are being used worldwide, their efficacies have only been studied in a sporadic way, with very few properly randomized andcontrolled studies. Trials of note that have employed a high standard of clinical trial methodology include Mok and colleagues [ 143] and Chan and colleagues [ 144]. Mok and colleagues examined the possible role of Chinese herbal medicine in reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity. They reportedthattraditionalChineseherbalmedicineseemedtohave a significant effect on the control of nausea in patients with early-stage breast or colon cancers, but these herbal medicinesdidnotreducethehematologictoxicityassociatedwithchemotherapy.Inaddition,Chanetal.[ 144]conducteda randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of test TCMs in improving QOL and reducing chemotox-icity and possible decrease in the side effects of systemic chemotherapy and the immune system status of patients undergoingastandardtreatmentforovariancancers.Inthisstudy, ovarian cancer patients were randomized to receive either the test TCM formulation or a placebo in addition to standard chemotherapy. The primary outcome was recordedby the global health status (GHS) score and assessed by the European Organizationfor Research and Treatment of Can- cer questionnaire, and the secondary outcomes were exam-ined using other QOL items, chemotoxicity levels definedaccordingtotheWorldHealthOrganization(WHO)criteria, andalterationsinspecificimmunefunctions.Theresultssug- gest TCM exerted in immune (e.g., lymphocyte count and cytokine activities) ratherthan improving QOL. However, as these randomized trialsfailed to recruit sufficient study numbers, we may need toconcludethat,inordertofullyevaluateanddemonstratespe-cificbioactivitiesandthemeritsofvariousTCMformulationsor plant extracts in cancer patients, continued, systematicefforts in conducting scientifically sound studies with RCTsarerequired[ 144]. 4.

Conclusion and Future Development For centuries if not millennia, various plants (many system-atized in traditional Chinese medicine) have been used asmedicinesanddiseasetherapeuticsinmosthumancultures.As exemplified in this review, over the last two decadesrenewed public interest and research efforts from scientificand medical communities worldwide have generated a largevolumeofinformationincludingclinicalstudiesandtrialsonthepharmacologicaleffects,usage,andthedevelopmentintofuture medicines of herbs and derivative medicinal phy-tochemicals as anti-tumor and chemoprevention agents.Although considerable effort has been put into the verifica- tion and upgrade of many traditional remedies or multiple-herbformulations,systematic,standardizedresearchandtheuseofFDAregulatoryprotocolsanddefinedclinicaltrialsarestillquitelimitedandneedtobeactivelypursued.Atthesametime, it is necessary for scientists, clinicians, and regulatory agencies to actively consider how to create novel, improved, or modified clinical surveys, studies, and trial mechanismsthat employ the stringent trial standards of the 21st centurybut also incorporate, at the international level, the wealth ofold empirical but incomplete data from various records anddocuments accumulated by traditional medicine practicesworldwide,toexpeditethediscoveryanddevelopmentofnewphytomedicinesandbotanicaldrugs. While continuous and systematic effort is needed, a numberofnotable\"breakthroughs\"haveoccurredinthefieldofmedicinalplantresearchandbotanicaldrugsinthelastfewyears.InApril2008,theFDAapprovedtheveryfirstbotanicaldrug, Veregen, a partially purified fraction of the waterextractofgreentealeavesfrom Camelliasinensis ,f o rt o p ical treatment of external genital and perianal warts [ 160]. Very recently(January2013),theFDAapproved,forthefirsttime,an oral botanical drug, Crofelemer (a purified oligomericproanthocyanidin from the latex of the South AmericanCroton lechleri tree), for treatment of diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients.AlthoughthesetwopioneerFDA-approvedbotani-caldrugsarenottherapiesforcancer,theycertainlypavewayfor such future developments. One possible example is theongoing (2013) FDA clinical trial on \"PHY906.\" This four-herbal-plant-composed TCM formulation has been shown to confer with good evidence [ 74]. It is our hope that the phaseIIIclinicaltrialofthisformulawillleadthewayinthedevelopment of CAM for cancer patients. With the variousother new clinical trials ongoing, CAM may start playingcriticalrolesinfuturehealthcareofagingpopulations. Conflict of Interests Theauthorsdeclarenoconflictofinterests.

Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignancies in China, ranks as the second leading cause ofcancer mortality [ 1] and approximately accounts for half in theworld[ 2].Globally,thereareapproximately750,000new casesofHCCreportedperyear[ 3].TheincidenceofHCCis increasing rapidly in the United States and other developedcountries [ 3]. Moreover, features of HCC are an aggressive cancer with a dismal outcome largely due to metastasis andpostsurgicalrecurrence[ 4]. Asknown,surgicalresection,embolization,ablation,and chemotherapyplayimportantrolesinthetreatmentofHCC, but it is limited to a significant extent by its toxicities, significant resistance to available chemotherapeutic agents,side effects and complexities. Given the poor prognosisassociated with HCC and limited treatment options outsideof surgery, patients seek additional therapies to improvequalityoflife(QOL)orsurvival.Onepossiblewaytoincreasethe efficacy of anticancer drugs and to decrease toxicitiesor side effects is to develop complementary and alternativemedicine(CAM).TraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM),one ofthemostpopularCAMformsworldwide,hasbeenwidelyused in cancer, especially from Chinese herbal medicine(CHM)[5]. In China, there has been a long history of using TCM in the treatment of liver cancer and other malignancies. The clinical diagnosis and treatment in TCM are mainly based on theyin-yangand five elements theories wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, an ancient philosophical concept used to explainthecompositionandphenomenaofthephysicaluni- verse.Thesetheoriesapplythephenomenaandlawsofnatureto the study of the physiological activities and pathological The typical TCM therapies include acupuncture, CHM, andqigongexercises.TheCHMcontainshundredsofmedic- inal substances, mainly plants, but also some minerals and animalproductsclassifiedbytheirperformedfunctioninthe body.DifferentpartsofCHMsuchastheleaves,roots,stems, flowers,andseedsarewidelyused.Usually,CHMiscombinedinformulasandsingle.2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine As the theory of TCM including CHM in the manage- ment of tumors concentrates on integrity and functionalregulation of the organism, which coincides with oncologyofmodernmedicine,itspositionincombinationtherapyforHCC has attracted more attention. Recently, accumulatingevidencesdemonstratedthatCHMattenuatesHCCprolifer- ation,invasion,andmetastasisinbasicresearchandimproves patientswithHCCsurvivalandoverallresponserate aswellin clinical study. This review will provide the reader with anew understanding of CHM's properties with an emphasisonregulationofmultiplemoleculartargetsofimportanceforHCC in basic research and representative CHM combinedwithclassictreatmentforHCC. 2. The Representative CHM Formula in Basic Research 2.1. Songyou Yin Formula. Nontoxic and supporting the healthy energy ( Fuzheng Guben )herbal formulasplay active roles in the anticancer. Yin , one of the important representative herbal formulas, expression [ 6]. Moreover, the formula improved living life, minimized cancer-related weight loss, and prolonged thesurvival of nude mice bearing tumors [ 6]. In experiments conducted for opposite effects of chemotherapy enhancingt h em a l i g n a n c yo ft r e a t e dH C C ,X i o n ge ta l .f o u n dt h a tSongyou Yin attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibited the enhanced metastatic potential ofr e s i d u a lH C Ci nn u d em i c e[ 7]. For another, the formula can render HCC sensitive to oxaliplatin via the inhibitionofstemness by induction of cancer stem cells (CSCs) differen-tiation or direct elimination of CSCs to decrease expressionof CSC-related markers in tumor tissues and cell lines [ 8]. As known, palliative resection Xiaozheng Yin Formula. Th eu s eo fh e a tc l e a r i n g anddetoxicating(Chinesenamed qingrejiedu )CHMinclud- ingJiedu Xiaozheng Yin has attracted antitumor including HCC. Jiedu Xiaozheng Yin(JXY), a polyherbal Pseudobulbus Cremastrae seuPleiones,SpicaPrunellae andRadixSophoraeFlavescentis study performed in HCC proliferationand growth, Cao et al. found that JXY inhibited the growthof HCC and the formation of cell colonies and blockedthe cell cycle to G1 phase in a dose-dependent mannerin vitro. Meanwhile, JXY showed an obvious antitumor and cyclin E) [ 10]. using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),chickchorioallantoicmembrane(CCM),andanHCCmousexenograft model, JXY treatment significantly reduced tubeformation of HUVECs, and angiogenesis in the CCM, andmicrovessel density of tumor in vivo[11]. Further studies showedthatJXYsuppressedthevascularendothelialgrowth factor A (VEGF-A) expression and its receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) among the HCC HepG2 cells, HUVECs, c-fos proto-oncogene, c-jun, and c-myconcogenes plays crucial role in the pathogenesis of HCC[12]. 2.3. Huqi San Formula. Huqi San, one of the experiences of famous Chinese anticancer drugs, consists of of it on rat befor-hepatocarcinogenesisinduced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) by analyzing themutational activation of c-fos and overexpression of c-juna n dc - m y c .A n dt h ef o r m u l ac a ni n h i b i tt h eo v e r e x p r e s s i o nof it and liver preneoplastic lesions induced by DEN [ 12]. Another, Wen et al. demonstrated the modulation effect ofenergymetabolicenzymeexpressiononDEN-mediatedhep-atocarcinogenesis by Huqi San. They found that the formula treated rats showed significant decrease in areas of gamma-GTpositivefociandactivityofAFP[ 13].Ontheotherhand, theformulaobviouslyincreasedtheseactivitiesofG-6-Pase,SDH, and ATPase. Huqi San is a potential function and inducingapoptosisoftumorcells in vivoandin vitro.Caoetal.found that mice treated with percentagesofCD3(+)andCD4(+),andmoreNKcells,andhighest serum levels of IL-2 and TNF- in the peripheral blood than those in the animals treated with normal saline.The results indicated that high-dose Fuzheng Yiliu granule- containing serum significantly decreased HepG2 cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis [ 15]. ThepresentstudysuggeststhatrepresentativeCHMformula properties with an emphasis on regulation of HCC multiplemoleculartargetsareofimportance invitroandinvivo. 3. The Representative CHM Formula in Clinical Research HCC is a multifactor and multistage process, and it is relatively difficultly to find a specific medication. Therefore,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 a wide consensus that combination therapy is most likely the way resulting in developing new therapy strategies forHCCinthefuturehasbeenreachedinacademicinstitution.Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is themost widely used primary treatment for unresectable HCCbecause of its survival benefit, although its clinical effect is stillfarfromsatisfactory[ 16].InChina,therehasbeenalong history of using CHM such as JDF granules, Jiedu, granules andganjiDecoction in the treatment of HCC and other malignancies. JDF chinensis of TACE combined JDF granulepreparation could improve the prognosis of patients andprolong the survival of patients with unresectable HCC [ 41.2%, 18.4%, and 9.6%, respectively. Additional,theCoxregressionanalysisrevealedthetherapymodeltobean independent predictor of patient prognosis. Importantly,thecurrentstudyprovidespreliminaryandpowerfuldatatosupport future evaluation of CHM in combination therapyforHCCinalarge-cohort,randomizedclinicaltrial(RCT). To effetely prevent the recurrence of HCC after surgical resection, a case-control trial, Jiedugranules, a CHM com- pound, plus cinobufacini injection, extracted from skin ofBufo bufo gargarizans Cantor after operation versus TACE after postoperation management of HCC,can postpone tumor recurrence and metastasis, prolong thes u r v i v a lt i m e ,a n di n c r e a s et h es u r v i v a lr a t eo fp o s t s u r g i c a lpatientswithHCC[ 18]. To evaluate whether CHM improves immune response for 1,008 unresectable HCC after TACE by using meta-analysis of data from the literature involving available 12RCT of CHM in combination with TACE compared withthatofTACEalone,literatureretrievalwasconducted.Menget al. showed that the differences of pooled weighted meandifference before and after treatment and 95% CI were 13.63(8.96-18.69;=0.0001 )fortheproportionofCD3(+)Tcells, 10.56 (6.91-14.21;=0.0001 ) for of CD4(+) T cells, 3.40 (6.83 to 0.03;=0.052 )f o rt h ep r o p o r t i o n of CD8(+) T cells, 0.54 (0.42-0.66; =0.0001 )f o rt h e ratio of CD4 +/CD8+, and 12.34 (7.26-17.41;=0.0001 )f o r the proportion of NK cells. No serious adverse events were reported. Thus, TCM in combination with TACE improvestheimmuneresponseofpatientswithunresectableHCC[ 19]. To observe the efficacy of TCM comprehensive therapeuticproject in treating the middle/late stage patients with HCC,with prospective RCT, 97 patients with HCC were assigned tothetestgroup(49cases)treatedwithTCMcomprehensivetherapyusing Oleumfructusbruceas interventioncombining oral intake of ganjiDecoction and external application ofAilitong, and the control group (48 cases) was treated withchemotherapeuticagentscombiningiodizedoilchemo- embolizationandanalgesics[ 20].Tocomparetheefficacyand sa f etyo fCHMp l u sT CEwi thth a to fT A CEalo n e(th era p yIversustherapyII)intreatingunresectableHCCviaameta- analysis of all available 37 RCTs involving 2653 patients, an important research was performed [ 21]. The results showed thattherapyIcomparedwiththerapyIIimprovedthepatient survival, QOF, alleviation of symptoms, and tumor response and was thus more therapeutically beneficial. Moreover, noserious adverse events were reported [ 21]. This trial study displayed that TCM comprehensive therapy is an effective treatmentforthemiddle/latestagepatientswithHCC,anditcould extend the pain-relieving sustained time and improvethe patients' QOL and long-term survival with less adverse reaction. Evidence from patients with HCC trials suggests that representative CHM formula combined with TACEimproveoverallsurvival,QOL,andimmunefunction. 4. The Representative CHM Single Herb in Basic Research CHM, including animal and plant herbs, plays important roles in the treatment of malignancy including HCC. important for treatment of HCC.Bufalin, one of the representative animal herbs, is the majorcomponent of Chan-Chu extracted from toad's skins. With respecttoautophagyinHCC,Tsaietal.investigatedthephar-macological mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and autophagiccelldeathinducedbybufalininSK-HEP-1humanHCCcellsin vitro[22]. Data showed that bufalin triggered autophagic cell death and G2/M phase arrest through the AKT/mTORsignaling pathway in SK-HEP-1 cells. For another, bufalintriggeredautophagyandenhancedBeclin-1expression,LC3-It oL C 3 - I Ic o n v e r s i o n ,a sw e l la sd e c r e a s e dp 6 2e x p r e s -sion and signaling activation in bufalin-treated cells, suggesting that bufalin induces HepG2 cells for autophagyat least in part via AMPK-mTOR dependent pathway.Similarly, arenobufagin, a well as corresponding multidrug-resistant in HCC cells as well as increasing They observed the inhibition of phosphatidylinos-itol evidenced above, underlying antineoplastic mechanisms of arenobufagin involve cross talk between apoptosis and angiogenesis, inhibited viability, and tube for- mation in HUVECs in vitroand suppressed sprouting for- mation from aortic in an ex vivomodel angiogenesis in a Additionally, arenob-ufagin inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 autophosphory-lation and suppressed the activity of VEGFR-2-mediated signaling cascades. With regard to HCC cell apoptosis and proliferation, our teams previous study showed that Flos Chrysanthemi Indici exerted a significant apoptotic effect via a mitochondrial pathway and arrested the cell cycle by regulationofcellcycle-relatedproteinsinhumanMHCC97Hcells, a HCC cell line with high metastatic potential [ 26]. Following, we investigated the effect of this herbon isopro- terenol induced growth of human HCC cells in correlationwith the intracellular activity of MAPK/ERK1/2 and found thattheherbwaseffectiveinattenuatingthemitogeniceffect of isoproterenol on both HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. The inhibitory effect of the plant was mediated by inhibiting the isoproterenol-induced activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 via beta2-ARintumorcells[ 27].Inaddition,ourstudyindicated thatFlos Chrysanthemi Indici inhibited the invasion and migration ability of MHCC97H cells, as assesses through a matrigel-coated membrane invasion. Moreover, the herb c o u l dr e d u c et h ec a n c e rc e l lm e t a s t a t i ca b i l i t y ,i np a r ta tleast,throughdecreaseoftheMMPexpression,simultaneous increase of the TIMP expression, and further restoring their balance as a therapeutic target in HCC [ 28]. Dai et al. found that Herba Scutellariae Darbatae Radix (HSDR) effectively inhibits the proliferation and apoptosis of H22 cells involving loss of mitochondrial transmembranepotential,releaseofcytochromeC,andactivationofcaspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner [ 29].The effect of HSDR on immune function was determined using hepatoma H22 tumor bearing mice. The results demonstrate that the plantincreased weight, thymus, and spleen index of H22 bearing miceandphagocytoticfunctionofmacrophagesbyobserving peritonealmacrophagesphagocytizechickenredbloodcells.It is suggested that HSDR improves the immune function of hepatoma H22 tumor bearing mice [ 30]. Regarding the detoxification and enhancement for chemotherapy, high-dose HSDR combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) could significantlyenhancethetumorinhibitionrate,thymus,and spleen index in immunological organs. The data displayedthat HSDR can significantly enhance the tumor inhibition rate of 5-FU, reduce the toxic effects, prolong the survival time, and improve immune function in the H22 tumor-bearingmice[ 31].Matrine,analkaloidpurifiedfromtheChi- neseherb RadixSophoraeFlavescentis, significantlyinhibited t h ep r o l i f e r a t i o na n di n d u c e dG 1 - p h a s ec e l lc y c l ea r r e s ta n dapoptosisofHCCHepG2cellsinadose-dependentmanner. Fewer autophagic vacuoles were observed in the combined 3-MA and matrine treatment group when 3-MA was addedbefore matrine treatment, indicating that both autophagy and apoptosis are when matrine-induced deathof HepG2 cells occurs [ 32]. Baicalein, a extracted from the roots of Radix Scutellariae , exhibited significant cytotoxicity to three HCC cell lines but marginalcytotoxicity to a normal liver cell line. Treatment with baicalein dramatically reduced mitochondrial transmem- brane potential, MEK1, ERK1/2, and Bad in vitroandin vivo. Consequently, these findings suggest that BaicaleinpreferentiallyinhibitsHCCtumorgrowththroughinhibition of MEK-ERK signaling and by inducing intrinsicapoptosis[ 33].TheseresultssuggesttherepresentativeCHM singleherbpropertieswithanemphasisonregulationofHCCmultiplemoleculartargetsofimportance invitroandinvivo. 5. The Representative CHM Single Herb in Clinical Research Kanglaite injection, one of Chinese herb preparations, extractedfromCHMcoixseedoil,hadbeenconfirmedwith antitumor activity including HCC [ 34]. Zhu et al. found thatKanglaite injection combined with TACE was signifi- cantly superior to TACE group in improving symptoms andKarnofskyscores,decreasingtumorgrowthandside-effectof marrow toxicity for patients with advanced stage HCC [ 35]. Regarding the single CHM use in combination with TACE,occasionally, single CHM was used to be combined with somefirst-lineanticanceragents. Kanglaite injectionreverses multidrug resistance tioncombinedwithCapecitabineforpatientswithadvanced displayed better time-to-progression, and median survival time[36].FructusBruceae oilandganjirecipecombinationof TACEshowedthattheimprovementsinthetreatmentgroup,including patients' physical energy enhancing, symptoms alleviating, and overall QOL improving, were superior to t h o s ei nt h eT A C Eg r o u p[ 37]. Yang et al. observed that patientswithadvancedHCCweretreatedwithTACEusingB. javanicaoil/lipiodolmixtureperfusionremobilization(treat- ment group) or using conventional chemotherapy/lipiodolchemoembolization infusion (control group) [ 38]. The data displayed that the incidence of toxic side effects in thetreatment group was less than that in the controlgroup afterthe intervention. Compare with the 0.5 and 1-year survivalrate,thetreatmentgroupwas96.1%(25/26)and50%(13/26)and the control group was 83.3% (20/24) and 33.3% (8/24).Additionally, two group cases with a median survival timewere 8.9 and 6.7 months, respectively. It is suggests thatrepresentative single CHM combined with TACE improvedtheoverallsurvivals,QOLandreducesthetoxicsideeffects.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 6. The Effects of Detoxification and Enhancement for Chemotherapy on CHM Previous studies have demonstrated that, one of the repre- s e n t a t i v eC H M ,H S D Ri n c r e a s e dt h ew e i g h t ,t h y m u s ,a n dspleen index of H22 bearing mice and phagocytotic func-tion of macrophages by observing peritoneal macrophagesphagocytize chicken red blood cells [ 31]. Regarding the detoxification and enhancement for chemotherapy, high-doseHSDRcombinedwith5-FUcouldsignificantlyenhancethe tumor inhibition rate, thymus, and spleen index inimmunological organs. The data displayed that CHM cansignificantly reduce the toxic effects and improve immunefunction. CHM plus TACE significantly increases nonde-terioration performance, T cells, natural killer cells, andwhite blood cell count, significantly decreases the level of blood alpha-fetoprotein concentration, and significantly l o w e r st h er i s kf o rn a u s e aa n dv o m i t i n g[ 39]. Furthermore, meta-analysis has also demonstrated that CHM plus TACEincreases the proportions of cluster differentiation CD3(+)Tc e l l s ,C D 4 ( + )Tc e l l s ,a n dN Kc e l l s ,a sw e l la st h er a t i oo fCD4 +/CD8+beforeandaftertreatment[ 19].Ameta-analysis ofRCTforCHMcombinedwithchemotherapyhasreportedpromisingevidencethatCHMpluschemotherapymayhavebenefits on patients with HCC [ 40].Astragalus might also boost host immune function by stimulating macrophageand NK cell activity [ 31]. Moreover, Astragalus appears to restoreinvitroT-cellfunction,whichissuppressedincancer patients [ 31]. The main ingredient of Kanglaite injection is coix seed oil. Kanglaite injection exerted a significant inducing apoptotic effect and arrested the cell cycle byinhibitionofMstageincancercells.Another, actives NK function as well [ 34,35]. And it can induce tumor cell apoptosis, block tumor cell mitosis, improve immunefunction, reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy, and relievecancerpain[ 34].Fructus Bruceae oilemulsion( Yadanzioil), one of Chinese herb preparations, significantly inhibittopoisomerase, reverses the multidrug resistance, and hasobviouschemotherapysensitizationinHCCcells[ 37]. 7. Side Effects of CHM No significant drug-related side effects were observed in the study group. The majority of patients reported mildto moderate side effects. The main side effects associatedwithCHMwerelowerfever,gastrointestinalsymptoms,bonemarrowsuppression,neurotoxicity,hand-footsyndrome,andsoforth[17,34-38]. 8. Conclusions The rising of the use of TCM, particularly CHM has worldwide sparked an extreme interest in more and morepeople and researchers. Recently, the use of heat-clearingand detoxicating (Chinese named qingre jiedu )C H Mh a s attractedgreatattentionasanalternativeantitumorincludingHCCconsideringitslowtoxicityandhighactivity.ForHCCin basic research, CHM has been found to be active against hepatocarcinogenesis,proliferation,invasion,metastasis,andangiogenesis.Additionally,CHMcombinedwithchemother-a p ycouldsignifican tlyenhancetheH CCinhib i tio nra teandimmune function in immunological organs and reduce thetoxic effects. All these beneficial effects will ameliorate the radiation,chemotherapy,andTACEinducedadverseeffects. Theseoutcomesofsuchstudiesmaybeusefulfortheclinicalapplications of HCC in human beings against cancers andmayopenupanewtherapeuticavenue.Duetoitsabundance,lowcost,andsafetyinconsumption,CHMremainsaspecieswithtremendouspotentialforfurtherinvestigationinHCC. For patients with advanced HCC, CHM including for- mula and single was used to be combined with TACE orchemotherapy usually, decreasing tumor growth and sideeffect of toxicity, and to prolong overall survival, QOF,and immune function. Together these reports indicate thatCHMisapromisinganti-HCCherbalremedy.However,dueto various factors\u2014including inconsistencies in treatmentschemes, the limited sampling sizes, and lack of qualityassuranceoftheherbalproductswell-designedRCTstoprovethe effectiveness of TCM as adjuvant therapy for cancer arescarce. In general, most of the published clinical studieswere trials without rigorous randomization or they involvedsingle group pre-post, cohort, time series, or matched case-control studies. Fore another, studies should be performedon a large number of HCC patients receiving radiotherapy,chemotherapeutic, postoperative combination with CHM.Moreover, the clinical trials are insufficient to draw firmconclusionsforthesingleuseofCHMinpatientswithHCC.

In this review, we desc ribe the usefulness of Kampo medicine, especially juzentaihoto, andoutlinethereportsonevidence,inadditiontothereportonanattitudinalsurveyabouttheuseofKampomedicineincancertreatmentinJapan. 1. Limitations of Standard Cancer Treatment Western medicine should be used in preference to Kampo medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Medicaldiagnosisbasedonwesternmedicineisessentialtodeterminethe exact degree of progression and malignancy of cancer[1-4]. Western medicine successfully treats many types of cancer,whentheappropriatetreatmentisused.Clinicaltrials to date demonstrate that standard cancer treatments arecurrently the most efficient treatments for large numbers ofcancerpatients[ 5-8].Thecurrentstandardcancertreatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Reli-abletherapyhasnotbeenestablishedyetforrefractorycancer,includingadvancedorrecurrentcancer. Advanced experimental therapies using special anti- cancer agents, radiation, immunotherapy, and gene therapyhave been attempted. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are called \"invasive treatments\" [ 9-12]. The term \"invasive\"means\"harmfultothebody\"aswellas\"attackingt h ec a n c e r . \"A g g r e s s i v et r e a t m e n th a st h ed i s a d v a n t a g eo fdamaging normal tissue and reducing tumor immunity andphysical strength. This is especially true in bone marrowcells or intestinal mucosal epithelia, in which the cell cycleis vigorous [ 13-18]. The tissues and organs of the whole body maintain order in their structure and function byincorporating nutrients and oxygen from the blood intocells, excreting waste, and repairing old and scar tissues.Thisiscalled\"naturalhealingpower\"or\"self-healingpower.\"Abnormal cells such as cancer cells are constantly produced inourbody,butaslongastheimmunesystemismaintained properly,theyareeliminatedpriortogrowthorprogression.This means that as long as the immune system is working2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine properly, cancer is constantly being \"cured,\" without any treatment. Cancer treatments will increasingly require approaches that allow patients to live with cancer, by increasing theirnaturalhealingpowerandtumorimmunity,aswellasatten-uating the progression of their cancers, instead of attacking the cancer cells [ 19-21]. Complementary and alternative medicine, including Kampo medicine [ 22-25], compensates for the drawbacks of western medicine by increasing thebody's healing power and resistance [ 26-29]. The term \"multidisciplinary treatment of cancer\" refers to treatmentthat appropriately utilizes a combination of treatments suchas standard treatment, advanced experimental treatments,medicalcaretoenhancetheanticancerandhealingpowerofthe body, and palliative care, depending on the state of thecancer patient. The goal of holistic treatment, or integratedcare, is not only to kill cancer cells but also to address thehealing power and resistance of the body. Kampo treatmentcanprovideveryusefultherapeuticoptionstoachieveholistictherapyandmultidisciplinarytreatmentforcancer[ 30-36]. 2. Surveys of the Use of Kampo in Cancer Treatment in Japan Three papers investigating the use of Kampo in cancer treatment in Japan were published in 2012. Takeda et al.[37]c o n d u c t e das e l f - r e p o r t e dq u e s t i o n n a i r eo nK a m p o medicine involving a total of 476 patients with gynecologiccancers. Anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait AnxietyInventory. It was confirmed that 22.9% of the women hadusedKampomedicine.Kampousersweremorelikelytohavehadchemotherapyandweremorelikelytohaveexperienceduncomfortable adverse effects of cancer treatment. Kampousers were more likely to believe that Kampo offers relief ofsymptoms with less adverse effects and that Kampo is moreeffective than western medicine. Kampo users expressedstronger attitudes in regard to taking Kampo medicine.Multipleregressionanalysisrevealedthatchemotherapy(RR,1.82; CI, 1.14-2.91), lower state anxiety (RR, and higher trait anxiety (RR, 1.46; 95% CI,1.11-1.92) were independently associated with Kampo use.Thestudyshowedthatapproximatelyone-fourthofJapanesegynecologic cancer patients take Kampo medicine. Kampousers made more favorable comments on Kampo medicinethannonusers.Theauthorsconcludedthatthepsychological characteristics of individual patients are one of the factors thatcaninfluencetheusageofKampo . Iwase et al. [ 38] conducted a cross-sectional self- administered anonymous questionnaire among 549 physi-cians working in palliative care teams at 388 core cancertreatment hospitals and 161 certified medical institutionsthat have palliative care units (PCUs). Valid responses wereobtained from 311 physicians (56.7%) who were evenlydistributed throughout the country without significant geo-graphicalbiases.Kampomedicineswereprescribedforcon-trollingcancer-relatedsymptomsby64.3%ofthephysicians.The symptoms treated ) ,m u s c l ec r a m p s to increase the clinical use of KampomedicinesandthattheactionmechanismsofKampo shouldbeclarifiedthroughlaboratoryresearch. Ito et al.

The authors concludedthat further research on the efficacy and safety of Kampomedicine in cancer treatment is warranted to resolve thisdiscrepancybetweenpatients'andphysicians'expectations. 3. The Role of Kampo Medicine in Multidisciplinary Treatment of Cancer The Kampo medicine approach is to prevent cancer by emphasizingthebody'sdefensemechanismandnaturalheal-ing power [ 22-25]. The existence of even early stage cancer indicates that the healing system is already in functionaldecline. The fundamental approach of Kampo treatment isto remove obstacles to healing, compensate for deficiencies,and consider the required combination of crude drugs. Inwestern medicine, ideas aimed at activation and nourishingof tissue function are scant, whereas Kampo medicine con-siders these ideas as the most important treatment strategy.Kampo medicine recognizes that diseases are processes ofstruggling between individual-specific resistance power andexternal force of robing those power (e.g., virus). And theformerdirectlydeterminestheoccurrence,progression,andoutcome of disease. Sanity is a Kampo concept includingall of the antidisease substances in the living body, which in modern medicine equates to natural healing power, comprising the mechanisms of self-defense, homeostasis,immunesurveillance,andtissuerepair.Theimmunesystem,antioxidantactionstopreventharmbyactiveoxygen,andthetissuerepairsystem alsobasicallycorrespondtotheconceptof sanity in Kampo medicine. In Kampo cancer treatment,we try to treat dysfunction of the body that leads to cancerprogression and also try to enhance body function to regainsanity. This is a core characteristic of Kampo treatment ofcancer. The present position of Kampo medicine in the medical treatment of cancer in Japan allows patients to access west-ern and Kampo medical treatments simultaneously. KampoEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 medicine[ 22-25]isauniquemedicalsystemthatoriginated from ancient China, was gradually imported to Japan, andhasbeenimprovedandrefinedbymanyexcellentphysicianss i n c et h eE d op e r i o d .M o s tK a m p op r e p a r a t i o n s( J a p a n e s etraditional herbal medicines) are available as extract formu-lations,whicharegreatlydifferentfromtheherbalmedicine practiced in China, Taiwan, and Korea. Four ethical Kampo extract formulations were approved in 1967 in Japan. Sincethen, the number of ethical Kampo extract formulationscovered by health insurance has grown to 148. Japan'suniversal health insurance system [ 40,41]d o e sa l l o wf o r simultaneous access to traditional Kampo preparations andwestern medicines. However, physicians in Japan cannot belicensed without passing a board examination on westernmedicine, which means that patients in this country receivehealthcarewithahighdegreeofsafety.ThisisanotherfactorthatdistinguishesthehealthcaresysteminJapanfromothercountries. In Japan, physicians who have studied westernmedicine and Kampo medicine practice these approachesin their medical treatment of cancer with the aim of fusingeastern and western medicine into a unitary medical system(unlike the dual medical systems in China or Republic ofKorea). Th eg o a lo ft h es y s t e mi st oa s s i s tt h ef u n c t i o n a lm a i n - tenance and recovery of the living body complex, a hostincorporating a nutrient state, mental balance, and so forth,ratherthanaddressingdirectanticancerefficacy.Thepresentcondition and stance of Kampo medicine in the medicaltreatment of cancer in Japan clearly diverges from develop-mentofananticancerherbalmedicineandformulationofan antitumorherbaltablet. 4. Juzentaihoto: A Typical Kampo Formula for Cancer Treatment Juzentaihoto is an effective Kampo medicine for promoting restoration of physical strength after surgery and alleviatingadverse effects of anticancer drugs or radiation therapy.While there are many other useful Kampo medicines, thisdiscussion focuses on juzentaihoto. Table 1andFigure1 show juzentaihoto's composition and constituent analysis.Juzentaihotoisindicatedforthereliefofdeclinedconstitutionafter recovery from disease, fatigue and malaise, anorexia,perspirationduringsleep,coldlimbs,andanemia.Importantprecautions, (1) when this product is used, patient's \" sho\" (constitution and symptoms) should be taken into account. Patient's progress should be carefully monitored, and if noimprovement in symptoms or findings is observed, contin-uous treatment should be avoided. (2) Since this productcontains Glycyrrhiza, careful attention should be paid tothe serum potassium level, blood pressure, and so forth,and if any abnormality is observed, administration shouldbe discontinued. (3) When this product is coadministeredwith other Kampo preparations (Japanese traditional herbalmedicines),attentionshouldbepaidtotheduplicationofthecontainedcrudedrugs.

It has also been reported to have an antiangiogenic action in malignant glioma. There havebeen studies of its actionsin suppressing carcinogenesisandmetastasis[ 43-48]. Juzentaihoto's biological activity has also been widely reported. Among these reports are studies that found thatit activates macrophages, enhances antibody production,induces cytokine production, and has other immunoen-hancement actions, in addition to protection against distur-bance of myelopoiesis and against immune suppression immunologicalfunctionsandantitumoractivityinoldmice.JuzentaihotoincreasedthenumberofTcellsremarkablyandNKcellsslightlyintheagedmice,whileasignificantincreasewasnotobservedinyoungmice. Treatment with juzentaihoto increased NK activity in both young and old mice. Therefore, the combination ofIFNs with juzentaihotomay providea meansto cancer patients[51].Thiseffectcanleadtoimmunoaugmentationforvarious combination therapies. Genetic analysis using microarrayshas recently been used to indicate its effects in germ-freemice [52]. Ogawa et al. also report that myelosuppression duetoTS-1inmicemaybeimprovedwithcoadministrationof juzentaihoto [ 53]. It is often used for adjunct therapy to cancer therapy as well as the main clinical goals ofimproving patients' quality of life and alleviating the sideeffects of anticancer agents and radiation therapy, anorexia,fatigue,andmalaiseandreducedphysicalstrengthfollowingillness.

Summary Several aspects of Kampo treatment in Japan have been introduced here with respect to holistic care, integrativetherapy, and multidisciplinary treatment of cancer patients.The Kampo medicine approach is to control cancer bybringing out the natural healing power inherent to liv-ing bodies and emphasizing body's defense mechanism. Inwestern medicine, ideas aimed at activation of organ func-tions and nourishment are scant, whereas Kampo medicineregardsenhancementofself-defensemechanismsasthemostimportant strategy.

Introduction Astrocytic tumors comprise a wide range of neoplasms of thecentralnervoussystem(CNS)whichshowsinvasiveandprogressive growth. The following clinicopathological enti-ties can as astrocytomas mostcommonsiteofthesetumorsisthebrain[ 2].Theymake up about 42% of all brain tumors including benign tumorsand80%ofallmalignantbraintumors[ 3].Thesetumorstend to grow and infiltrate into the normal brain tissue, whichmakes complete surgical removal very difficult, or usuallyimpossible,andcomplicatestreatment[ 4].TheWorldHealth Organization (WHO) classifies astrocytomas into the previ-ously described four grades depending on how fast they aregrowing and the likelihood that they will spread (infiltrate) to nearby brain tissue [ 5]. Grade II astrocytomas are also called low-grade astrocytomas or diffuse astrocytomas andare usually infiltrating tumors. These tumors grow relatively slow and usually do not have well-defined borders. They are generallymorecommoninmenandaremostcommoninthe cerebralhemispheresofyoungadultpatients[ 6]. Patients with brain tumors have many problems which relatetotheconsequencesofneurologicaldysfunctioncaused byadestructiveorinvasivetumormassinthecentralnervous system. Astrocytic tumors can cause several neurologicalsymptoms such as sensorimotor deficit, ataxia, language problems,andcognitivedecline[ 7].Symptomscanarisefrom the disease process itself, which usually causes focal neuro- logical damage, and the side effects of treatment (surgery,2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) can cause more dif- fuse damage [ 6]. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that although more than 60 percent of patients with astrocytic t u m o r ss u ff e rfr o mh e m i p a r e s i sa tt h et i m eo fd i a g n o s i s ,b u tonly3percentcomplainofweaknessastheinitialsymptom.At the onset of their disease, patients with gliomas have relativelylowratesofhemiparesisandhemianesthesia,bythe timeofdiagnosis,someorallofthesefindingsarepresentinthemajorityofpatients[ 8]. For more than 3000 years, practitioners in China have used acupuncture to treat various diseases, including hemi- paresis[9].Acupuncturetreatmentalsohasbecomeincreas- ingly popular in western societies. Acupuncture, as a treat- ment of individuals with hemiplegia after stroke, has a longtraditioninChinaandcanimprovefunctionsandthequalityof life. Recent studies showed benefits in the rehabilitationof strokes [ 10-12]. But while there are still limitations in the quality[13],furthercontrolledtrialshavebeenrecommended andrecommendationsforstudydesignshavebeenpublished[14]. The reporting of the promising results of acupuncture on hemiparesis after a stroke to other causes of hemiparesisis unclear and has not been investigated on a large scale inpatientswithastrocyticbraintumors.Eventhoughacupunc- ture is a common treatment option for brain tumors in China [15,16], no randomized, controlled studies have yet explored the effectiveness of acupuncture on the treatmentofhemiparesisduetoastrocytomatypeII. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify whether acupuncturecansignificantlyimprovesensory-motorbehav-ior and the quality of life for hemiplegia patients with astro-cytoma grade II. While new protocols for hemiparesis after a stroke recommend a standard concept for the selection of acupuncturepoints[ 14],theeffectofthepointsonthebasisof theprominentsymptomatologyforanindividualizedtherapymightofferadditionaltreatmenteffects. InChinesemedicinetheoryhemiplegia,whichiscaused bybraintumors,hasasimilarpathogenesistothatdescribedafter a \"blood stasis\", \"deficiency\", and \" yang-hyperactivi- ty\"asthemainpathologicalfactors.Previousstudiesshowedthat acupuncture treatment by needling the RenandDu meridians can effectively improve motor disturbance forhemiplegia patients affected by a stroke and enhance thequality of life [ 17,18]. Another unique therapy concept is calledJin-3-needling technique, introduced by Professor Jin Rui of the Guangzhou University of TCM. On the basis ofthe experiences of modern medicine, Jin Rui has drawn thedevelopment of traditional acupuncture prescriptions into arationalandscientificdirection[ 19].Inhisconcept,groupsof three different acupuncture points are combined for certainphysicalconditions.Thisconceptiswidelyappliedinvariousk i n d so fm o t o rd y s f u n c t i o n ss u c ha sh e m i p l e g i ad u et oastroke[9].

Each point was performed on the affected limbs withtheevenreinforcing-reducingmethod[ 27]. Theneedle was maintained for 30 minutes. All acupuncture treatmentswere administered by the same physician acupuncturist inthisgroup. 2.2.2.IndividualizedAcupunctureTreatment. PatientsinIA+ SR group were treated according to two specific treatmentstrategiescalled\" connectingandregulatingRenDu \"[28]and \"Jin-3-needling \"t e c h n i q u e[ 9]a sw e l la sa d d i t i o n a lp o i n t s selectedonthebasisofsyndromedifferentiation[ 29].

(2) These were combined with points following the con- ceptof\"Jin-3-needling \"[19]. Points of Jin-3-needling received ipsilateral acupunc- ture according to the affected limbs as described inTable1.Iftherewasspasticity,acupuncturereduction manipulationwasusedattheselectedpoints.Iftherewas no relevant increased muscle tone acupuncturereinforcement manipulation was used at the selectedpoints. (3) Additionally, points chosen on the basis of Chinese syndrome differentiation were added [ 29]. These syndromes and the additional points are describedin Table2. Points selected for deficiency syndromes (Yin-deficiency, Qi-deficiency) were stimulated with the acupuncture reinforcement manipulation andexcesssyndromes(\" Xue-stasis\",\"phlegm\",\"Liveryang hyperactivity\",and\"endogenousliverwind\")andwiththeacupuncturereductionmanipulation. The needles were manipulated by way of the respective methodafterinsertion,after15minutesandbeforeextraction after 30 minutes.

The Fugl-Meyer (FM) Motor and Sensory Assessments are used to measure theperformance of voluntary limb movement (50 items) andtheleveloflimbsensation(12items),respectively.Eachitemis assessed and scored on a 3-point ordinal scale of 0-2(0 for no performance/absent sensation, 1 point for partialperformance/impaired sensation and 2 points for completeperformance/normalsensation). The FM motor assessment (50 items, total FM motor score of 100), in turn, consists of the upper extremity (UE)subscale(33items,scorerangeof0-66)andthelowerextrem-ity(LE)subscale(17items,scorerangeof0-34).

Placebo controlled studies in the rehabilitation of hemi- paresis patients are almost impossible because all knowntherapies require an activation of the paralyzed limb. Thisincludes acupuncture where, depending on the syndrome,reducing or reinforcing manipulation is necessary, while a neutral needling might not be stimulus enough [ 39].

Randomization of patients, blinding the patients tothe concept of acupuncture and blinding the independentobserverstothetherapeuticprocedureasdoneinthisstudy,seemsadequateforstudiesonhemiparesiswithacupuncture. A general problem with acupuncture studies is the standardization of the procedures, while in traditional Chi-nesemedicineanindividualizedapproachwithpersonalizedacupuncture treatment is expected.

The effect on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axiswas validated by demonstrating a decreased phosphorylation of Akt and a direct inhibition of the IGF1R kinase activity after shikonin treatment. Our results indicate that inhibiting the IGF1R-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade is a new cellular mechanism of shikoninstrengtheningitspotentialforthetreatmentofhematologicalmalignancies. 1. Introduction Hematological malignancies comprise different types of cancers that affect blood cells, bone marrow, or lymphnodes.AccordingtotheNationalCancerInstitute,leukemia,lymphoma, and myeloma accounted for 9% of all deaths from cancer in the United States in 2011. In recent years improvementsinradiotherapyandnewtherapeuticsinclud-ing imatinib [ 1], rituximab [ 2], and lenalidomide l e a r l y improvedtheresponseandsurvivalrateofthesediseases[ 4]. Despite this considerable advances in chemotherapy, drugresistance and relapse remain major problems and severalhematological malignancies remain incurable with standard treatments [ 4,5]. This lack of cures requires novel targeted andlesstoxictherapies,andnewcandidatecompoundsneedtobetestedfortheimprovementoftherapysuccess. The naphthoquinone pigment shikonin is the most important pharmacologically active substance in the driedroot ofLithospermum erythrorhizon . erythrorhi- zonhavebeenusedtotreatmaculareruption,measles,sore- throat, carbuncles, and burns [ 6]. We recently showed that the natural compound shikonin has a strong cytotoxic effectagainst different cancer cell lines, especially sensitive and2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine resistant leukemia cells. Shikonin directly targets mitochon- dria of cancer cells causing an overproduction of reactiveoxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and ulti-mately apoptosis [ 7]. However, thequestion particularly leukemia and lymphoma cellsremainsunresolved. Inthepresentstudy,weinvestigatedtheeffectofshikonin on the myeloid leukemia cell line U937 by the integrationof different quantitative \"-omics\" technologies, combininghigh-throughput techniques as a promising tool for eluci-d a t i n gm o l e c u l a rm e c h a n i s m so fn e wd r u g si naf a s ta n dprecisemanner[ 8].Theintegrationofgenomicandpharma- cologicalanalysissignificantlyacceleratestheidentificationofcancer-specific synthetic lethal targets [ 9]. We analyzed the mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression in U937 cells aftershikonin treatment and integrated the results using a bioin-formaticapproach.Thereby,itwaspossibletoidentifycellularfunctions and signaling pathways strongly deregulated aftershikonin treatment. The data obtained from the proteomicandtranscriptomicstudiesconfirmedpreviousfindingsindi-cating that shikonin has strong effects on cell proliferation,cellcycleprogression,cellularmovement,andDNAintegrityof cancer cells [ 7]. Interestingly, our findings indicated that oneofthemostaffectedsignalingpathwaysinU937leukemiacellswasthephosphatidylinositol3-kinase(PI3K)-Akt-mam-malian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade. Hence, weproposed that an inhibition of this signaling network is areason for the strong activity of shikonin against leukemiacells. We validated the effect of shikonin on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway by demonstrating a decreased phosphory- lation and activation of Akt after shikonin treatment using phospho-specificantibodiesandflowcytometricanalysis.Inaddition, kinase activity tests revealed that shikonin inhibitsthekinaseactivityoftheinsulin-likegrowthfactor1receptor(IGF1R), which is an important trigger of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade. Targeting of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling became an attractivetherapeuticstrategyforcancerchemotherapyoverthelastfewyears[ 10,11].Thesignalingpathwayplaysacentral role in cellular growth and survival through the regulationof protein synthesis and ribosomal protein translation [ 12]. angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis [ wide receptor (EGFR)), integrins, and cytokine receptorscouplingexternalsignalsfromgrowthfactors,cytokinesandthe availability of nutrients to cell growth and proliferation[15]. After binding of the corresponding ligands, the RTKs activate PI3K, which in turn causes the phosphorylation ofAkt. Activated Akt inhibits the heterodimeric complex oftuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) that negatively regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)[ 16].Thiscomplexisacenterpieceofthesignaling cascade that controls protein synthesis by phosphorylationof different effector proteins, for example, the S6 kinase (a) viability (% of control) Shikonin ( M)IC50=0.3 M (b) Figure 1: Cytotoxic effect of shikonin against U937 leukemia cells.

This complex responds to growth factors and regulates cellsurvival and metabolism, as well as the cytoskeleton [ 17]. Currently used drugs targeting this pathway are rapamycinanditsderivatives(rapalogs)thatdirectlytargetthemTORC1complex[ 18,19].Oneweakpointofthesedrugsisaresistance mechanism of cancer cells, which leads to an upregulationof IGF1R after mTORC1 inhibition [ 20-22]. This feedback mechanism causes an activation of the PIK3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade after initial inhibition resulting in only modestanticancereffectsofrapalogs[ 14]. Ultimately, our results suggest that inhibition of IGF1R- Akt-mTOR signaling plays a key role in the cytotoxic effect of shikonin against U937 leukemia cells. Since this signalingnetwork is frequently deregulated in hematological malig-nancies, shikonin is a promising candidate for the nextgenerationofchemotherapyagainstthesediseases. 2. Results 2.1.

In the present study, we used this experimental approach to show that the natural naphthoquinoneshikoninstronglyderegulatestheIGF1R-Akt-mTORsignalingcascadein U937 myeloid leukemia cells. Three different \"-omics\"assay indicated that the signaling pathway is disturbed attranscriptomic and proteomic level. Functional validationstudies showed that shikonin indeed inhibits two centrals i g n a l i n gn o d e so ft h ep a t h w a y:t h ek i n a s ea c t i v i t yo fI G F 1 R(a central receptor of the signaling cascade) was inhibited,andinadditionthephosphorylationofAktwassignificantlydecreaseduponshikoninapplication. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR cascade is the predominant signal transductionpathwayafterIGF1Ractivation[ 15].Ourresults are consistent with previous findings indicating that an inhibition of IGF1R causes a decreased phosphorylation and activation of Akt [ 26]. The reduced Akt phosphorylation in turn causes a decreased activation of the mTOR com-plexes (mTORC1/2) [ 12]. mTORC1 regulates phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, andmTORC2 controls cellular growth and survival through the phosphorylationofmanyAGCkinasesincludingAkt,SGK1,and PKC-[17]. It was shown that inhibition of critical signaling nodes of this pathway induces cell cycle arrest andapoptosis in leukemia cells [ 27]. These findings corroborate our results indicating that the cytotoxic effect of shikoninagainst leukemia cells is reinforced by a direct inhibition ofIGF1RandaderegulationoftheIGF1R-Akt-mTORsignalingcascade. The signaling network around the mTOR kinase has been shown to be frequently deregulated in a wide range ofhematological malignancies, especially in different types ofleukemia [ 14]. For example, in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the mTORC1-signaling pathway is constitutivelyactivated in almost 100% of all patients [ 28,29]. Blocking this pathway could be an effective new treatment strat-egy for leukemia and other hematological malignancies.At the moment, rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs),forexample,RAD001(everolimus),CCI-779(temsirolimus),and AP23573 (deforolimus), are used to partially inhibit thesignaling pathway by directly binding the mTORC1 com-plex [18,19]. However, results of clinical trials were mostly disappointing and showed only modest anticancer Control Shikonin 0.3 M (b) Figure4:EffectofshikoninonthePI3K-mTORsignalingcascade. (a) U937 cells were treated with 0.3 M shikonin for 24h and subsequently stained with phospho-specific antibodies against p- Akt and p-ribosomal protein S6. Shikonin treatment significantly decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt (left shift), but no effect on the phosphorylation status of ribosomal protein S6 wasdetected.

A combination of rapalogs with other targeted molecules was more successful, and clinical trialshave shown that rapalogs synergize with different conven-tionalchemotherapeuticstoovercomeresistance[ 14,30,31]. Recent findings showed that a positive feedback loop causes the rapamycin-resistance phenotype: mTOR inhibition 20-22]. Thus,combininganmTORinhibitorandanIGF-1Rinhibitormay be an appropriate strategy to Since proliferation inhibitingEGFRsignaling[ 24].EGFRisafurtherRTKthattriggerstheTable 2: Calculation of binding energies of shikonin inhibits the growth of cancercells[32].AnadditionalinhibitionofEGFRsignalingmakes shikonin even more valuable for targeting the PI3K/mTORcascade since a second important starting point of thepathwayiseliminated. Besides the deregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR sig- naling cascade, we recently showed that cancer cells and therebytriggersapoptosis [ 7].

Onthe one hand, it inhibits the PI3K-mTOR signaling cascade,whichisfrequentlyderegulatedinleukemia,andinadditionit is directly targeting mitochondria of cancer cells, whichmakes it to a promising candidate for a combined treatmentwithestablishedantileukemicdrugs. Ultimately, the direct targeting of mitochondria and the simultaneous deregulation of the IGF1R-Akt-mTOR signal-ing cascade make shikonin a promising compound for thetreatmentofhematologicalmalignancies. 4.

Toexamine quantitativechangesintheproteomeofU937leukemiacellsafter shikonin treatment, the \u00d710 6U937 cells were seededin10mLRPMI1640mediumina25cm2cultureflask. Subsequently,cellsweretreatedwith0.3 Mshikonin(IC50) for incubation cellswerewashedwithPBSandproteinextractionwasperformedusing the M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent(ThermoScientific,Germany)containingaproteaseinhibitorcocktail Germany), cells were incubated with theextraction reagent for 40min at 4 C. After incubation, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14000 \u00d7g for 15min. Supernatants were transferred into new tubesand an acetone precipitation of the proteins was performed.Afterprecipitation,theacetonewasremovedandtheproteinpellet in each of the tube was further diluted to 1 g/L w i t h5 0 m MT E A B Ca n dr e d u c e dw i t h5 m MT C E Pf o r 1hat37 C, followed by alkylation using 2mM MMTS for 45min at room temperature. For the proteolytic digestion,themodifiedtube-geldigestionprotocolwasappliedandthedetergent residue was checked using the method describedpreviously [ 36]. Two 200g proteolytic protein mixtures from DMSO cells were first dissolvedin 200L of 100mM TEABC (pH 8.5) and, respectively, mixed with 20L of formaldehyde and formaldehyde-13C, d2 (4%, diluted with H 2O). After vortexing (5min) and centrifugation, each of the sample solutions was mixed with20L of 600mM sodium cyanoborohydride solution. The centrifuged againandthenallowedtoreactfor30minat25 C.Toquench thereaction,ammoniumhydroxide(7%inwater,10 L)was added to each sample solution. Finally, 16 Lo ff o r m i ca c i d was added to acidify each of the sample solutions and two samples were further combined for strong cation exchange (SCX)fractionation. ForSCXfractionation,thebufferSCX-A(5mMKH2PO4 in 25% 350mM KCl in 25% ACN at pH 3) were themobile phase. The peptide mixtures were reconstituted inbuffer SCX-A and then loaded into a PolySULFOETHYLAc o l u m n( 2 0 0\u00d72.1mm, 5m, 300A, PolyLC, Columbia, MD)for10minattheflowrateof0.2mL/min.Peptideswerefractionatedusinga75mingradientfrom0to100%ofbufferSCX-B. Fractions were collected every three minutes fromthe retention time of 10 to 55min using a fraction collector(BioFrac Fraction Collector, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules,CA).ThepeptidemixturesineachofthefractionwerefurtheranalyzedbytheLC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed a nanoUH- PLC system (nanoACQUITY UPLC, Waters, Millford, MA)coupled online to mass HDMS water with 0.1% FA and ACN with 0.1%F Aw e r eu s e da st h em o b i l ep h a s e .Th es a m p l ew a si n j e c t e dinto a trap column (Symmetry C18, 5 m, 180m\u00d720mm, Waters, Milford, MA) and separated online with a reverseEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 phase column (BEH C18, 1.7m, 75m\u00d7250mm, Waters, Milford, at the 300nL/min using eithera 95min gradient with 5-90% ACN/water ratio. The massspectrometry instruments were all operated in the positiveion mode, and data-dependent acquisition methods wereappliedforallexperiments.Theacquisitionsettingswereset to one full MS scan (350-1600m/z) with a scan time of 1 sec o n da n ds w i t c h edt os i xp r od u cti o nsc a n s( 50 - 1 900m / z )with 0.4 second scan time when a precursor ion charge was2+, 3+, or 4+, and the intensity was higher than 200 counts.The data files generated from LC-MS/MS were processed byUniQua and further analyzed by the MASCOT and TransProteomicsPipeline(TPP)1version4.4rev.1,andthedetailsandcriteriaofdataprocessingweredescribedpreviously[ 37]. 4.8.IngenuityPathwayAnalysis. \"-omics\"datasetswereana- lyzed through the use (IPA,Ingenuity Systems, CA, USA; http://www.ingenuity.com/ ). This software integrates the experimental results to knownbiological relationships, mechanisms, and functions usingthe regularly updated Ingenuity Knowledge Base, a giantdatabase of biological findings and relations gathered fromthe literature. Only molecules from the \"-omics\" datasetsthat met the expression fold change cutoff of \u00b11.2 were used for analysis with IPA. Briefly, filtered molecules werefedintoIngenuityPathwayAnalysissoftware,andaseparatecore analysis was performed for each of the three \"-omics\"assaystoassignthederegulatedmRNA,miRNA,andproteinsto cellular networks, functions, and pathways. Furthermore, the Ingenuity microRNA Target filter tool was used to associate deregulated miRNAs from the miRNA microarraywith experimentally observed and predicted mRNA targets.The results of the core analysis were further studied in acomparisonanalysis toidentifycellularfunctionsaffected inall three assays. Finally, the results of the \"-omics\" assaysweremergedinonedatasetthatwasscreenedforoverlappingcellular signaling pathways using the core analysis tool.For molecules that showed a nonconsistent deregulationof mRNA and protein expression (36 cases), the FlowCellect PI3K-mTOR Signaling Cascade Assay.

The phosphorylation of Akt isindicative of the upstream PI3K signaling, marking the cellsinitiationintoproliferationorcellsurvival.Phosphorylated- ribosomal S6 protein is indicative of downstream mTOR and p70S6K signaling leading to protein translation. Theassay was performed according to the manufacture's proto- col. Briefly, 1.5\u00d710 6U937 cells were treated with 0.3 M shikonin or DMSO solvent control and incubated for 24h.Subsequently,cellswerefixedonicefor20minusingthesup-plied fixation buffer.

Virtual Screening. Virtual screening represents an approach to identify possible binding interactions betweenligands and proteins without any previous knowledge ofinteractions or binding sites. Since shikonin deregulates the PI3K-mTOR signaling cascade, a virtual screening approach was used to identify proteins of the mTORp a t h w a yw h i c ha r em o s tl i k e l yt a r g e t e db ys h i n o n i n .Virtual screening was performed using AutoDock Vinawith the graphical user interface AutoDock Tools [ 23]. X-ray structures of proteins involved in signaling cas-cade were downloaded from the \"Protein Data Bank\"(http://www.pdb.org/ ). The three-dimensional structure before use, shikonin was further diluted 1:10 withwater. Shikonin was tested at 10 final assay concentrations the range from 1.85\u00d710 5Mt o5 . 5 5\u00d71010M.

Background 1.1. Historical Background of Cancer Treatment in Japan. Surgery,radiotherapy,andchemotherapyarethemainmed-ical treatments for cancer. Chief among those is surgery. In recent years, advances have been made in a range of treatments that target specific characteristics and stages ofcancer. By its nature, cancer develops after gene mutationsin the body's cells, and the difficulty in treating cancer liesin the fact that cells metastasize. Surgery and radiation arelocal therapies, which leave the problem of how to treat theinvisible remaining cancer cells. What is then required isnot a localized treatment but a systemic treatment such aschemotherapy. B u tu n tilp r o gr e s sw a sm a d ei nth ed ev e l o p m e n to fa n ti - cancerdrugs,therewasnoeffectivetreatmentagainstcancero n c ei th a ds p r e a dt h r o u g h o u tt h eb o d y .Ac o m b i n a t i o no fsurgerywithchemotherapyisgenerallyused.Andsometimes radiotherapyisalsoused.Nowadays,thestandardtreatmentis\"multidisciplinarytreatment[ 1-5],\"acomprehensiveform oftreatmentthatefficientlycombinesavarietyoftreatments. 1.2. Anticancer Drugs. Chemotherapy now occupies an important position in the treatment of cancer. Anticancerdrugshavegreatlychangedcancertreatment.Excellentther-apeutic effects have recently been achieved by combiningradiation with anticancer drugs, even for solid cancers. TheAchilles heel of anticancer drugs has been the strengthof the adverse reactions [ 6-18] ;h o w e v e r ,t h e s eh a v eb e e n alleviated with the development of administration methodsa n ds u p p o r t i v ec a r et oc o n t r o ln a u s e a ,v o m i t i n g ,a n ds oforth;therefore,patientsdonotsufferasmuchasbefore.Yet,the history of chemotherapy is still short. Surgery has beenavailable for about 100 years and radiotherapy for about 50,2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine b u ta n t i c a n c e rd ru g sh a v eo n l ybe e nu se dt ot r e a tc a n c e rf o r thelast35years. Anticancer drugs have completely different effects dep- ending on the type of cancer. While chemotherapy may beeffectiveforsomecancers,itisvirtuallyineffectiveforothers.Theeffectsofanticancerdrugsalsodifferaccordingtotheway they are used. Potent effects are demonstrated when using drugs in combination, even if each anticancer drug does notpromisesufficienteffectwhenusedalone.Nowadays,twotofour types of anticancer drugs are used in combination toenhance their effectiveness, even at a modest amount. Suchmultidrug therapy is now being widely used and offers thehopeofsynergisticoradditiveeffects. 1.3. Historical Background of Kampo Medicine. Traditional, complementary, and alternative therapies [ 19-25]a r ew i d e l y used and researched in the USA. Underlying this is thehigh cost of health care in that country and the commonuse of cheap folk remedies as well as traditional therapiesand supplements against illness. The same situation existsin Europe and is becoming more widespread in Asia, wheregovernments are promoting integrative medicine. There is a universal health insurance system which enables everybody inJapantoreceiveadvancedhealthcareatlowcost.Therefore,alternativemedicinedidnotattractattention.Japan'suniver-sal health insurance system [ 26,27]i sh e l di nh i g hr e g a r d across the country, and it means patients receive standardcare for cancer at any medical service provider under thisinsurance system. However, if you prefer complementary oralternative therapies, you must pay a private provider out ofyourownpocket. Yet, another characteristic of medical care in Japan is that patients can access Western and Kampo medical caresat the same time. Kampo medicine [ 28-30] is a unique medical system that originated from ancient China, wasgradually imported to Japan since approximately 1500 yearsa g o ,a n dh a sb e e ni m p r o v e da n dr e fi n e db ym a n ye x c e l l e n tphysicians especially since the 17th century (Edo periodsin Japanese era). Now, most Kampo preparations (Japanesetraditional herbal medicines) are available as extract formu-lationsofhighquality,whicharegreatlydifferentfromherbalmedicines used in China, Taiwan, and Korea, where mostpreparationsareherbaldecoctions. Four ethical Kampo extract formulations were approved in 1967 in Japan. Since then, the number of ethical Kampoextract formulations covered by health insurance has grown to 148. Much Japanese herbal extract preparation is used in Japan. Kampo extract preparation is mostly used inJapan. These Kampo extracts are the combination of herbalmedicines from the viewpoint of Kampo theory. Standardexaminations are done, and quality control of index ingre-dient is displayed. Kampo formulation for prescription isused for cancer medical treatment. Japan's universal healthinsurance system does allow simultaneous access to tradi-tionalKampopreparationsandWesternmedicines.However,doctorsinJapancannotbelicensedwithoutpassingaboardexamination of Western medicine, which means patients inthis country receive health care with a high degree of safety.ThisisanotherfactorthatdistinguishesthehealthcaresysteminJapanfromothercountries.InJapan,physicianswhohave studied Western medicine and Kampo medicine practicethese approaches in their medical treatment of cancer withthe aim of fusing Eastern and Western medicines into aunitary medical system, unlike the dual medical systems inChinaorKorea. 1 . 4 .S u p p o r t i v eC a r ef o rC a n c e rP a t i e n t sU s i n gK a m p oP r e p a - rations.Some people involved in the treatment of cancer reject Kampo therapy. The biggest reason they give is the scarcity of evidence. Kampo medicine is fundamentally a tailor-made type of treatment, and Kampo prescription ischanged according to the patients' conditionand symptoms.Therefore,thebenefitsofKampopreparationscannotbefullyevaluated using the criteria of the randomized clinical trialsas in Western medicine. Objective data and proof of actionm ec h a ni sm sa r er eq uir ed .M os to fth es t udieso nth eactio n sof Kampo preparations have been animal trials and small-scale clinical trials. Little research has been done that offershighly reliable evidence, although progress has been madein this area recently [ 31-37]. The use of Kampo prepara- tions for palliative and supportive care of cancer patientsin combination with anticancer drugs or radiotherapy mayoffer alleviation of adverse effects and survival benefits, andthe number of such research papers being published ininternationaljournalsisincreasing. 2.

Myeloid cells, immune cells, gastrointestinalmucosal cells, and hair cells are particularly susceptibletodamageandarepronetoadverseeffectssuchasbonemar-row suppression, immunodeficiency, digestive symptoms,and alopecia.

Platinum-based drugs directly damage nerve cells and are thought to lead to nervecellaxondisorder. 2.2. Medical Treatment of Peripheral Neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy symptoms include limb extremity numbness, as wellassensorymotorataxia,deeptendonreflexdecline,anddecreased muscle strength.

In some cases the neuropathy may be almostirreversible. If symptoms are severe, the anticancer drugtreatment must be discontinued or the prescription shouldbe changed.

Indications and Evidence for Kampo Therapy for Chemo- therapy-InducedPeripheralNeuropathy. TheuseoftheKam- po preparation goshajinkigan [ 57-67]a sd r u gt h e r a p yf o r peripheralneuropathysymptomshasbeenwidelyreportedinJapan. Goshajinkigan extract preparation has been reportedt or e l i e v es y m p t o m ss u c ha sn u m b n e s so rp a i ni n8 0 %o fcases in which it is used for peripheral neuropathy causedby paclitaxel for breast cancer [ 68]. Goshajinkigan also uterine cancers. Neuropathy is a characteristic adverseeffect of oxaliplatin, the core drug for colorectal cancer.

Treatment can be continued if symptoms are mild, but the dosage is decreased or the administrationis discontinued in some severe cases. On the other hand,research has found that goshajinkigan can alleviate suchsymptoms. Nishioka et al. [ 69] and Kono et al. [ 70]c o n - ducted a retrospective comparison and examination of theeffectsofgoshajinkiganforperipheralneuropathyassociatedw i t ho x a l i p l a t i ni na d v a n c e do rr e c u r r e n tc o l o r e c t a lc a n c e rpatients.Theyfoundthatthegroupwhichwasadministeredgoshajinkigan from the start of chemotherapy tolerated thelargest dosage until onset of peripheral neuropathy. Gosha-jinkigan's efficacy differs according to the causal anticancerdrug. It promises some effectiveness for forth, but it is virtually ineffective for oxaliplatin. Since it might be effective for preventionof oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, it would be better toadminister goshajinkigan from the start of chemotherapy. IthasbeenreportedthatadministrationofKampopreparationspromises an increase in the frequency of administrationduring the FOLFOX regimen, which HPLCfingerprintappearin Table 1andFigure1.

It isused for patients with remarkable edema tendency, severearthralgia, and persistent low back pain. It is frequentlyused for symptoms in which peripheral vascular disease issuspected of being involved, such as sciatica and diabeticneuropathy, and has demonstrated effectiveness for theseconditions.

Kampo for Chemotherapy-Induced Diarrhea 3.1. Development of a Camptothecin Derivative\u2014Irinotecan. Irinotecan is an anticancer drug classified as a plant alka-loid. It inhibits cancer cell proliferation by breaking DNAduring cell division through its inhibition of the enzymetopoisomerase,whichisrequiredwhenDNAreplicates.Wallet al. extracted and isolated camptothecin (CPT) in 1966fromCamptotheca acuminate ,ap l a n tn a t i v et oC h i n a ,a n d foundthatithasapowerfulantineoplasticeffect[ 74].Subse- quent development was undertaken by the National CancerInstitute (NCI) in the USA but was abandoned followingthe emergence of adverse effects. Pharmaceutical manufac- turers in Japan vigorously pursued synthetic research intoderivatives to preserve CPT's activity while reducing itstoxicity, resulting in the CPT derivative irinotecan, whichhas been subsequently used as a potent anticancer drug.Irinotecan has demonstrated usefulness for various types ofcancer,includingcolonandlungcancers,anditsapplications have been widening. Irinotecan suppresses the action of topoisomerase 1, which is involved in DNA replication,thereby demonstrating a strong antitumor effect; however,it can cause severe adverse effects including leukopenia anddiarrhea[ 16,17,75-94]. 3.2. Adverse Effects of Irinotecan and Their Frequency. The chief adverse effects are severe myelosuppression andintractable diarrhea. There have been reports of death fol-lowingsevereinfectionduetomyelosuppression,intractablediarrhea, and intestinal perforation due to intestinal paraly-sis or bowel obstruction.

However, individual vari-ability in the UGT activity is thought to be a reason for individualvariationintheadverseeffectsofirinotecan.Many reports[95-99]inrecentyearsmentiontherelationbetween UGT1A1 genetic polymorphism and onset of adverse UGT1A1 is a molecular species of UGT inthe and is the enzyme that metabolizes irinotecan.UGT1A1 28 and6 are variants of UGT1A1, and reports cite an increase in the incidence of severe adverse effects ofirinotecanduetoreducedUGT1A1activity. The most troublesome adverse effect of CPT-11 is severe delayed diarrhea, which is caused by reactivation in thedigestive tract by enteric bacterial into SN-38, which has a powerful anticancer actionand is then transported throughout the body. The SN-38formed in the liver is glucuronidated by a glucuronidationenzyme also present in the liver. At this point, the SN-38 isdeactivated, losing its injurious effect. However, after beingexcretedintothedigestivetractviathebiliarytract,theSN-38isdecomposedbyentericbacterial -glucuronidase, thereby r e f o r m i n gS N - 3 8 .I ti ss u r m i s e dt h a tt h i sS N - 3 8f o r m e di nthedigestivetractthendamagesintestinalmucosalepithelialcells,givingrisetodelayeddiarrhea. 3.3. Irinotecan Hydrochloride-Induced and Kampo. The flavonoid may control irinotecanhydrochloride-induced diarrhea because actively inhibits-glucuronidase of intestinal flora and suppresses reforma- tion of the active form (SN-38) in the tract. Largeamounts of baicalin are contained in Scutellaria root, a constituent crude drug of Kampo preparations. Researchershave tested hangeshashinto for diarrhea as it is a Kampopreparation containing Scutellaria root. It has been reported inhumanclinicaltrialsandanimalexperimentsthatadmin-istrationofhangeshashinto[ 37,100-104]extractformulation two to three days before irinotecan hydrochloride adminis-tration effectively prevents or reduces diarrhea. It has beenascertainedthatthisdoesnotaffecttheantitumoraction. If the preventative effect against irinotecan hydrochlo- ride-induceddiarrheaiscontainedsolelyintheactionmech-anism of root, rather than a Kampo formulation, may also be effective. Nevertheless, the comprehensive actions ofthe other crude drugs contained in hangeshashinto improveeffectiveness. Specifically, it has been reported that hange-shashinto suppresses elevation of enteric prostaglandin E2,promotesrepairofdamagedintestinalmucosa,andimprovesintestinal water absorption [ 37,100]. A particular character- istic of Kampo preparations is that they give greater efficacythrough the synergistic effect of multiple crude drugs com-pared to one constituent alone.

Luciferase reporter assays indicated DMC to activate PPAR, and pharmacological inhibition of PPAR protected cells from DMC's antiproliferative effect. Western blot analysis indicated that DMC suppressed the expression of many reticulum stress, as manifested by the inductionofGADD153andGRP78expression.Moreover,DMCinhibitedmTOR-p70S6KsignalingthroughAktdownregulation and AMPK activation. The ability of DMC to activate AMPK in liver kinase (LK) B1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells suggests that this activation was independent of LKB1-regulated cellular metabolic status. However, DMC induced a cytoprotective autophagypresumably through mTOR inhibition, which could autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. ( Momordica charantia L.) is widely used as a functional food to prevent and treat diabetes andassociatedcomplications[ 1].Inadditiontothehypoglycemic effect,theantitumoractivityofcrudebittergourdextracthasalso been reported in various types of cancer cells in vitro andin vivo[2-5]. Reported chemical constituents of bitter gourd include, but are not limited to, glycosides, saponins,alkaloids, fixed oils, triterpenes, polypeptides, and steroids(for review, see [ 6]). Wild bitter gourd, a wild species of M. charantia L., (M. charantia Linn. var. abbreviate ), is native to several tropical areas of Asia, including southernTaiwan, where it is consumed not only as a vegetable butalsoasaherbalmedicine.Recentstudieshavedemonstratedthat wild bitter gourd extracts exhibited multiple pharma-cological activities associated with anti-inflammation and antidiabetics, including those of suppressing inflammatory response in macrophages [ 7], overcoming insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in 8], (PPAR),P P A R, and their target genes in mice [10]. Together, these activities might account for the abilityofwildbittergourdtoimprovemetabolicsyndromeinhumans[ 11]. PPARregulates the expression of genes involved in the control of lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity viathe ligand-activated transcriptional activity [ such 15]. Many of these PPARagonists exhibit antiproliferative activities against many types of cancer cells including those of colon,prostate, and breast, suggesting the potential use of theseagentsincancertherapyorprevention[ 16].Evidencesuggests that PPARactivation leads to the transcriptional suppres- sion of a series of signalingeffectors associated death Therefore, PPARis recognized as a therapeutically relevanttargetforcancertherapy[ 22,23]. Although the health benefits of wild bitter gourd have beenassociatedwithPPARactivation[ 10],bioactiveconstit- uentsthatcontributetothispharmacologicaleffect,however,remain undefined. In this study, we investigated the mech-anism underlying the antitumor effect of bitter gourd with antileukemic activity [ 24]. We obtained first evidence that DMC induced apoptotic death in breastcancer cells, at least in part, through a PPAR -dependent mechanism. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.PlantMaterials.

Results and Discussion 3.1.AntiproliferativeEffectofDMCinBreastCancerCells. The dose- and time-dependent effects of DMC on cell viabilitywere assessed in 2 human breast cancer cell lines, ER - positive MCF-7, and ER-negative MDA-MB-231, by MTT assays (Figures 1(b)and1(c)). Relatively, MCF-7 cells more sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of DMC thanMDA-MB-231 cells, with IC 50values 1(b)and1(c)). 3.2. DMC Induces Apoptosis through Caspase Activation. We obtained several lines of evidence that DMC sup- pressed the proliferation of MCF-7 First, annexin V-propidium reveals as annexin V+ cells) after DMC treatment(Figure2(a) ). Western showed that cleavage and caspase-9 activation in adose-dependentmannerinMCF-7cells( Figure2(b) of activated caspase-3 in response DMC(Figure2(c) ), confirming the involvement of caspase activa- tioninDMC-mediatedapoptosis.TreatmentwithDMCat10,15,and20Mfor72hincreasedthelevelofactivatedcaspase- 3, from 13% in 5 are potential active constituents of wild bitter gourd and that wild bitter gourd crude extracts activated PPAR sig- naling in mice [ 10]. We hypothesized that the antitumor activity of DMC was associated with its ability to facilitatePPARactivation. To corroborate this premise, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with PPRE-TK-Luc and Renilla plasmids exposed to DMC at different concentrationso rt h ep o s i t i v ec o n t r o lt r o g l i t a z o n ea t5 0 Mf o r2 4 h .A s shown, the PPRE-luciferase reporter assay indicates that DMC at 15 and 20Mi n c r e a s e dt h ea c t i v i t yi nP P A R transactivationby2.2-and5.2-fold,respectively( <0.05), while troglitazone at 50Mg a v er i s et oa2 . 8 - f o l di n c r e a s e (Figure3(a) ).Equallyimportant,cotreatmentwithGW9662, aPP ARinhibitor,protectedcellsfromthesuppressiveeffect of DMC on cell viability ( Figure3(b) ).

In addition, the drug effect on the expression of NF-B/p65 was interrogated in light of a recent report that PPARacts as an E-3 ligase targeting p65 degradation [27]. DMC expression of NF- B/p65inadose-dependentmanner( Figure3(d) ).Moreover, the suppressive effect of DMC (ER) expression ( Figure3(d) ) as PGJ2 and TZD PPARagonists have been shown to disrupt ER signaling byfacilitatingERdegradation[ 28]. Previously, it was reported that induce endoplasmic reticulum stress [29]. The ability of DMC to trigger this stress response was borne out by increased expression of two endoplas-mic reticulum stress-associated markers, growth arrest- and mic reticulum chaperone, 31]. 3.4. DMC Induces Autophagy. I nl i g h to far e c e n tr e p o r t that PPARactivation induces autophagy in breast cancer cells [15], we examined the effect of DMC on autophagy in MCF-7 cells. By using transmission electron microscopy, wefound that exposure of MCF-7 cells to DMC at 10 or 15 M for 24h led to autophagosome formation in the cytoplasm(Figure4(a) ). During the of microtubule-associated protein light-chain (LC3-I) is pro-cessed and recruited to the autophagosomes, where is generated via site-specific lipidation. Thus, cells with GFP-tagged LC3(GFP-LC3) and exposed to DMSO, 15 MD M C ,o r1 0 0n M rapamycin as a positive control. As observed by confocal fluorescence imaging, DMC induced the accumulation of LC3-positive puncta in the cytoplasm in a manner similar to that of rapamycin ( Figure4(b) ). Second, Western blot analysisindicatesthatDMCtreatmentledtodose-andtime-dependent increases in the abundance of endogenous LC3-II expression (Figures 4(c)and4(d)). Moreover, our data showthatthisDMC-inducedautophagywasassociatedwith elevatedexpressionlevelsofautophagy-relatedprotein(Atg)7 and Beclin 1 (a and AMPK Activation. Interruption of mTOR signaling is known stimulateautophagy[ 34].Toinvestigatethemechanisticlink between mTOR and DMC-induced autophagy, we assessedthe activation status of the Akt/mTOR signaling axis by examining the phosphorylation status of Akt at Thr308, Ser473, and mTOR, and the mTOR target p70S6K phorylationlevelsofallofthesekinasesinadose-dependent manner ( Figure5(a) , left panel). It was also reported that thiazolidinedionePPARagonistsinduceautophagythrough the activation of HIF1[15], which led us to examine the expression of HIF1. The result showed that DMC dose- dependently upregulated of 120kDa band; Figure5(a) ,l e ftp a n e l ) .T op r o v i d ea mechanistic link among DMC-induced mTOR inhibition, PPARactivation, and autophagy, we examined the effect of the PPARinhibitor GW9662 on these drug effects. Western blotting indicates that treatment of DMC or trogli- tazone,eachat15M,decreasedphosphorylationofp70S6K, indicative of mTOR inhibition, accompanied by increasedaccumulation of LC3-II as compared to the vehicle control (Figure5(a) , right panel). Although GW9662 alone had no appreciable effect on either cellular response, it was ablet or e d u c et h ea c t i v i t i e so fD M Ca n dt r o g l i t a z o n et oi n d u c e p70S6K dephosphorylation and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II(Figure5(a) ,rightpanel). In addition, it is well recognized that AMPK activation promotes autophagy via mTOR inhibition [ 35]. Western blot analysis indicated that DMC facilitated concentration- dependent increasesinthephosphorylationlevelsofAMPK and its downstream of DMC to activate AMPK in MDA-MB-231 cells is noteworthy as this cell line is deficient in liver kinase B1(LKB1) [36], an upstream kinase of AMPK.

Discussion Wild bitter gourd has been reported to exert anti-inflamm- atory [7], 40], and stituents contributing to these pharmacological effects havenot been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrated that DMC, a cucurbitane-type triterpene isolated from wildbitter gourd, acts as a PPARagonist. Although the activity of other cucurbitane-type triterpenes in modulating PPAR activity remains to be investigated, the ability of DMC to activate PPARmight underlie the hypoglycemic effect of wildbittergourdcrudeextractsindiabeticmice[ 41].10 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Several lines of evidence indicate that PPAR plays a pivotal role in mediating DMC's antiproliferative activityin breast cancer the pharmacological inhibitor GW9662 protected cells from theinhibitory of the viability of MCF-7 cells(Figure3(b) ). Second, DMC suppressed the expression of as e r i e so fP P A R-targeted signaling effectors that govern cell cycle the downregulation of ER expression is noteworthy since ER has been shown to bind to PPRE and negatively interfere with PPAR signaling in breast cancer cells [ 42]. Thus, this ER-ablating effect might account for the higher sensitivity of MCF-7 cells relativeto that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals [ 43], is positively and negatively regulated by Akt and AMPK, respectively. This DMC-facilitatedmTORdownregulationislikelyattributable totheconcertedactionofDMCtofacilitateAktdephospho-rylationandAMPKactivation( Figure5).TheabilityofDMC to activate AMPK is noteworthy as a key energysensorandregulatescellularmetabolismtomaintainenergyhomeostasis [ 44]. Previously, TZD PPARagonists were reported to induce PPAR-independent AMPK activation through changes in cellular energy state [ 45,46]. However, the finding that DMC was equally effective in activatingAMPK in LKB1-deficient MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cellssuggests that this activation might be independent of thec e l l u l a rm e t a b o l i cs t a t u sa sL K B 1i sa c t i v a t e di nr e s p o n s eto environmental nutrient changes [ 47]. Thus, the mode of AMPK activation by DMC warrants further investigation. The Akt/mTOR pathway is often dysregulated in malig- nant cells, thus representing an important target for cancerprevention and therapy [ 48]. The concurrent suppressive e ff e c to fD M Co nA k ta n dm T O Ra c t i v a t i o ni sn o t e w o r t h y ,because it circumvents the feedback activation that resultsfrom mTOR inhibition, a problem associated with its translational potential as a chemopreventiveagent. Nonetheless, consistent with the reported effect ofmTOR inhibitors and many other anticancer agents, DMCinduced a cytoprotective autophagy that decreased DMC'santiproliferativepotency,which,however,couldbeovercomebytheco-treatmentwiththeautophagyinhibitorchloroquine(Figure6). Further in vivostudies are needed to better understand the role of DMC, alone or in combination withotheragent,inbreastcancerpreventionandtreatment. 5. Conclusion There has been growing interest in the use of wild bittergourd as a dietary supplement for the treatment of variousillnessesinlightofitsdiversepharmacologicaleffects,includ- inghypoglycemic,anti-inflammatory,antibacterial,antiviral,and antitumor activities. However, despite recent advancesin gaining understanding of the health beneficial effects ofthis herbal medicine, information regarding the mode ofaction of its bioactive ingredients is lacking or fragmentary. In this study, the activity of DMC isolated from wild bitter gourd in PPARactivation was characterized for the first time. As the role of PPARin regulating lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, apoptosis, and cell differentiation is wellrecognized,theabilityofDMCtomodulatemultiplePPAR - targeted signaling pathways provides a molecular basis toaccountforthehypoglycemicandantitumoractivitiesofwildbitter gourd. Today, processed bitter gourd in the form ofcapsules or tablets is used by natural health practitioners,which like many other herbal medicine suffers from diffi-culty in quality control due to high variability of bioactivecompoundsinvolved.Fromaclinicalperspective,wildbittergourd extracts enriched in DMC and related compounds, ofwhich the contents could be quantified by chromatographicfingerprint analysis, will provide a better alternative to cap-sulesortabletsfordiseasemanagement.

Introduction Breastcancerremainstobetheleadingcauseofcancerdeath amongwomenworldwidewiththerateofreportedincidenceand mortality increasing annually [ 1,2]. In the past decade, women with tumors between stages I and II increased from41% to 65%, 80% of which are invasive tumors originatingfrom ductal carcinoma and its variants [ 3]. Current early detectionmethodsallowbreastcancertobediagnosedatanearlystagewhensuccessfultreatmentismorelikely.Multipleagencies and organizations around the world support mam-mography as the most reliable way to detect breast cancer atanearlystage,particularlyinwomenaged50yearsandolder[4,5]. About 70% of breast cancers express estrogen hor- mone receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), andthese markers along with human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER-2) and proliferation marker Ki-67 provideinformation about tumor grade and possible response todifferent treatments [ 6]. Although several treatment options are currently available including surgery, radiation therapy,and chemotherapy, specific treatment strategies depend on characteristicssuchastumorgrade,hormonereceptorstatus,metastatic potential, and molecular and patient profile [ 7]. Chemotherapy is still the most commonly used and recom-mended treatment option for breast cancer, either by usinga single compound or combination therapy with multipledrugs [8]. However, chemotherapeutic drugs have narrow therapeutic indices resulting in nonselective toxic effects onnormaltissues,thusincreasingtheriskofinfection.Althoughchemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective against breastcancer,theyareaccompaniedbyvariedsideeffectsincludingvasomotor syndrome (occurring in up to of hot flushes, and psychological stress, which presentmajorhurdlesinincreasingtheeffectivenessofcancertherapy[7-10]. Palliative care is an important aspect of cancer therapy that centers on the relief of pain and other symptomsrelated to cancer and its treatment. It aims to improve the2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine patient'squalityoflife(QOL)andcanbeadministeredalong with curative treatment. Pharmacological interventions thatreduceorpreventadversesideeffectsandincreasechemosen-sitivity may have a substantial impact on cancer treatmentand palliative care. Though the use of complementary andalternativemedicine(CAM)bycancerpatientsisnotpartof conventional cancer palliative care regimens in some coun- tries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO),80% of cancer patients use CAM, in one form or another,for these purposes [ 11]. According to the WHO definition, t h et e r mC A Mi su s e di n t e r c h a n g e a b l yw i t h\" t r a d i t i o n a lmedicine\" and refers to a broad set of health care practices,includingtraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM),acupuncture,herbalpreparations,vitamins,homeopathicremedies,musictherapy, and other psychological, physical, and spiritualtechniques [ 12-14]. The effectiveness of CAM is primarily basedonempiricalevidenceandcasestudieshowever,intherecent years, the increasing amount of supporting data fromcontrolledclinicaltrialsrelatingCAMusetooverallqualityoflifeandsafetyhasdramaticallyincreased[ 15-17].Thesesup- portivemeasuresaresupposedtocontrolsymptoms,improveQOL, boost the immune system, decrease cytotoxicity tonormalcells,andpossiblyprolonglife[ importanttonotethattheintegrationofCAMintopalliativecare and cancer treatment regimens is One multicenter study that reported oncology profes- sionals' attitude towards CAM concluded that in Europeancountries, for example, CAM therapies commonly includemistletoe extracts, vitamin supplementation, and phytoe-strogens, and only an approximately 4% of Scandinavian healthpractitioners,incontrasttothe20%Germandoctors, b e l i e v et h a tC A Mu s eh a sap o s i t i v er o l ei na d j u v a n tt r e a t -ment of cancer patients [ 22]. Traditional oriental medicine systems (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Ayurvedic), spiritu-alism, hypnosis, aromatherapy, and acupuncture representthe widespread use of these CAM practices in the region[23]. In particular, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan operate a two-tiered medical system of integrativemedicine, and CAM is fully integrated into national health,education, and insurance policies [ 16,24,25]. On the other hand, though not integrated in current oncological practice,16% to 63% of North American cancer patients are reportedtocommonlyuseacupuncture,hypnosis,andspiritualism,aswell as vitamin therapies and botanicals. In one populationsurvey, 75% agreed that combining conventional medicaltreatment and CAM was preferable to using either alone[26,27]. The apparent widespread use of CAM worldwide andits(erroneousorotherwise)associationwithminimalorzero risk means that there is a significant need to do furthers t u d i e st og a i na nu n d e r s t a n d i n go ft h ep h a r m a c o d y n a m i cinteractions between chemotherapeutic drugs and herbalcomponents and the effects of either component and dosingregimensincancertreatmentandpalliativecare[ 28,29]. Among cancer patients, CAM is used more frequently by breast cancer patients with an estimated use by 45% of patients across different treatment stages [ 30,31]. In one survey done among long-term breast cancer survivors (onaverage, 8.7 years after-diagnosis), more than 50% believedthat CAM use could prevent cancer recurrence (69%), playan active role in recovery (67%), and help to manage stress (64%) [32]. Evidence gathered from recent randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrates that herbal medicinesand chemopreventive phytochemicals in combination withchemotherapeutic agents are effective in sensitizing cancercells to treatment and minimizing the side effects arising from conventional therapy, thus increasing patient survival rate and QOL [ 18,33-40]. In addition to herbal medicine, acupuncture has also become a popular complementarytreatment in oncology, particularly as patients seek non-pharmacologicalalternativestoprovidesymptomcontrol.Areview of recent RCTs of acupuncture in oncology suggeststhat it has a promising role in controlling a wide varietyof cancer and treatment-related symptoms. The evidencecurrently available suggests that acupuncture is a safe, lowcost, and effective therapy, which further permits cancerpatientstoactivelyparticipateintheirowncareplan[ 41]. Several reviews had been done in the past on the use of either herbal medicine or acupuncture [ 42-47]; however, a comprehensive review of clinical trials utilizing eitherof these CAM methods in palliative care of breast cancerpatients had not been done yet. This review focuses on theuse of herbal medicine treatments, either as single herbsor combinations, and acupuncture in palliative care and asadjuvantsincombinationwithchemo-orradiotherapyinthetreatment of breast cancer based on recently conducted orcompletedRCTs.Thecorrelationbetweenclinicaluse, invitro mechanistic and in vivoanimal studies of herbal medicine, and the effectiveness of acupuncture with the use of certainacupoints in breast cancer patients is summarized and is aimed at facilitating an understanding of current practices involving the use of herbal medicine and acupuncture asadjuvantsinbreastcancertherapy. 2. Methods An electronic search for previously published articleswas conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Database, theUS National Center for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine (NCCAM) ( http://www.nccam.nih.gov/ ), and Health ( http://www.clinicaltrials .gov/) databases to find relevant studies published up until February2013(inclusive).Thesearchincludedthefollowingspecific medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: breastcancer, AND/OR breast neoplasms, AND/OR adjuvant chemo/radiotherapies,AND/ORherbalmedicine,AND/OR acupuncture, AND/OR acupuncture points in addition torelevant text keywords comprising the following words incombination: cancer palliative care, traditional Chinesemedicine, herbal formulation, phytoagent, and acupoints.The article or study types were limited to clinical trials(Phases I to IV), controlled clinical trials, and randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs). The titles and abstracts of allretrievedcitationswerereadandanalyzed.Intotal,90RCTs,either completed or ongoing, were included regardless ofblinding. The most common phytoagents, single herbaltreatments, herbal formulations, and acupoints used in theretrieved RCTs were singled out. Moreover, an exhaustiveEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 search for references regarding in vivoandin vitrostudies pertaining to mechanistic actions, acupuncture practices,individual acupoints, treatment-related symptoms, andassociatedeffectswasconducted. Furthermore,theherbalmedicineandacupunctureprac- ticesincludedinthemostrecentRCTsarehighlightedinthis review because these are generally accepted as constituting the most reliable evidence of treatment effects [ 48,49].

Results and Discussion 3.1. Herbal Medicines as Adjuvant Treatment in Breast Can-cer Chemotherapy. The most common complaint among patients receiving chemotherapy treatment is fatigue, whichis experienced by 80% to 96% of the patient mucositis and myelosuppres- sion, by almost 40% of patients, are the com-mon, dose-limiting, and costly side effects of cancer ther-apy [51]. Moreover, cytotoxic chemotherapy suppresses the system andlimitingthedosesofdrugsthatcanbetoleratedbythepatient[52].Table 1summarizes the conventional/approved drugs usedinbreastcancerchemotherapytogetherwiththeirmajormechanisms of action and most commonly observed sideeffects [50-63]. Several drugs have been used in combina- tion,forexample,cisplatin-methotrexatefluorouracil(CMF),fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide and FEC-tamoxifen (FEC-T), supposedly to increase efficacy pression alongside long-term side effects including ovarian failure,weightgain,cardiacdysfunction,and,insomecases,leukemia[ r ewidel 3.1.1. Traditional Chinese Medicines Composed of Multiple Herbs.In traditional medicinal systems, herbal medicines a r eu s e do ft e nt ot r e a tt h es y m p t o m sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hc a n c e rand the side effects of cancer treatment [ 68]. Herbal formu- lations used in TCM include mixtures of herbal compoundsconstituted as decoctions, tea, injections, or capsules, whicharepurportedtopossessanticancercompoundsandareusedalone or as adjuvants to existing chemotherapy regimens toimprove efficacy and/or reduce drug-induced toxicity [ 69]. Although TCM is commonly used to counteract the sideeffects of chemotherapy, scientific evidence for its use in womenwithbreastcancerstillisbeingcollected.Amongthe mostcommonChinesemedicinalherbformulationsusedin preclinical and clinical practice for breast cancer treatment are Danggui ( Angelica sinensis -radix) and Ren Shen ( are reported to have potential bene- ficial synergistic effects that include decreasing treatment-associated toxicity, psychosocial stress, and fatigue [ 70]. Jia-wei-xiao-yao-san, commercially known as \"Augmented Rambling Powder,\" a Chinese medicinal herb formulationcontaining Danggui, is the most frequently prescribed for- mula for treating breast cancer and chemotherapy-related symptomsbyTCMpractitionersinTaiwan.Thisformulationhas a long history of use for alleviation of blood toxicity and s l e e pd i s t u r b a n c e .I ti sa l s ou s e dt or e l i e v eh o tfl u s h e sa n d lowerserumlevelsofinflammatorycytokines,IL-6,IL-8,and macrophageprotein1-[71,72]. LSC101, an encapsulated homogenized mixture of dry powdered extracts from a combination of medicinal herbs, littoralis, is used widely by breast cancer patients. Its efficacy in atten- uating the hematological complications of chemotherapyh a sb e e nt e s t e di nc l i n i c a ls e t t i n g s[ 70]. In mouse breast cancer models, the use of LSC101 together with doxorubicinl e dt os i g n i fi c a n t l yh i g h e rn e u t r o p h i l ,s p l e n i ce r y t h r o c y t e ,and leukocyte counts [ 71]. In addition, the use of LCS101 together with conventional chemotherapy regimens pro- vided protection against mild to moderate chemotherapy-induced anemia and neutropenia, supporting its use fordecreasing hematological toxicity but not cancer prevention[73]. Though it is not yet clear how the compounds in LCS101 reduce hematological toxicity, it is suspected thatthe interactions and synergistic effects of the active com-pounds from the combination of herbs may be responsiblefor the pronounced efficacy [ 74]. Some of the component herbs, for example, Ophiopogon japonicus andAstragalus membranaceus, inLSC101havebeenindependentlyshownto stimulatetheproductionoferythroidprogenitorcellsinmiceand in patientsw i t hc h r o n i ca p l a s t i ca n e m i a[ 75]. A TCM formulation composedoffiveherbs,commonlyknownas\"Ruyiping\"and\"Runing II,\" is used as treatment for detoxification and pre-venting relapse, recurrence, and metastasis in breast cancerpatients after mastectomy [ 76]. Clinical evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of this herbal formulation isviainhibitionofangiogenesisanddownregulationofvascularendothelialgrowthfactor(VEGF)andVEGFreceptoraswellas microvessel count (MVC) and micro-vessel area (MVA)[75,76]. ShenqiFuzhengInjection(SFI),aTCMformulationused in repairing immune function at the cellular and molecular levels, is also effective in alleviating myelosuppression andGI tract reaction induced dendritic cellsand upregulating costimulatory molecules [ 77,78]. Clinical studies using a natural dietary supplement composed of a combination of medicinal mushrooms Coriolus versicolor , ,a n Curcuma longa suggested that the formula can alleviate chemotherapy-inducedtoxicityinliver,spleen,kidney,lung,and heart tissue [ 79].In vitrostudies also elucidated the mechanism of action of this mushroom-herbal formulationininhibitingproliferationandloweringtheinvasivebehaviorof a highly metastatic human cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, by the inhibition of cyclin A1 expression and by used in TCM treatmentsfor breast cancer and is associated with immunomodulationbased and wound-healing propertiesattributedtothesynergisticactivityofthecomponentsoftheherbs[82].InoneRCT,RG-CHMinterventionimprovedthe immunecellcountofcancerpatientsreceivingchemotherapy and/or radiotherapy preventing leukopenia and immune impairment associated with a decrease in levels of T cells,helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells com-paredwiththegroupreceivingplacebotreatment.However,the differences between the two groups were not statisticallysignificant [ 83]. The results did show, however, that the administrationofRG-CMHtopatientsreceivingchemother-apy/radiotherapydelayedthereductioninlevelsofleucocytesand neutrophils u l e sh a v eb e e ns h o w nt ob e n e fi tt h ec i r c u l a - tory system through vasodilation, immunomodulation, andantidementiaactivities[ 85].ResultsofarecentRCTshowedthattheabsolutecountsofT-helperlymphocytes(CD4+),the B lymphocytes were significantly elevated in patientsaftertakingYunzhi-Danshencapsules.Theseclinicalfindings imply that regular oral consumption of Yunzhi-Danshen capsules could be beneficial for promoting immunologicalfunction in breast cancer patients after chemotherapy [ 85, 86]. These findings were also supported by in vitroresults showingthatYunzhi-Danshentreatmentinhibitedcancercellproliferation by cell-cycle arrest and downregulation of Aktphosphorylation cells, a human breast cancer cellline,andbyinducingapoptosis[ 87,88]. 3.1.2. Single Herbs and Medicinal Mushrooms. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa )i sk n o w ni nT C Mt or e d u c eh o t flushes in menopausal women and to have low toxicity.S e v e r a lc l i n i c a ls t u d i e sh a v eb a c k e du pt h i sc l a i m[ 89-92]. Since breast cancer chemotherapeutics such as cytostatics,aromatase inhibitors, or antiestrogens frequently induce oraggravate preexisting menopausal symptoms, extracts of C. racemosa are currently being explored as an adjuvant. The mechanisms of action of this phytotherapeutic herb arestill not totally understood, but there is growing interestin its usefulness in the treatment of vasomotor symptomsand hot flushes and in preventing the decrease in bone densityassociatedwithmenopause[ 93,94].Theuseofblack cohosh in clinical trials as an adjuvant to chemotherapy wasobserved to help patients improve their QOL through reliefof vasomotor symptoms [ 95,96 ]. Moreover, in vitrostudies using MCF7 cells showed the high antitumor activity ofC. racemosa extracts their involvement in induction Coriolus versicolor (Yunzhi) also known as Trametes versicolor is a popular component in TCM mushroom preparations. Several clinical trials with patients receivingchemotherapyorradiotherapyhavefoundthatencapsulatedYunzhi preparations significantly improve appetite, alleviateweakness, anorexia, vomiting, dryness of the throat, andEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 spontaneous or night sweats and pain, increase weight, stabilize white blood cell counts, NK cells, IL-2 levels, andCD4/CD8 ratio, and demonstrate a a unique protein-bound polysaccharide, which has been used as a chemoimmunotherapy agent. Several RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of PSK as anadjuvant in cancer therapy, with positive results seen in theadjuvant treatment of gastric, esophageal, colorectal, breast,and lung cancers. PSK is a biological response modifier(BRM) that improves the ability of cancer patients to fightoff tumor progression through different mechanisms, mostprobably by leukocyte activation, regulation of IFN- and IL-2 levels, and inhibition of metalloproteinases and otherenzymes involved in metastatic activity [ 101-105]. PSK has further been shown to have antioxidant activity which mayallow it to play a role as a normal tissue chemo- andradioprotector when used in combination with adjuvant ordefinitive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in the treat-mentofcancersandmayalsoenableittodefendthehostfromoxidativestress[ 106]. Ganoderma Lucidum ,a l s ok n o w na sL i n g z h i ,i su s e di n TCM to promote health and increase life expectancy [ 137]. Clinically, the spore powder is used to treat cancer-relatedfatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine ther-apy.Patientsgiventhetreatmentreportedimprovedphysicalwell-being, less fatigue, less anxiety and depression, andoverall better QOL. Comparative evaluation of TNF- ,I L - 6 ,a n dl i v e ra n dk i d n e yf u n c t i o nb e f o r ea n da ft e ri n t e r - ventions showed a statistically significant effect [ 138]. The wide spectrum of biological effects reported for G. lucidum in the prevention of chronic diseases, such as hepatitis,hepatopathy,andhypertension,makesitaviableadjuvantforhepatoprotection in cancer therapy [ 139]. Among the active compoundspresentin G. lucidum extracts,triterpenoidsare one of the main components responsible for the pharma-cologicalactivitiesincludingimmunomodulatory,antioxida-tive, antimetastatic, and antitumor effects [ 140].In Ginseng ( Panax Ginseng ) is one of the most well-known herbal remedies and is used in TCM to proactively promotehealth,vitality,andlongevity.Ginsengisrankedasthefourthtop-selling herbal medicine globally [ 142,143]. In recent years, ginseng has been included in the pharmacopoeiaso fG e r m a n y ,A u s t r i a ,t h eU n i t e dK i n g d o m ,a n dt h eU n i t e dStates. In adjuvant breast cancer therapy, ginseng has beenused to maintain natural energy, increase physical andpsychomotor performance, and improve mood and evidence from epidemiologic, studies has revealed an inverse-relationshipbetweenincreasedintakeofgreentea( Camelliasinensis )andrelativeriskforbreastcancer[ 147].Greenteaextractpolyphe- non (EGCG) was supplemented as decaffeinatedgreen tea capsules for 2 months in a double-blind, ran-domized,andplacebo-controlledinterventionstudy.Resultssuggest the beneficial effects of EGCG on LDL-cholesterol concentrations and glucose-related markers [ 148]. Since green tea has been associated with weight control andcardiovascular disease prevention, its effect on weight gainafter breast cancer treatment was also investigated [ 149]. A slight reduction in body weight and improved HDL andglucose homeostasis was seen in overweight breast cancersurvivors.Theseclinicalfindings,togetherwithsubstantial in vitroandinvivoevidence,suggestthatteapolyphenolscanbe used as chemopreventive agents and 149-151 ]. Mistletoe ( Viscum album ) extracts have been used for cancer therapy since the early 1920s, most commonly incentral Europe [ 152,153]. Most recent clinical studies have focused on the use of mistletoe extracts as adjuvants forchemotherapy specifically for nausea/vomiting and the sideeffects of systemic therapy [ 154]. The active compounds in mistletoe treatment are the recently identified mistletoelectins (ML I, II, and III) that consist of two polypeptidechains: a carbohydrate-binding B chain that can bind to cellsurface receptors enabling the protein to enter the cell, andthecatalyticAchain,whichcansubsequentlyinhibitproteinsynthesis, due to its ribosome-inactivating properties [ 155, 156].Otherpharmacologicallyrelevantcompoundsfoundin mistletoe are viscotoxins and other low molecular proteins, oligo- and polysaccharides, flavonoids, and triterpene acids, which have been found to act synergistically resulting int h ec y t o t o x i ca n da p o p t o s i s - i n d u c i n ge ff e c t so ft h ew h o l eplant extract [ 157,158]. One RCT showed that mistletoe preparations boosted the immune system in low doses,helping to improve the QOL and survival of some cancerpatients by as much as 40% alongside cotreatment withchemo- and radiotherapy. These pathways[159-162]. Rhodiola algida is widely used TCM stimulate the immune system. Oral ulcerative mucositis, a commonadverse effect of mainstream cytotoxic drugs, limits thenutritional intake of cancer patients. One clinical studydemonstrated the effects of R. algida in alleviation of the occurrence of oral ulcers after four cycles of chemotherapyusing 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and tak-ingR. algida extracts. While white blood cell (WBC) levels returned to the normal range a week after every cycle ofchemotherapy,WBCcountincreasedfasterinpatientsusing R.algida.Patientsalsopresentedfewerandsmalleroralulcers and no liver or renal complications were observed in anyo ft h ep a t i e n t si n v o l v e di nt h es t u d y .Th u s R. algida has the potential to be used concurrently with chemotherapy toalleviatetheoccurrenceoforalulcers[ 163-165].6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine Several flavonoids with cytotoxic activity have been isolated from the aqueous extract of the aerial part ofScutellaria barbata . Despite identification of several active chemicalcompounds,nonedemonstratedmorepotentcyto-toxic activity than the whole plant extract. Thus, the wholeherb extract is being used and studied clinically [ 166- 168]. In one multicenter, open-label, and dose-escalation phase 1B clinical trial, S. barbata extract was administered orally, once or twice daily on a continuous basis to womenwith advanced metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receivingchemotherapy. decreasedincluding aspartate transferase (AST) elevation, diarrhea,fatigue, and pain, proving this herb to be effective and safea n dt h u ss h o w i n gp r o m i s ei nt h et r e a t m e n to fs i d ee ff e c t srelated to the treatment of women with MBC [ 169]. Most notably, the components of the whole herb extract work insynergy to inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell-cycle arrest,stimulateROSproductionandhyperactivationofpoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase(PARP),andinhibitglycolysis[ 170]. principal active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa ), has potential therapeutic activities against breast cancer through multiple signaling pathways [ 171].

In addition to its antioxidant properties, U. tomentosa modulates the activity of the immune system by proliferation of normal T and Blymphocytesandmodulationofcertaincytokines,includingIL-1,IL-6,andTNF-[182-184]. 3.2.UseofAcupunctureinBreastCancer 3.2.1. Definition and Concept of Acupuncture. The National InstitutesofHealth(NIH),USA,hasdefinedacupunctureasa family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomicallocations on the skin by a variety of techniques. The moststudiedmechanismofstimulationofacupuncturepointsusespenetration of the skin by thin, solid, and metallic needles,whichar emani p ula tedman uallyo rb yelectricalstim ula tio n[185]. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by an energycalled \"qi\" which flows through the body; disruptions ofthis flow may cause disease [ 186]. Traditional acupunctur- ists understand qi as circulating between the organs alongchannels called meridians, which are classified as yin oryangmeridians[ 187].Yinmeridiansincludethelung,spleen, heart, kidney, pericardium, and liver, while yang meridiansinclude the stomach, large intestines, small intestines, blad- der, triple energizer, and gall bladder [ 188,189]. Qi energy must flow in the correct strength and quality through eachof these meridians and organs for health to be maintained.ThroughoutthehistoryofChinesemedicineanddescriptionsinHuangdiNeijing ,theconceptofbalancingyinandyanghad beenextensivelyappliedintheapplicationofcombinationofmeridians,correspondingorgans,andacupuncturepointsoracupoints [ 188,189]. Acupoints are mainly (but not always) foundatspecificlocationsalongthemeridianswhichprovideonemeansofalteringtheflowofqi.Therearealsoanumberof acupuncture points with specified locations outside themeridians; these are called \"extraordinary\" points and areoften credited with special therapeutic properties. A thirdcategoryofacupuncturepointscalled\"A-shi\"pointshavenofixedlocationbutrepresenttenderorreflexivepointsappear-ing in the course of pain syndromes [ 188]. Acupuncture points are thought to correspond to conventional (Western)physiologicalandanatomicalfeatures,suchastheperipheralnerve junctions, and are known to stimulate the release ofneurotransmitters, partially explaining its effect particularlyinpainmanagement[ 189]. 3.2.2. Scientific Exploration into Acupuncture. Acupuncture is aimed at correcting imbalances in the flow of qi by stimu- lation of acupoints by a variety of techniques which involvesthe insertion of fine needles into the skin and underlyingtissues at specific points, for therapeutic or preventativepurposes. Evidence of the neurophysiological mechanismsunderlying acupuncture now exists [ 190-193]. For example, the release of a number of endogenous substances including-endorphin,met-enkephalin,anddynorphinswasobserved during treatment [ 194-196]. Moreover, acupuncture can alter gene expression, upregulating opioid production [ 197, 198]. Acupuncture works by modulating noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways to give extra segmental pain relief,that is, analgesia throughout the body [ 199]. releases serotonin [ 200], oxytocin [ 201], and endogenous steroids [ 202], which may further contribute to analgesia. In functional MRI studies, acupuncture induced brain acti- vation in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivated areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala,andhippocampus.Intermsofanalgesia,itwassuggestedthatacupuncturemodulatedtheaffective-cognitiveaspectofpainperception [ 199]. Furthermore, correlations between signal intensities and analgesic effects have been reported [ 203]. Further work using PET scanning showed that acupunctureinducedextraeffectsintheipsilateralinsulabeyondtheshamneedle, which also had greater effects on activation patternsthanthecontrolgroup[ 107]. Recent advances in clinical research on acupuncture suggest that acupuncture provides clinical benefit for breastoncology patients in symptom control and supportive care.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 Symptoms that respond to acupuncture treatment include pain,gastrointestinalsideeffects,hotflushes,fatigue,anxiety,depression, and insomnia. Patients welcome a supportivetherapythatcanreducesymptomswithouttheneedforlong-term medication. The strength of current scientific evidencehas made acupuncture acceptable 3.3.1. Cancer-Related Hot acupuncture on vasomotor syndrome (summarizedinTable 2)[109-116,204,205],includingeightRCTsandfour single-group pre-post comparisons. Daily flush frequency was the main outcome measure. All the studies used self-administrated questionnaires to measure this effect. Sometrials also used the Kupperman Index (KI) to score climac-teric symptoms. Most studies used six or more acupointsof which SP6 was the most commonly used.

Nausea and Vomiting. Ten studies included in Table 2 investigated the antiemetic effect of acupuncture on distresssymptoms induced by chemotherapy [ 119-126]. Participants received intervention over a treatment period of 5 days to3 weeks. These studies, including three high quality studies[118,119,121], reported that acupuncture could significantly improve emesis caused by breast cancer therapy. Acupunc-ture stimulation at points PC6 and ST36 has repeatedlybeen shown to be a clinically useful antiemetic treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy- induced emesis. In 1998, the US NIH stated that \"acupunc-ture is a proven effective treatment modality for or minimal acupuncture demonstrated thatthe electroacupuncture plus antiemetics arm was the mosteffectiveforpreventingnauseaandvomitingassociatedwithhigh-dosechemotherapy[ 121].Ezzoandcolleaguesreviewed eleven trials in 2006 and concluded that electroacupuncturehas demonstrated benefit for chemotherapy-induced acutevomiting,andself-administeredacupressureappearstohavea protective effect against acute nausea and can readily betaught to patients [ 206]. Since then, two multicenter longi- tudinalRCTshaveshownthebeneficialeffectofacupressurein significantly reducing the severity of both acute anddelayed vomiting [ 118,119]. These studies also demonstrate that acupuncture and acupressure are simple to administerandmeritwiderconsideration. 3.3.3. Pain. Up to 70% of cancer patients still suffer signif- icant pain which adversely impacts their QOL [ 207]. Bone painisthemostcommontypeofcancer-associatedpain,andbone metastases are common in advanced breast cancers.Current pain-relieving strategies the use of opioid-based analgesics, bisphosphonates, and radiotherapy. Thepharmacological failure to control pain alone has led tothe use of nondrug treatments including acupuncture. Theanalgesiceffectsofacupuncturemaypermitadecreaseintherequirement and side effects of pharmaceuticals. It can alsohelpthosewhoaresensitivetonormaldosesofanalgesicsandthose who have pain despite analgesic dose titration [ 196]. Although acupuncture is used in palliative care settings forall types of cancer pain, the evidence base is still insufficientand inconclusive and there is very little evidence to show itseffectivenessinrelievingcancer-inducedpain[ 208,209]. Threetrialsusedacupuncturetomanagepostmastectomy pain(Table 2)[127-129,208,209].AcupointL14wasusedin all the three trials. demonstrated a significanteffectfavoringtheacupuncturegroup[ 128,129],butonehigh quality RCT [ 127] found no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group. Althoughreviews vary in their conclusions,acupuncturewas foundtobe superior to no treatment or waiting list control in moststudies. Finally, emerging evidence demonstrates the analgesic effectiveness of both acupuncture and electroacupuncturein breast cancer patients experiencing joint pain as a resultof adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment. Four trials haveincludedinvestigationofarthralgia,andallexploredtheeffectof acupuncture therapy on aromatase inhibitor-related jointpain and functional ability ( Table 2). Positive results were obtained including enhanced postoperative analgesic effi-ciency, relief of postoperative pain, and significant improve-mentinjointandmusclestiffness[ 128,130-132,210]. 3.3.4.

Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia. The two anxiety, sickness, and dyspnoea (ASAD) points located at the upperleft and right sternal regions are used extensively in the UKto control dyspnea and also anxiety. Patients can to control these distressing symptoms in the event of a panic attack. In a systematic review of RCTs ofacupuncture in the treatment of depression, Leo and Ligot Jr. stated that although the odd ratios derived from com- paring acupuncture with control conditions in the existing literaturesuggestaroleforacupuncture,theevidenceisthus far inconclusive [ 217]. More recent evidence suggests that acupuncturewhencombinedwithantidepressanttherapyhasa faster therapeutic onset rate than pharmacotherapy alone, c o u p l e dw i t har e d u c t i o ni nt h es i d ee ff e c tp r o fi l eo ft h e antidepressant medication [ 218]. An additional RCT exam- ining the treatmentof hot flushes revealed that compared to women taking venlafaxine, those receiving acupuncture felt theyhadmoreenergy,improvedclarityofthought,increasedlibido, and a greater sense of well-being [ 219]. In one study donebyMehlingandcolleagues,massageandacupuncturein postoperative cancer patients who were also receiving usual careresultedinasignificantimprovementintheirdepressed mood with short-lived significant improvement in tensionand anxiety when compared to patients receiving usual care alone [220]. A subsequent meta-analysis revealed that the rate of improvement in insomnia produced by auricular acupuncture was significantly higher than that achieved by taking Diazepam [ 221]. Although a Cochrane systematic review of acupuncture for insomnia in 2007 concludedthat acupuncture or its variants were not more effective than the control groups [ 222], five clinical studies showed significantimprovementinanxietyanddepressionovertime in patients who underwent acupuncture treatment. QOL measures of pain severity and interference, physical andpsychological distress, life satisfaction, and mood states alsoshowed improved scores after acupuncture treatment [ 223- 227]. 3.3.6. Lymphoedema and Leukopenia. Lymphoedema is a distressing problem that affects many women after breastcancersurgery.IntheUnitedStates,needlingandevenliftingobjects using the affected arm has been prohibited, resultingin a limited number of publications on acupuncture andlymphoedema [ 133]. However, recent results of two studies demonstratedthattraditionalacupunctureafterbreastcancersurgery was associated with improvements body of evidence comes from China whereasystematicreviewofRCTswaspositiveforincreasing WBC in patients undergoing chemotherapy [ 228]; however, the quality of trials was considered poor, and the authorssuggest that the positivemeta-analysisshouldbe consideredasexploratory. 3.4. Safety of Acupuncture. With an increasing number of positive evidence-based acupuncture trials, more cancerpatients may seek acupuncture treatment. While closelymonitored clinical trials often report low incidences ofadverseeventsofacupuncture,manyphysiciansremaincon-cernedaboutitssafety.Seriousadverseeventsareexceedinglyrare\u2014roughly five in one million [ 229]\u2014and are usually associated with poorly trained, unlicensed acupuncturists[230]. The vast majority of adverse events from acupunctureEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 are minor; those most commonly reported occur at the site of needle insertion: minor bleeding (3%), hematoma(2-3%), and pain from needling (up to 3%). Dizziness isr e p o r t e di na b o u t1 %o ft r e a t m e n t s[ 229,231,232]. Serious adverse effects including pneumothorax, spinal lesions, andhepatitis Btransmission have been reported in the litera- ture for acupuncture, but these are rare and are generally associated with poorly trained unlicensed acupuncturists[233]. Acupuncture for oncology should be administered by asuitablyqualifiedpractitionerwhocanmaintainaconstantdialogue with the oncology team treating the patient.

Ingeneral,acupuncturecanbeconsideredasafemethod of treatment, with a low side effect profile, which in partaddstoitspopularityamongpatients[ 234-236].Establishing an eligibility guideline for cancer patients before receivingacupuncture would add another layer of safety. Lu andRosenthal suggested that cancer patients should not be rec-ommendedforacupunctureiftheyhaveoneofthefollowingconditions: (a) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than500/L, (b) platelet count less than 25,000/ L, (c) altered mental state, (d) clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias,and (e) other unstable medical conditions (case-by-caseconsideration). Guidelines for safe practice within this fieldhave previously been published [ 237]. Before the first visit, approvalisrequiredfromtheprimaryoncologistbasedupontheseguidelines[ 238]. 4. Conclusions and Future Prospects Research on CAM as adjuvants in chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, particularly that on herbal medicine andacupuncture,hasgainedmomentumoverthepastfewyears.Thisdevelopmentpavesthewaytowardunderstandingtheirefficacy and modes of action in alleviating cancer or cancertreatment-relatedconditions.Evidencefromvarious invitro, in vivostudies andRCTs supporttheuseof herbalmedicine immune system, in relievingpain,fatigue,cyto-andhepatotoxicity,andininhibitinggas-trointestinaltoxicity,angiogenesis,andothersideeffectsfromchemo- and radiotherapy. The inclusion of selected herbalmedicines from well-designed RCTs in this review providesevidence-based knowledge to strengthen the rationale forthe use of herbal medicines in controlling breast cancer in the clinical setting. Further, considering the assessment of benefit:risk ratio of the presented results, acupuncture isseen as a valuable nonpharmaceutical treatment option forsymptom management in cancer patients. Although currentevidence from basic science and clinical research on herbalmedicines or acupuncture is still not sufficient to changeoncological practice in general, the quality and design ofclinical trials have significantly improved over the last fewyears which can provide patients with the most effectiveprotocols or treatment types and safety profiles. Despite allthe evidence presented, key challenges still exist includingquality control of herbal medicinal materials, standardiza-tion of practices and drug components or between chemotherapy and herbal medicine. Furtherresearchaddressingthesechallengesintheformofrigorouslydesigned clinical trials accompanied by comprehensive andin-depth laboratory studies is needed to improve the qualityoftheexistingevidencebaseandsupporttheuseofCAM.

Unexpectedly, JTT did not significantly affect cellular or humoral immune responses specific to the vaccine antigens, which were determined by antigen-specific interferon- secretion in T cells and antigen-specific IgG titers in plasma, respectively. Nevertheless, JTT prevented deterioration of patients' conditions, such as anemia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, plasma IL-6elevation,andreductionofperformancestatus,whicharefrequentlyobservedinadvancedcancers.Toourknowledge,thisisthe first clinical study that examined the immunological and clinical effects of JTT in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy in humans. 1. Introduction Juzentaihoto(JTT)isawell-knownKampo(Japaneseherbal) medicine, which consists of 10 different herbs and has beenused as a supplementary therapy in patients with varioustypes of chronic diseases/symptoms, such as fatigue, lossof appetite, night sweats, circulatory problems, and anemia[1]. JTT has also been frequently used for cancer patients, since it was reported to have anti-tumor effects [ 1-7]a n d diminishthesideeffectscausedbycancertreatments,suchaschemotherapyandradiotherapy[ 8-12].Inaddition,JTTwas shown to immune-modulating properties, such asenhancementofphagocytosis,cytokineproduction,antibodyproduction, NKT, and T-cell functions, in animal experiments[ 1-7,13-21].However,onlylimitedinformation is available on the immunological and clinical effects of JTTinhumans. Pancreaticcancer,thefourthlargestcauseofcancerdeath in the world, is one of the most aggressive cancers [ 22, 23]. Although there have been substantial advances in the therapeutic modalities for pancreatic cancer, including oach, personalized peptide vaccination (PPV), in whichHLA-matched peptides were selected and administered,based on the pre-existing host immunity before vaccination[24-28]. Recent clinical trials of PPV have demonstrated feasibility and safety of this new therapeutic approach invarious types of advanced cancers [ 24-28]. For example, in our previous clinical trials, immune responses boosted byvaccination were well associated with overall survival (OS)in advanced pancreatic cancer patients undergoing PPV incombination with GEM as the first-line therapy [ 28]. In the current study, we conducted a randomized phase II study ofPPV to investigate whether combined usage of JTT couldshow immunological and/or clinical effects in advancedpancreaticcancerpatientsundergoingPPV. 2. Patients and Methods 2.1.Patients. Patientswithpathologicaland/orclinicaldiag- nosis of pancreatic cancer, who were refractory to con-ventional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, andradiotherapy,wereeligibleforinclusioninthecurrentstudy,if they showed positive IgG responses to at least 2 of the 31different vaccine candidate peptides, as reported previously[24-28]. Other inclusion criteria were as follows: age of morethan20years;anEasternCooperativeOncologyGroup(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; positive status for theHLA-A2,-A24,-A3supertype(A3,A11,A31,orA33),or-A26;expected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; and adequatehematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Exclusion criteriaincluded pulmonary, cardiac, or other systemic diseases; anacute infection; a history of severe allergic reactions; regularuse of herbal medicines; pregnancy or nursing; and otherinappropriate conditions for enrollment as judged by clini-cians. The protocol was approved by the Kurume UniversityEthicalCommitteeandwasregisteredintheUMINClinicalTrials Registry (UMIN 000006295). After a full explanationof the protocol, a written informed consent was obtainedfromallpatientsbeforeenrollment. 2.2. Clinical Protocol. This was an open-label, randomized phaseIIstudy.Thepatientswererandomlyassignedtoreceive PPV with or without oral administration of JTT (PPV plus JTT group versus PPV alone group), according to age andperformance status. The primary and secondary objectiveswere to compare cellular and humoral immune responsesto the vaccine antigens and safety between the PPV plusJTT group and the PPV alone group, respectively. Thirty-one peptides, whose safety and immunological effects hadbeenconfirmedinpreviouslyconductedclinicalstudies[ 24- 28],wereemployedforvaccination(12peptidesforHLA-A2, A31, or A33), and 4 peptides Table 1) (see Supplementary Material availableonlineathttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/981717 ).ThepeptideswerepreparedundertheconditionsofGoodManufacturing Practice(GMP)byPolyPeptideLaboratories(SanDiego,CA,USA)andtheAmericanPeptideCompany(Vista,CA,USA). The peptides for vaccination to individual patients were selected in consideration of the pre-existing host immunitybefore vaccination, by assessing the titers of IgG specificto each of the 31 different vaccine candidates, as reportedpreviously [ 24-28]. A maximum of 4 peptides (3mg/each peptide), which were selected based on the results of HLAtyping and peptide-specific were subcutaneously administered once aweek for In the PPV plus JTT group,JTT (TJ-48, 15mg/day; Tsumura Co., Tokyo, Japan) wasorally administered for 35 days during the first cycle of 6vaccinations. After the first cycle of 6 vaccinations, up to4 vaccine peptides were reselected according to the titersof peptide-specific IgG and administered every 2 weeks.The vaccine peptides were re-selected at every cycle of 6vaccinationsuntilthediscontinuationofPPV.Adverseeventswere monitored according to the National Cancer Institute CommonTerminologyCriteriaforAdverseEvents(CTCAE) version4.0.Completebloodcountsandserumbiochemistrytests were performed before and after every cycle of 6vaccinations. 2.3.MeasurementofT-CellResponsestotheVaccinePeptides. T-cell responses specific to the vaccine peptides by interferon (IFN)-ELISPOT assay and each peptide (10M ) .H a l fo ft h em e d i u mw a s replaced with new medium containing the correspondingpeptides(20M) at day 3. After incubationforthefollowing 4 days, the cells were harvested and tested for their abilityto produce IFN-in response to the corresponding specific peptides. The cells were also tested for IFN- production in response to negative control peptides from human immun-odeficiency virus (HIV), which might activate nonspecificimmune cells, including non-specific (ImmunoSpot S5 Versa Analyzer; Cellular Technology Ltd.,Shaker Heights, OH, USA). assays were carried out inquadruplicate. The two-tailed Student's -test was used for statistical evaluation. Antigen-specific T-cell responses wereconsidered positive, when the spot numbers in responseto the specific peptides were significantly higher ( < 0.05)than those in response to the control HIV peptides, which were supposed to reflect the numbers of immunecellsnonspecificallyproducingIFN- .Peptide-specificT-cell responses were shown as the differences between the spotnumbers per1\u00d710 5PBMCs in response 01 9 2 219 7 0.753 A24 A2 12 13A3supertype 10 17A26 5 7 Clinicalstage 0.845 IV 19 20 Recurrence 9 9 Locationofthemain tumor0.182 Head 6 12 Body-tail 22 17 Numberofprevious chemotherapy regimens0.843 01 1 11 1 1 321 3 1 0>33 5 Number of vaccinations0.443 Median(range) 9(3-17) 13 S-1 5 7 Gemcitabine+ S-178 Others 2 1 2.4. Measurement of Humoral Immune Responses to the Vaccine Peptides. Thehumoralimmuneresponsesspecificto thevaccinepeptidesweredeterminedbypeptide-specificIgGtiters using a bead-based multiplex assay with previ-ously[29].Inbrief,plasma(\u00d7100diluted)wasincubatedwith 100L of peptide-coupled color-coded beads for 1.5 hours at 30 C, followed by washing and incubation with 100 L of biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (Vector Laboratories,Burlingame, CA, USA) for beads were washedandincubatedwith100 Lofstreptavidin-PE(Invit- rogen) for After washing, the fluorescence of the beads was detected using the Luminex 200 system. Ifpeptide-specificIgGtitersinthepostvaccinationplasmaweremore than 2-fold higher than those in the prevaccination plasma, the changes were considered to be significant. If a significantincreasewasobservedinatleastoneofthevaccinepeptides,theantigen-specifichumoralimmuneresponsewasconsideredtobeaugmented. 2.5. Measurement of Laboratory Markers. ELISA kits were used to measure serum amyloid A (SAA) (Invitrogen), IL-6 (eBioscience, San protein (CRP), IL-12 and TGF- 1( R & Ds y s t e m s , Minneapolis, MN, USA). (Luminex). plasmasamples were thawed, diluted, and assayed in duplicate inaccordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The meanofduplicatesampleswasusedforstatisticalanalysis. Free-radical elective evaluator (Wismerll, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure biological antioxidant potential (BAP)andderivativesofreactiveoxidativemetabolites(d-ROM),anindexofoxidativestress.Frozenplasmasampleswerethawed,diluted, and assayed in accordance with the CD33, and HLA-DR. After run on a FACSCanto II (BD biosciences,San Diego, CA, USA), and data were analyzed using theDiva software (BD biosciences). All mAbs were purchasedfromBiolegend(SanDiego,CA).GranulocyticMDSCswereidentified as CD33 positive in the cell subset negative forboth the lineage markers and HLA-DR. Monocytic test, or Fisher's exact test was usedtocomparedifferencesbetweenmeasurements.OSwascalculatedfromthefirstdateofpeptidevaccinationuntilthedate of death or the last date when the patient was knownto be alive. Curves for OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was conducted for thecomparison of survival curves.

Results 3.1. Patients' Characteristics. Between September 2011 and December 2012, a total of 57 advanced pancreatic cancer patients, who were refractory to conventional treatments, were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomlyassigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive PPV with or without oraladministration of JTT (PPV plus JTT, =28;P P Va l o n e , =29). The demographic and baseline disease charac- teristics of the enrolled patients are given in Table 1.Th e r e were no significant differences between the two groups intheclinicopathologicalcharacteristics,includingage,gender,performance status, HLA-type, clinical stage, location ofthe main tumor, and numbers of previous chemotherapyregimen(s).Themediannumberofvaccinationswas9(range3-17) in the PPV plus JTT group and 10 (range 3-18) in thePPV alone group.

Laboratory Markers. Laboratory data both before and after the first cycle of vaccination were available in 23and 27 patients in the PPV plus JTT group and the PPValonegroup ,respectively .Completebloodcountsandserumbiochemistry tests were compared between the two groups.There were no significant differences in complete blood counts, such as hemoglobin and lymphocyte counts, and serum biochemistry tests, such as albumin, total Table 4).InthePPValone group, hemoglobin, lymphocyte counts, and albumin weresignificantly decreased after the first cycle of vaccination,whereas they did not change significantly after vaccinationin the PPV plus JTT group (Figures 2(a),2(b),a n d2(c)). Of note,theseresultswereconsistent,evenif4patientswithoutcombinedchemotherapieswereexcludedfromthePPVplusJTT group for statistical analysis. This finding suggestedthat combined usage of JTT prevented the decrease inhemoglobin, lymphocyte counts, and albumin in pancreaticcancerpatientsundergoingPPV.

Discussion JTTisawell-knownKampo(Japaneseherbal)medicineandhas been shown to possess immune-modulating and antitu-morpropertiesinanimalexperiments[ 1-7,13-21].However, only limited information is available on the immunologi- cal and clinical effects of JTT in cancer patients. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study that examined theimmunological and clinical effects of JTT in cancer patientsundergoingimmunotherapyinhumans. JTT has been reported to modulate antigen-specific adoptive immune responses in mice [ 2,15]. For example, Dai et al. demonstrated that oral administration of JTTinduced cytotoxic T cells specific to tumor cells and preventtumordevelopmentintheRET-transgenicmousemodel[ 2]. Iijima et al. reported that JTT induced Th1-skewed immuneresponses and Th1-dependent antibody responses in agedmice[15].However,thecurrentstudyshowedthatcombined usage of JTT did not significantly affect cellular or humoralTable 4: Laboratory markers in peripheral a l ob e e ns h o w nt oe n h a n c ep r o d u c t i o no fc y t o k i n e s ,s u c has IL-12 and IL-18, in mice [ 17,18]. But, in cytokines, IL-6, between the PPV plus JTTgroup PPV alone group. Furthermore, there werenosignificantdifferencesinsuppressiveimmunecellsubsets,granulocytic and monocytic MDSCs [ 30,31], in PBMCs between the two groups.

In addition,althoughJTTwasreportedtoinhibitimmunecell-mediated oxidative stress [ 6,19], the current study showed no significant effects of JTT in redox status, which wasdetermined by oxidative stress markers (d-ROM and BAP)inplasma,inadvancedcancerpatientsundergoingPPV. Several previous reports demonstrated that JTT showed antitumoreffectsthroughvariousmechanisms[ 1-7].Ohnishi et al. showed that oral administration of JTT before tumorinoculation resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of livermetastasis of colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells [ 5].

In addition, in humans, JTT supplementation was shown to result in considerableimprovementinintrahepaticrecurrence-freesurvivalinhep-atocellularcarcinoma(HCC)patientsaftersurgicaltreatment[6]. Although these results suggested the preventive effects of JTT in tumor development in mice and humans, thetherapeuticeffectsofthisagentforadvancedstageoftumorsarenotwelldefined.Thecurrentstudyshowedthatcombinedusage of JTT conferred no survival benefits in patients with pancreaticcancerundergoingPPV. Combined usage of PPV and JTT was well tolerated. Themostfrequentadverseeventwasinjectionsitereactions,and all of the severe adverse events observed were due tocancer progression or other causes rather than to the vacci-nations or JTT administration. Of note, JTT administrationinducedsomebeneficialeffectsinpancreaticcancerpatientsundergoing PPV. Although the patients treated with PPValone showed decrease in hemoglobin, lymphocyte counts,and albumin after vaccination possibly due to side effects ofcombined chemotherapies and/or malnutrition mediated bydisease progression, those treated with PPV in combinationwith JTT maintained a stable level of these factors, as pre-viously suggested [ 1,12,32]. Consistent with these findings, a significant change in performance status was observedbetweenbeforeandafter(orduring)vaccinationinthePPValonegroupbutnotinthePPVplusJTTgroup.Theseresultssuggest that JTT has the potential to prevent deteriorationof patients' conditions without severe adverse events evenin advanced cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy.Other clinical data, such as patients' quality of life (QOL),w e r eu n a v a i l a b l ei nt h i ss t u d y ,b u tt h e ym i g h tb ew o r t h yo fassessmentinfutureclinicaltrials.It should also be noted that the elevation of the pro- inflammatorycytokineIL-6wasinhibitedbycombinedusageof JTT. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that regulatesvarious aspects of immune responses, acute phase reactions,and hematopoiesis. In particular, IL-6 has been reported tobe deeply involved in inflammation associated with cancerdevelopment and progression [ 33,34]. Indeed, there have been many studies describing the correlation between IL-6elevation and poor prognosis in various types of cancers, including pancreas cancer [ 35-38]. In addition, IL-6 has recently been reported to be one of the critical cytokines forinducing suppressive immune cell subsets, such as MDSCsand Th17, which are known to negatively affect anti-tumorimmunity [ 39-41]. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of JTT on IL-6 elevation might be beneficial for controlling cancerprogression. 5.

Despite the development of radiotherapy machines and technologies, a proportion of patients suffer from radiation-induced lymphedema. Saireito (SRT) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been used for treating edema and inflammationin conditions such as nephritic disease. This study investigated the effect of SRT on lymphedema caused by radiotherapy. Four patients were treated with SRT at a dose of 9g/day. The severity of lymphedema was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 and Numerical Rating Scale before and after SRT treatment. After the Onecasedecided tostoptakingSRT3daysafter the aging of the population, radiotherapy is taking an increasingly important role for preserving organ function.With the development of machines and technologies forradiotherapy,adverseeffectshavedecreased.However,somepatientsstillsufferfromirreversibleadverseeventsassociatedwith radiotherapy. One of the most serious complications islymphedema, which is a chronic, debilitating, refractory, orincurable condition. No consensus has been reached on thestandard therapy for lymphedema. It is difficult to controllymphedemainWesternmedicine,andthelong-termuseof theappliedmedicationshasbeenlimitedduetodocumented hepatotoxicity[ 1-3].Theonlyeffectivetypesofprimarycare for lymphedema have been reported to be elastic clothing, multilayerlymphedemabandaging(MLLB),lymphdrainage,skin care, and complex physical therapy. Complex physical therapy includes elastic clothing, MLLB, lymph drainage,skin care, and exercise [ 4-8]. However, the problem is that elastic clothing or MLLB cannot be used on the head andneck,soitisdifficulttocontrollymphedemaintheseareas. Kampo, Japanese traditional herbal medicine, is the most frequently used type of alternative and complemen-tary medicine in Japan. The aim of Kampo therapy is toimprovepatients'conditionwhatevertheirdiseaseis.KampomedicineisplayinganincreasinglyimportantroleinclosingthegapbetweenmodernWesternmedicineandthedemandsof patients. Kampo applications for cancer therapy weredeveloped by trial and error because of dissatisfaction withWestern medicine in dealing with problems such as theadverse effects of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and varioustypes of general malaise [ 9]. For example, Daikenchuto is2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine effective on postoperative adhesive bowel obstruction requiring long-tube decompression [ 10] and Goshajinkigan has been used for peripheral neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin inpatients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer [ 11]. The Japanese herbal medicine Saireito (SRT) has been usedempirically in the treatment of various edematous disorders (nephritic syndrome, cirrhosis, pregnancy, swelling, and lymphedema after surgery and macular edema) [ 12,13]. It is composed of 12 crude drugs in fixed proportions: 7.0gofBupleurum root and 1.0g of ginger.Saikosaponin, which is derived from the medicinal plant Bupleurum root, exhibits a variety of pharmacological and immune-modulatory activ-ities including anti-inflammatory responses [ 14]. In light of the purported activities of SRT for various edematousdisorders in experimental models, we investigated whetherSRT had beneficial effects in terms of the reduction oflymphedemainpatientsafterorduringradiotherapy. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.PreliminaryStudy 2.1.1. Patients. Between December 2010 and January 2013, 625patientsunderwentradiotherapyatIshikawaPrefecturalCentral Hospital. We prescribed SRT to 5 patients whosuffered from lymphedema among them. They had alreadyundergonesometreatmentforlymphedema or had receivedno treatment because of its location in the head and neck.We excluded 1 patient whose lymphedema had been causedby an operation. Therefore, we evaluated 4 patients withlymphedemacausedbyradiotherapy. 2.1.2.RadiotherapyPlanning. Patientsweretreatedbyradio- therapy using 6-MV X-rays or thermoplastic body cast (Hip-Fix, Med- Tec, Orange City, IA, USA), a Type-S head and shoulder thermoplastic mask (CIVCO, Iowa City, IA, USA), or acustomized Vac-Lok (Med-Tec, Orange City, IA, USA) bagthat conformed to both the patient's body contours and thetreatment box. They were used for head and neck treatmentusingCLINAC21EXandfortreatmentanywhereinthebodyusingNovalisTx. 2.1.3. Target Localization and Treatment Delivery. On the treatment day, the patients were again appropriately immo-bilizedonthecustom-madethermoplasticcastandVac-Lokbag box. Initial setup was based on bone anatomy usingtwo-dimensionalorthogonalkVimagesregisteredtodigitallyreconstructed radiographs. In the case of IMRT, additional shifts for accurate setting up within the treatment field wereperformed using three-dimensional cone beam computedtomography (CBCT): 200 gantry rotation, 100kV, 20mA, and20mSfortheheadandneck;200gantryrotation,125kV, 80mA,and25mSforthebody.Treatmentwasthendelivered, with the entire process of setting up and treatment taking approximately15-30minutesperpatient. 2.1.4.

We delivered 2 or 3Gy per fraction, and thetotal dose of radiotherapy was 30 to 66Gy. Three patientshad undergone an operation before radiotherapy. They hadundergone their last operation 1-15 years ago. Three patientsreceived chemotherapy before radiotherapy and 1 of themreceived concurrent chemotherapy. Two received SRT after12Gy. Two patients received SRT after they finished thetotal course of radiotherapy (63 or 66Gy). The compliancewas good. Prior to SRT treatment, all patients had grade 2lymphedema according to the CTCAE, and all patients hadsymptomsscoredas4to10accordingtotheNRS.After2or3 days of SRT treatment, lymphedema of 2 patients treated w i t hS R Ta ft e rt h e yr e c e i v e d1 2G yo fas c o r eo f1 0i m p r o v e d to0,butlymphedemaoftheother2patientstreatedwithSRTaftertheyfinishedtheentireradiotherapyofascoreof4or8didnotimprove.Patient3decidedtostoptakingSRTafter3days because cough and fever appeared.

Figure1shows CBCTdemonstratingtheimprovementoflymphedema. 4. Discussion Lymphedema is a troublesome complication of radiother-apy, especially for patients wearing a custom-made ther-moplastic cast. Massive lymphedema leads to temporarydiscontinuation of radiotherapy because the custom-madethermoplastic cast and treatment planning (adapted plan)n e e dt ob em a d ea g a i nt oe n s u r ea c c u r a c yo ft h et r e a t m e n t . Therefore, it is important to control lymphedema, especiallyfor the patients treated with a custom-made thermoplasticcast. Complicationsof radiotherapyhave decreased withthedevelopment of machines and technology for radiotherapy.O n eo ft h e s et e c h n o l o g i c a la d v a n c e si sI M R T .Th ei n t e n s i t yof radiation beams can be changed in IMRT during treat- ment to spare more adjacent normal tissues than during conventional radiotherapy [ 15]. Owing to this, an increased dose ofradiationcan bedeliveredto thetumorusingIMRT.IMRT is a type of conformal radiation, in which radiationbeams are shaped to ensure close approximation to theshape of the tumor. When it is applied, improvement in thetumor control rates and reduction of complications can beexpected.Nevertheless,somepatientssufferfromirreversibleadverse effects of radiotherapy like lymphedema, for whichWestern medicine is not useful. In this study, lymphedemain patient 1 progressed during radiotherapy and it becamedifficult to fit the custom-made thermoplastic cast. Kishidaet al. [16] concluded that SRT is useful for the prevention and early recovery of postoperative leg edema after total hiparthroplastywithanassociationofrapidCRPreduction. The mechanism of lymphedema due to radiotherapy has beenpostulatedasfollows[ 17].Theinitialfractionaldosesof irradiation would destroy cells in the vegetative intermitoticcell and differentiating intermitotic cell compartments andreduce the production of cells that normally flow into the4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure1:CBCTimagesofpatient1onthefirstdayofradiotherapy(a),firstdayofSRTmedication(beforemedication)(b),3dayslater(c), 14dayslater(adaptiveradiotherapy)(d),and28dayslater(lastdayofradiotherapy)(e).Lymphedemaimproved3dayslater,butitgotworse ononeoccasion.Itimproved28dayslater. postmitotic compartment.

How-ever, in the chronic clinical period, cells are sloughed awayand fibrosis increases, and blood vessels and lymphatic obstructed. These microcirculationdisorders cause repeated edema. SRT exhibits pharmacolog-ical effects via the following actions. (1) Diuretic actions:SRT shows diuretic actions due to an antagonistic actionon the mineralocorticoid receptor, exerted by saikosaponinH, which is a principal component of SRT [ 13]. (2) Anti- inflammatory actions: there have been several reports about the relationship between SRT and inflammation [ 13,18], addition, saikosaponin inhibited T-cell activation via the suppressionof NF-B[13]. Thus, both direct and indirect actions of suppression of NF-Ba c t i v i t ym i g h th a v ec o n t r i b u t e dt oa change in the normalization of CRP early in the study. Oral administration of SRT to rats increased the plasmaACTH level and the expression of proopiomelanocortin(an ACTH anterior pituitary lobe) mRNA[25].Furthermore,theseactionswereinhibitedbyantiserum corticotropin-releasingfactor[ 26]. SRT has not been investigated (drug use investigations, etc.) to determine the incidence of adverse reactions. Therehave been several reports of adverse reactions includinginterstitial pneumonitis, pseudoaldosteronism, myopathy,fulminant hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction, and jaundice [ 27]. In this study, one patient decided to stop taking SRT after3 days because cough and fever appeared. Fever, cough, dyspnea, abnormal pulmonary sound (fine crackle), and ground-glass-like and reticular opacities predominantly inthebilaterallowerlungfieldsonchestcomputedtomographywere observed when interstitial pneumonitis occurred. Thepathogenesisofdrug-inducedpneumonitisisnotcompletelyunderstood;intolerancetosideeffects,secondaryeffects,andidiosyncratic allergic reactions is thought to be the mostimportant factor [ 28]. Pneumonitis generally develops 1-2 weeks after the start of administration, and bronchoalveolarlavage and histologic examination of lung biopsies revealthe features of eosinophilic pneumonitis [ 29,30]. AllergicEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 pneumonitis is particularly mediated via types III and IV allergic reactions [ 31]. The patient who stopped taking SRT after 3 days visited our hospital 1 month later, so it wastoo late to examine the cause of her disease and it was tooearly for interstitial pneumonitis by SRT to have developed.The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare had approved 148 types of Kampo drug by 1999. Nakagawa et al. [ 32] conductednationalsurveillanceofdrug-relatedpneumonitisin Japan and reported that cases of Kampo drug-relatedpneumonitis accounted for as much as 10% (75 cases duet o1 3k i n d so fK a m p od r u g )o fa l lc a s e so fd r u g - r e l a t e dpneumonitis in Japan from 1984 to 1996. Using their data,84% of cases of Kampo for saibokuto,4 for SRT, 1 for scihaito,1 fordaisaikoto,1forsaikokeishito,and1forsaikokeishikanshouto.Including these drugs, the Japanese Ministry of Health andWelfare has approved 29 kinds of Kampo drug that containOugon.Ougonisthoughttobethemostimportantcauseofpneumonitis because of previously reported highly positivelymphocytestimulationtests[ 33]. Tsumura & Co. investigated reports on Shosaikoto drug use from October 1995 to March 1997, including abnor-mal laboratory test results, and 88 adverse reactions wereobserved in 69 of 2,495 patients (2.8%). The incidence ofinterstitial pneumonitis was less than 0.1% [ 34]. Nakagawa et al. [32] showed that the rate of interstitial pneumonitis as an adverse reaction of SRT was lower than the rate forShosaikoto.Therefore,itisrareforinterstitialpneumonitisto developasanadversereactionofSRT. 5.

Introduction ThisreviewaimedtoexaminetheevidenceforusingChinese herbal medicine (CHM) in cancer treatment in terms ofthe benefits and potential mechanisms of action. As thesame CHM formulae may be used for different cancer typeswith different effectiveness, in this review, liver cancer orhepatocellularcarcinoma(HCC)hasbeenusedasthespecificfocusfordiscussion.Livercanceristhesecondleadingcauseof cancer death in men and the sixth in women worldwidewithanestimated748,300newlivercancercasesand695,900l i v e rc a n c e rd e a t h so c c u r r i n gi n2 0 0 8[ 1]. The highest liver cancer rates are found in East and South-East Asia and inMiddle and Western Africa. In the United States between 1 9 9 0a n d2 0 0 7 ,t h ei n c r e a s ei nd e a t hr a t e sf o rl i v e rc a n c e r accounted for nearly 70% of the total increase in the cancerdeath rates in men and for almost 23% of the increase inwomen[2].Livercancerhasapoorprognosis,andthe5-yearsurvival rate reported between 1973 and 2007 remained below 12% in the United States [ 3]. Early stage liver cancer is currently d i ffi c u l tt od i a g n o s ed u et ot h el a c ko fas e n s i t i v es c r e e n i n g test. As a result, only 30% to 40% of patients with livercancer are candidates for potentially curative treatments at thetimeoftheirdiagnosis[ 4].Treatmentmodalitiessuchas surgicalresection,livertransplantation,andlocalablationareonly considered for patients with preserved liver function. However, most newly diagnosed liver cancer patients are already at an advanced stage. For these intermediate orlate stage liver cancer patients, the therapeutic options are limited to palliative approaches using transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)orchemotherapeuticagents[ 3]. However, many patients are either not suitable for TACE or suffer from poor outcomes with conventional systemic cytotoxicchemotherapy[ 5].2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine A meta-analysis summarized the results of 193 ran- d o m i z e dc o n t r o l l e dt r i a l s( R C T s )o far a n g eo fm e d i c a lmodalities for HCC treatment reported during 2005-2010indexedbyMEDLINE,CANCERLIT,Embasedatabases,andtheCochraneLib rary[ 6].Fromthe32studiesthatmettheir inclusion criteria, only 17 studies were eventually selected based on the strength of the trials. Of these, one study used chemoembolization, three used tamoxifen hormonaltreatment,andafurtherthreeemployedsystemicchemother-apy treatment modalities such as doxorubicin and PIAF\u2014cisplatin/interferon alpha 2b/doxorubicin/fluorouracil. Theresearchers summarized the effects of all these treatmentmodalitiesforHCCinthecategoryof\"Nosurvivalbenefit.\" New conventional medicine treatment approaches for HCC now rely on molecular targeted therapies such asthe multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib. In a recent random-izedmulticenterplacebo-controlledphaseIIItrial,Sorafenibexhibited a benefit in advanced liver cancer patients byextendingoverallsurvival,butthiswasonlyby2to3monthscomparedwiththeplacebo[ 7].Thereforeinviewofthepoor clinical effectiveness of a broad range of medical modalitiesincluding the molecular targeted approach, new therapeuticagents with low cost and high effectiveness, such as herbalmedicines,areurgentlyneeded. Natural products represent a rich reservoir of poten- tial bioactive compounds exhibiting anticancer properties[8]. Several compounds have been found to have powerful antitumor effects, such as taxol, which was identified byscreening approximately 114,000 plant extracts and obtainedtherapeutic approval from the Food and Drug Administra- tion of the United States [ 9]. Although herbal medicines have been used in clinical applications for centuries, theirpresent use lacks stringent supporting scientific evidence interms of double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. Inaddition, since there are usually multiple compounds in asingle herb, the actual active compounds and their sites ofaction and mechanisms of action are generally unknown.The situation is further complicated by the use of herbalmedicines as a formula with multiple components [ 10-12], whichrepresentsa\"polychemical\"approachincontrasttothe\"single-chemical\"approachofclassicalchemotherapeutics. CHMhasbeenpracticedforcenturiesbylocalphysicians caring for a huge population in China and in East Asiaincluding Korea and Japan and has developed a compre-hensive set of well-documented medical theories. CHMusually requires the use of multiple herbs, minerals, or evencompounds derived from animal parts. In light of CHMtheory,managementofhealthcanbecharacterizedasholisticwith the emphasis on regulating the integrity of the humanbody functions and the interaction between various organsand the internal environment. Likewise, liver cancer is asystemic disease associated with a local tumor. Therefore,CHM therapies not only focus on eliminating the localmalignancy, but also aim to restore the homeostasis of the wholebody. This review focuses on the current understanding of CHM as a therapy for liver cancer and explores approachesfor its future development as an evidence-based comple-mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) for liver cancermanagement. Based on the premise that a successful CHM cancertreatmentwouldrequiretheclinicalefficacysubstan-tiated by clinical trials in humans, this review aims to firstpresentacriticalanalysisoftheclinicalstudiesandtherelatedpreclinical animal in vivostudies, followed by experimental in vitror e s u l t sw h i c hc a nh e l pt od e l i n e a t et h eu n d e r l y - ing mechanisms of action of CHM treatment. This review highlights some important lessons from critical analysis ofthe CHM anti-HCC research, including inadequacies in thereported clinical trials, possible CHM candidates for futureclinical trials, and quality control of CHM to ensure batch-to-batch consistency. These considerations may contributeto enhancing the development of an evidence-based cancerresearchplatformusingCHM. 2. Preclinical and Clinical Studies of CHM in Liver Cancer 2.1. Study Selection. An extensive search was performed in four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), China Biological Medicine database, and CNKI (Chinese Journal Full-Text Database for clinical trials and animal studies of CHM-based therapy) targeting restrictions wereimposed. In addition, the reference lists of recent reviews relatedtothistopicwereexamined. Theflowchartdemonstratingtheselectionprocessofthe systematic analysis is shown in Figure1.A ni n i t i a ls c r e e n of identified abstracts or titles was performed followed by athorough reading of selected full-text articles. Studies were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) the study design was a clinical trial or animal study; (2) the languageofpublicationwasEnglish;(3)themainexposureof interestwasCHM;(4)theoutcomeofinterestwastreatmenteffectsforlivercancer.Usingthepreviouscriteria,30clinical trials in the area of integrative CHM with western medicine for treating liver cancer reported in Chinese were excluded from this review [ 13] .Th i sr e v i e wf o c u s e do nt h ee v a l u a t i o n of four CHM formulas or extracts in human trials and fiverelatedpreclinicalanimalexperimentstargetinglivercancer. Weattemptedtocriticallyanalyzethereportsofuseofthese CHM extracts or formulas in clinical trials (216 liver cancer patientsintotal).Ameta-analysiswasnotperformedbecause ofthesmallnumberofidentifiedstudies. 2.2.

This simulation usedanovelintrahepatictunnelimplantationtoestablishthein situhepatoma. Compared to the murine tumor model, in which cancer cells are subcutaneously transplanted inimmune-deficientanimals,this insitutransplantationmodel is closer to the clinical situation of liver cancer. The resultsindicated that bufalin alone could inhibit growth, leading to tumors with a significantly smaller size ( 35.21\u00b112.51 cm 3) compared with those in ( addition to these effects, apoptosis was induced by bufalin which regulated the expression of an apoptosis-relatedgene,Bax,andtheratioofBcl-2/Bax.Apoptoticchar-acteristics such as cell shrinkage, cytoplasm concentration,andapoptoticcorpuscleswerealsodeterminedbyultrastruc-ture observation. These KanglaiteisanacetoneextractofCoixseed (Semen Coicis ) in clinical cancer therapy inChina.CHMtheorystatesthat SemenCoicis increasesthe energy of the body and reduces or eliminates nodes, as wellasbenefitingdigestivedisorders[ 21]. Effects of Kanglaite injection were investigated using rat models of transplanted Walker-256 hepatoma [ 15]. Forty hepatoma-bearing Wistar rats were treated with intratumorinjections of Kanglaite and compared with a control groupreceiving saline treatment. The hepatoma volumes of rats inthe Kanglaite group were significantly smaller than those in NS group (235.4mm 3versus 464.6mm3,<0.05 ). The t u m o ri n h i b i t o r yr a t ei nt h eK a n g l a i t eg r o u pw a s4 9 . 4 % , and the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, related tohepatic function, were significantly lower. Inhibition of pro-liferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression indicatedthat one of the antitumor mechanisms of Kanglaite could beinhibition of karyokinesis and propagation of cancer cells.The indicated that intratumor injection of Kanglaitecouldeffectivelyinhibithepatomainrats.Kanglaitewasalsoreportedtoinduce invitroapoptosisofHepG2cellsthrough theactivationoftheFas/FasLpathway[ 16].Althoughfurther studies of the mechanisms are needed, these findings havecontributed to the understanding of Banzhilian inCHM.AccordingtoCHMtheory,it can be used to eliminatetoxicity, promoteblood circulation,andreducetumornodes.Ithasbeenwidelyusedasatherapyfor cancers of the liver, lung, stomach, and breast, as wellas colorectal cancer [ 22]. In anin vivostudy of hepatoma investigating the antitumor effect (SB) SB, fluorouracil(5-FU), and NS. SB significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to use of NS (1.67\u00b10.76 g,2.65\u00b11.12 g, resp.; < 0.05 ). In addition, SB significantly improved the phagocytotic function of macrophages, which was analyzedbycomparingthechicken-redcellphagocyticrate,withboth5-FU and NS groups (<0.05). The phagocytotic function ofmacrophagescanreasonablyreflecttheantitumorimmunefunction. The study demonstrated the antitumor activityof SB in H22-bearing mice and suggested that a potentialmechanism was the improvement of immune function. Thisstudy also demonstrated that SB was able to inhibit theproliferation of H22 cells in vitroin a dose- and time- ofultrastructurerevealedapoptosisofH22cellsinducedbySB.Furtherdetailedinvestigationofthemechanismsinvolvedin theobservedantitumoreffectsofSBiswarranted. 2.2.4. PHY906. PHY906 is derived from the formulation known as Huang Qin Tang, which was first described inCHMdocumentsdatingapproximately1,800yearsagoandisusedforthetreatmentofvariousgastrointestinalsymptoms,includingdiarrhea,nausea,andvomiting[ 23].PHY906con- si Researchers from Yale investigated if use of PHY906 c o u l dr e d u c et h en o n h a e m a t o l o g i c a ls i d ee ff e c t so fc h e m -otherapy in particular GI problems. Surprisingly, in thepreclinical mouse cancer model, NCr-nude mice bearinghuman HepG2 tumor PHY906/CPT-11, PHY906/Capecitabine,PHY906/Doxorubicin, and PHY906/Thalidomide showedthat the integrated treatment not only greatly alleviated sideeffectsofthechemotherapy,butthatPHY906couldactuallypotentiate tumor inhibition in a significant way. However,t h en u d em i c eu s e di nt h em o d e lh a v el i m i t e dh o s tc e l l u l a restricted to targeting HCC but is alsoactive in other tumor models such as colorectal cancer andpancreatic cancer [ 27,30]. In summary, although PHY906 used alone had no significant effect on tumor weight loss, itcanworkasaneffectivebroad-spectrumadjuvanttoenhancethe chemotherapeutic efficacy of a variety of anticanceragents. In addition, other animal experiments of colorectal cancer indicated that PHY906 could reduce chemotherapy- induced toxicities by exhibiting anti-inflammatory effectsand promoting the regrowth of intestinal progenitor/stem cells [23,30] affecting the and antitu- 2.2.5. Ganfujian. Ganfujian is not toxic and m a yb eu s e da sd i e t o t h e r a p yf o rp r o l o n g e dp e r i o d s[ 31]. A preclinical study to investigate the inhibitory effect ofGanfujian granule on diethylnitrosamine- (DEN-) inducedhepatoma in SD rats involved the use of 165 rats with freeaccess to water containing 0.1g/L DEN for 16 weeks, whichwere assigned into two groups to receive either normal dietor Ganfujian, respectively [ 19]. Thirty rats from each group were sacrificed at week 20 to observe incidence rate of livercancer. Observation of the remaining animals continued to6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine determinesurvivaluntilweek28.Atweek20,all30ratsinthe normaldietgrouphaddevelopedlivercancer,incomparisonwith 24 of 30 rats in the Ganfujian group ( <0.05 ). The longest survival time of rats was 28 weeks in the Ganfujiangroup and 20 weeks in the control group ( <0.05 ). The results suggested that Ganfujian could reduce and delay the incidence of hepatoma in rats and prolong survival time of hepatoma-bearingrats.TheresearchersfoundthatGanfujiancould affect the cancer cell cycle by suppressing overexpres-sion of related modulators such as cyclin D1 and CDK4,which is a potential antitumor mechanism [ 19]. Ganfujian granuleisapromisinglivercancerchemicalpreventiveagent,withpotentialforclinicalapplication. 2.3. Clinical Trials. The selected articles included clinical trialsinvestigating4CHMextractsorformulasandinvolvinga total of 216 liver cancer patients. The CHM medicationstestedwereHuachansuinjection,Kanglaitecapsule,PHY906,andJinlongcapsule( Table 2). 2.3.1. Huachansu. Huachansu (Cinobufacini), which is a water extract of Bufo toad skin, is used in CHM to treatconditions including swelling, pain, and heart failure [ 32]. Huachansu is commercially prepared for injection and is widelyusedatoncologyclinicsinChina[ 33].Itisreportedto have good effects in eliminating toxicity, as well as relievingswelling and pain. An in vitropharmaceutical study of HuachansuconductedinChinaidentifiedbufalinasamajoranticancercomponentofHuachansu[ 34]. In a clinical trial of 11 HCC patients with stage III or IV diseasewhoreceivedHuachansuasasingleagent,6patientswerefoundtohavestablediseasewitharesponsedurationof5.5 months to 11.1 months [ 25]. One patient whose response lasted for 11.1 months had a 20% reduction in tumor mass.Patients with stable disease had improved quality of life asassessed by using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory(MDASI) scores. There were no drug-related toxicity greaterthangradeIIandnodose-limitingtoxicitiesreported.Therewas a dose-dependent increase in bufalin levels, with amaximum level of bufalin reached two hours after infusion.FurtherclinicalstudiesofHuachansuwithlargersamplesizesandincludingappropriatecontrolarmsareneeded.AnNIH-funded project on pancreatic cancer using Huachansu hasrecentlybeencompletedandthereportwillsoonbeavailable[35] .Th i sm a ys h e dl i g h to nt h em e c h a n i s mo fa c t i o no f clinicalefficacyofHuachansuonsolidtumors. 2.3.2. Kanglaite. Animal experiments with Kanglaite, an acetone extract of CHM Semen Coicis, were described in Section2.2 andTable 1. In a randomized controlled trial in China, 65 unresectable stage II or III HCC patientswere enrolled to receive either Kanglaite with TACE (30patients) or TACE alone (32 patients) [ 26]. The method of randomization was not disclosed, and it was unclearwhether the trial had used a blinded method to assessthe outcome. It was reported that three subjects withdrewbecause of financial problems. The response rates of tumorsin the combination group and the TACE group were 40%and 25%, respectively (>0.05 ). Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) combination group and the TACE groupwere 73.1% and 60.7% combined with TACE had a higher median timeto progression (TTP) (7.0 months) than TACE alone (5.5months) (<0.05). Compared with TACE alone, Kanglaite plus TACE improved immune function significantly by increasing the indexes of CD3 +,C D 4+,a n dC D 4+/CD8+ (<0.05 ). The TACE-induced adverse reaction of liver damage was less serious in the combination group thanthat in the TACE group. Further trials are needed withimprovedmethodologicalqualitysothatdefiniteconclusionson the clinical benefits of using Kanglaite in HCC can beassessed. 2.3.3. PHY906. To ensure reproducible clinical efficacy, the researchers first attempted to determine the batch-to-batchconsistency among different batches of PHY906 throughstrict quality control Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)productionmeasures[ 27].Theyintroducedacomprehensive technology platform termed \"PhytomicsQC,\" which is amultifaceted approach integrating chemical and biologicalfingerprinting. Together with a novel statistical analysis, theresearchersshowedthatPhytomicsQCwasusefultoevaluatedifferent batches of PHY906 and provide a robust platformtodeterminethebatch-to-batchconsistencyofthefour-herbCHM formula PHY906 effectively [ 18]. The researchers also suggested that in vivoanimal testing can be viewed as the ultimatequalitycontrolplatform,ifthereisadiscrepancyinthechemicalandbiologicalfingerprintingresults. The clinical trials of PHY906 not only demonstrated reduced chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity butalso reported an overall stronger protective effect of globaltoxicity [30]. Two open-labeled clinical studies of PHY906 with capecitabine were conducted in patients with unre-sectableHCC[ 28].ThefirststudywasaphaseI/IIstudywith 93%ofpatientsbeingenrolledintheUS,whereasthesecondstudywasaphaseIIstudyinTaiwan.ThephaseI/IItrialwasamulticenter,open-label,dose-escalation,safetyandefficacystudyofPHY906pluscapecitabine.Only3patientsfromtheTaiwan site were enrolled in the phase II study, and theseTaiwanese patients were excluded from the data analysis asthe enrollment criteria were slightly different from those forUSsubjects.Ofthe18USpatientsenrolledinaphaseItrialtodetermine a safe and tolerable dosing regimen, it was foundthatthecombinationofPHY906800mgbidandcapecitabine 750mg/m 2bidwaswelltolerated. Subsequently, 39 patients using the recommended dose were enrolled in a phase II trial to determine whetherPHY906 enhances the response rate of capecitabine, overallsurvival time (OS), time to disease progression (TTP), andqualityoflife(QoL)ofpatients.Oneofthemajorlimitationsof this trial is that there was no control arm for comparison.Thediseasecontrolratewas65.2%with8.7%havingamoder-ate response (MR) and 56.5% exhibiting stable disease (SD).The median TTP was 3.4 months and median OS was 9.2months.

Thesamestudyreportedthat,surprisingly,Asianpatients had a higher median OS (16.5 months) than non-Asianpatients (6.2 months) (=0.03 ). This significant survival benefitinAsianpatientsmaybeassociatedwiththeirgeneticphenotype of PHY906-sensitive, but further investigationwith a larger patient sample is needed.

Lessons Learned Evidence-based clinical efficacy is the most important keycriterion to be evaluated to establish whether CHM canbenefit liver cancer management. Ideally the Chinese herbs chosen should comply with Chinese medicine theory in aholisticway( Section3.1 ).Toensureconsistentdesirableclin- ical effects as well as safety and control of CHM preparations is crucial ( Section3.2 ). As most regimens require use of CHM together with other chemotherapeutic agents, herb-drug interaction is another key factor in evidence-based CHM cancer management(Section3.3 ). This section also geted, multidimensional features of CHM by highlightingthe related action and some possible activeingredients ( Section3.4 ). Other factors such as the ethical and regulatory issues of CHM products and the safe usageofhealthproductshavebeenaddressedbyotherreviews[ 37] andwillnotbefurtherdiscussedhere. 3.1. Nature of the Chosen CHM. Why did the researchers choosetheherbsdescribedearlierforpreclinicalandclinicalstudies? Generally, the reason for choice of herbs originatesfrom CHM theory. The herbs can be classified into severalgroups in terms of CHM thinking. Semen Coicis ,Rhizoma Dioscoreae ,G l y c y r r h i z au r a l e n s i sF i s c h ,P a e o n i al a c t i fl o r a Pall,a n dZiziphus jujube Mill belong to herbs thought to strengthen healthy Qi. In contrast, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi,Bufobufogargarizans Cantor,and Scutellariabarbate D. Donare Dumeril et Bibron ,Bungarus Parvus , andAgkistrodon reduce phlegm and soften hard solid mass. In the studies reviewed, herbs for strengthening healthyQi appear to modulate immunity or affect the process ofcancer cell cycle, while the heat-reducing and detoxifyingherbsmodulatedimmunityorinducedcancercellapoptosis.The anticancer mechanisms of herbs of reducing phlegmand softening hard solid mass were not reported in theanimal studies. Choice of herbs used should also be inaccordance with TCM Syndrome Differentiation, a theorythat involves the categorization of patients into differentpatternsofunbalancedhomeostasis,whichisavitalelement ofTCMpractice[ 38]. 3.2. Quality Control of CHM to Ensure Batch-to-Batch Con- sistency of Clinical Efficacy. Quality control is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of CHM [ 39]. Consistent CHMbatchpreparationisessentialforthereliabilityofclin-icalandpreclinicalstudies.However,manystudiesincluding some described in this review fail to mention the quality controlaspectsoftheCHMherbofinterestorthecombinedcomplex multiple-herb CHM formula. This is understand-able as CHM formulas may contain hundreds of differentcomponents. In addition, the majority of active ingredientsr e l a t e dt ot h ee ff e c t i v eu s eo fC H Mi nd i s e a s et r e a t m e n ta r ec u r r e n t l yu n k n o w n .Th u s ,t oc o n t r o lt h ep r o d u c t i o no fs u c hcomplex matrices of diverse compounds in single herb orherbalformulaewithpredictableclinicalefficacyisextremelydifficultorevennotpossible. Atpresent,identificationofthemajorcomponentsinthe CHM preparations is by means of an array of fingerprinttechnologies accredited by the World Health Organization8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine as evaluation tools [ 40]. These diffraction,and However, it should be noted thatmajor\"peaks\"or\"features\"maynothaveanyrelationshipwith the bioactivities or the desirable clinical effects of that particularherborformula. The studies of PHY906 highlight the use of \"Phytomic- sQC\" that integrates both chemical and biological finger-printing to evaluate different batches of PHY906 in orderto effectively provide a robust quality control platform ofbatch-to-batch consistency of the four-herb CHM formula[21]. Another approach advocated by Chau and his team was the use of \"Quantitative-Pattern-Activity-Relationship(QPAR) [ 42,43]. Using whole herbal medicines chromato- graphic/fingerprint profiles and their corresponding totalbiological activities as input, by means of sophisticatedchemometricscomputation,theQPARapproachcanbeusedto explore and exploit the relationship between the CHMwhole fingerprint profiles and their biological activities.Firstly, QPAR can reveal the important multiple features inthe chromatographic profiles responsible for the biologicalactivities, secondly, build a model for activities predictionsimplyusingthechemicalfingerprintingprofiles,andthirdly,discover the active ingredients of the HM by identifyingt h em u l t i p l eg e n u i n e\" a c t i v e \"r e g i o n so nt h ec h r o m a t o g r a m ,which are not necessarily the major components. In sum-mary, future clinical trials using CHM should consider useofeither\"QPAR\"or\"PhytomicsQC\"orsimilarplatformsforthequalitycontrolofthebatchtobatchconsistencytoensure reproducibleclinicalefficacy. Other than quality control issues mentioned earlier, a few other important areas also require stringent controland management in order to obtain excellent batch-to-batchconsistency.Theseareascomprisegoodmanufacturingprocess conditions for high standard production and goodagriculturalpracticetosafeguardstandardizedplantcultiva-tion. 3.3.Herb-ChemotherapeuticsInteractions. SinceCHMshave commonly been used in an integrative way with standardchemotherapeuticsincancermanagementprotocols,itisper-tinenttoinvestigateifanyherb-druginteractionisoccurring.From both the physicians' and patients' points of view, it isimportanttounderstandiftheCHMsaffectthepharmacoki- netics of the chemotherapeutic agent by reducing the level ofchemotherapeuticsinthepatients'bloodleadingtofailuretoprovideenoughdosageinsidethecancercells.Conversely,herb-druginteractionmayalsopotentiallyrelatetothedrugsafety, if the herb unexpectedly enhances absorption of thechemotherapeutic agent. For instance, in a clinical trial oflung cancer, an astragalus-based herbal formula, Jinfukang,was shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, withmost patients experiencing increase in docetaxel levels by atleast33%,althoughnocleartrendwasevident[ 44]. Currently, there are few reports describing this key aspect of herb-drug interaction. One study has addressedthe effects of PHY906 on the pharmacokinetics of CTP-11,capecitabine,gemcitabine,andsorafenibincolorectalcancer, HCC, and pancreatic cancer, respectively, in animal models[21].Importantly,resultsindicatedthatPHY906didnotaffect the metabolism of these chemotherapeutic agents or theircorresponding metabolites. However, it has to be noted thatthese findings were based on animal studies only, and it is therefore important that a similar approach should be adopted for human clinical trials. There is a clear need formore systematic coordinated herb-chemotherapeutic inter-action studies to provide an base Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory proposesCHMformulaemayprovideholistic,multitargeted,multidimensionalpharmacologicaltherapiesleadingtoeffec-tive cancer management. Accordingly, the mechanisms ofaction of CHM for liver cancer are also likely to be multi-factorial. As shown in Tables 1and2,t h ep o t e n t i a lm e c h a - nismsofactionincludeanti-inflammation,antiangiogenesis,antivirus,apoptosis-induction,cellcyclearrest,modificationoftumormicroenvironment,andimmune-modulation. Todate,relativelyfewstudieshaveexaminedthemecha- nisticeffectsofCHMontheimmuneresponse,andthespe-cifictargetproteinsortheunderlyingrelatedsignaltransduc-tionpathwaysaffectedbyCHMhavealsonotbeenaddressed.This may be due to the current poor understanding of theactualtargetsofthemultipleactivecompoundsoftheCHMresponsible for the clinical effects. A coordinated networkof laboratories collaborating to determine these effects isurgentlyneeded. Methodologies to approach these multitargeted, multi- dimensional pharmacological activities of CHM have been proposedbyseveralresearchgroups[ 45-47].Theseplatforms make use of recent advances in \"Omics\" bioinformatics,pharmacogenomics,andsystemsbiology,whichhaveallbeenfound to be useful for the analysis of diverse complex data[48]. Furthermore, as CHM targets the underlying disturbed homeostasis, studies concerning the mechanisms related tothe characteristics of TCM Syndrome Differentiation thatreflect the inner health status of the body should be con-ducted [49]. Recent reports discovering \"phenotypes\" based o nt h es y s t e m sb i o l o g ya p p r o a c hm a yb et h eb e g i n n i n go fanew frontier of scientific research into this important aspectof TCM Syndrome Differentiation [ 50,51]. A sophisticated and fuller understanding of Syndrome Differentiation maylead to TCM-based personalized treatment strategies forHCC CHM or integrative treatment, or it may provide therationale for patient stratification of groupings with similarhomeostasisimbalancesforinterpretationofclinicaltrials. 4. Discussion ThisreviewfocusedonsomeCHMtherapiesreportedtohavesignificant effects for liver cancer. These therapies have notyetgainedwideacceptanceaspartofintegrativelivercancermanagement.Theexplanationforthisismultifaceted.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 First, many publications of the use of CHMs in liver cancermanagementarewritteninChinese;ofthe139articlesexcluded from this review, 85 were rejected due to thislanguage criterion. These papers could potentially includeusefulinformation;however,theymaysufferfromthesevereinadequacy of lack of independent assessment for veracity andreproducibilitybywesternscientists[ 52]. Second, this review highlights preclinical studies using variouslaboratoryexperimentalplatformsandanimalcancerstudies, which are important for providing evidence of theefficacyandmodeofactionofCHMsinlivercancerclinicaltrials. This approach illustrates the potential of reverse-translationalresearch.Laboratoryexperimentalplatformsareused to study the mechanisms of action and the potential\"active ingredients\" in the CHMs in relation to the effectiveclinical trials results. Such knowledge can lead to modifi-cations of treatment and assist in the quality control of theCHM using defined amounts of those \"active ingredients.\"This knowledge can then be applied to the patients, leadingtoimprovementandconsistencyofbothclinicalefficacyandsafety. Third, although some of the clinical studies included in this review suffered from problems of study design or otherquality issues, they nevertheless provide credible evidencesuggesting effectiveness of some selected CHMs. Furthertrials ensuring high quality control of production of CHMagents to reduce the batch-to-batch variations and rigor-ouslydesignedrandomized,controlled,multicentretrialsarerequired. In this review, most clinical studies examined the effec- tiveness of CHM therapies for liver cancer. In TCM, the medicines are prescribed according to syndrome. SyndromedifferentiationremainstheessenceofCHMtreatmentandisthekey toevaluatinga patient'sdiseasestateanddevelopinganefficient,individualizedtreatmentstrategy.Therefore,syn-drome differentiation should be applied to the treatment oflivercancerbyCHM,possiblyusingapersonalizedtreatmentplanorasetofplansforafewdefinedsyndromeprofiles.WebelievethattheapplicationofTCMsyndromedifferentiationto disease diagnosis can yield improved therapeutic efficacy.We also envision that TCM syndrome will be able to beassessedbymoderntechnologiesinthefuture.Thediagnosisand efficacy of CHM therapies for liver cancer can then beevaluatedonamolecularandSystemsbiologybasis. 5. Conclusions In this study, we systematically reviewed some CHMs forthetreatmentoflivercancer.WefirstsummarizedtheCHMextracts or formulas in preclinical studies and clinical trialsand evaluated these studies with focus on the mechanismsof action and TCM theory.

Metastasis remains the most deadly aspect of cancer and still evades direct treatment. Thus, there is a great need to develop new treatment regimens to suppress tumor cells that have escaped surgical removal or that may have already disseminated. We have found that tetrandrine (TET) exhibits anticolon cancer activity. Here, we investigate the inhibition effect of TET to breast cancermetastasis, angiogenesis and it s molecular basis underlying TET's anticancer activity. We compare TET with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin in 4T1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice model and find that TET an anticancer metastatic and antiangiogenic activitiesbetterthanthoseofdoxorubicin.ThelungmetastaticsitesweredecreasedbyTET,whichisconfirmedbybioluminescenceimaginginvivo.Ontheotherhand,laserdopplerperfusionimaging(LDI)wasusedformeasuringthebloodflowoftumorin4T1- tumorbearingmice.Asaresult,thelocalbloodperfusionoftumorwasmarkedlydecreasedbyTETafter3weeks.Mechanistically angiogenicrelatedproteins,includingvascularendothelialgrowthfactor,hypoxia-induciblefactor-1 ,integrin5,endothelialcell specificmolecule-1,andintercellularadhesionmolecule-1 ) oftheMenispermaceae,isabioactivealkaloidwithamolec- ular weight of 622.76g/mol. Many reports indicated that TET exhibits very broad pharmacological actions, includingimmunomodulating, antihepatofibrogenetic, antiinflamma-tory,antiarrhythmic,antiportalhypertension,anticancer,andneuroprotective activities [ 1]. The beneficial effects of TET on tumor cell cytotoxicity and radiosensitization, multidrugresistance, normal tissue radioprotection, and angiogenesisare most promising and deserve great attention [ 2,3]. Several investigations indicated that TET generally presentsits anticancer effects in the micromolar concentrations onclone,leukemia,bladder,hepatoma,andlungcancer in vitro [4-8]. Inourpreviousresearch,wehavefoundthatTETexhibits significant anticancer activity in colon cancer line HCT116. Mechanistically,theinhibitoryeffectofTEToncoloncancer cells may be at least in part mediated by targeting -catenin activity, and the sensitivity of cancer cells to TET may bedeterminedbythefunctionalstatusof -catenin[ 9]. Nevertheless, with the development of clinical surgical treatment, the growth of primary tumor was no longer the critical element influencing the overall survival in cancer patients. Prevention of metastasis and more effective treat- ment of cancer metastasis are necessary for cancer therapy. Thus,antimetastasistherapythattargetstumorcellsescaped2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine surgical removal or already disseminated, and tumor angio- genicprocesshasabetterchanceofsuccess.Althoughseveral rational lines of evidence support the application of TET as an anticancer metastatic agent [ 10], the cellular mechanisms underlying the antiangiogenic and antimetastatic effects of TETactivationintumorcellsremainelusive. In this study, we use a mouse model for stage IV breast cancer(4T1tumorbearingBALB/cmicemodel)forevaluat- ing the antimetastatic effect of TET in lower concentration (10mg/kg/d, which could not change the growth of tumormass). Meanwhile, laser Doppler imager (LDI) was used for measuringbloodperfusionofthetumorbearingarea,which could measure the local blood flow and vascular networkandreflecttheangiogenicactivityofthetumorbearingmice indirectly. Our results show that TET could significantly inhibit endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, adhesion, migra-tion, invasion, and tube formation by targeting angiogenic endothelial by interfering with the ERK pathway, leading to thesuppressionoftumormetastasisandtumorangiogenesis. 2.

TET Exhibits a Significant Growth-Inhibitory Effect inHUVECs. To assess the antiangiogenic property of TET in vitro, we examined the inhibitory effects of TET on cell viability in HUVECs using MTT assay and crystal violet staining. As shown in Figures 1(a) and1(b), TET (<10M) doesnothaveanyremarkableeffectonHUVECproliferation.However, TET can significantly inhibit cell viability at amuch higher concentration with a half-maximal inhibitionat 16.76M( b yM T Ta s s a y )o r2 9 . 3 1M (by crystal violet staining assay). To examine the possible mechanism behindT E T ' si n h i b i t i o ne ff e c to nH U V E C ' sp r o l i f e r a t i o n ,w ep e r -formed cell cycle analysis by FACS, and the result revealedthat when HUVECs were treated with TET for 24h, TET in10M induced a depletion of cells in the G 2-M phase, from 10.70% to 4.21%, and a concomitant accumulation of cells inS phase, from 34.17% to 38.35%. These data suggested thatTETcouldarrestendothelialcellproliferation.Furthermore, we examined the effects of TET on NF- B, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 expressions, and the results suggested that theinhibitionofTETinHUVECswasrelatedtotheupregulationofNF-BandsuppressionofthephosphorylationofERK1/2. 3.2.TETInhibitsCellAdhesion,CellMigration,andCellInva- sion of HUVECs. The antiadhesion ability of TET between 4T1 and HUVEC cells was investigated. As a result, TETcould and VEGF-induced was significantly suppressed by TET ( Figure2(b) ). The migratory distance of HUVEC was significantly decreasedby 10MTET-containedmediumwhencomparedtothatof control (<0.01 ). We further tested whether TET affect chemotactic HUVECs invasion. Using the Boydenchamber transwell assay, we found that when HUVECswere treated with 10M TET the numbers of migrated cells across the extracellular matrix protein-coated membranessignificantlydecreased( Figure2(c) ).Quantitatively,TETwas shown to inhibit the numbers of migrated HCT116 cells byapproximately33%overthatofthecontroltreatment. Notably, this inhibitory effect of TET on EC invasion waspotentiallyrelatedtotheactivityofproteinases(MMPs). To determine the effect of TET on the production of pro-teinasesbyHUVEC,culturesupernatantswerecollectedandsubjected to gelatin zymography. As shown in Figure2(d) , the presence of proteinases (MMPs) digested the gelatin-containing gel and resulted in a clear band at 66kDa, whichwas assigned to MMP-2, and TET reduced secreted MMP-2 in a dose-dependent mannerwhichcorrespondedtotheinhibitionofECinvasion.

These results have demonstrated thatTET can effectively inhibit EC adhesion, migration, andinvasion through mechanisms of changing the integrin 5, ESM-1,andICAM-1expressions. 3.3. TET Inhibits Tubeformation of HUVECs. The effect of TET on the capillary tube formation of ECs was examined.IntheabsenceofVEGF,therewasnotubenetworkstructurein ECs, whereas the addition of VEGF (20ng/mL, positivecontrol) induced the formation of tube or cordlike structureand tube network on GFR matrigel.

(b) Crystal violet assay. HUVECs were treated with TET at the indicated concentrations for 24h. The cells were subjected to crystal violet assay as described in Section2. (c) Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distribution of HUVECs was analyzed by flowcytometry. Cells were treated with 1 MT E in Mouse Breast TumorModel. Wenextinvestigatedthe invivoantimetastatic activity of TET using a mouse breast cancer model. Briefly,exponentiallygrowingfireflyluciferase-tagged4T1cellswereinjected into the MFP of BALB/c mice, and TET was orallyadministered (10mg/kg body weight, once every two days).Asshownin Figure4(a) ,theDoxandTETtreatmentgroups exhibited significantly decreased Xenogen imaging signal inlung, when compared with the control group four weeksafter treatment. At sacrifice, lung metastases were counted.I nk e e p i n gw i t ht h e in vitrodata, the number of metastasis sites on the lung surface was remarkably decreased by TET,from 6.2 to 2.6 for each mouse, rather than that of Doxtreatedmouse(Figures 4(b)and4(c)).Moreover,histological analysis (H & E staining) indicated that TET treatment group exhibited a decreased metastatic tumor mass in lung(Figure4(d) ). 3.5.

These results demonstrated that TET is a potent inhibitor ofvascularizationandangiogenesis. We sought to further investigate the mechanism behind the TET mediated inhibition of angiogenesis activity.

Lastly, to investigate the blood perfusion change of TET treated tumor bearing mice in tumor surface andskin around tumor area, we took advantage of the laserDoppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) to measure the localperfusion pattern. In the LDPI, the related perfusion of themice abdomen was decreased after tumor being implantedfor 3 weeks, especially the tumor site ( Figure6(a) ). The related perfusion of tumor site (Flux 1) in TET groupwas decreased to 49% lower than that in healthy mice,but with no difference from that of the model group. Itsuggested that TET could slightly improve the necrosisof tumor 4 weeks after TET administration ( Figure6(b) ). However, the related perfusion around tumor site (Flux 2)in TET group was significantly decreased to 82.54% of themodel group (<0.05 ), which indicated that TET markedlydecreasethelocalbloodperfusionoftumor3weeksafterTETadministration( Figure6(c) )andsuggestedthatthe tumorangiogenesiswassuppressedbyTETtreatment. Taken together, these in vivoresults strongly suggest that TET may inhibit the tumor metastasis of breast cancer, possiblybyreducingangiogenesisactivityandrelatedproteinlevel of breast cancer cells, although further investigation isrequired. 4.

TET has been shown to exhibit anticancer activity in many in vivomodels [ 5,9,10]. TET-treated mice (10mg/kg/day) have fewer metastases than vehicle treated mice, and no acute toxicity or obvious body weight changes [23].RecentstudiesshowedthatTETinducescellcyclearrest and also induces apoptosis in many human cancer cells. In our previous study, we found that inhibition of Wnt/beta- catenin signaling might contribute to the anticancer also participate in TET's anticancer activity. (GSK- 3), generation [5,24-29]. As mentioned previously, TET exhibits significant anti- cancer activity both in vitroandin vivo,a sw e l la si t s inhibitoryeffectontumormetastasisandangiogenesis.Chen et al. found that TET inhibits the expression of VEGF in glioma cells, has cytotoxic effect on ECV304 HUVECs, and suppresses in vivoangiogenesis in rat [ 10]. However, the tumor related angiosuppressive property of TET and themolecularmechanismthatunderliesitsactivityarenotfully understood.

Results from the present study demonstrated that TET exerted inhibitory effect on proliferation, adhesion, andcapillary tube formation of ECs in a dose-dependent man-ner. Interestingly, the blood perfusion of the periphery oftumors was significantly reduced by TET treatment. Owingto that the blood perfusion is usually proportional to thebody's blood vessels density [ 30], this result implied that the antimetastasis effect of TET was passably related to theangiosuppressive activity. Similar cases were also observedin the tumor mass of TET treated 4T1-tumor bearing mice. TET was found to effectively suppress the formation ofmicrovesselsintumor.Furthermore,sincetubeformationofHUVECinvolvesECattachment,migration,andproductionof ECM degrading enzymes, data in the presented paperindicated that all these steps were interfered by TET andresultedintheattenuationofangiogenesis invitroandinvivo. Thus, TET may be useful in cancer metastasis by acting as aspecificandeffectiveangiosuppressiveagent.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 TT TNormal Ctrl TET Dox (a) the molecular mechanism underlying theantivascularizationactivityofTETinbreastcancer.TETtreated group exhibited a decreased level of VEGF, HIF-1 invivoresultsstronglysuggestthattheinhibitory effect of TET on breast cancer metastasis may be at leastin part mediated by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis factors(VEGFandHIF-1)orregulatingadhesionfactors(Integrin 5, ESM-1, and ICAM-1), although further investigation and is the hypoxic pathway. Aswe know, HIF-1binds to HREs and induces subsequent expression of genes encoding angiogenic factors, such asVEGF and MMPs, leading to angiogenesis [ 31]. TET could reduce the expression of HIF-1 a n dt h e nd e c r e a s eV E G F level and MMPs activity. It is generally believed that VEGFcould activate ECs; activated ECs produce many types ofenzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that break down the stroma and ECM proteins [ 32].

Recently, several research groups have tried to iden- tify cell adhesion suppressors which could inhibit cancermetastasis by blocking the lodging in blood vessels in the distant organs of disseminated cancer cells or cell clusters[33]. Integrins are important mediators of the malignant phenotype during oncogenic transformation [ 34]. Breast carcinoma cells express high levels of integrin 5. Bianchi- Smiraglia et al. indicated that cells deficient in integrin 5 have lower migration and proliferative capacities, and ERKsignaling pathway plays an important role in the functionof integrin5i nc a n c e r[ 35]. Our results show that the expression of integrin5 was decreased by TET treatmentEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 11 accompanied by a reduced phosphorylated-ERK level. On the other hand, the adhesion factor ESM-1, whichcould inhibit leukocyte adhesion and migration throught h ee n d o t h e l i u m ,w a si n c r e a s e di nt i s s u ea n ds e r u mf r o mcolorectal cancer patients and ESM-1 silencing decreasedcell survival, migration, and invasion and modulated cell cycle progression in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 36,37]. We notified that TET also decreases ESM-1 expression in breastcancer cells, which leads to an inhibition effect of tumormetastasis. Taken together, TET suppressed the integrin 5 andESM-1expressions,thendepressedtheactivationofERK,andregulatedcellularproliferation,adhesion,andsurvivalinECs. Another important adhesive factor involved in TET's angiosuppressiveeffectisICAM-1;severalresearchesshowedthat ICAM-1 synthesis in ECs is regulated by activation ofp38 and NF-B[38,39], and ICAM-1 could induce cell adhesion ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways [ 40,41]. OurIHCresultspresentanupregulationofICAM-1intumortissue, along with the increasing of NF- B, and suggested that the promotion effect of TET on NF- Ba n dI C A M - 1 expressions is closely related to its antiangiogenesis effects.T a k e nt o g e t h e r ,a ss h o w ni n Figure7, our studies indicate that TET is a potential inhibitor of tumor angiogenesisand metastasis by targeting the angiogenesis Project (no. 2012E10002), andt h eI n n o v a t i o nG r o u pP r o j e c to fZ h e j i a n gC h i n e s eM e d i c a lUniversity.References [ 1 ]J .J .L u ,J .L .B a o ,X .P .C h e n ,M .H u a n g ,a n dY .T .W a n g , \"Alkaloidsisolatedfromnaturalherbsastheanticanceragents,\"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine ,v o l . 2012,ArticleID485042,12pages,2012.

Introduction With the increasing numbers of patients with cancer and cancer survivors and the development of multidisciplinarycancer therapy, treatment that considers the quality oflife (QOL) of patients together with prognostic improve-ment is demanded. Multidisciplinary cancer therapy con-sists of surgical treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.Chemotherapy often causes side effects such as myelosup-pression, digestive symptoms, renal failure, or peripheralneuropathy. Cancer chemotherapy-induced peripheral neu-ropathy(CIPN)isoneofthemostseriousproblemsinclinical practice, and it sometimes results in the discontinuation of subsequent treatment [ 1,2]. CIPN is well known in taxanes, platinum analogues, Neuropathy by taxanes stems from damage to microtubules of the neuraxis, mainly devel-oping from gloves-and-socks type sensory disturbance [ 4].Platinumanaloguessuchascisplatinandoxaliplatindamage n e r v ec e l l sd i r e c t l y ,f o l l o w e db yd a m a g et ot h en e u r a x i s[ 5]. Moreover, with oxaliplatin, acute anticonvulsants (carbamazepine) tricyclic antidepressants, alpha-lipoic acid,andopioidsareoftenused[ required to preventtheexacerbationofsymptoms.Specificandeffectivecurativetreatmentsarelacking. Acupunctureisafrequentlyusedalternativeandcomple- mentary medicine in Japan. Contact needle therapy (CNT) is one of the traditional Japanese methods of acupuncture, w h i c hw a st h o u g h tu pb yB u n k e iO n o .W eu s ed i s p o s a b l eneedle and do not insert at all but only settle the needle on2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine the acupuncture point to perform the least but effective stimulus to unblock the meridian. The aim of CNT is toimprovethepatients'conditionnomatterwhattheirdiseasesare by regulating the flow of Qi. This method has manyadvantagessuchthatitissafe,painless,easytoperform,anditdecreasestheriskofinfection. From ancient times, it has been said that the larger the needle is and the deeper the needle is inserted, the strongerthe stimulation will be. If the stimulation is too strong, thepatients' condition becomes worse, especially when theirconstitution is weak. CNT is known as a method of weakstimulation. In this aspect, CNT is effective and appropriatefor treating cancer patients. It is also expected to relievesymptomssuchasthesideeffectsofchemotherapyinseveralclinicalreportsinJapanese[ 8]. R e c e n t l y ,c l i n i c a lt r i a l so fa c u p u n c t u r ef o rp r e v e n t i o no r treatmentofCIPNhavebeenconducted[ 9].Publicationsin English language journals on acupuncture as a symptomatictreatment for CIPN have been limited to only a few casestudies, all of which report an improvement in symptoms[10-13]. But there is no report of CNT and it has never been clinically evaluated in English publications, because CNTmayhavebeenconsideredasplaceboacupuncture. Inthisstudy,weinvestigatedwhetherCNThadbeneficial effectsinpatientswithCIPNafterorduringchemotherapy. 2. Patients and Methods 2.1.PreliminaryStudy 2.1.1.Patients. BetweenJuly2012andJanuary2013,acupunc- ture treatment was offered to all the patients who werediagnosed to have CIPN by surgeons in Japanese Red Cross Kanazawa Hospital. Seven patients agreed to receive acupuncture treatment, CNT. We excluded 1 patient whoseCIPN had been partially caused by uncontrolled diabetesmellitusfromthisstudy.Therefore,weevaluatedsixpatientswith CIPN. We checked the patients' background (age, sex,andcancertypes)andcontentsofchemotherapy.Sixpatients(four men and two women) of mean age 64.3 years receivedthebestmedicalcareandadditionallyweretreatedwithCNTforCIPN.Thetypesofcancerwereonecaseofbreastcancerand5casesofcolorectalcancer. 2.1.2.

It is commonlyassociated with a decrease in reflection, vibratory sensation,muscle ache, and muscle weakness [ 4]. Platinum analogues such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin damage nerve cells directly,followed by damage to the neuraxis. With oxaliplatin, acuteaccumulation-relateddisorderisdetected,andacuteperiph-eral neuropathy is induced by a low-temperature stimulusthatisknowntobereinforced[ 6].

In 4patients who stopped chemotherapy, CNT was effective onperipheral neuropathy even 2 years after last chemotherapy.CIP Nma ys po n ta n eo us l ydisa p pea ro v ertim einso m ecases[16] and in some patients in our study as well, but it will be difficult while undergoing the responsible chemotherapy, as well as after more than one year. Patient 5 demonstratedremarkable improvement in pain, numbness, breakout pain,anddiscomfortofhislegs. Althoughseveralprospectiveclinicaltrialshaveindicated acupuncture to be effective in painful diabetic neuropathy(PDN)andhuman-immunodeficiency-virus-(HIV-)relatedpainful neuropathy [ 17-20], no known clinical trials have investigated the intriguing potential of acupuncture for therelief of breakout pain in CIPN, which has a dominantposition among side effects. Various treatments have beentried, but few of them have demonstrated sufficient effectsso far. In the present study, the usefulness of CNT for CIPNbyexperiencedspecialist,includingtheadvantageofmakingadjustments to acupuncture point according to the patients'sho and safety of CNT compared with inserted acupuncturemethods, is suggested. Several studies [ 17-20] have demon- stratedthatacupunctureiseffectiveinthetreatmentofCIPN,withfeweradverseeffectsthananalgesicdrugs. From a perspective of Japanese traditional medicine, acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patternsof qi flowing throughout the body, and blockage of qi leadstoillness.Qiisdefinedasakindofvitalenergythatisimma-terial or invisible in narrow definition and is simultaneously both immaterial and material in wide definition. From the scientific point of view, the proposed putative mechanismsof acupuncture involve regulation of the nervous system,stimulation of the immune system and alteration of brainchemistry causing the release of various neurotransmittersand hormones. Some evidence has shown that acupunctureis a safe pain-control method with minimal side effects, andinterest in acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy has grownr a p i d l yi nr e c e n ty e a r sa m o n gt h eg e n e r a lp u b l i ca sw e l la sthescientificandacademiccommunities. Several human and animal studies have examined the neurochemical basis of acupuncture for pain control, andalthough no single theory is sufficient to completely explainall the effects of acupuncture, the mechanisms can be partlyexplained in terms of endogenous pain inhibitory systems.Acupuncture excites receptors or produces rhythmic dis-charges in nerve fibers activating both the peripheral andcentral nervous systems, resulting in the release of variousneurotransmitters [ 21-24]. The exact effects of acupuncture dependonpointselectionandtypeofstimulation[ 25]. Serotonergicpathwayshavebeenimplicatedinpainrelief a n dh a v eb e e nu s e f u li nr e l i e v i n gd i s c o m f o r ti nn e u r o p a t h y[26].Thus,ithasbeen hypothesizedthatacupuncturemight work synergistically with serotonergic therapy to the vasa nervorum and dependent capillarybeds supplying the neurons may contribute to nerve repairwithmeasurableimprovementofaxonsormyelinsheaths.In addition, the symptomatic effect of acupuncture may reflectmorphological changes in the anatomy of peripheral nervesand also complex derangements of central and peripheralregulation [ 28]. It is not certain whether CNT has the same effect as inserted acupuncture, but those findings in acupuncture give us some suggestion on the mechanism of effectofCNT. The reason that quite a few randomised controlled tri- als of acupuncture failed to show the significant effects ispartially because of the real effect of no-insertion acupunc-ture. For example, a randomised controlled trial comparedacupuncture and amitriptyline with their respective placebocontrols showing that the sham device had greater effectsthan the placebo pill on self-reported pain and severity ofs y m p t o m so v e rt h ee n t i r ec o u r s eo ft r e a t m e n t[ 29]. In this study, we showed the effect of \"placebo\" acupuncture, CNT.It might be better to reconsider the method of \"placebo\"acupunctureinthedesignofrandomisedcontrolledtrials. In this investigation, it is difficult to evaluate everything because of the small study population. We did not evaluatethe efficacy after cessation of CNT. It is said that the effectof CNT continues about a week and the accumulative effectis reported in some other researches on acupuncture, so asin this study group. It should be investigated in our nextr e s e a r c h .H o w e v e r ,w et h i n kt h a tt h ep o t e n t i a lo fC N Tf o rCIPN was clearly indicated. Another shortcoming of thisstudyistheremarkableeffectofCNTforpainbreakthrough.ThebenefitoftheapplicationofCNTbyspecialistsforCIPNwassuggestedforthefirsttimeinthisstudy. 5. Conclusion There are few standard therapies for CIPN, a conditionthat often leads to discontinuation of chemotherapy and todeteriorationofthesubsequentQOL.CNTmayimprovethesymptoms of CIPN and associated side effects during thecourse of chemotherapy and even after a long interval sincethe last chemotherapy. CNT might be considered as one ofthesafeandeffectivealternativemethodsforCIPN.

Introduction Therootbarkof Morusalba L.(Moraceae;whitemulberry)is usedforitsdiuretic,antitussive,antidiabetic,andantipyretic medicine [ Therefore, Morus speciesplantshavebeenintensivelystudiedfromphytochem- ical point of view, and bioactive compounds of flavonoidcharacter have been isolated. Within the flavonoid classof natural products, the prenylated subclass is quite rich in structural variety and pharmacological Com-poundsobtainedfrom M.albaL.possessanti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and hepatoprotectiveactivities [ 2-6]. Extracts obtained from M. alba L. were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against various tumor cells,such as K-562, B380 human leukemia cells, and B16 mousemelanoma cells [ 7]. Several studies have been published in2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine which bioactive compounds isolated from white mulberry exerted potent effect on human cancer cell lines. Morusin,one of the most efficient substances, showed strong activityagainst cervical carcinoma HeLa, breast between inflammation and cancer can be thought of as consisting of two pathways: an extrinsicmechanism,whereaconstantinflammatorystatecontributesto increased cancer risk (such as in an inflammatory boweldisease),andanintrinsicmechanism,whereacquiredgeneticalterations (such as activation of oncogenes) trigger tumordevelopment [ 11]. The NF-B signaling plays crucial roles in both precancerous chronic inflammation as well as cancerinducedinflammation.Anactivationofthispathwayinducesexpression of inflammatory cytokines, in normal human fibroblastsandfivehumancancercelllines[ 14].Furthermore, we clarified the underlying molecular mechanisms mediat-ing the effects of geranylated flavanone tomentodiplaconeBo nc e l lg r o w t h[ 15]. We showed that tomentodiplacone B induced accumulation of human monocytic leukaemia(THP-1) cells in G1 phase of cell cycle, which was in concertwith the cyclin E1 isoform and cyclin A2levels,reducedCDK2activity,andreducedpRbphosphoryla-tion[15].Ourmostrecentworkfocusingonprenylflavonoid B, which is contained in large amounts in therootsofwhitemulberry,showedunusuallypronouncedanti-inflammatory properties of this compound [ 2].

These compounds are poorly soluble in water; therefore, fresh10mMstocksolutionsindimethylsulfoxide(DMSO)(Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were prepared 1 day prior to experiments and stored at 20 C. These solutions were further diluted in the culture media to the desired finalconcentrations. RPMI 1640, obtained from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Fixed cells were washed three times in PBS (pH7.4)andincubatedwithRNaseA(0.02mg/mL)(Boehringer,Ingelheim, Germany) for 30min at 37 C. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (40 g/mL) and analysed by flow Coulter CytomicsFC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, containing20%glyceroland1%SDS.Proteinconcentrationsweredeter-mined using the and-mercaptoethanol SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis(PAGE),electrotransferredontoPVDFmem-branes (Millipore, dissolved in DMSO to obtainfinalconcentrationsof10M(thisconcentrationlackedcyto- toxic effect). For comparison with conventional drugs, 1 M prednisone dissolved in DMSO was used. Vehicle-treatedcells containeda vehicle (DMSO) in each well. The inflammatory responsewas triggeredby adding LPS dissolved in water (1 g/mL) to drug-pretreated macrophages, and cells were incubated for another 24h.

SCp2 cells were plated in a 24-well plate in density of 4 \u00d710 4cells/mL.

For comparisonwith conventional drugs, parthenolide (5 Md i s s o l v e di n DMSO) was used, because of its usual use as a control forthis type of cells and experiments and its well-known abilityto inhibit the expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9[20].Theinflammatoryresponsewastriggeredbyaddinga nontoxicdoseofLPS(10g/mL)tothedrug-pretreatedSCp2 cells,whichwerethenincubatedat37 Cforanother24h[ 21]. After this time period, medium was collected and the pro-MMP-2 and MMP-2 activity was measured by zymographyas described previously by Talhouk et al. [ 22]. Briefly, 20L of collected medium was loaded into polyacrylamide gelimpregnatedby0.1%gelatin.Afterelectrophoresis,SDSfrom gels was washed out by 2.5% Triton X-100, gels were incubated for 30min 23 C) and overnight(16-20h)at37Cindevelopingbuffer(50mMTris (pH8.8),5mMCaCl2,3mMN aN3,and0.5%TritonX-100). Gels were then stained by Coomassie blue [ 22]. Intensity of digested regions was determined by densitometry followedby calculation using AlphaEaseFC 4.0.0 software (AlphaInnotech, USA). It should be noted that the conditionedmedium contained active MMP-2, which represented 75.3%of measured activity. Therefore, this value was subtractedfromallobtainedresultsofMMP-2activity. 2.8.

To determine the effects of all three testedEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 substancesobtainedfrom M.albaontheviabilityandgrowth of human leukemia cells, the THP-1 cells were exposed for24htoincreasingconcentrations(1,2.5,5,10,20,and50 M) of1,2,and3,respectively,stainedforviability,andcountedby hemocytometer.Fromthisdata,theLD asLD50increasedasfollows: 1(>50M),3(45.7\u00b13.72),and 2(24.3\u00b12.41). To compare toxicity of MA compounds with already known chemical or natural substances, we assessedLD 50of activity as a readout following exposure toMAcompoundsfor24h,revealedthatproliferationofTHP-1cellswasinhibitedbyallthreetestedsubstances.AsshowninFigure1(c) ,s u b s t a n c e 2exhibited the strongest effect, as 10M and higher doses caused dose-dependent inhibition of THP-1 cell growth. The significant reductionof metabolicactivity (<0.05 ) was though observed in cells treated with each of the three flavonoids at concentrations of 20 M or higher. Based on cytotoxicity and proliferation data, theconcentrationrangeofMAcompoundsfrom5to30 Mwas selectedforallsubsequentexperiments. 3.2. Effects of 1,2,a n d3on Distribution of Cells in Cell Cycle Phases.Inordertoinvestigatetheeffectoftestedsubstances onthecellcycleprogression,weperformedcellcycleanalysisbased on DNA content using flow cytometry of THP-1cells. The data shown in Figures 2(a)-2(c) demonstrate that all compounds tested ( 1,2,a n d3) accumulate human leukemia cells in G1 phase dose-dependently after 24htreatment. While the percentage of S phase cells decreased,the percentage of cells with 4N DNA content, representingG2/M phase, was unchanged upon treatment with testedcompounds.Thiseffectwasdominantinsubstance 3,lasting evenafter72h(datanotshown). Since compound 2exerted the strongest impact on viability and proliferation, together with impact on the cellcycle profile of THP-1 cells (observed already from 10 M concentration),wehaveexpandedouranalysiswiththissub-stancetofurther3humancancercelllines( Figure2(e)).The inhibition of G1/S transition, accompanied by the decreasedproliferation caused by 2,w a so b s e r v e di na l lc a n c e rc e l l linesusedinthisexperiment(LAPC-4\u2014metastaticprostate,establishedfromlymphnodesinSCIDmice;PC3\u2014androgen receptornull,p53-null,metastatic(bone)prostatecancer;and DU145\u2014androgenreceptor,p53-mutated,metastatic(brain)prostatecancer).Toassesswhether 2affectsalsothecellcycle of human nontumorigenic cell line, we exposed the prostateepithelial BPH-1 cells, derived from the benign prostatichyperplasia,tothiscompound.Interestingly,thedistributionof BPH-1 cells in all three cell cycle phases remainedunchangedevenafterthetreatmentwithhighconcentrationsof2usedinthestudy(20and30M)(Figure2(e)).

The appearance ofthe G1 subpeak was increased at 24h after beginning the treatment with MA compounds, although with a differentintensity of this effect ( Figure2(d)). While 1exerted no G1 apoptosiswas model compound ( 36- and60-foldhigher,resp.,comparedtocontrol). 3.3. Expression of Cell Cycle Regulators in MA-Treated Cells. Based on the fact that all tested compounds cause accumu-lation of cells in G1 phase, we determined the expression andphosphorylationstatusofkeycellcycleandstress-related proteins. Phosphorylated Rb protein is the key regulatory molecule, which coordinates processes critical for G1/S pro-gression.WethereforeexaminedwhetherpRbphosphoryla- tionissuppressedinTHP-1cellstreatedbyMAcompounds. As shown in Figures 3(a)and3(c),2 4he x p o s u r et o2 0M 1or3results in reduced phosphorylation of Rb protein on serine 780. For 2this effect was even more pronounced (Figure3(b) ). Phosphorylation on serines 807/811 was also decreased in THP-1 cells exposed to MA compounds, in clearly dose- dependent manner (Figures 3(a)-3(c)). It is highly probable that MA-induced Rb dephosphorylationcorrespondstotheaccumulationofcellsinG1phase. Another protein involved in cell cycle machinery, which weanalyzedinMA-treatedcells,wasproliferatingcellnuclear a n t i g e n( P C N A ) .Th i sp r o t e i ni sw e l lk n o w na saD N Asliding clamp for DNA polymerase delta and as an essential component for eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication and repair [ 25]. All flavonoids tested downregulated the expressionofPCNAinTHP-1cells(Figures 3(a)-3(c)),again correspondingly to the observed decrease of cells in S phase ofthecellcycle. Cyclins A and B are members of the cyclin family, expression of which fluctuates during cell cycle progression p e a k i n gi nSa n dG 2p h a s e s ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .W ef o u n dt h a t none of the tested MA compounds affects the quantity oft h e s ec y c l i n s ,w h e nm e a s u r e di na s y n c h r o n o u s l yg r o w i n g cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 11, which normally peaks at M phase, remained unaffectedeven after 24h treatment with MA compounds. Unchanged phosphorylation of histone H3 with normal expression of cyclins A and B suggests that MA compounds do notinfluenceprogressionthroughG2andMphasesofcellcycle. Caspase 3-mediated PARP cleavage has been considered as a hallmark of apoptosis. It is also known that PARP activation is induced by DNA strand breaks [ 26]. Neither 1 nor3didcausePARPcleavage,andsoitsactivationinTHP-1 cells.

Behaviour of Inflammatory Response Markers in MA- Treated Cells. Protein TNF-together with other cytokines, such as interleukins, not only plays crucial role in theinflammatoryresponsebutalsoisinvolvedincarcinogenesis[13]. To investigate whether antiproliferative effects of MA compounds are accompanied by anti-inflammatory activ- ity, we assessed levels of selected inflammatory response markers secreted into the culture medium by LPS-activatedmacrophages derived from THP-1 cell line. As evident fromFigure4(a) ,L P S - i n d u c e dT N F -secretion by macrophages was reduced upon the treatmentwith MA compounds,sim-ilarly to prednisone used as the reference anti-inflammatorydrug. Notably, all three compounds tested were significantlymore effective than prednisone. Levels of IL-1 ,t h em o s t studied member of the IL-1 family [ 27], produced by THP- 1-derived macrophages were slightly decreased by testedsubstances, except for 3(Figure4(b) ). Treatment with this compound (10M) led to significant (<0.01 )i n c r e a s e of IL-1secreted to cell culture medium. The natural antagonist of IL-1is IL-1RA, and their mutual ratio is crucial for a progression of inflammation and maintainingahomeostasis.Alltestedflavonoids,similarlytoprednisone,significantlydecreasedthesecretionofIL-1RA( Figure4(c) ). was nonsignificant for com- pounds1,2, and prednisone. On the other hand, 4 -O- methylkuwanon E ( 3)i n c r e a s e dt h eI L - 1/IL-1RA ratio by the factor of 5.33. It is caused by enormously elevatedsecretion of IL-1.

Whereas PTL inhibits proteinase activity to the level typical for unstimulated cells,2was able to reduce the (pro-)MMP2 activity below these controlcells. 2uniquelyandsignificantlydecreasedthepro- MMP2/MMP2ratio( Figure5(b) ). 4. Discussion and Conclusions Relevance of the crosstalk between components of the immunesystemandcancercellsiswidelydiscussed.Duringthe last decade the clear evidence that inflammation plays a criticalroleintumorigenesishasbeenobtained,andsomeof underlyingmolecularmechanismshavebeenelucidated[ 28]. A role of inflammation in tumorigenesis is now generallyaccepted, and it has become evident that an inflammatorymicroenvironment is an essential component of all tumors,including some in which a direct causal relationship withinflammationisnotyetproven[ 11]. In the present study, we assessed cytotoxicity and effects of three -O- methylkuwanon E ( 3)o nc e l lcy c l ep r o g r e s s i o na n ds e l e c t e d cell cycle regulatory proteins. We have also extended ourstudywiththeaimofevaluatingtheeffectofthesesubstanceson proinflammatory markers, because we recently reported that2has potent anti-inflammatory properties in human macrophages [ 2]. Compounds are poorly soluble in water; therefore, we used DMSO as a solvent. The final DMSOconcentration of 0.5-1% is frequently employed in in vitro studies to solubilize/deliver bioactive compounds to cells. However, it has been shown that DMSO exhibits a myriad of biological actions, such as reported effects on cell cycle,differentiation,inflammatoryresponse,andapoptosisstudies[29-31]. Since our intention was focused on evaluation of these types of effects, it was necessary to take into accountthe effects of DMSO in arrangement of all conductedexperiments. In particular, the concentration of DMSO inexperiments never exceeded 0.1%. Moreover, to minimalizemisinterpretations of our results due to biological effectsof DMSO, we employed DMSO-only-treated THP-1 cells ascontrolsineachexperimentsetting.Basedonourpreviouslypublished we used human monocytic leukaemia cells THP-1 as a model system to detect cytotoxicand cytostatic effects of newly isolated natural compoundsandTHP-1-derivedmacrophagesforstudiesoninflammatoryresponse.Wefoundstrongantiproliferativeeffectsofallthreetested MA compounds in concentrations ranging from 10 to50M.WhencomparingthesedatawiththeLD 50values,we may conclude that unlike 2,b o t h1and3at concentrations of 20Ma n d30Mhadsignificantgrowthinhibitoryeffect without being cytotoxic to the cells. As regards substance2, we speculate that the observed reduction of metabolic activityismorelikelyasignofcelldyingratherthangrowthinhibition.

Our results showed thatall tested compoundscaused accumulation of THP-1 humanleukemia cells in G1 phase of cell cycle (and inhibited theirentry into the S phase) in a dose-dependent manner.

W h i l ei na l lt u m o rc e l l s 2exhibited inhibitory effect on the G1/S transition, in nontumor line (prostate epithelial BPH-1 cells) such activity was not observed. This might indicatea partially selective effect of this substance on tumor versusnontumorcells.Nevertheless,suchselectivityof 2wouldhave tobeverifiedbymoredetailedanalysis.

Cyclin A is required for cell to progress through theSphase,andcyclinBisnecessaryforcellstoentermitosisa n dd i v i d ei n t ot w od a u g h t e rc e l l s[ 32]. It is also known that activation of tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein(pRb)permitstranscriptionofkeyS-phase-promotinggenes, including some that are required for DNA replication. In contrast, dephosphorylation of pRb slows the progression ofcells into S phase [ 33]. None of the MA compounds tested were found to reduce, after 24h exposure, the expressionof cyclins A and B. This fact, together with the reducedpRbphosphorylationcausedbyallMAcompounds,possiblyindicates that these substances affect rather the G1/S thanG2/M transition. Flow cytometry data further support thishypothesis,sincesignificantaccumulationofcellsinG1attheexpense of S phase was observed upon the treatment withMA compounds. Since such cell cycle distortion could bemediated by stress response signaling pathways, their acti-vation was evaluated in THP-1 cells treated by all three MAflavonoids. In THP-1 cells stress-associated regulators suchp21, p27, and p53 proteins are not detectable [ 15]. Therefore, we focused on histones-H2AX (becomes phosphorylated on damaged DNA) and H3 (its phosphorylation on Thr11correlates with mitotic/meiotic chromosome condensation).Cells treated with any MA compound displayed no changesin phosphorylation of histone H3 on the given residue.ForH2AX we observed increased phosphorylation only in cells treated with 2at concentration of 20M, which is t h es a m ea ss u c hc a u s i n gc l e a v a g eo fc a s p a s e3a n dP A R P .Collectively,wespeculatethat 2exertsmodeofactionthatis different from that of 1and3.Co m po und 2seemstoinhibit proliferationviatriggeringthestress-relatedpathwayleadingtoRbdephosphorylationandapoptosiswithtypicalcleavage o fP A R Pa n dc a s p a s e3 .O nt h eo t h e rh a n d ,n oi n d u c t i o no fthe stress-related proteins occurs in 1-a n d3-treated cells, and1inalltestedconcentrationsclearlyaffectsPCNA,which facilitates and controls DNA replication, and is at the very heartofcell-cycleprogression.

The ability to cause dysfunc-tion of mitochondria by prooxidant effect is connected withpossible mechanisms of anticancer action, which may leadto apoptosis of tumor cells. Their antioxidant activity isconnected with direct scavenging effect of excessive reactiveoxygen/nitrogen species or with interaction with enzymesinvolvedintheirproductionorelimination.Interactionwithenzymes responsible for carcinogen activation can lead toprevention of tumor formation [ 37].

However, the standard treatment for patients with relapsed or metastatic AAV has not been established.We investigated the clinical feasibility of standardized allergen-removed Rhus verniciflua stokes (aRVS) extract for advanced or metastatic AAV. Patients and Methods . From July 2006 to April 2011, we retrospectively reviewed all patients with advanced AAV treated with aRVS extract alone. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 12 patients were eligible for the final analysis.We assessed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of these patients during the follow-up period. Results. The median aRVS administration period was 147.0 days (range: 72-601 days). The best tumor responses according to Response EvaluationCriteriainSolidTumorswereasfollows:twowithcompleteresponse,twowithstabledisease,andeightwithprogressivedisease. The median OS was 15.1 months (range: 4.9-25.1 months), and the median PFS was 3.0 months (range: 1.6-11.4 months). Adverse reactions to the aRVS treatment were mostly mild and self-limiting. Conclusions . Prolonged survival was observed in patientswithadvancedAAVunderthetreatmentofstandardizedaRVSextractwithoutsignificantadverseeffects. 1. Background Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (AAV) is a rare cancer representing about 6% of all periampullary tumors and only 0.2% of all gastrointestinal cancers [ 1,2]. From 1973 to 2005, 5,625 cases of AAV were reported in the USA, and the frequency of the disease has been increasing [ 3]. Furthermore, Asian-Pacific people have a higher incidenceofthiscancer,whereasAfricanAmericanmenhaveaslightly to tumors of the ampulla generally produce obstructivejaundiceearlierthantumorsinotherlocations[ 4-6].Ontheother hand, patients who relapse or present with metastatic AAV have a poor prognosis with a two-year overall survivalrateofabout10%[ 3].Thereisnostandardchemotherapeutic regimenforadvancedAAVpatientsandnostandardadjuvanttherapy after curative pancreaticoduodenectomy. Further, aconsiderable number of patients could not undergo aggres-sive chemotherapy or radiation therapy because of poorperformancestatusoradverseeffect[ 4]. Rhusverniciflua Stokes(RVS)oftheAnacardiaceaefam- ily, commonly known as the lacquer tree, was traditionallyused for treating diseases of the digestive system, includingt u m o r s ,i nK o r e aa n dC h i n ai nt h e1 5 t hc e n t u r y[ 7,8]. Several reports have been published on the clinical efficacyof RVS in stabilizing cancer progression or inducing tumorregression [ 9-14]. Many experimental studies have recently2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine shownthattheflavonoidsfromRVSorthewholeextracthave antiproliferativeandapoptoticactivitiesinhumancancercelllines[7,8,15-17].Here,wereportontheoutcomesofusinga standardizedextractfromRVS(aRVS)withoutconventionaltherapyregimensinpatientswithadvancedAAV. 2. Patients and Methods 2.1. Patients. All patients had advanced AAV and were treatedwiththestandardizedaRVSextractattheIntegrative CancerCenter,KyungHeeUniversityHospitalatGangdong (Seoul,RepublicofKorea)betweenJune1,2006andApril30,2011. We selected patients based on the following eligibility criteria: (1) histologically confirmed AAV, (2) radiological findingsshowingnonresectabilityofthetumorthatincludedevidence of distant metastasis, and (3) more than a day of standardized aRVS extract administration. Exclusion crite- ria included response evaluation not available after aRVStreatment and concurrent conventional treatment includingchemotherapy or radiotherapy during aRVS treatment. Allpatients signed a written informed consent form. Medi-cal records were retrospectively reviewed with particularattention to the initial history and physical examination,histopathologic findings, operative and postoperative treat-ments,andfollowup.Thisstudywasapprovedbytheinstitu-tionalreview board of the Kyung Hee University Hospital atGangdong(KHNMC-OH-IRB2011-12). 2.2. Standardized Extract of aRVS and Treatment Course. The clinical application of RVS has been limited becauseof an allergenic component, urushiol, which causes severecontactdermatitisinsensitiveindividuals[ 18-20].Therefore, urushiol, a mixture of several derivatives of catechol, mustbe removed from RVS prior to its pharmaceutical use. Astandardized extract of allergen-removed RVS (aRVS) wasmanufactured based on thorough historical research (fustin>13.0%,fisetin>2.0%,urushiolnotdetected).Thedailyoral administration of 1350mg (one 450-mg capsule, three timesaday)ofaRVSextractwasprescribed. 2.3. Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety. We identified 15 patientswithadvancedAAVwhowereconsecutivelytreatedwithaRVS.Threepatientswereexcludedbecauseofalackofresponse evaluation (=2) and concurrent radiotherapy (=1). We assessed the treatment outcomes of progression-free survival(PFS),overallsurvival(OS),andtoxicities.Progres- sion of radiological findings was determined according toResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

The baseline characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1.Th em e d i a na g ew a s 52years(range:36-73years),withalowBMI(medianBMI:20.3; range: 14.6-25.2). Ten (83.3%) patients had undergonesurgical resection of their primary tumor, and, of those, two(20.0%)hadreceivedadjuvanttreatment. Only three patients (25.0%) were chemotherapy na \u00a8ve because of advanced age, poor performance status, anxietyabout the toxicity of chemotherapy, or preference for herbalmedicine. Before starting aRVS treatment, nine patients(75.0%)hadreceivedpriorpalliativechemotherapy,andthreeofthosepatients(33.3%)hadreceivedsecondchemotherapyregimens.Allpatientshadprogressivediseaseduringorafterpriorchemotherapyexceptforonepatient(ID9). 3.2. Safety and Treatment Outcomes of the aRVS Extract. On March15,2012,ninepatientshadexpired,andtheremaining three patients were living. The median aRVS administrationperiodwas147.0days(range:72-601days).Overall,treatmentwas well tolerated, even in patients with a worse perfor-mancestatus.AlthoughhematologictoxicityrelatedtoaRVStreatmentwasnotobserved, nonhematologicadverse effectswere reported. One case of gastritis (Gr 2) and two casesof pruritus (Gr 1) were each observed in three patients. Thereportedgastritisdevelopedaftersurgery,andthesymptomswaxed and waned. The symptom of pruritis spontaneouslydiminished without reducing the dosage of aRVS. PatientsdiscontinuedaRVStreatmentbecauseofdiseaseprogression,notbecauseofadverseeffectsofaR V S.

The median OS was 15.1 months (range: 4.9-25.1months). The median PFS was 3.0 months (range: 1.6-11.4months). Patient 11 is 73 years old and was diagnosed with ade- nocarcinoma with invasive pancreas (pT3N0M0; IIA) inJune2010,followinganabnormalpresentationduringarou-tine underwent pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). Follow-up CT scans in February 2011 revealed newly developed peritoneal seedingand local tumor recurrence around the PPPD site. PET-CTwhole body scans confirmed multiple peritoneal metastases(Figure1(A)). The patient and her family refused palliative chemotherapy because of old age and poor performancestatus. For these reasons, the patient visited our hospitalto receive alternative therapy. The treatment plan did notinclude any orthodox therapies such as surgical operation,chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Only aRVS was admin-istrated since March 2011.

Discussion AAV represents a rare disease, and only a few prospectivestudies on the palliative treatment of AAV have been pub-lished [21,22]. Moreover, previous studies were small and focusedonsmallboweladenocarcinomahavingsignificantlybetter OS than AAV. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prospective randomized controlled study evaluating the benefit of palliative chemotherapy against AAV. There-fore, patients with advanced AAV are obliged to receivechemotherapybasedontheirphysician'spreference[ 4]. Recently, two clinical reports were published on the efficacy of chemotherapy in patientswith advanced relapsed/metastatic AAV. A phase II trial of capecitabine plus oxali-platin in 25 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of thesmall bowel and ampullary origin reported a median timeto progression (TTP) of 6.6 months and a median OS of15.5 months [ 21]. However, the study included patients with small bowel origin rather than AAV. The response rate wasactually33%inAAVcases,whichispoor,comparedtoarateof 61% in cases with small bowel origin. The retrospective data from another Korean hospital showed that first-linecisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in AAV resulted in a median TTP of 4.9 months and a median OS of 12.5 months [23]. These results are consistent with the outcomes of the current study because it was a retrospective review ofpatientsofthesameethnicitywithonlyAAV,notsmallboweladenocarcinoma. The median OS of 15.1 months in our study is compa- rable to the findings based from the other Korean hospital,although our sample size was smaller (12 patients versus 29patients). It should be noted that most patients (75.0%) inour study were refractory to the first or second regimen ofchemotherapyandthemediantimewas8.4monthsfromthedayofadvancedormetastaticstagediagnosistotheinitiationof aRVS treatment (Tables 1and2). The more conventional treatments were not available and recommended for themby oncologist because of disease progression or adverseeffect. Nonetheless, there were two cases (ID 8 and 11) out of 12 patients showing complete response after only aRVS treatment,whilethefront-linecisplatin-basedchemotherapydidnotresultinasinglecaseofcompleteresponseoutof29patients. The aRVS treatment was safe with over one year of a d m i n i s t r a t i o n( I D4 ,6 ,a n d8 ) ,a n dt h e r ew e r en oa R V Sdiscontinuationsrelatedtoadverseeffects.Hematologictoxi-citywasnotreported,andonlyminorgradenonhematologicadverse effects were reported in three patients. The resultsEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 also suggest that aRVS treatment could improve OS, in spite of a median PFS of only 3.0 months, which is supported byt h eo u t c o m e so fp a t i e n t si nt h i ss t u d y( I D2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,a n d6 ) .Therefore,theaRVStreatmentshouldnotbeevaluatedasthecytotoxicagentsfocusingontumorresponse. Biological studies on AAV have been difficult because there are only a few established cell lines and histological subtypesaremixedwitheitherpancreatobiliaryorintestinaldifferentiation[ 24,25].Therefore,thereisaneedforabetter understandingofthebiologyofAAVandtheidentificationofpotentialprognosticfactorsandclinicallyrelevantmoleculartargets for therapy. Up to now, several clinical reports havedemonstrated that the expression of death-promoting pro-teinssuchasBaxishighlycorrelatedwithsurvivalinpatientswith radically resected AAV, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is highly elevated in patients with AAV andstrongly associated with vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)expression[ 26-28]. The flavonoids are known to have significant anticancer properties as they induce apoptosis and inhibit COX-2[29]. A purified flavonoid fraction prepared from RVS has been shown to induce apoptosis in some cancer cell lines,while sparing normal cells [ 7,16]. A phenolic-rich fraction from RVS was reported to suppress inflammatory responsevia the NF-Ba n dJ N Kp a t 30]. been shown to downregulate COX-2 in cancercells and suppress cancer cell micrometastasis by inhibitingfibroblast formation [ 33,34]. It has been experimentally demonstratedthatthestandardizedaRVSextracthasantian-giogenic activities by inhibiting VEGF and an inhibitoryeffect on matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9a c t i v i t i e si nah u m a nfi b r o s a r c o m ac e l ll i n e[ 35,36]. The singlecomponentsuchasfustinorfisetinshowspoorresultscompared to the whole extract. Though the mechanism ofaction is not clear, the multifactorial synergistic interactionsamong unknown compounds in RVS are thought to blockAAVprogressionwithmajorbiologicallyactivecomponentssuchassulfuretin,fisetin,and/orbutein. Even though this study is limited by the rarity of the disease,ourresultsindicatethataRVSextractisbeneficialintumorresponseto somepatients(ID 6, 8, and11) previouslydescribed and could be applied as a salvage regimen oradjuvantagentagainstAAVintheselectedpatientsforwhomchemotherapy is not feasible. Therefore, we have tried tofind several markers in common among responders, basedon traditional medicine and modern science in the viewof personalized medicine. For example, the alterations of cytokines-related immune system or metabolites in urine and plasma are investigated before and after treatment. Wealsohopethatthisclinicaloutcomewouldstimulatedifferentinvestigation in natural products from conventional drugdiscoveryanddevelopmentbasedoncytotoxicity[ 14].Conflict of Interests Theauthorsdeclarethattheyhavenoconflictofinterests.
