ArgO-EMR emphasizes long-term fieldwork and local language competencies. It investigates the ways medical and religious knowledge and practice are embedded within their ecologies and histories. Eastern medicines and religions have family resemblances; while each is specific to the cultural context in which it is practised, they are often studied in isolation by separate research institutions and environments. ArgO-EMR therefore aims to offer a meeting ground for researchers who already have experience with, or wish to engage in, the study of Eastern medicines and religions across geographical areas and theoretical perspectives. It holds a fortnightly seminar, a fortnightly reading group, and an annual international workshop. For an English version of the prospectus, click [here](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/anthro/documents/media/argoemr_brochure_2011_2012.pdf). Who are we? Eastern medicines and religions have family resemblances and reveal cross-cultural continuities, yet quickly develop specificities to the locality of their practice. Argo-EMR is a coordinated anthropological effort to explore Eastern medicines and religions in popular rural, institutionalized urban and transnational settings. We emphasize long-term fieldwork and linguistic competency. Argo-EMR promotes ethnographic research on Eastern medicines and religions in rural, institutionalised urban, and transnational settings. Argo-EMR facilitates senior and post-doctoral research, and intends to offer studentships and one-year fellowships. Current ongoing research projects in Rural Areas: Tibetan Sign Language and Deaf Identities in the Making: Signing, Embodiment, and the Lives of Deaf People in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China Since 2001, deaf Tibetans in Lhasa have been formalising a broad variety of signs, gestures and other forms of communication into the Tibetan Sign Language (TSL). This project seeks to understand the methods, people and organisations involved in the emergence and ongoing development of TSL. It furthermore studies who signs TSL, and how TSL influences deaf Tibetans' lives and their educational, social and employment opportunities. A special emphasis is placed on exploring how anthropological theorising of the body and embodiment might be usefully applied to, and enhances the study, transmission and use of TSL in the People's Republic of China (PRC), in relation to processes in deaf identity formation. Through its theoretical, analytical and methodological attention to body and embodiment, the project aims to add to, but also enrich, existing scholarship on signing and deaf identity formation. The project is undertaken by Dr Theresia Hofer, Wellcome Fellow at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, University of Oxford, 2015 -2018, and core member of the Institute's Anthropology Research Group on Eastern Medicine and Religion (ArgO-EMR). 'Textual Transmission' in Tibetan Medicine Three educational methods: empowerment (Tib. dbang), textual initiation (Tib. lung) and didactic teaching (Tib. khrid) are traditionally seen as the three compulsory methods in Tibetan medical education. Out of these, apart from 'didactic teaching', which is required to impart / gain intellectual knowledge, the other two methods aim at imparting general familiarity with the subject and a deeper awareness, appreciation and confidence in the theoretical understanding and practice of Tibetan medicine. Both methods involve lineage transmission lines, either textually or spiritually. A person who has received all three of these teaching elements can be considered to have gained 'full' transmission of knowledge, including both 'general' and 'sacred' aspects. However, in the modern institutionalised education environment, these traditional 'sacred' teaching methods have somehow become neglected areas, and as time passes by, we are entering a transitional time when traditionally trained Tibetan doctors who obtained the full transmissions are becoming older. Modern university-trained younger generation Tibetan doctors are in general lacking this inner wisdom developed through sacred study methods. Important lineage transmission lines are at risk and once these 'living' transmission lines die out it will be very difficult to restore them. Dr Mingji Cuomo's research into 'Textual Transmission' in Tibetan Medical Education has two aims. One is to document the textual transmission lineages by either interviewing lineage holders who are still alive and by reviewing the existing literatures (in particular through the biographies of historically famous Tibetan doctors) in order to determine the different textual transmission lineages. The second goal is to evaluate and analyse the rational aspects of this teaching method in order to understand why these sacred teaching methods are still today considered very important. Further aims are to preserve and promote these important teaching methods which are traditionally seen as core values of Tibetan medical education. Current ongoing research projects in Institutional Settings: The herbal anti-malarial qinghao in the pre-modern Chinese medical literature Artemisinin is a purified chemical substance that has been demonstrated, beyond reasonable doubt, to have antimalarial properties. The molecule has as active principle a peroxide bridge and is known for causing rapid fever clearance with minimal side effects, It was extracted in the 1970s from the species Artemisia annua L., plant parts of which are used to make the traditional Chinese medical \"drug\"/herb qinghao, huanghuahao. Currently several projects on qinghao are underway. The first project should result in the publication of a handbook in Chinese and English, sourcing information on qinghao from 168 BCE-1949 within the genre of Chinese medical recipes (fangji), It will be the first book-length project to provide a longitudinal, critical study of a single traditional Chinese materia medica in English. The project started in March 2011, funded by the Shanghai Traditional Medicine University, and is undertaken by Professors Wu Zhongping, Wu Dunxu and Elisabeth Hsu, with the help of research assistants funded by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (Geneva). Furthermore, Dr C. W. Wright of the University of Bradford and Elisabeth Hsu have undertaken exploratory researches into the ethno-archeology of Artemisa annua L. and Artemisia appiacea Hance (the latter is a perennial species in the Flora of Korea), resulting in various publications between 2006 and 2015. This research is ground breaking in that it aims to re-enact the drug preparatory methods as recommended in pre-modern scientific Chinese texts and to test these re-enacted recommendations according to modern scientific standards (e.g. [Wright et al](http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/15/2/804)., 2010). Further research on antimalarial teas and juices, and into the poly-pharmacy of qinghao recipes, is planned. Finally, on a more general level, the above researches, which, ultimately, concern the body's sensorial engagement with its environment, throw new light on questions of sense perception and sense awareness raised in the history and philosophy of science (Whitehead, 1920; Latour, 2000). Current ongoing research projects in Transnational Settings: Chinese Medicine in East Africa This ethnographic study that commenced in 2001 researches an East-South flow and thereby countervails the standard accounts of globalisation from the West to 'the rest' of the world. Chinese medicine, as a 'modern traditional' medicine, is attractive to an upwardly mobile, self-styled 'middle class'. Yet equally common are drug stores, staffed by local Tanzanian youth only, in rural townships and small clinics close to bustling bus stations in large cities. Elisabeth Hsu has published umpteen articles on this theme, and a monograph is in preparation. Furthermore, she collected medical commodities for a display case on the 'Treatment options for HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania' in the permanent exhibition on 'Living and Dying' at the British Museum, London. Blood, Women's Bodies and Gender in Ancient Mesopotamian Medicine Ulrike Steinert, Babylonian Medicine, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 2016 Body substances form a significant topic for analysis, in medical anthropology as well as in the history of medicine. One intriguing aspect of body substances in cross-cultural perspective is presented by their complex links to cultural epistemologies concerning the body, human nature and social order. In this study, [Ulrike Steinert](http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/babmed/staff/steinert.html) investigates the notions connected to blood in general and to female bleeding in particular, which are reflected in Mesopotamian medical cuneiform texts from the 2nd and 1st millennium BCE. The research focuses on the Babylonian healers' ideas and knowledge about women's monthly bleeding in relation to concepts of the human body, in relation to gender-specific physiological processes (in connection with reproduction), and in relation to imputed significations of bodily discharges in medical and other texts (e.g. myths, omens, rituals). The analysis aims to elucidate how views on female blood tie in with broader cultural concepts about the gendered body. Steinert proposes that women's bleeding in Mesopotamia was conceptualised in a culture-specific way that differs from the notion of menstruation developed in the Hippocratic writings up to contemporary Western medicine as a regular process restricted and essential to women's bodies. Her study will integrate textual and historical evidence with anthropological analyses of menstruation in non-Western cultures to highlight ambiguities surrounding the understanding of women's bleeding. In particular, the study aims to overcome an overemphasis in current Assyriological research on notions of impurity and pollution associated with women's bleeding. The Imagination and Practice of Chinese Tea in the Cultivation of Personhood and Well-Being Kunbing Xiao, Associate Professor, Research Institute of the Minorities in Southwest China, Southwest University for Nationalities, 2014-2015 Tea has long been considered a cultural symbol in China. Deeply interwoven with Chinese Buddhism and Daoism, tea is a vital part of the ritual environment during the Buddhist monks' and Daoists' meditation. Tea has also long been regarded as a special 'semi-medicinal' plant. But in order to fully benefit from tea, people had to mobilize their sense organs (nose, tongue, eyes, ears, skin and posture) in particular ways. Ultimately, the particularity of these mobilizations became a differentiator of social class (nobles versus others) and had implications for ideas of proper conduct. The main purpose of Prof Xiao Kunbing's research is to describe and analyse the metaphors used for the appreciation of tea and its therapeutic practice. She seeks to show how the special materiality of tea gives it a powerful relationship of physical feeling and subjective imagination, personal body and social body, spiritual belief and actual effect. A Comparative Study on Inner Alchemy and Tibetan Tantric Buddhism Shen Wenhua, Associate Professor, University of Nanjing, Department of Religious Studies, Nanjing, 2014-2015 The theories of inner alchemy and Tibetan tantra have accumulated abundant knowledge of the body, spirit, and soul. This project uses the comparative method to identify the generalities they reveal about life. Ultimately, the theories of inner alchemy and Tibetan tantra demonstrate strong similarities, particularly regarding the view of the universe, the concept of yinyang and the five phases, the theories of the immortals and the Brahma, the relationship between body structure and nadi tsa, the sexual arts, alchemy and pharmaceutical technology, visualization, praying, the mandala, and so on. Research contents include: 1.Comparison of philosophy and doctrine. This includes a study things' () 2. Comparison of religious practice. a. Comparison of subtle body parts such as 'san dantian'and 'sanmai qilun'). b. Comparison in the procedures of practice: 'Four steps of inner alchemy' and 'Nine steps in nyingma dzogchen'. c. Comparison of the practical realms: gods at five levels in the Daoist pantheon, and the Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Avatar in the Tibetan tantra. 3. Discussion of the significance that inner alchemy and Tibetan tantra bring to us today, such as self-awareness, intuitive thinking and intelligence. Public Perceptions of Traditional Chinese Medicine Culture in the UK Zhang Yanping, Associate Professor, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Centre for TCM Culture in the School of Humanities, Nanjing, 2013-12014 This small research project was carried out between February and June 2014 after approval by the School's ethics committee. It employed a questionnaire of 18 questions, of which 15 were multiple choice. It recruited 30 participants (14 male, 16 female), aged between 23 and 71, including 14 British, 9 other European, 7 American and 1 Chinese nationals, and of whom 20 among were scholars, support staff, and students of the University of Oxford The findings indicated that more than half of the participants had a personal experience, or a family member's, of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and/or acupuncture. Almost all participants had heard of the concept yinyang, especially the taiji diagram. However, with exception of a few scholars in Chinese Studies, the participants had no knowledge of the ancient Chinese famous doctors and medical classics and could not explain the meanings of yinyang and qi in detail. The participants had different understandings about the purpose of TCM applications, depending on their own experience, but they generally believed TCM was more applicable in the treatment of difficult diseases such as vitiligo, eczema, psoriasis, rheumatoid, arthritis, asthma, rhinitis, pain, cervical spondylosis, lumbar removal, and infertility. The participants with a background in psychology, medicine, and/ or anthropology gave fuller explanations of the human-environment relations related to TCM. The participants with a background in biomedicine trusted the RCT (double-blinded randomised controlled trials) for the evaluation of the effectiveness of TCM treatment and therefore often exhibited a distrusting attitude towards the effectiveness of TCM. With regards to the current state of TCM in UK, all participants thought that TCM should be used as a complementary medicine. Analysing manuscripts of Yao Nationality Daoism Xu Fei, Institute of Religious Studies, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 2011-12 The University of Oxford hosts more than three hundred copies of Yao Nationality Daoism scriptures not found in the Daoist Canon and not recorded in the contemporary Daoist literature. In the 1990s, Curator of Chinese Collections in the Bodleian library, Mr Helliwell, acquired the Yao Daoist manuscripts, which are written in Chinese characters and which apparently came from local Yao communities in northern Thailand. These scriptures, of which there is no comparable collection in China, allow for invaluable research on Yao nationality Daoism and Daoism more generally. While there is a bibliographic project underway by Lucia Obi towards Part II of \"Handschriften der Yao\" (Part I, edited by Thomas H\u00f6llmann in 2004, is in the Staatsbibiliothek at Munich), this project, undertaken by the visiting academic Xu Fei and her doctoral supervisor at the University of Chengdu, Professor Guo Wu, aims a) to document this series of scriptures photographically for research purposes in China, b) re-arrange them thematically for summary, such that Chinese speaking researchers can access them more easily, and c) analyse selected texts related to healing (in a co-authored English article). Scriptures of this kind are one of the main carriers of Daoist cultural practices, as Daoists generally regard the Dao, the scriptures, and the Daoist masters as the three treasuries of the religion. Despite the invention of printing, copying scriptures has remained one of the dominant ways to spread Daoist practices. Yao nationality Daoism has been a hotbed for research for many years, but the investigation is usually thwarted by a lack of accurate historical records. The holdings of Bodleian Library therefore may be helpful in sorting out these difficulties and drawing a clear map of the developments of Yao nationality Daoism. Traditional Korean medicine between two extremes Yousang Baik, Associate Professor, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyunghee University, Seoul, 2011-12 Today Korean society is a culture of extremes, containing tradition and modernity, religion and science, conservatism and progressivism, east and west, etc. Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) hosts both ends of these confronting values. This project researches how the knowledge and practical skills of Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) are handed down from person-to-person and among self-identifying social circles of traditional medicine. In particular, this research investigates how processes of person-to-person transmission come from the unique socio-cultural and historical background of the Korean society and to what extent this process is common to other traditional medicines. The project also focuses on the mutating features of TKM, which have adapted in order to cope with environmental changes. For over 60 years, TKM has been assured a high position by the legal system; however, systematic control over TKM in the aspects of medical education and clinical trials by the government or other organizations is relatively loose. This paradox demonstrates the deep-rooted commitment of TKM practitioners to maintain individual spontaneity, making it difficult for the Korean biomedical community to support TKM. Throughout history, numerous treatments, theories, and schools of TKM have incessantly appeared, spread, undergone examination, and either been discarded or received with recognition. This process continues today without permanent regulation. Despite the Japanese Government General's powerful repression over several thousands of traditional doctors during the colonial period, TKM practitioners still carry out their own medical practice and are entrusted as influential players in medical treatment. But as society turns toward a global standardisation of treatment evaluations, TKM faces a turning point. Considering the observation that such turning points are often from a longue-duree-view of history insignificant and that the essence of culture lies not in rapid external development but is embedded in the everyday lives of the people, it suffices to say that the study of the thoughts and practices of Korean medical doctors who are facing the current vast environmental changes is key to identifying the characteristics of Korean medical culture. , and anticipate its future. The Body and Medicine in the Shi jing (Book of Odes) Zhang Jianjun, Professor, Art History Department, College of Fine Arts, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 2012-13 There are at least 51 poems in Shi jing pertaining to the body and medical field. The poems can be classified into nine themes: plants, bodily conditions in adolescent boys and girls; feelings of desire and resistance to sexual longing; procreation and birthing; abundant alcohol consumption for religious reasons and others; ageing including the disorders of old age and signs indicative of longevity; bodily deformity and associated ethics; disorders of the heart arising from emotional problems; and finally, epidemics that can bring disaster to the state. Medical anthropological methods on these topics can elucidate new interpretations of both the Shi jing and early Chinese cultures. The project aims to screen the Shi jing poems for ethnobotanical terms, study the traditional exegesis of these poems and the included meanings of sensations, explore relations between literary presentation and bodily feeling, and investigate how bodily and medical experiences transform into the Shi jing's literary. Background: Shi jing studies have a very long history and include shifting interpretations. The ancient scholars interpreted it as praising and satirising to the Son of Heaven (Tianzi ); the modern scholars considered it more as a literary text. Anthropological studies include Wen Yiduo who published Myth and Poetry, the French scholar Marcel Granet who published Fetes et chanson anciennes de la Chine and in America, and Ching-Hsien Wang who published Shih Ching: formulaic language and mode of creation. However, up until now, a study of the Shi jing from a medical anthropological perspective is unprecedented. Icons and Innovation in Southwest China's Religious Texts Katherine Swancutt, AHRC-ESRC Research Fellow in Social Anthropology, Oct 2007-13, now Lecturer in the Anthropology of Religion, Department of Theology and Religious Studies King's College London Sacred texts mobilise many forms of change, but while studies on them tend to focus on an exegesis of textual meanings, they rarely show how religious specialists, their clients, and even the texts themselves interact in practices that trigger religious change. Shamanic or 'animistic' religions in particular have often been considered as the foil to world religions, whose text-reading priests cite written passages which reinforce social conventions across the generations. However, sacred texts can also be subjected to a 'hybridised' practice of textual and oral exegesis, which combines (1) the imagistic-linguistic or phonetic elements of script forms and (2) the materiality of the written texts as used in rituals with (3) religious practitioners' memories of previous performances, which are often a spontaneous response to social circumstances. This project, funded by the AHRC-ESRC Religion and Society programme as a Major Research Award 2009-2013, brings four researchers together: Elisabeth Hsu (Principal Investigator); Katherine Swancutt (AHRC Research Fellow); Markus Schiesser, who directed the film Blood For the Gods: Ritual Revival Among the Premi people in Southwest China to be released shortly; and Yang Honglin, Associate Professor, Yunnan Nationalities University, China Studies. It investigates the chanting of sacred texts as a 'technique' that skilfully amalgamates the materiality of the text with its imagistic scripts, in ways that either give rise to 'revelatory' religious innovations or simply reinforces conventions. It explores how shamans in Southwest China interact with their sacred texts in practice, effectively rendering texts into 'works-in-progress' rather than into 'fixed entities'. The project hosted the fortnightly ArgO-EMR seminars, and the conference at ISCA, on 'The Viewpoint of the Technique', 28-29 Jan 2010. Pulse Diagnostics in Chinese Medicine Dr Elisabeth Hsu Touch, tactile perception, and tactility are aspects of Chinese medicine that are fundamental for understanding basic concepts of Chinese medicine like qi (usually translated as influence or energy), zang (often translated as inner organs, depots, or viscera), and others. The language of emotion is often a tactile one, and this may explain why a tactually known body can attend to feelings and emotions. The first extant text that deals extensively with an already fairly elaborate art of Chinese pulse diagnostics includes twenty-five medical case histories, recorded by a doctor called Chunyu Yi (born 215 BC), and transmitted within the 105th chapter of the Shi ji (Records of the Historian) by Sima Qian (?145-86 BC). Two projects employ this text. One is a translation of the entire chapter in collaboration with the Department of East Asian Languages and Literature, University of Wisconsin (Hsu and Nienhauser 2011). The other is a publication of a monograph that focuses on highly complex concepts of disease and their diagnosis through tactile perception, a diagnostic process that attends to the present and is not primarily dependent on establishing the cause of a disorder in the past (Hsu 2010). Another series of texts on pulse diagnostics dates to between the 7th-11th century AD. The series is part of a corpus of medical manuscripts found in a Buddhist cave at Dunhuang. All texts on pulse diagnostics in the following Dunhuang manuscripts have been them is provided in an introductory essay, which also outlines a modular reading of these texts. Their study contributes to the project \"Medicine, religion et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la Chine de Turfan\" (Despeux 2010). Following these textual studies, Dr Elisabeth Hsu undertook ethnographic fieldwork on the tactile qualities of different pulse patterns from July 2009-January 2010 (funded by the ESRC).. She worked with a ninth generation Chinese medical doctor in Huizhou, Anhui province, PR China, in order to understand how one learns to identify and talk about these tactile practices during the medical encounter. Generating Synchronicity: Vitality and Relatedness in Southwest China Dr Katherine Swancutt and Dr Elisabeth Hsu This three-year long ESRC project (Oct 2006 - Jan 2010), explores the hypothesis that religio-medical practices have developed sophisticated linguistic devices and bodily techniques for endorsing the therapeutic principle of 'generating synchronicity' between practitioner and patient. Synchronicity arises when practitioner and patient focus on a single event, which breaks down habitual boundaries between them and generates a space for negotiating uncertainty and interpersonal relations. This is thought to create a sense of relatedness between them, which, in turn, is considered to enhance vitality. In order to explore how people generate synchronicity through (1) the use of vague and/or polysemous concepts during the therapeutic encounter and (2) tactility, the researchers Dr Katherine Swancutt and Dr Elisabeth Hsu carried out language-competent ethnographic field research among the Xiaoliangshan Yizu in 2007-08 and, as it was difficult to visit the Eya Naxi then, among the Hanzu in Hsu village, Huizhou, Anhui province, in 2009-10. The field results have been complemented with an Ethnicity and Identity seminar series on \"Blood, Vitality and Relatedness\" in Michaelmas Term 2007, a medical anthropology seminar series on 'Vitality-enhancing Body Substances' in Hilary Term 2008 and a workshop on 28-29 January 2010 on 'The Viewpoint of the Technique: Managing Time and Crisis Resolution in Eastern Religions and Medicines'. Shamanic Remedies and among the Nuosu (Liangshan Yizu) Katherine Swancutt, AHRC-ESRC Research Fellow in Anthropology, Oct 2007-13, now Lecturer in the Anthropology of Religion, Department of Theology and Religious Studies, King's College London Katherine Swancutt's fieldwork among the Nuosu in Yunnan Province - who are a Tibeto-Burman group (known in Chinese as the Liangshan Yizu) - was launched within the three-year ESRC project entitled 'Generating Synchronicity: Vitality and Relatedness in Southwest China'. This new fieldwork arose out of Swancutt's larger comparative initiative for showing how innovative shamanic (or other magical) remedies are regularly sought out across Asia. Using fieldwork of the Buryat Mongols of Northeast Mongolia and China since 1999, Swancutt produced two articles in the JRAI (2006 and 2008): a monograph on divination and fortune (khiimor') and an analysis of the production of shamanic innovations (2013, Berghahn). Buryats frequently introduce tailor-made shamanic remedies to immediately resolve problems. Similarly, her article in Inner Asia (2007) parallels this Buryat innovation-making with the ad hoc pedagogy of Mongolian games, which she researched among the Deed Mongols of Qinghai, China. To better understand the Nuosu, Swancutt travelled to a remote forested mountain village, located 8,000 kilometres southwest of her Mongolian field sites in 2007. Her unique ethnography on the Nuosu human soul and shamanic dreams highlights the Nuosu's 'predatory sociality' (who held slaves and serfs until 1956-7, when the Chinese disbanded these practices under the Democratic Reforms). Her monograph on the Nuosu, complemented by several new articles and a book chapter (see below), offer an in-depth case study of the ways that, like Buryat shamands, Nuosu text-reading shamans (bimo) produce innovative remedies of crisis. Nuosu exegeses are thus often 'oral' and improvisational, drawing upon inspirations from dreams, divinations and astrological predictions; indeed, This will be the center of Swancutt's work on a new AHRC-ESRC research project at ISCA (starting in 2009), entitled 'Icons and Innovation in Southwest China's Religious Texts'. The Medical Efficacy of Tibetan Household Rituals Patrizia Bassini, John Fell Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Oct 2006-08 This project investigated the household rituals and bodily techniques used to protect against illness. Tibetans are strongly concerned with the harmful influence of the \"cold\" ('khyags), which in popular Tibetan medicine is seen as the cause of many illnesses (e.g. TB, gastric disorders, postpartum infections). People make great efforts to keep their bodies warm; they eat specific foods known to have a heating effect (e.g. yak meat, fat soups, rtsam pa, 'bra go dmar po-dates), visit local springs, and that have a heating effect on the body. Additionally, they undergo daily rituals to appease deities in the natural environment and allay the detrimental effects they impose on people. Frequently, people inadvertently anger deities, evoking illness and misfortune from the sacred landscape they inhabit. Contrary to studies that focus on institutionalised forms of Tibetan medicine, this study explores day-to-day practices such as rituals, warmth-maintaining body techniques (e.g. eating and sleeping habits, visits to local hot springs) and how theose express and shape the social life of households. To date, Dr Bassini has carried out long-term field-work (several years) among Tibetans in rural Qinghai with specific focus on home-based popular experiences of health and illness. The Sensory Experience of Thai Massage: Commercialisation, Globalisation and Tactility Iida Junko, Associate Professor, Kawasaki University of Medical Welfare, Fellow of the Kawasaki Green College Medical Research Exchange Programme 2006-07 Based on a decade of fieldwork at traditional therapies clinic in Chiang Mai, the largest city in northern Thailand, Dr Junko Iida, a Kawasaki Green College Academic Exchange Scholar in 2006-07, explored how the sensory experience of the Thai massage was affected by its commercialisation and globalisation. The popularity of the Thai massage among foreign tourists and the Thai urban middle class has informed the frequency of tactile interactions between people with different social and cultural backgrounds. Most Thai clients receive Thai massage as a therapy for pain which they interpret in terms of folk anatomy, while tourists receive it for relaxation or an 'exotic experience'. These aims inform the massage technique: as tourists appear to prefer gentle massage, whereas Thai clients perceive the strength of a massage to be associated with its efficacy. Therefore, practitioners must answer to a variety of requests, learning massage skills not only through a standardised course, but also through 'hands-on', intersubjective experiences with clients and colleagues. This study, which is now published in the edited volume \"Everyday Life in Asia: Social Perspectives on the Senses\" (2010) reveals that it is necessary to acquire bodily knowledge in order to experience touch as efficacious or pleasurable. Sensory Experience and Chinese Medicine Dr Elisabeth Hsu This four-year project (2003-07), funded by the Chiang Chingkuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange and instigated by Dr Yu Shuenn-der, Senior Researcher at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, brought anthropologists and historians of medicine together in monthly seminars and a yearly workshop. Invited as a foreign expert, Dr Elisabeth Hsu collaborateed in exploring themes of \"the training of the senses\" or \"the senses in everyday life\". In particular, the scholars focused on the shentigan (literally: bodily resonances), a concept that makes evident how culture-specific the Western notion of \"the senses\" is and how often it is intricately related to Cartesian ideas about the body. The edited volume (2008) explores shentigan that refers to sensory experiences, emotional states, priopriocetive perceptions, hunger, fatigue, anxiety, and the like. Approaches to Misfortune in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal The Kathmandu Valley is home to an old high culture, both Hindu and Buddhist and based on Tantric scriptures, which gives a prominent place to healing practices. At the same time, it has always been a trading and pilgrimage outpost for Tibetan Buddhists and Indian Hindus. Today, as the capital of a rapidly developing and politically tortured country, it is home to religious and healing movements from all over the world, including Japanese Seimeikyo and Tenrikyo, Rajneesh, Christian missionaries, Buddhist vipassana meditation, naturopathy, and many more. At the same time, many shamans have migrated from the hills and freelance mediums of various sorts are found in most localities. Ayurvedic practitioners are also common and there is an Ayurvedic hospital supported by the government, in addition to many Ayurvedic clinics. There is a very specific relation to gender in this context, in that possessed mediums are predominantly female, regardless of whether they are Buddhist or Hindu, whereas healers, whose practice depends on the mastery of acquired techniques and some relationship to oral or written texts, are nearly always male. [Professor David Gellner](https://isca.web.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-david-gellner) has a longterm interest in mapping the overall field in which these movements exist, in Ayurveda and its context, and in tracing patients' or clients' strategies of resort. Publications: articles 1993 (Tantric Healer), 1994 (Priests, Healers). He also has an interest in similar phenomena in Japan, 1996 (Temples for life). A medicine of constitutions: Sasang medicine in contemporary South Korea Hyunkoo Kim, St Antony's College, 2021 Supervisor: Elisabeth Hsu This thesis investigates the process of standardisation, scientisation, and diversification of Sasang medicine in contemporary South Korea, through the lens of its central concept ch'ejil (constitution). Sasang medicine (sasang ihak) is a current of medical tradition which emerged from the scholarly physician Yi Chema in late 19th century Chosn. Sasang medicine is known as ch'ejil ihak (constitutional medicine) because it assumes that human beings have different constitutions with different physiologies and pathologies as well as different psychological traits. Sasang medicine is a unique example in [traditional] Korean medicine because it has constantly been practiced for over a century and is ingrained into health practices of modern Koreans as well as the contemporary health care system in South Korea. Based on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in a school of Korean medicine and its teaching hospital, in a national research institute, and in private clinics, this thesis meticulously explores how an established form of Sasang medicine has been situated in the institutionalised system of Korean medicine. Ethnographies from different field sites provide microscopic details which are interspersed with various issues of collaboration, confrontation, and negotiation of different values and epistemologies. Furthermore, this thesis scrutinizes 'how practitioners of Sasang medicine know what they know' in such different social settings. These attempts are fulfilled by exploring how the central concept of Sasang medicine, ch'ejil, is understood in each field site. In so doing, this thesis aims to elucidate to what extent the practice of Sasang medicine in historical and social formation diversifies concepts of ch'ejil, which have played a role as a fluid medium to raise legitimacy or \"efficacy\" of Sasang medicine. Once More to the Body: an Ethnography of Mindfulness Practitioners in the United Kingdom Kitty Wheater, St Cross College, 2017 Supervisor: Elisabeth Hsu and Caroline Potter Kitty's DPhil thesis, Once More to the Body: an Ethnography of Mindfulness Practitioners in the United Kingdom (submitted, April 2017), is supervised by Prof. Elisabeth Hsu and Dr Caroline Potter. Drawing on fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, it explores techniques of self-cultivation among participants and practitioners of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy. This psychotherapeutic intervention is derived from Buddhist meditation and cognitive therapy. Highlighting the paradoxes that occur as mindfulness emerges in evidence-based medicine and psychotherapy, her thesis asks what it means to be a mindfulness practitioner in this context. She concludes that tensions such as that between 'compliance' and 'compassion' in mindfulness-based approaches are irreducible, but productive of new and dynamic forms of 'mindful' subjectivity. The Reception and Transformation of Homeopathy in Japan Yuri Nonami, Green Templeton College, 2015 Supervisor: Elisabeth Hsu and Takehiko Kariya This thesis examines from a medical anthropological viewpoint how the practice of the newly imported complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been transplanted, received and transformed in Japan. More specifically, I focus on homeopathy, which was introduced into Japan in the late 1990s. To address the research question, I focus on the practice of homeopathy from an anthropological viewpoint. The adoption of any new form of medicine is affected by the prevailing medical, social and cultural context. So, how and why was homeopathy introduced into Japan in the late 1990s? I explore this question by focusing on three aspects of the reception of homeopathy in Japan: (1) the institutionalisation of the homeopathy, including the formation of associations of practitioners and homeopathic colleges; (2) the translation of the theory and practice of homeopathy by the practitioners into a culturally acceptable form; (3) the utilisation and consumption of homeopathy by the patients, their families and self-prescribers. Over eighteen months of fieldwork in Japan led me to focus on these three elements of homeopathic practice. Regarding the theoretical framework, this mainly explores medical pluralism and the health care system in Japan from an anthropological perspective, and the globalisation and transmission of medicine. I argue that the success of homeopathy in Japan was largely thanks to the transmission strategies set by the founders of the colleges for lay homeopaths. Mothers in particular, concerned by worries over family health care, were drawn to this approach. Furthermore, I argue that this group not only became consistent users of homeopathy but also propagated the therapy through \"mothers' self-help groups\", thereby creating a strong tie with the lay homeopaths. I argue that mothers gained a sense of empowerment through homeopathy. Within the Japanese health care system it was the popular sector that received and developed homeopathy. Convention, control and creativity: the case of Chinese medicine in Singapore Arielle Rittersmith, Green Templeton College, 2010 Supervisor: Elisabeth Hsu The Singaporean government promotes the city-state as the 'biopolis of Asia', with the intention of bolstering their reputation for the most advanced biomedical facilities and research in the region. This politically-crafted image explicitly has not included 'traditional' medicine. Yet, despite their general day-to-day compliance with laws and state agendas, Singaporeans from all walks of life continue to use and practice Chinese medicine, sustaining an adaptive practice that eventually demanded acknowledgement (of a sort) by the state. Beginning with the observation that differing social, political and economic conditions generate variable manifestations of Chinese medicine around the world, this thesis examines facets of medical use and practice in Singapore, focusing on power dynamics, embodied experience and negotiations of convention and creativity. Theoretically and methodologically developed within medical anthropology, this study includes a range of perspectives, including patients, caregivers, physicians, educators, legislators, shop owners, entrepreneurs, researchers and students. Exploring individual and group creativity vis-\u00e0-vis state agendas, and environmental aspects of embodied experience, this broad scope considers contemporary medical practice in relation to government policies favouring international investment, urban redevelopment, healthcare regulation, 'multiracial' nationalism and the management of history and heritage. Manufacturing Tibetan medicine. The creation of an industry and the moral economy of Tibetanness Martin Saxer, Green Templeton College, 2010 Supervisors: Elisabeth Hsu and Charles Ramble This thesis examines the recent creation of a Tibetan medicine industry in the People's Republic of China. Within a mere decade hospital pharmacies throughout Tibet have been converted into pharmaceutical companies. Confronted with the logic of capital and profit, these companies now produce commodities for a nationwide market. While these developments are depicted as a big success by official China, they also meet with harsh criticism: medicine prices are on the rise and doctors complain that their quality is decreasing; the industry still relies extensively on wildcrafted herbs, which is seen as a threat to the survival of certain plant species; and the industrial application of traditional knowledge raises questions of intellectual property and cultural heritage. The quick and forced industrialisation touches upon much more than technical aspects of manufacturing Tibetan medicines. What is at stake is a fundamental (re-)manufacturing of Tibetan medicine as a system of knowledge and practice and its role in contemporary Tibet. The industry lies at the intersection of conflicting agendas and visions for Tibet. On the one hand, the industrial Tibetan medicine serves as an allegorical figure of Tibet's rapid development and progress. The creation of an industry exemplifies the scope and speed of the Party State's modernist schemes. On the other hand, Tibetan remedies are part of a booming \"ethnicity industry\". They are marketed as products of ancient wisdom rather than science and modern technology. Industrial Tibetan medicine has emerged as a space in which Tibet as such is being discussed and shaped. My ethnography explores their tactics and strategies, their ethical reasoning and their engagement in the market not only for pills and remedies but also for Tibetanness - a market, I argue, that bears the characteristics of a moral economy at large, enmeshed in the global political spectacle that surrounds the \"Tibet question\" and China's rise as a world power. Heart Distress on the Sino-Tibetan frontier: History, Gender, Ecology and Ritual Practice in Tibetan Popular Perceptions and Experiences of Heart Distress (snying nad) and other illnesses in the Qinghai part of Amdo Patrizia Bassini, St Cross College, Trinity Term 2007 Supervisors: Elisabeth Hsu and Charles Ramble Stimulated by a marked tendency of medical anthropologists of Eastern medicines to explore \"medical systems\" in urban and institutional contexts, this thesis investigates health care from the home-base and the standpoint of ordinary people engaged in popular practices. This study attempts to answer questions such as: \"What do we learn from the popular stance on health and illness?\", \"What motivates the choice of health care?\" and \"Why is it important to consider popular perceptions and experiences of health and illness?\" Through the analysis of the phenomenon of heart distress ( snying nad ) among other common illnesses such pho nad ) and gallbladder ( mkhris nad ) disorders, this thesis shows how people in rural areas in Amdo are creative agents of their own well-being. Patients explain heart distress as the outcome of shared and personal histories and the harmful influence of the sacred landscape they inhabit. The majority, however, are young brides who have to adjust to working hard in the household of often unsympathetic parents-in-law. Heart distress is not easy to overcome: habitual practices such as the hierarchy of food consumption in Tibetan households, for instance, constitute and express social and kin relations. These are embedded in a religious cosmology that constitutes an important determinant, together with the surrounding ecology, for the way people choose to treat other illnesses too. Perceptions of health, illness and healing in a Sichuan Village, China Anna Lora-Wainwright, Green College, Michaelmas Term 2006 Supervisor: Elisabeth Hsu This thesis explores attitudes to the body, illness and healing in contemporary rural China through the prism of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus. It is divided in two parts. Part 1 shows that bodily dispositions articulate ways of engaging with one's surroundings and claims to authority and status. Hierarchies with regard to what constitutes a desirable body or a healthy diet are not stable but always disputed. Negotiations surrounding them are informative of wider social processes and serve to reproduce or challenge social relations and values. Part 2 examines bodily practices at times of illness through the case of oesophagus cancer. I highlight how family relationships are produced and contested through various practices of care, and that such relations engender particular bodily attitudes. Closer attention to practices during illness are therefore important for understanding how illness is experienced by all involved, but also how it intersects with family relations, attitudes to resources, strategies to secure them and invest them, and perceptions of the state and welfare provision. Employing habitus allows a closer grasp of the intricate processes through which family relations are formed, why families opt for particular forms of treatment and how the effectiveness of therapy is produced. ArgO-EMR offers a meeting ground for anthropologists and researchers who adopt an anthropological orientation in the study of Eastern medicines and religions. We hold a fortnightly seminar and organise an international workshop once per year.

The workshop explores in particular whether and if, how the materiality of the form in which ritual meanings are transmitted, e.g. the notation of ritual texts, affects the creativity of shamans and other ritual specialists when they perform and re-enact these rituals.
