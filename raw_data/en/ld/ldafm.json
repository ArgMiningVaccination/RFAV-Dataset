With billions of doses administered across the globe, there is a growing body of real-world evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines are both safe and effective. Importantly, they are very effective against preventing someone from getting seriously ill, requiring hospitalization or dying from COVID-19. Studies completed to date include: - mRNA vaccines are 94% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among health care personnel - [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7020e2.htm?utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default) - Vaccination reduced the risk for COVID-19 hospitalization among adults 65+ by 94% - [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm?s_cid=mm7018e1_w&utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default) - mRNA vaccines are highly effective in real-world conditions; those fully vaccinated 90% less likely to get infected - [Learn more](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default) - There are no increased risks of severe side effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes from the mrRNA vaccines - [Learn more](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983?utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default) - Among those fully vaccinated in New Jersey, COVID-19 vaccines are 99.92% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection, 99.998% effective against hospitalization and 99.9993% effective against COVID-19 related deaths - [Learn more](https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2021/approved/20210609a.shtml?utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default) - A study by HMH CDI found just 138 COVID-19 positive cases among 26,000 vaccinated health care workers.

You will not get the boost in immunity until you receive the second shot. However, you should reschedule your second dose at the earliest opportunity. We administer all four vaccine types (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J Janssen and Novavax) depending on location and availability of supply. All four vaccines are very effective against preventing symptomatic or severe COVID infections. If you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have scheduled an appointment to receive the vaccine and are not feeling well on the day of vaccination, it is best to reschedule the vaccine. You can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including a flu vaccine, at the same visit. There is a potential for injection site reactions (redness, swelling and pain) as well as fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and/or joint pain. These are common reactions seen with other vaccines. If you experience common side effects from the vaccine it is still necessary to receive the second dose for the vaccine to be effective. If you receive any other side effects, contact your health care provider. If you have had a COVID-19 infection in the past, you can get the vaccine after recovering from COVID-19 and after you meet criteria to [discontinue isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fif-you-are-sick%2Fquarantine.html&utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default). There is no need to wait 90 days. [discontinue isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fif-you-are-sick%2Fquarantine.html&utm_medium=online&utm_source=healthu&utm_campaign=default). Yes. The CDC recommends people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy. No. Claims linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility are unfounded and there is no evidence that any vaccines impact menstrual cycles or future fertility in women or men. In alignment with leading specialists, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, vaccination is recommended for all eligible people who may be considering future pregnancy - as well as women actively trying to conceive or undergoing fertility treatment. While COVID-19 generally causes mild illness in children, some children do develop more severe illness such as pneumonia. After the infection, some will get the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that requires hospitalization. Others may experience \"long COVID\" with symptoms that last for months, including extreme fatigue, \"brain fog\", breathing problems and body aches. MIS-C and \"long COVID\" can happen after all types of COVID-19 illness, including after mild illness or no symptoms. The vaccine can prevent infection and should decrease the risk of all complications from COVID-19. You should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, Moderna or J&J Janssen vaccine if you: - had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine; - had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine Yes, if you received any brand vaccine for your primary dose (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson or Novavax), you can receive the updated Omicron-specific booster as long as you are ages 12 and older and it has been at least 2 months since completing your primary dose.
