I was shocked to see all the posts and thought I would add my experience to all that you guys are sharing. In July I suffered a stroke and at the age of 43 they were a little baffled as to why. I had never suffered from seizures (that we knew of) and I have Lupus. After the stroke I was having some strange symptoms and a neurology interventionist came up with the conclusion that it is seizures also. An EEG in the hospital confirmed seizures, and they immediately put me on 1000 mg of Keppra 2x a day. In the meantime, they tested me for MS with numerous blood tests and a Lumbar Puncture. They recently had me in the hosptial for a mutli-day EEG during which they took me off the Keppra, cold turkey. Apparently I suffered no seizures during my hospital stay and the doctor supervising the EEG went back and looked at my first EEG. He discovered that the EEG Tech had set the machine too sensitive and even if I blinked, it showed as a seizure. Apparently, I had not been having seizures and yet was on such high doses of Keppra. That was a week ago and I was never put back on Keppra and weened. I have been cold turkey for the past week and have suffered quite a bit. I have had migraines, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. I can't even sit in a car or drive it without getting really sick. I wanted to confirm the side effects that many on here have commented on and I want to know what others would do about this?

I was taking 1000mg of Keppra and 500mg of Lamictal for about 3 years. I thought ut would be a good idea to only be on one medication and as Keppra had treated my seizures so well, I decided to drop the Lamictal. When I was only on Keppra I expeienced grand mal seizures and because very tearful and exhausted. I gradually introduced the Lamicatal again and am now coming off the Keppra instead. Now I take 200mg of Lamicatal and 400mg of Keppra (oral solution) per day. I only experience 1 absence seizure a month and find I'm feeling less tired - I don't need to sleep for 2 hours during the day anymore. I've very slowly withdrawn the Keppra by 250 mg every 8 weeks and feel better for it. Hopefully, I'll be off the Keppra altogether and be able to start a family! If anyone else has experience of Keppra and pregnancy, I'd be grateful to know. Hello I'm currently withdrawing Keppra in order to start a family.
