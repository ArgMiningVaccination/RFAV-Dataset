Gavi has said it will fund a [global emergency stockpile](https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7Ba472592c-ee2a-4650-84fb-f4b8cd5fdceb%7D/gavi-to-fund-global-stockpile-of-ebola-vaccines) of Ebola vaccine that countries will be able to use for outbreak prevention and response.
