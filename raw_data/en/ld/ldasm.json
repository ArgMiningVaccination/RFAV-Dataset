Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive multiorgan autosomal recessive disease with devastating impact on the lungs caused by derangements of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main respiratory pathogen in individuals with CF infecting most patients in later stages. Despite its recognized clinical impact, molecular mechanisms that underlie P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and the host response to P. aeruginosa infection remain incompletely understood. The nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)  (PPAR), has shown to be reduced in CF airways. In the present study, we sought to investigate the upstream mechanisms repressing PPAR expression and its impact on airway epithelial host defense. Endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ER-stress) triggered unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by misfolded CFTR and P. aeruginosa infection contributed to attenuated expression of PPAR.
