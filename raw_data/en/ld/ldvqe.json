Give your body the tools it needs to fight off colds, flus, viruses, and infections by choosing foods that are packed with immunity-boosting vitamins and minerals. Here are some of the foods we recommend from a [holistic medicine](https://www.holisticpediatrician.com/) perspective to include in a well-balanced, vegan diet. Sweet Potatoes Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, also known as yams, are [foods](https://www.holisticpediatrician.com/services/food-as-medicine/) packed with vitamin A, which is essential for building a strong immune system. They also contain beta carotene, which gets converted to vitamin A by your body (it also gives sweet potatoes their orange color). Vitamin A supports immune function in another way: by promoting a healthy gut. Recent studies have highlighted just how important gut health is to overall health, including its role in fighting off sickness. Vitamin A keeps the lining of the gut in good condition and reduces inflammation, all of which helps make you less susceptible to illness. Ginger Ginger's potent medicinal qualities are no secret and it's a time-honored home remedy for colds, flus, upset stomachs, and more. The good news is, ginger is also highly effective at preventing illness as well as treating it. It gets much of its immune-promoting properties from gingerol, a compound that is a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Antioxidant foods have a range of health benefits, from slowing aging to preventing cancer. As if that weren't enough, ginger also has antimicrobial properties, which makes it a powerhouse when it comes to fighting infectious diseases. Garlic Garlic is another tried-and-true health food that has been used to both prevent and treat ailments for centuries. Like ginger, garlic has a rich phytochemistry that makes it an incredibly versatile health promoter. One of the compounds that is part of this makeup is sulfur. Sulfur is important as an immune booster because it increases the ability of white blood cells to ward off viruses. It's also responsible for giving garlic its distinctive pungency. Include these in your daily diet Good health is a habit! There are lots of fun and delicious ways to incorporate these foods into your daily meals.
