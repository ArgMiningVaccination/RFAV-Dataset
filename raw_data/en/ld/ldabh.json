(How to Balance Your Doshas!)", "date": "2019-10-05", "cleaned_text": "Oh, [Ayurveda](https://bookretreats.com/blog/ayurveda-yoga-teacher-training/). What is it? Only the most ancient holistic healing system that was developed 3,000 years ago in India. NBD. \"Ayur\" means life and \"veda\" means knowledge. In other words, it known as the \"science of life.\" Some say it is the oldest medicine on Earth... ...so how come most of the Western world doesn't know about it? What is the solution for a headache? Pop a pill. Depression? Oh yes, take this one, the blue pill. Some of us don't even question it anymore, because it's become so routine to mask our symptoms... ...I mean, who wants to get to the root of the problem when we can just put a band-aid over it and pretend it's okay? *hint hint* Not us superconscious, holistic healing yogis. We have the secret... ...and we want to share it with you. Yoga, meditation, exercise, eating healthy, and spending time in nature are all part of the \"medicine\" you actually need to heal. Ayurveda is one of the guides that will help you get to the root cause of your problems, to help you clear it once and for all. So come follow me down the rabbit hole, and allow me to show you a new perspective. One that involves holistic healing, the mind/body connection, and lots and lots of ghee ;) Ayurveda means the \"knowledge of life\" in Sanskrit. I like to think of it as a strong-rooted oak tree with many different branches. It listens to the wisdom of the body instead of just treating the symptoms of the illness. Ayurveda gets to the root cause of any dis-ease, and one of the strong principles is that the mind and the body are inextricably connected. In other words... ...you can heal your body with your mind. Yep, your thoughts are food for the mind and if you're feeding your body with negative thoughts and worries, you cause more stress on the body. Try this out. Say out loud, \"I am happy, I am abundant, and everything is working out for me best-case scenario.\" This is called an affirmation or mantra. Ayurveda uses mantras to heal the mind, body, and soul on a cellular level. Along with herbs, nourishing foods, oils (ghee), Ayurvedic massage, and more. Panchakarma uses different techniques to pull toxins out of the body. Ayurvedic treatments work on the individual holistically, meaning they understand that no person is the same. Ayurveda treats the patient, not the symptom. According to Ayurvedic medicine, every person is made up of a constitution of all three doshas: Vata, Pitta, Kapha. Take this [ quiz](https://chopra.com/dosha-quiz) to find out your dosha type. We'll get more into the energies of each dosha below. In Ayurvedic Medicine, there are three doshas: Vata People who are Vata are usually characterized as tall and thin with a tendency to have dry skin. The elements that represent Vata are air + ether. Vata rules the element of wind and people with more Vata are more flexible and creative. If Vata is out of balance this can cause fear and anxiety. Ways to Balance Vata: - Eat warm foods - Eat lots of spices - Eat more grounding food, like root veggies - Drinking warm drinks like turmeric or ginger before bed - Get into a regular routine - Practice meditation Those with Vata doshas tend to flow like the wind, and this can cause them to be ungrounded. Pitta Pitta people are characterized as hot, light, intense and fiery. And no, I'm not talking about the deliciously warm, oven-baked flatbreads my loves. The elements for Pitta are fire + water. Do you get angry often? Yea, that's your Pitta being imbalanced. When in balance Pitta is ambitious and competitive, when out of balance this can cause aggression and aggravation. Ways to Balance Pitta: - Eat less hot and spicy food - Drink more water - Eat your bitters like green leafy vegetables - Eat more fruits and veggies Kapha Kapha always gets a bad rep, for having slow digestion and being lazy... ...but when Kapha's are in balance they are the most peaceful, dependable and loving. When there is an imbalance, they tend to feel more depressed and lethargic. The elements for Kapha are earth + water. Ways to Balance Kapha: - Eat more spicy foods to speed up digestion - Drink ginger tea often - Exercise more often - Use fewer fats and oils when cooking - Eat more raw vegetables, bitter herbs & lighter foods Most people have a dosha type of Vata Pitta, or Pitta Kapha, while a tri-dosha (having all three equally) is rarer. You can also eat with the seasons, so once you know your dosha you can type in on Google: \"ways to balance Kapha in the summer\" or \"how to balance Vata in the fall\" Summer is considered to be Pitta season. Autumn is naturally more Vata, winter is more Kapha, and spring is tri-doshic meaning it's all three. Heard the expression \"spring cleaning?\" Spring is the time to get all your dosha back into balance for optimal health. Agni What is Agni? Agni means \"fire\" in Ayurveda and refers to our digestive juices. Agni can be weak or strong, and there are foods and pranayama (breathing techniques) that can strengthen it. If your Agni is weak you may have a tendency to overeat, not exercise and have problems with digestion. The beauty of Ayurveda is that there are herbs & spices (like cayenne and ginger) and wholesome foods to strengthen your digestive system and build up that fire! Burn baby, burn! Ojas \"Ojas\" refers to vitality. It is connected to your immunity, strength, and longevity. The stronger ojas you have, the stronger your health will be. This can be strengthened by your diet and eating nourishing \"sattvic\" foods. For example, legumes, whole grains, seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds are all sattvic. Alcohol, refined sugars, processed and frozen foods and stimulants such as caffeine deplete our ojas. I'm not saying you can't still have your wine & chocolate... ...but everything in moderation. Ama Ama. No, not the Indian woman who gives magical hugs... ... Ama, in this case, means toxic, undigested substances. Ama gets stuck on the cells and promotes disease & discomfort in the body. If you have too much ama or toxins, a Panchakarma treatment with the right practitioner will do the trick. Think of it as a clogged pipeline. If it's all backed up and nothing can flow through it, then substances just accumulate into a thick, cloudy mess. Gross right?! Well, that's what happens to our human bodies if we don't take care of them. 1. Eat the rainbow (in fruits and veggies). The more colorful and abundant your plate is, the happier your body will be. And I'm talking about natural, organic fruits & vegetables\u2014nothing processed or artificial. Of course in Ayurveda, they have their own special guidelines, and this includes adding these 6 tastes to your meal: sweet (local, organic honey) salty, sour (Himalayan salt or lemon) pungent (chili pepper) bitter (asparagus) astringent (pomegranate) This also helps with those with overeating and snacking tendencies. Have you ever tried an Indian [thali](https://www.pinterest.es/pin/535576580661798675/?lp=true)? Yum! The thought of this delicious platter just makes my eyes light up and my mouth water. In India, eating with their hands is normal. This makes eating food more fun (and messy)! But actually, eating with your hands improves your digestion and makes you more connected with your food. When touching food with our bare hands, the sensory nerves on the end of our fingertips signal to our body to stimulate digestion. 2. Practice yoga and meditation daily. Getting into a routine of doing yoga and meditation can boost your health and wellbeing immensely. Yoga and meditation are [ scientifically proven](https://chopra.com/articles/ask-dr-sheila-what-is-ayurveda) to reduce stress and increase neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins. This means your \"stress\" hormones decrease, and the natural, happy hormones increase! Yoga and meditation increase your awareness, helps you to center and ground, and improves your life expectancy. 3. Improve your digestion. Remember the whole talk on 'Agni' and 'Ojas?' Quick quiz: What does the Sanskrit mean? a. fire b. water . . . ...If you guessed the letter 'a' you are CORRECT! Just keeping you on your toes here. Rule #1 of eating: Don't eat when you're upset. This is otherwise known as emotional eating. Rule #2: Eat only when you feel hungry. Ayurveda says don't eat if you aren't feeling hungry. Ie. when you have the flu the body naturally doesn't want food so it can heal. Hunger is a good excuse to eat something, well duh. Rule #3: Don't eat while standing or driving. The more presence we have with our food, the more our body is able to digest it. Eating while walking or running just doesn't make sense in Ayurveda. Rule #4: Eat slowly. Savor your food. Until the very last bite. Eating too fast causes a tendency to overeat. 4. Get plentiful, uninterrupted sleep. Sleep is soooo important! When we get restful sleep, our body is able to repair and heal itself. When we are sleep-deprived this is when we are more likely to get sick and develop chronic conditions. Here are some natural ways to promote better sleep: - turn off all electronics and lights 30 minutes before going to sleep - practice Yoga Nidra - listen to a guided meditation for sleep - rub lavender essential oil into your palms and inhale deeply - self-massage with herbal body oils 5. Connect more with nature. One of the reasons we are so disconnected from ourselves and each other is because we don't spend enough time in nature. I get it. Most of society is stuck at their tiny cubicles for 8 hours of the day with little to no sunlight and often feel too tired to do anything else but get home, pour a glass of wine and fall asleep with their phone in their hands... ...but come on... pencil in some Mama Nature time. Make it a priority at least 1-2 times per week or more, to replenish your soul. Walk barefoot in the grass, go on hikes with loved ones, create a garden, or go on a mini weekend camping trip!! What is the difference between Ayurvedic and Modern Medicine? Great question. Western medicine tends to use drugs and surgery to get rid of a disease. Of course, this method saves lives and is needed in extreme situations... ...but if you have an imbalance, like a chronic disease, depression, being overweight... ...and are open to alternative healing... Perhaps Ayurveda can help you get to the root cause of your dis-ease. I personally have never done a Panchakarma cleanse, but I did have an Ayurvedic massage while I was in India and I loved the herbs, oils and spices the woman used on my body and rubbed into my scalp. I smelled like a masala dosa afterwards, but after spending some time in India you start to smell like a walking array of Indian spices anyways. What does a practitioner do? So an Ayurvedic doctor or practitioner has a special way of assessing you\u2014to see what is out of balance. They check the pulse and observe your tongue, eyes and body. Sometimes they ask questions like how your bowel movements are, but observation says more than words. The online quizzes to find out your dosha can be super fun, but nothing quite beats the precision of an actual consultation with a trained Ayurvedic practitioner. What is an Ayurvedic retreat? An Ayurvedic retreat will teach you about your constitution and how to eat right for your body type. They can include a [detox](https://bookretreats.com/14-day-ayurveda-juice-detox-retreat-kerala-india), [weight-loss treatments](https://bookretreats.com/14-day-weight-loss-ayurveda-yoga-retreat-kerala), yoga, meditation, Ayurveda therapy and massage or [spiritual connection](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/india). If you are looking to do an Ayurvedic training, you can get your 50-hour or 100-hour certificate. How much does an Ayurvedic treatment cost? Depending on where you go they can range from $1,000- 3,000 USD. It will be more expensive in Europe, but India will be the most budget-friendly. What is an Ayurvedic spa? An Ayurvedic spa includes different massage treatments and therapies for balancing your dosha. Warm herbal-infused massage oils and soothing strokes will drift you off into the most heightened state of relaxation you will ever experience. Are there any side effects of Ayurvedic medicine? There shouldn't be any side effects, but of course since Ayurveda uses herbal treatments and medicine that isn't regulated. Pregnant woman CAN have Ayurvedic treatments, just be sure to let your practitioner know. Ayurveda can help with fertility and pregnancy.
