This wholistic approach is customized to each client, emphasizing prevention, self-care and optimal health for children and adults. This natural approach addresses the root cause of an illness or disease. It allows for profound healing of the body and promotes well-being. Naturopaths use the following treatments to help restore health: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, vitamin/mineral therapy, detoxification, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and life counseling. Naturopathic physicians are licensed healthcare providers who specialize in the natural prevention, evaluation and treatment of health challenges and disease. Naturopathic physicians attend graduate school for 4-5 years which includes clinical training. The schools are nationally accredited by the Council for Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). The CNME is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education which classifies the Naturopath Degree (ND), as a doctorate Professional degree, on par with MD (Medical Doctor) and DO (Doctor of Osteopathy). Currently, 7 institutions are accredited to provide this doctoral level naturopathic training in the United Sates and Canada. Students are trained in the same foundation science and pathology courses as traditional medicine schools. Hands-on clinical work is incorporated throughout the educational experience. Residencies are available post graduation. Dr. Janet received her medical science education at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in Toronto and her clinical medicine training at Bastyr University in Seattle, Wa. She completed her Naturopathy Residency at the Wholeness Center in Ft. Collins, Co. Her previous training in Occupational Therapy was completed at Boston University and University of Kansas. Her massage training was completed at Finger Lakes School of Massage, Ithaca, NY. The philosophy of Naturopathic medicine is what sets it apart from traditional medicine. Naturopathic physicians address the root cause of health challenges or diseases and do not settle for masking symptoms. This approach allows for profound healing of the body and promotes well-being. Once the underlying cause of health issues are addressed, the symptoms naturally resolve or decrease on their own. The beauty of Naturopathic medicine is that Naturopathic physicians have comprehensive training in medical sciences and natural medicines; allowing them to integrate both worlds. The latest in evidence-based scientific studies and age-old healing traditions provides the patient with success in restoration and prevention of health challenges. Naturopathic medicine is founded on the healing power of nature, which means that the body innately knows how to correct and rebalance itself. Given the necessary ingredients of good diet, exercise and rest, our bodies have the buoyancy and skills to remain in good health. The role of the Naturopathic physician is to guide the individual to optimal health care and identify and remove any obstacles to cure. A complex interaction of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and spiritual factors are all involved. For true health and well-being to occur, all of these factors must be considered. Patients are partners in their health care and supported by Dr. Janet on their own healing journey. The body has the inherent ability to establish, maintain, and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent and is a response to environmental inputs. The physician's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to act to identify and remove obstacles to health and recovery, and to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Illness does not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered and removed or treated before a person can recover completely from illness. Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of disease. Symptoms, therefore, should not be suppressed by treatment. Causes may occur on many levels including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The physician must evaluate fundamental underlying causes on all levels, directing treatment at root causes rather than at symptomatic expression. Illness is a purposeful process of the organism. The process of healing includes the generation of symptoms which are, in fact, an expression of the body's forces attempting to heal itself. Therapeutic actions should be complimentary to and synergistic with this healing process. Methods designed to suppress symptoms without removing underlying causes are considered harmful and are avoided or minimized. Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism involving a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. The physician must treat the whole person by taking all of these factors into account. The harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual is essential to recovery from and prevention of disease, and requires a personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. Beyond an accurate diagnosis and appropriate prescription, the physician must work to create a healthy, sensitive interpersonal relationship with the patient. A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inherent therapeutic value. The physician's major role is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for health. The physician is a catalyst for healthful change, empowering and motivating the patient to assume responsibility. It is the patient, not the doctor, who ultimately creates/accomplishes healing. The physician must also make a commitment to his/her personal and spiritual development in order to be a good teacher. The ultimate goal of any health care system should be prevention. This is accomplished through education and promotion of life habits that create good health. The physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and makes appropriate interventions to avoid further harm and risk to the patient. The emphasis is on building health rather than on fighting disease. Naturopathic physicians use diet, nutrition, botanical medicine, detoxification, vitamin and mineral supplements, physical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and life-style counseling to address the root cause of an illness or disease. Currently 22 states, the District of Columbia, and the Puerto Rico and Virgin Island territories have licensing for naturopathic doctors. This license is granted to naturopathic doctors who have attended a 4-5 year residential naturopath medical school and passed an extensive postdoctoral board examination (NPLEX). Licensed Naturopathic physicians must fulfill state-mandated continuing education requirements annually. North Carolina is high on the list to be one of the next states to obtain licensure for Naturopathic physicians. The North Carolina Association for Naturopathic Physicians (www.ncanp.com) welcomes your support in passing this legislation. Most Naturopathic physicians in North Carolina hold a license in another state to protect patients from unqualified practitioners. Dr. Janet's Naturopathic license is from Washington State. Naturopathic Physical Medicine is hands-on therapy to address restrictions, imbalances, and tensions in your body. Dr. Janet is highly trained in this area and has expertise in Craniosacral therapy, Lymphatic Massage, Orthopedic Medical Massage, Neurodevelopmental Therapy, Myofascial Release, Sensory Integration, Scar Releasing, and Visceral Manipulation. Dr. Janet combines her Naturopath services with this bodywork for clients who need specialized care. WNC Naturopathic Medicine WellSpring Wellness Center 966 Tunnel "}
