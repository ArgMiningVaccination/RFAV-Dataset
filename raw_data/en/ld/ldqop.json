Dr Maurer- Board Member As we talk about the numbers of citations, have you addressed anything about the severity of those citations has evolved over the years ? Response: The next step in 2022 is to look at scope and severity. b. Mike Bibo - Board Member One of the things that the Long Term Care Advisory Board has looked at is the number of complaints and if they are valid or invalid , under Nursing Home Act section 3 -702 G 5 says the Long Term Care Advisory Board shall review the Departments Annual Report concerning the complaint process including the number of complaints received, the breakdown of anonymous and non -anonymous complaints, and whether the complaints were substantiated or not. Will we be seeing that in the near future? We usually see it in July or August. Response: This will be placed on the agenda for our next LTC Advisory Board Meeting. c. Mike Bibo - Board Member Under Nursing Home Act 3 -518, we are supposed to review the Departments report to the General 5 Assembly, the LTC Advisory Board and the State Ombudsman is due by January 15th and we have not reviewed that this year. Response: This will be placed on the agenda for our next LTC Advisory Board Meeting d. Kevin Taylor - Board Member The data presented , is this from the Annual's, complaints, or both? Response: The data is from the annual surveys and complaint surveys. e. Mike Bibo - Board Member Regarding the economic and fiscal impact of adopting those regulations that the Department purposed. It is the Departments stance that it is not their responsibility to provide us with that economic evaluation, although the Nursing Home Care Act 2 -204C say s during the LTC Advisory Boards review of the rules the board shall analyze the economic and regulatory impact to those rules. We are supposed to be analyzing it not proposing it. But the Department has taken the position that it is not theirs to provide and we should provide it. So, we looked at the proposed regulations having to do with Infection Preventionist. We estimate an economic impact of about $175,000 per facility. To hire and Infection Preventionist it is going to cost us $70,000 - $100,000 plus benefits, to get the clerical staff to monitor and track the vaccination records and all that of the staff, of the contract personnel, the students, the volunteers, of the residents personal physicians and all that. So, we estimate that $175,000, for 700 facilities roughly in Illinois that would be $122,500,000. Illinois healthcare is putting that on the table, and I would like the Department to respond to that. Response: I will take your question under advisement regarding the economic impact of regulations. Is there data to substantiate any increased cost per facility. f. Mr. Bibo - Boar d Member Knowing what an RN costs with specialty interests with any sort of Long -Term experience. Knowing what the cost of Clerical Staff for facilities is going to cost plus adding 30 -35% benefit factor on top of all wages, that's how we based it. I t is t oo early to tell whether that's going to result in those benefits, in later data after it's been in place for a while but not at this point. g. Ron Nunziato - Board Member Agreed with Mr. Bibo's economic impact and went on to add that we're looking at $100,0 00 on the low side. I have been talking about the Infection Preventionist being and unfunded mandate from the get-go, and the initial proposal to these regulations . So, whether its $100,000 - $150,00 the impact of having less infections there is no financial impact. Unless the department is going to change the regulation to say, you don't need a full -time infection control preventionist if you have less than 10 infections or less than 20 infections. So, regardless if the facility has 0 or 50 infections going on in the building, we still need that position. We still need to pay those benefits; we still need to collect data that's required within these new regulations. Tim Bledsoe - Board Member Add that facilities under 100 if they do any type of infusion the rapy, they still have to have this position, so it affects facilities under 100 also. 6 Response: Please provide any financial impact information for the board to review. 1. V. Public Comments a. Henrietta Reader - I am a parent of almost 40 yr. old whom lives at Ann Kindly Center in Waukegan. I am also the president of the friends of Ann Kindly Center. About 199 residents currently living there with a variety of Developmental Disabilities in the moderate to severe range. Both physical and mental impairment. The re ason for me to call in is to discuss the position that was made that all residents who are taken out of the building overnight. They go home for an overnight visit and they come back , they must be placed in transmission -based precautions for 14 days, regar dless of the that the individuals are fully vaccinated along with their parents. This is really a hard thing for someone who is mentally handicapped to go through. We understand the need for control infection and so forth. Most of these cases these parents have compassionate care rights as well and to have them not be able to have their individual stay overnight because they fear that the effect individual going back and into isolation for 14 days would be detrimental for their individual. (Henrietta gave an example of one family's struggle with regression.) I get calls or emails from parents as the president of our support group. The Kindly Center is currently in outbreak status due to the staff, none of the residents have had COVID since they were vaccinat ed. I just wanted to bring this to your attention with the hope that perhaps this rule could be somehow altered, or exceptions be made for certain individuals who clearly need the comfort of their family. Deb Burdsall responded as follows: What we a re lo oking at in the community with COVID and the Delta variant and how the positi vity rate in the community over the past two weeks have skyrocketed. To your point exactly that the concept of making the other clients and members are protected anytime anyone goes out overnight this has sort of been going on through the pandemic, and compassionate care visits for residents are available . We understand and to the point this may change if the positivity rates in the community come down this may change again but rig ht now when you look at all of the information that is coming out about immunity in vaccinated persons, it's about risk and benefit. This was a well measured well considered approach to things, especially as we are now seeing in LTC settings in June there were actually more cases in vaccinated persons then in non -vaccinated. We will keep monitoring. b. Dr. Karen Kelly - My son lives at Murray Center and I want to comment about the rules. I have 40 years' experience in Health Policy and this 14 -day isolation is bad Health Policy. My son was hospitalized for four weeks this summer, he has an unhealed abdominal wound. He came home the other day shortly after the rule was announced , on a Friday afternoon or evening. We planned to bring him home after a wound asses sment. We have decided to keep him at home as long as we can. My husband and I are both 70ish. My son is sever ely autistic, 6 foot 5 inches and functions at the level of a 3 -year- old cognitively. My son is at a greater risk for reinfection at Murray Cente r and in the community where he lives Centralia, Illinois than he is at home with his dad and I. We live in O'Fallon, IL, and our vaccination rate here is above the Regional Average for the Metro East. Centralia is far below the average for the Metro East. It's ironic an unvaccinated staff member could take him on a trip to Walmart. If we take him back now, he will spend two weeks in isolation. When he was previously isolated during the early months of the pandemic and through the 1 st twelve months, he lost 50 pounds during those months when he could not see his father and I live but only by video conference. I have been told by very compassionate leadership that they will place him in a room and check on him often, but my son needs activity due to blood clots in his lungs. He is not going to get that activity walking in a 15 by 16 room. He is high risk for other reasons as well. I have looked through the Federal Regulations from both the CDC and CMS and I don't see anything that really advises this kind of stringent 14 -day isolation. As a matter 7 of fact, there are places where it specifically says that those who are fully vaccinated should not be put in isolation just because of exposure. We've had plenty of exposures at Murray Center by staff who have refused to wear masks or be inoculated. Who will eventually if they want to keep their jobs because not only the Governor's decree but also the Presidential decree that all Long -Term Care works be immunized? I don't know how long we will be able to keep him at home. He is thriving at home and we do have compassionate care, we could take him and bring him home on a regular basis however we live an hour away. I just think that after a year in the pandemic the infection disease specialists finally should recognize that those who have cognitive or intellectual disability are at greater risk from isolation because isolation kills too. I have sent a letter to IDPH I have outlined my son 's unique circumstances and needs. This is not based on evide nce and I have challenged them to show me their evidence. Delta variant has an incubation period of about 3 days, the original had an incubation period of about 6 days. I don't see anything that justifies a 14-day isolation for someone who does not tolerat e isolation . My son being autistic needs to have his routines, 14 days in isolation by himself will put him back where he was months ago after almost 60 -pound weight loss during the initial period of the pandemic. Sheila Baker thanked Dr. Kelly for her c omment and added that she would take her comments to the appropriate place as they are looking for recommendations for changes or issues on how this is affecting the Long- Term Care community and see if there are any update or changes. c. Denise Shovette- I am also a parent of a resident at the Murray Center and I am also on the advisory board for the Murray parents' association. My son is in his 30's and he is soon to be in his 20 th year being a resident at Murray center. My son is severely autis tic, he is 6 foot 9 inches tall and he is like Dr. Kelly's son he has to have consistency and the things he cherishes the most are the activities that go on at the Murray Center, like Career Beginnings program and the programs they have there that he can participate in, as well as seeing his family. We are all fully vaccinated and the idea of coming home every 3 to 4 weeks is a real happy time for him. Then getting to go back after a couple of days and getting back into his normal routine. Going to seeing h is other extended family at Murray Center is as well. I agree with the last two speakers, 14-day isolation after being home for a day or 2 or more, is just not right for a person that is fully vaccinated. Going back to a facility where only 33% of staff is vaccinated, at home we are fully vaccinated, he has of being more exposed there than he does at home. We feel like my son is being punished for going home and being well cared for. We are all being observant of who is vaccinated and who is not, who he get s to see when he is home. We do follow the guidelines here and everything that is put before us, but this 14 -day isolation thing is horrible. My son is a child, a young man that needs activity. He needs that consistency in his day to day activities and daily living. He is an outside boy he loves to be on the patio and just be outside, and when he doesn't get to do that he will find a way to do that, he is that smart he looks for opportunity to escape. They caught him climbing over a fence and had to pull him off and this is when he wasn't in isolation. This is just not conducive and helpful for him at all. Thank you very much. Sheila Baker thanked her for her comment and advised she would discuss it with others in IDPH. d. Barbara Conners - I have a so n at Murray Center, he was just put into isolation for 14 days because he did have a COVID exposure. After his isolation I brought him home because he had been cooped up for 14 days. A couple of days after he came home this new policy came out, now he has to go back into isolation fully vaccinated with unvaccinated staff for 14 days. I am hoping to keep him home and this policy has changed quickly. I don't understand the difference between coming home for overnight or under 24 hours, if you are out in publi c you are still exposed the virus. Sheila Baker acknowledge the comment. 8 VI.
