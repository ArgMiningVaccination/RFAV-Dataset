BY JUAN ENRIQUEZ 46SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 7 [ PUBLISHER'S LETTER ] It was an unusually cool eve - ning during the summer of 2000 when I strolled from my office on Madison Av - enue in New York City, me - andering through Central Park, to my home on the Up - per West Side. While my gait was light, my thoughts were heavy. I was a few years into my nascent career in the field of science media and had been wondering if I had indeed chosen the right path. In the previous week, I had taken the LSATs, thinking that law might be a more rewarding and lucrative field. I knew the world was rapidly changing in this new millennium, with the rise of internet start-ups and \"disruptive\" digital technolo - gies, but was unsure of my place in it, or what a traditional career like publishing would look like amid these seismic shifts. A few blocks from my apart - ment I came upon a newsstand and, as is still my habit, paused to gaze at the collage of headlines and cover stories. In a marquee slot, Time magazine's latest edi - tion hung, featuring two famil - iar giants in the world of science on its cover: Francis Collins and Craig Venter, the mappers of the Human Genome. The two would soon join President Bill Clinton at the White House to mark a water - shed in the genomic era\u2014a precise draft of life's blueprint. Suddenly, a wider swath of the population beyond scientists would be buzz -ing about the promise of new pos - sibilities for better health. Something about this new buzz resonated with me, both profes - sionally and personally. Sensing a renewed energy in scientific story - telling, I chose to stay in the world of content and publishing. I also had a deeply personal stake in this revitalized national conversation on health: Many members of my father's family had been ravaged by neurodegenerative disease and, from an early age, I experienced the hope and then inevitable frus - tration of failed therapies and clinical dead ends. Unlocking the blueprint of life was a major step for biology, but most diseases are too complex to pin to a single gene. They result from multiple gene mutations, in - teracting with the environment and guided by behavioral factors, microbes, and other bodily chemi - cals, influencing the proteins that genes produce. Now we are on the next itera - tion of the post-Human-Genome era, using data-gathering bioin - formatic tools to harness insights into the complex interactions of our genes, behavior, environment, gut microbes, metabolites and other disease-influencing actors. This massive undertaking is being championed by some of the pioneers upon whose work the original human genome mapping effort was built. Pioneers like Le - roy Hood, whose latest endeav - or, the newly formed Phenome Unlocking the blueprint of life was a major step for biology, but most diseases are too complex to pin to a single gene.Health, is a collaborating partner for this special volume from Sci - entific American Custom Media, dedicated to a renewed discus - sion of health and wellness. I had the pleasure of meeting Lee through my longtime friendship with Robert Lee Kilpatrick, a lead advisor for this project, and a his - torian of science as well as a bio - tech entrepreneur. I am glad to have stayed in this profession and to have the pleasure of working with people like Lee and Robert, and some of Phenome Health's key collabora - tors, including Google. This mul - tidisciplinary alliance is emblem - atic of the breaking down of silos separating the many scientific dis - ciplines relevant to human health that has to occur if we are to see meaningful progress in address - ing chronic conditions. Read on to see how these stakeholders are coming together in unique and productive ways. On the personal front, I still hold out hope for health's bright future, as complex and daunting it may be to make a meaningful impact on the health of millions of people. We are all soldiers in the war on disease and hope that our arsenal of tools, data, insights and human ingenuity can relieve the world of some of its suffering and pave the way for a healthier tomorrow.

He also told me that if you want to fundamentally change the way a discipline, such as medicine, is practiced, invent a new technology. Technology was the focus of my interest in hu- man complexity. It occurred to me that medicine at the time was like the blind people and the elephant. Each was feeling a diff erent part of the animal and declaring it was a spear, or a fan, or a stump. That was an especially apt analogy for medicine at the time, because the blind people were all feeling the outside of the elephant. I was convinced that we needed more tools to plumb the complexity of the human body. We needed a way to look inside the elephant. Blood, I re- alized, is a window into health and disease because it bathes all organs, which release their telltale molecules. If you could read these molecules, you could infer the state of the internal organs. Another important tool is big data. We needed to generate an enormous amount of data, not only about our genes, but also our phenomes. In other words, we needed to analyze the complex interactions between the individual and the environment, and how these interactions aff ect our health. Years later, after my colleagues and I invented DNA sequencers and other technologies aimed at peering inside the elephant, we realized that we needed to use these tools for the purpose of keep-[INTRO ] A New Strategy for Keeping People Healthy BY LEROY HOOD Making \"well care\" a reality will require a radical change in how we think about health care. ing people well. The future of health care lay in our ability to predict the onset of disease, prevent it from happening, and doing this in a way that was personalized to the individual. In recent years we have gotten pretty good at the three Ps\u2014predicting, preventing and personalizing\u2014but we need to add a fourth: participation. We need to use the best tools of behavioral psychology to engage people in being active participants in maintaining their own health. This story is the evolution of what we're now call- ing scientifi c wellness. We now have the tools and the know-how to in- crease the number of healthy years a person can expect to live. We know how to improve the quality of people's lives, attend to an aging population and handle a steady rise in chronic disease. We can do these things for less money than we now spend on an outdated paradigm of medicine\u2014treating illness rather than preventing it in the fi rst place. And we can use these tools to fashion a more equitable and compassion- ate system of health care that helps many of the least fortu- nate people among us who are currently left out. Changing big institutions is never easy\u2014and that is es- pecially true for the multi- trillion-dollar medical industry. Making this vision of well care a reality will require a radical change in how we think about health care. In the meantime, a new generation of scientists and engineers are building the tools.

She was concerned, she said, about my TMAOs. \"My what?\" I asked. \"Your TMAOs,\" she repeated, referring to trimethylamine-N-oxide, a metabolite excreted by bacteria in the stomach that can increase risk for heart disease if levels get too high. Who knew? Not to worry, said Hultin in a soothing, upbeat voice. I could reduce my score by cutting back on red meat, which TMAO-secreting bacteria love to gorge on. Trimethylamine-N-oxides were part of a bat - tery of tests I had taken a few weeks earlier when Hultin's employer, a Seattle start-up called Ari - vale, had collected copious amounts of my blood, saliva, and stool to test hundreds of biomark - ers. These included DNA markers, proteins, me - tabolites, lipids like cho - lesterol, and the microbi - ome in my gut. The company had also sent me a Fitbit to mea - sure steps, sleep and heart rate. Online they had asked endless ques - tions about my health, medical history, happiness, stress and more, to add to my digital health report card\u2014information that was integrated with my other data using advanced computers and algorithms to produce the report. The goal was for me, a basically hale and hearty man in my fifties, to find out just how healthy I really was\u2014and would be. Hultin asked me to scroll to a section called \"Genes\" in my online Arivale profile. \"Do you see the finding about vitamin D?\" she asked. My result for a gene called VDR indicated that I had a mutation that makes it difficult for my body to absorb vitamin D. \"This is probably why your vitamin D level is low,\" she said, referring to yet another section of my pro -The Phenomics Revolution Science is poised to shift the focus of health care to well care\u2014the prediction and prevention of disease\u2014rather than just treating the sick BY DAVID EWING DUNCAN file. Not dangerously so, though she suggested that I start taking a vitamin supplement. I was impressed. I had spent years as a reporter trying out hundreds of newfangled tests like these to see what they might reveal about the health of an actual human, findings that I had chronicled in my 2009 book Experimental Man and in dozens of ar - ticles before and after, including a 2017 story in NEO. LIFE , \"The Radical Idea of Avoiding Sickness\". Most of them, however, had been too new, experimental, and incomplete to tell me much. Arivale's data and analysis was different. It seemed more scientifically sound. More important, it seemed believable. Yes, the company was testing just a small num- ber of biodata points, a few hundred out of the thou - sands that might be in - fluencing, say, my risk for heart disease. Nor was TMAO likely to have an immediate influence\u2014or much influence at all, compared with other risk factors\u2014on whether my heart would keep happily beating, or would one day seize up. Yet the report was telling me things that few people learn from standard exams. I was also being given choices based on my own specific data about how to intervene in my own healthcare\u2014for instance, to rein in the burgers and BBQ pulled pork sandwiches or face the consequences. At the time, I remember feeling like I had just gotten a checkup from the future, something that scientists and entrepreneurs had repeatedly prom- ised me during my experimental man project, but seldom delivered on. This wasn't surprising given the complexity of human biology and the newness of the science, although I had been wondering when all of this would finally come together to make a difference in keeping me in tip-top health. Could the advent of Arivale be the moment?The science and technology to help us predict and prevent diseases is arriving. The big task now is to make it work for millions of people. 10 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS12 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 13As it turned out, it was not. Two years later, Ari- vale folded, a victim mostly of high costs. Few cus- tomers were willing to pay $3,400 for a profi le, or even $99 a month, to which the company eventually slashed its price. But Arivale did signal the dawn, or perhaps the predawn, of a new era in health care that in 2022 seems even closer to being realized. It's called scientifi c wellness, a fi eld that collects and analyzes reams of biodata and uses it to keep you well rather than waiting for you to get sick before taking action. One way to look at scientifi c wellness is to think of it as \"well care,\" rather than the \"sick care\" that is the current standard of care in the U.S. and the rest of the world. \"Well care\" means keeping a person healthy, which doesn't at fi rst glance seem radical. Yet it is, in part because the sci- ence to delve deeply into the se- crets hidden in our genes and in other molecules like TMAO was, until recently, unavailable. Now the data is arriving, even if much work remains to make sense of it. Scientifi c wellness may be poised at last to usher in a new health-care paradigm, in which people will routinely get Arivale- style tests and analysis. This will include getting a dashboard of risk factors like most people have never seen before that will track transitions from a state of wellness to a state of disease. It will be like getting weather forecasts about a personal future of possible maladies, and what can be done now to prevent them. Scientifi c wellness is already aff ecting how scien- tists and physicians are using phenomics in research and diagnosis (or prediagnosis) to develop new and potentially better treatments for everything from cancer to brain health. This new approach also is be- ginning to aff ect the worlds of business, policy, and ethics in health care, while at the same time driving fresh innovation in fi elds like artifi cial intelligence and computing. \"The science and technology to help us predict and prevent diseases is arriving,\" says Leroy Hood, a physician and biologist who founded Arivale. Hood, 83, has been a leading fi gure in precision health for more than two decades, since long before the science was ready and the term \"precision health\" even exist- ed. \"The big task ahead of us now,\" says Hood, \"is to take all this and make it work for millions of people.\" A New Approach To do this, Hood recently launched another endeavor to jump-start the age of scientifi c wellness that is much more ambitious than Arivale. It comes as other wellness eff orts are gathering steam, including gov- ernment-sponsored projects like biobanks that have been for years collecting DNA and other biodata on millions of people, and are just now starting to use new technologies and discoveries to make sense of it. The private sector is also delving into treasure troves of new data, including drug companies that hope to use it to develop new pharmaceuticals. A handful of start-ups are also developing risk-profi le tests and algorithms using biobank data. These in- clude Genomics PLC , headquartered in Oxford, Eng- land, which is working with the Manchester-based, UK Biobank to develop risk scores for dozens of dis- eases, including heart disease, diabetes, and several cancers. The company is tapping into DNA, elec- tronic medical records, and other biodata that was collected (with consent) from 500,000 Brits. Other fl edgling businesses, such as Alden Scientifi c in Bos- ton, are in the early stages of creating complex pro- fi les of biodata for individual consumers. Hood's new venture is called Phenome Health , a name derived from the term \"phenomics\"\u2014the sci- ence of measuring one's phenotype. This refers to a person's state of health at any given moment as infl u- enced by their genes and from changes in other mol- ecules, such as proteins, in the body\u2014plus the impact of diet, lifestyle, age, and other factors. Phenome Health, says Hood, is a variation on Ari- vale, but with several key diff erences. \"First of all, it's a nonprofi t. We realized that before all this will work commercially, there is still some basic science and research to be done, and economies of scale that need to happen to bring the costs down.\" Hood also is planning to raise far more money than anyone else working in phenomics\u2014a whopping $10 billion. He hopes to fi nd it not from investors or even tradition- al grants but from the U.S. Congress\u2014a big ask in Washington these days, but one Hood is convinced he can make happen. Another lesson learned from Arivale is that they needed more people and more biomarkers to allow their analysis to draw fi rmer and more comprehen- sive conclusions about risk. \"We need to include a lot more people,\" says Hood, \"and run them on a lot more tests,\" which is why he wants to recruit one million volunteers to give samples in the U.S. for a project that will run for 10 years. His wish list of biodata includes not only sequences of complete genomes\u2014a person's entire DNA, which now costs around $600 per genome\u2014but also thousands of proteins, those compounds in the body made by cells from instructions from DNA that include everything from enzymes and hormones to structural elements in skin, hair, fi ngernails and more. Phenome Health also plans to collect everything from bacteria in the gut to metabolites like TMAO, which are chemicals that our bodies\u2014or bacteria living inside our bod- ies\u2014create when they break down food, drugs and other chemicals. \"We're planning to test for 3,000 proteins,\" says Hood, far more than Arivale. \"We're probably go- ing to do 2,500 metabolites,\" he adds, also a deluge compared to past eff orts, \"and a whole variety of key clinical chemistries, including levels in your body of environmental toxins like mercury.\" Phenome will collect data on brain health working with brain-test- ing company Posit Health, a partner that's signed up to assess 25 cognitive functions, and to create a digi- tal neural profi le. Recruits also will be asked to use wearables like Fitbits that measure not only steps, sleep and heart rates, but also oxygen levels, heart variability, erratic pulses like atrial fi brillations, and daily calories con-sumed. Plus, they will run standard blood tests like creatinine and cholesterol. All this data will be crunched using advanced ar- tifi cial intelligence and machine learning that also will incorporate subjects' medical records, journal articles and other medical information, all to pro- duce a state-of-the-art phenomics report card. Doc- tors will be able to use this report card to assess a person's current and future health and to help their patients, as Ginger Hultin helped me using my Ari- vale data, to start any preventive measures that need to be taken. A huge concern with collecting all this intimate health data is privacy. We live in an era when even banks and secure government data\u2014not to men- tion health information collected by doctors, hospi- tals, insurers, and by health apps on our phones\u2014 are sometimes hacked. \"Of course, we will institute state-of-the-art security measures to protect people's data,\" says Hood. Still, security breaches will remain a possibility, just as they do for people who do their banking on apps and conduct other aspects of their lives on digital systems. A Long and Winding Road Hood's obsession with phenomics goes back more than 40 years to when he was at the California In- stitute of Technology in the 1970s and 1980s, when he fi rst became interested in applying information technology to biology. This horrifi ed his colleagues, who in those days preferred to work directly with organisms and ecosystems and didn't yet realize how There's a lag between the development of technologies and convincing doctors and health-care systems that those technologies are valid and worthwhile. A Brief History of Scientific Wellness 1982: Leroy Hood, a physician and biologist then at the California Institute for Technology, develops the gas-phase protein sequencer to determine the order of amino acids in a protein. It's the first of several groundbreaking scientific instruments to analyze biological molecules.1970s: The first genes are cloned. Frederick Sanger develops a method for sequencing DNA and uses it to sequence the first-ever complete genome, the virus PhiX174.

CRICK, NATURE, 171, 737-738 (1953) 1960s: Scientists crack genetic code and largely work out how DNA produces proteins. IMAGE: M. H. SAIER JR., JOURNAL OF BAC TE- RIOLOGY, 201, 15 (2019)The notion of using science to keep people healthy was well underway when genes were found to be made of DNA. It continues with technology that harvests data on wellness and spots early signs of disease. 14 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 15 important computers and digital databases were about to become to their fi eld. \"My colleagues in the biology department tried to move me to engineer- ing,\" he remembers, even as he worked back then to co-invent some of the fi rst advanced DNA sequenc- ers. This included technology that later became the core to Applied Biosystems, the fi rst major sequenc- ing company, founded in 1981. Parting ways with Caltech in 1991, Hood moved to Seattle, where he headed up the Department of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Washington before founding the Institute for Systems Biology in 2000. This was another radical notion of his\u2014that biologists should be studying entire systems of molecular and physiological activity in cells and organisms\u2014 and at a time when the norm was a reductive approach that isolated and studied single genetic biomarkers and highly focused functions and systems. Around this time Hood coined what he called the \"Three P's\"\u2014Personalized, Predictive, and Preventative\u2014as an early way to describe his vision, and later added a fourth\u2014Participatory\u2014at the sug- gestion of Google co-founder Larry Page. In the early 2000s, the science was driven mostly by genetics, as the Human Genome Project was fi n- ishing the fi rst-ever sequence of a complete human genome, a 10-year-plus project funded by Congress for $2.7 billion ($5.5 billion in 2022 dollars). Excite- ment around DNA was at a fever pitch as geneticists discovered gene variants like APOE4 , a mutation that is a strong indicator of Alzheimer's disease, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 , which indicate high risk for breast cancer. Biotech companies like Genentech were also developing new drugs such as Herceptin, which tar- gets a genetic mutation in the HER gene that causes various cancers, including stomach, esophageal, and breast, shutting the gene down. Geneticists were also discovering genes for rare and often devastating dis- eases like cystic fi brosis and Fragile X syndrome. Science in the early 2000s, however, remained a long way off from realizing Hood's visions for scien- tifi c wellness. What was available using molecular markers was almost exclusively genomic and focused largely on single genetic letters\u2014the A, T, C and G of DNA\u2014and how diff erences in these letters, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), seemed to be correlated with a higher risk for disease. For in- stance, a G instead of a C might slightly bump up a person's risk of getting bladder cancer, although a few years later scientists discovered that the eff ect size of these single letter mutations in causing dis- ease tended to be very small compared to other risk factors like age, diet, and other genes. Scientists back then were also talking about assessing the combined eff ects of multiple genes (polygenics) and biomark- ers like proteins and metabolites. But using these multiple biomarkers for determining disease risk re- mained costly and mostly beyond that day's techni- cal capacity. Only in the last decade did Arivale become sci- entifi cally feasible. Founded in 2015, it ultimately tested 5,000 people. Although this population wasn't particularly large, given the ambitious goals, it was enough to get some preliminary results. \"We were able to monitor 167 individuals as they transitioned from wellness to sickness over a four-year stretch,\" he says. \"We looked at ten of these people who then transitioned to cancer. In every case there were pro- teins that were way off the scale compared with the normal average. We mapped them into disease-per- turbed networks and projected what the transition was going to be.\" Arivale proved the concept of scientifi c wellness, which is why Hood considers it to be a success even though it failed as a business. Experiments to Come Having proved the concept, the next task is to deepen the pool of data and expand the insights that can be gleaned from it. That will require building workable platforms, honing methods, gathering more baseline data and developing new and better technologies. Computers need to be taught how to recognize criti- cal information within a fi rehose of unstructured data. Iya Khalil , a theoretical physicist turned bio- AI expert who is the global head of the AI Innova- tion Lab at Novartis, says that much more needs to be done. \"This stuff is really complicated,\" she says. \"Right now, we're better at using this data for rare diseases that are easier to identify and predict. We need to work on building it out for more common diseases that have multiple risk factors. But it's be- coming much more real than it was before.\" The current state of scientifi c wellness is analo- gous to the Human Genome Project in the 1990s, says Hood. Although it had a big price tag, it helped the nascent genomics industry scale up its capabili- ties, which ultimately brought costs down. \"We think that will happen with phenomics,\" he says. \"Prices are already falling,\" says Rory Collins, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Uni- versity of Oxford and the chief executive of the UK Biobank, the government- and private philanthropy- sponsored project that has genetically sequenced 500,000 Britons, and is planning to add phenomics biomarkers to their scores that predict future risks for several diseases. This is part of the initiative de- veloped by Genomics PLC, in Oxford, that recently announced polygenic risk profi les for 28 diseases. By using UK Biobank data, for instance, Genomics PLC was able to provide risk assessments for apparently healthy people\u2014such as a 40-year-old man with no symptoms or family history of heart problems who, it was revealed, is at high risk for heart disease by the time he turns 60. Other biobanks, such as the Mas- sachusetts General Brigham biobank at Harvard, are also developing polygenic risk profi les and plan to soon include proteins and other markers. Phenome Health's eff ort would be larger than any of these\u2014if Hood succeeds in procuring twice the amount of funding that the Human Genome Project raised in the early 1990s.

He's looking to power a new ecosystem, and not looking for 'How do I make money off this data?'\" Without such a basic eff ort, she adds, \"we will contin- ue doing health care in the same way we do it now.\" Hood suspects there will be a consumer-based \"phenomics-and-me\" style company spinning out from Phenome Health in future years when costs come down and more data is collected and analyzed. Right now, Phenome is working on a spin-out company based on the modular computer platform they're building to analyze the data they're planning to collect. Some scientists ask why Phenome Health needs to recruit one million new people to study when doz- ens of biobanks and institutions around the world already have recruited and genetically sequenced millions of people. UK Biobank has now fi nished complete sequences of their entire cohort of 500,000 people. \"There is a risk that setting up a new cohort will mean waiting another 10 to 15 years to get data that we already have tracked for over a decade,\" says Collins. \"It might make more sense to look at these cohorts that have already existed for a long time, and then think about which ones you might enhance with more depth in order to create your million or your two million.\" Hood counters that a new cohort can set out from the beginning to use the latest technology and build into it continual updates as they happen. Also, most risk profi les coming out of biobanks have tests for perhaps a few hundred thousand or a million SNPs\u2014those single letter genetic markers\u2014instead of nearly every one of the six billion nucleotides that come with sequencing a complete human genome, which is what Hood plans to do. \"I think most of the SNP data is utterly trivial and it's totally inadequate for what you can do now. No one is collecting as much data as we plan to,\" he says. However, the UK Biobank's Collins confi rmed that they have now fi nished complete sequences of their entire cohort of 500,000 people. (Data from the fi rst 150,000 was released earlier this year in a study in Nature , which announced the discovery of almost a half-billion new genetic variants, far more than were known before.) Diversity is another challenge for many biobanks. Most existing repositories include data from over- whelmingly white populations, which misses the rich diversity of human genetics. To remedy this short- fall, Phenome Health plans to work with its partner, Guardian, to tap into their large cohort of Black, His- panic, and other marginalized people in the U.S. It's also a social justice issue, given that diff erent eth- nicities have diff erent genetic proclivities\u2014variations that need to be better understood to improve pre- diction and treatment. \"We need greater diversity to better understand the human gene pool,\" Hood says. Another hurdle to bringing scientifi c wellness to more people is a resistance to deploying phenom- ics in the clinic. \"There's a lag between the devel- opment of technologies and the ability to convince doctors and health-care systems that those tech- nologies are valid and worthwhile, and suffi ciently cost-eff ective or valuable to incorporate them into health care,\" says Robert Green, a medical geneticist at Mass General Brigham Hospital, and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies how to bridge the gap between novel technologies and clinical practice. For instance, women are not routinely tested for BRCA1 and 2 genes to determine their breast cancer risk. These tests are available and well-established, but they have yet to be integrated into the daily workfl ow of most physicians. \"How do you fi t this into the 15 minutes that doctors have with their patients?\" asks Green. Standards are also lacking on how much evi- dence is needed to prove that a predictive test is good enough to be used routinely in the clinic. Nor are set pathways and rules established for how the FDA evaluates predictive DNA and other molecular tests. \"We've got to get there,\" says Green, \"but the challenge is implementation, not vision.\" The way to gain acceptance, Hood believes, is to convince a few key physicians to sign on. That starts with working with them in demonstration projects and clinical trials. But he isn't looking just to doc- tors and other providers to drive the shift to well care. He also expects patients to drive change, too. \"Once well care reaches a critical mass of new people who taste its benefi ts,\" he says, \"they are going to see how transformational this type of health care is, and they're going to demand it.\" With Phenome Health, Hood is convinced that his long quest to bring precision health to millions of people may be fi nally on the brink. \"I'm absolutely convinced of it,\" he says, with his trademark broad smile, intensity and optimism. If he's right, it may not be too long until everyone will have a Gin- ger Hultin calling them to discuss their TMAO and genetically infl u- enced vitamin D levels, or whatever bubbles up from their own report. After I got Hultin's news about my TMAO, I opted to cut back on the burgers and BBQ pulled pork sand- wiches. A few months later, she called back, her voice cheery as ever, to go over my results from a fresh round of testing. My TMAO score, she reported, had shifted to normal. With her help, I managed to make at least a small gesture towards staving off heart disease, now and, hopefully, in the future.

SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 19 A FOCUS ON WELLNESS In the future that scientifi c wellness researchers imagine, health problems will be spotted before they start, using data from mul- tiple areas\u2014say, diet, microbe and genetics as indicators of colon cancer risk.

These would be captured by surveys and screenings. screenings. screenings. METABOLITES Small molecules called metabolites are found in cells, fl uids and tissues. Because they are infl uenced by both genes and the environment, they off er powerful clues to the underlying biochemical activity in the human body. This in turn can yield signs of impending disease long before symptoms appear. GENOME Genes are a key element in understanding underlying disease susceptibility, and it's aff ordable now to sequence an individual's genome\u2014their entire set of genes.

PROTEINS Proteins are chains of amino acids that act as antibodies, enzymes, and other key critical components in organs and blood. Large-scale analysis of pro- teins, or proteomics, can yield insight teins, or proteomics, can yield insight into disease, and researchers keep into disease, and researchers keep fi nding new links to study. fi nding new links to study. What Is the Phenome? Scientifi c wellness promises person- alized health care that spots the ear- liest signs of disease and intervenes to stop it from developing. A person might inherit a gene for cancer, for example, but diet, medication and exercise changes can lower the chance that cancer will develop. This requires detailed snapshots of their genes (what's coded in DNA), but also other major factors that predis- pose us to either wellness or disease, including their body's gut bacteria (microbiome), proteins and other biomarkers, as well as their life his- tory, nutrition and environment. This integrated picture is the phenome.INFOGRAPHIC: COLLECTION METHODS A personalized data cloud for an individual requires sampling a range of biomarkers. In a pilot study led by Jennifer C. Lovejoy, research- ers relied on a half-dozen diff erent methods.

But times are changing. After decades of effort and hype, scientists believe they are on the cusp of being able to tell, from this data, just how healthy each of us is right now, and to augur with some accuracy whether, and when, we might later become ill. Possibly no scientist has fought harder to reach this goal than phy - sician and biologist Leroy Hood. At the nonprofit Phenome Health, his latest effort to shift the mod - ern paradigm from sick care to well care, he is planning to recruit one million people and collect from them a blizzard of molecular data. Mashed together with medi - cal records, measurements from wearables and other devices, assess - ments of brain health, and more, Phenome plans to use AI-armed supercomputers to crunch all this data and produce what Hood is calling a \"phenomics\" profile\u2014a report card designed to untangle and describe a person's state of health in detail at any given time and arm people with information to stay healthier for longer. He talked to David Ewing Dun - can of Scientific American Custom Media about his new project. [ Q&A ] Revealing Our Life's Secrets Leroy Hood plans to recruit a million people and kick-start scientific wellness. BY DAVID EWING DUNCAN DAVID EWING DUNCAN : Can you describe your idea of how people move from wellness to sickness? LEROY HOOD: I'm interested in being able to assess and optimize the health trajectory of each indi - vidual for body and brain health. This trajectory has three differ - ent phases. Most of us start in the wellness phase. Then we go through a transition from well - ness to disease. The aim of Phe - nome Health is to gather powerful statistical evidence for early tran - sitions for every single chronic disease before it's ever clinically diagnosed. Alzheimer's is the one we're starting with. Describe the Beyond the Human Genome Project\u2014you're collecting thousands of data points on each person? We're starting by sequencing a million people's complete ge - nomes, and for each person we'll also analyze 3,000 proteins, 2,500 metabolites, and all the lipids, plus environmental toxins like mercury. We're going to do the gut microbiome twice a year, and we'll use wearable data for things like sleep and heart rate variabil - ity. We'll also assess each person's brain health\u2014that is, 25 different cognitive features. And much, much more. You want to raise $10 billion to pay for this, mostly from the U.S. government. Why so much? And is this feasible? My argument is that for $10 billion we can do a demonstration project that will create the infrastructure so anybody can do this in the fu - ture. That's a database and how to manage it. It's a biobank and how to manage it. It is modular, computational platforms that handle every aspect of gathering samples, generating data, putting that in the cloud, doing the analy - sis. We know this will not be easy to raise, but we have supporters in Congress. How will you make sense of all this data? There is a new kind of AI called HyperScale AI that's going to move way beyond statistical correlations and be able to give us directly causal inferences and mechanis - tic data in a way we could never get before. I think we should take this enormous calculation engine and educate it in several impor - tant ways. For instance, let's feed it everything on PubMed so it has access to all of the published data. Why do you need to start from scratch with one million more peo - ple to test? Wouldn't it be cheaper to go to, say, the UK Biobank and the 500,000 people they've already genetically sequenced? What's missing from all the ge - nomes in the UK Biobank are the phenomes. The genome is a kind of source code, and it tells you some interesting things. But you integrate it with phenomes, and it moves you into a completely new dimension. What about diversity? Most genomes sequenced so far, and much of the data and analysis, are about white people. We've designed our program to reflect the population diversity of the U.S. We've done this by hav - ing a partner, Guardian Research Network, that interfaces with 120 hospitals and 30 million patients in 13 states across the South and Southwest. They lie across ma - jor African American and Latino populations, and others. How do you plan to take this huge research project and implement it in the clinic and with regular people? First, you get a small cadre of phy - sicians you've convinced, and you work with them in a demonstra - tion project that's compelling, and it explodes outward from there. There also is cost. We're going to save enormous amounts of money on drugs. We have biomarkers that will tell you for some drugs which 10 percent of the population they work on, and you can save the oth - er 90 percent the cost of the drugs. We're confident that the future of health care is well care, and that it will save money and allow people to live longer, healthier lives.\"The aim is to gather powerful statistical evidence for early transitions for every single chronic disease before it's ever clinically diagnosed.\"SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 23\u00a9 JONATHAN KNOWLESHuman beings are complex. Unfor- tunately, our current approaches to health and medicine are based on simplistic models that fail to take into account the intricate relation- ships between body, mind, and our social and physical environments. Our health-care system rarely considers that humans are products of both nature and nurture and that our minds infl uence our bodies, and vice versa. We give short shrift to diversity in both ethnic and social backgrounds, even though it's well known that both play a major role in health. Worse, we generally don't seek information about our health and well-being until we develop symptoms, by which time it may be too late to reverse the transition from wellness to disease. More than a decade ago, a group of us at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle began to think about how the practice of medicine could focus more on wellness than disease. Rather than waiting until people get sick, what if we found ways of helping people stay healthy? Part of what inspired this question was the tre- mendous amount of data becoming available through advances in technology, such as low-cost genetic se- quencing. These tools emerged from \"multiomics\", which collectively refers to new data-driven fi elds of inquiry into the body's many biological constitu- ents. The \"omics\" in the name comes from the com- mon methods used to analyze four diff erent types of constituents: proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), genes (genomics) and gut bacteria (microbiomics). Since then, we've developed these ideas and honed them through research with thousands of people. We've found that the copious \"omic\" data becoming available gives clinicians an opportunity not only to diagnose disease, but also to take the measure of an individual's state of wellness. We are developing ways of using this data to identify early signs that things are going off track\u2014in other words, when a person begins the transition from wellness to illness. And we are fashioning interventions that get them back on track before and during this disease tran- sition, sometimes avoiding disease entirely. These interventions need not be drastic or invasive. Even small changes to diet and exercise or targeted supplements could poten- tially head off obesity, dia- betes, heart disease and other ailments before they have a chance to develop. The key is to intervene early, before the onset of dis- ease. By informing these interventions with behav- ioral science, we've been able to deliver interventions that people actively incorporate into their daily lives, often with dramatic results. We are now focused on fi lling the research gaps in our understanding of disease transitions and how to prevent them\u2014what we have come to call \"scien- tifi c wellness.\" At the same time, we need to remove many practical roadblocks to realize a truly preven- tive and personalized approach to medicine. But nev- ertheless, our work has demonstrated unequivocally that this approach could vastly improve health-care outcomes compared with today's disease-centric medicine. And because it is preventive, it could gen- erate considerable cost savings. Using Data to Live Longer, Healthier Lives Making small changes to diet and exercise or adding targeted supplements has the potential to head off many ailments before they have a chance to develop. But fi rst we need to ground these changes in solid data. BY JENNIFER C. LOVEJOY The opportunity to defi ne and optimize individual healthful- ness and generate important scientifi c discoveries is clear. 22 22 22 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS 24 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 25 able possibilities that would ameliorate or potential - ly reverse any risk factors for disease. For instance, someone with high cortisol would be supported in developing a daily stress management practice and given a series of exercises to identify and address their stressors. Or an individual who was 20 pounds overweight and had been trying unsuccessfully to lose weight on a low-carbohydrate diet would be educated in a dietary pat - tern that aligned with their weight-related genetic pro - file. In some cases, such as for people with low levels of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acid levels, we would recom- mend a dietary supplement. Each participant then began a series of health coaching sessions with a registered dietitian, who provided behavioral and nutritional support. The blood mark - ers, gut microbiome and lifestyle data were assessed every three months so we could determine the im- pact of the lifestyle coaching on wellness. The Pioneer 100 Pilot Our inquiry into scientific wellness began with a pilot study, called Pioneer 100. This project was initiated by Leroy Hood, a physician-scientist who brought me in to help create the clinical protocol and oversee the study. I had conducted academic research in obesity, diabetes and women's health and had also had execu - tive roles at health and wellness start-ups, and I was fascinated by the potential of big data combined with behavioral science. The questions we sought to an - swer in this study were ori - ented toward proving the concept of scientific well - ness. We wanted to find out if people who believe they are well have actionable op - portunities to optimize wellness or prevent disease. We also wanted to know if there is enhanced value in integrating different data types to quantify wellness. Could we identify novel discoveries with multiomic data, even with a small number of participants? And how would participants respond to a scientific well - ness intervention? We recruited 108 healthy volunteers to participate in a nine-month study seeking to both quantify and optimize wellness. The first thing we did was gather baseline data, which we would later use to develop action plans, perform scientific research and assess the program's success. We collected data on a vari - ety of health measures. Rather than rely on surveys of food intake, which are notoriously unreliable, we measured nutritional biomarkers\u2014molecules in the blood that give a more accurate indication of what an individual is eating. (In general, in this study we re - lied on measurements of biomarkers, which could be made with precision, rather than self-reported dis - ease or conditions.) We had the volunteers wear Fit - bits that monitored their physical activity and sleep. We also took a variety of lifestyle and psychologi - cal assessments, which we shared with behavioral coaches, who helped the volunteers develop and im - plement personalized action plans to reduce risk fac - tors. And we gathered multiomic data\u2014we sequenced their genomes, sampled their gut bacteria, and mea - sured their metabolites and proteins. This gave us a total of six types of data which we would be able to mine for novel insights: clinical, lifestyle, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and gut microbiomics. Once we had reviewed the baseline data, we drafted for each participant an individual lifestyle intervention plan, which included a range of action -We found more than 14,000 statistically significant correlations between our six data types.The results of the study were compelling. At base - line, all participants had multiple actionable possi - bilities. Some had out-of-range results on standard clinical tests, such as high cholesterol or glucose lev - els. Many had nutritional deficiencies, genetic risk factors for various conditions, or gut dysbiosis (an imbalance of gut microflora). We found more than 14,000 statistically signifi - cant correlations between our six data types (see \"Phenome Discoveries\" on p. 26). Many of these cor - relations led to greater personalization of recom - mendations, such as the ability to use genetics to better optimize dietary tips. And several generated novel discoveries that could be subsequently tested in clinical trials. For example, we found that a cer - tain liver enzyme (gamma-glutamyl transferase, or GGT) was associated with multiple risk factors for cardiometabolic syndrome, a group of metabolic dys - functions that raise the risk of coronary heart dis - ease, stroke, and diabetes. We also found that higher gut microbiome diversity was associated with lower inflammatory proteins. We also created polygenic risk scores (which ex - amine the cumulative total of hundreds or thousands of single mutations related to a particular disease) and observed alterations in blood markers associ - ated with these scores that could be early indicators of disease. For example, we found that a high poly - genic risk score for inflammatory bowel disease was associated with lower levels of cystine, an amino acid metabolite, in the blood, and that a high polygenic risk score for bladder cancer was associated with higher levels of a metabolite of caffeine. Future stud - ies could be designed to examine the role of these biomarkers in development of disease in people who are at risk, potentially leading to future treatments or preventive strategies. More important, we found that behavioral coaching was effective in driving significant clinical improvements across various in - tegrated biomarkers. Study participants were highly enthusiastic about this approach. Broadening Our Reach On the basis of Pioneer 100's success, in 2015 we launched Arivale, a genetic testing and personal health coaching company. One goal was to bring the benefits of scientific wellness to large numbers of consumers. We also wanted to create a unique da - tabase of multiomic data from individuals, collected over time, that could be mined to generate scientific discoveries and novel clinical treatments. Over four years, Arivale provided multiomic data and behav - ioral coaching to more than 5,000 people, most of whom enrolled for two to three years. This gave us a deep longitudinal data set and opportunities to see significant improvements in wellness. Arivale's scientific wellness approach had a sub - stantial impact on the lives of its participants. Brad (not his real name), a man in his 60s who was an avid hiker, suffered from progressively worsening pain in his ankle that his physicians were unable to diag - nose. Baseline multiomic data showed that he had very high blood levels of ferritin, a biomarker of iron stored in his cells, and two copies of a genetic vari - ant related to hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease and a common genetic disorder in people of European descent. It turns out that one of the symp - toms of this disease is joint pain. Untreated, hemo - chromatosis ultimately leads to multiorgan failure and death. We referred Brad to his physician, who ultimately diagnosed him and several members of his family with the disorder. The treatment for hemochromatosis is straight - forward: regular blood donation until iron levels re - turn to normal. But since clinicians do not routinely measure ferritin levels or genetic risk, they typically don't discover hemochromatosis until it is signifi - cantly more advanced. Although early diagnosis did not reverse Brad's ankle pain, it most likely avoided major damage to his heart, liver and other organs down the road. \"REBECCA \" Age: 40s Gender: Female Likes: Athletic activity Phenome anomaly: Elevated cortisol levels that stayed high throughout the night.

Some of the links are known disease indicators, and others are meaningless for clinical work. But a few, researchers believe, represent new links that further study will turn into life saving diagnostics.INFOGRAPHIC: One particular gut metabolite, trimeth- ylamine-N-oxide, or TMAO, has emerged recently as a key marker for cardiovascular dis- ease. Arivale researchers identifi ed other parts of the phenome\u2014including proteins, metabolites and lifestyle choices\u2014that are correlated with elevated TMAO levels. The GC gene helps cells capture vitamin D. People with GC variants and low vitamin D levels might be put on supple- ments\u2014and monitored closely to fi nd the right dose.By closely monitor- ing the hormone cortisol, which regulates appetite, sleep and stress, researchers identi- fi ed participants who were skipping meals, harming their adrenal health.A few Arivale participants received cancer diagnoses during the program. Retrospective study revealed several cancer-linked proteins in their blood months or years before diagnosis. As proteomics grows, early cancer detection will likely become more common. In 2020, researchers compared genetic risk for elevated cholesterol with actual measured LDL. By sampling about 100 people, they confi rmed earlier research showing that participants with higher genetic risk had consistently higher LDL levels.ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) remains a largely mysterious neurodegenerative disorder. Data from nearly 5,000 Arivale participants helped link ALS, a T-cell-produced protein, and high omega-3 and low omega-6 levels.Arivale participants on the high-fat keto diet had elevated cholesterol that appeared only after a detailed panel identifi ed small LDL molecules that the standard tests had missed.

His lifestyle data showed that he fol - lowed a Paleo-type diet consisting mostly of meat and dairy products with few vegetables. Since low intake of fiber is associated with poor gut microbi - ome diversity, we coached Kevin on how to increase his intake of fiber-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruits and intact whole grains. After six months, his gut microbiome had improved but was still not normal. Spurred by his ongoing elevated inflamma - tory profile, Kevin followed up with a gastroenter - ologist who diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease. Since this was caught much earlier than it normally would have been, his doctor was able to initiate treatment and hopefully delay or prevent some of the long-term complications. Furthermore, what Kevin learned about his digestive issues and gut mi - crobiome pattern helped him choose a diet that was much healthier for his unique biology than the one he'd originally followed. From the standpoint of scientific discovery, the data generated through scientific wellness inter - ventions has also proven to be of value. Our work formed the basis of published papers on topics in - cluding predictive risk factors for metastatic cancers, gut microbiome in aging and obesity and the impact of a scientific wellness intervention in patients with early-stage cognitive decline. Conventional Wellness vs. Scientific Wellness Most general wellness programs tend to focus on nutrition, physical activity, stress and sleep, which are all proven methods to improve health and pre - vent disease. The difference with scientific wellness is that it approaches these same interventions with a rigorous, data-driven mindset. For example, our clients at Arivale often had been taking dietary supplements for nutrients for which their blood levels were perfectly normal, or even high. Based on scientific wellness data, they could stop taking the supplements they didn't need. Con - versely, we commonly found certain nutritional defi - ciencies, such as vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and ferritin, which were easily treated. For each nutrient, there are genetic markers that indicate how well a person is likely to absorb or me - tabolize the nutrient. For example, individuals with a specific variant of the GC gene, which codes for a vi - tamin D-binding protein, typically have lower blood levels of vitamin D and may need to take higher dos -es of supplemental vitamin D to get their blood levels up to normal. This sort of tailoring of nutritional rec - ommendations cannot be done without both blood and genetic measurements. Another area where the data-driven approach made a difference was weight loss. Many of our cli - ents came into the scientific wellness program fol - lowing a low-carbohydrate diet, which was popular at the time, and yet struggled to lose weight. Some of them turned out to have genetic variants that cor - relate with greater success at weight loss on a low-fat diet. After a dietitian coach shared this information with our clients, many discovered that reducing fat and increasing high-fiber, complex carbohydrates re - sulted in easier, more sustainable weight loss. For exercise, genetic data can yield information on risk of injury and speed of recovery that is useful for developing tailored exercise plans, especially for athletes or those engaging in competitive sports. The clinical biomarkers of inflammation could also tell us if someone was overexercising, resulting in chronic inflammation, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.To get otherwise healthy people to make changes in their lives, a wellness program cannot rely solely on its data.Stress has a big impact on health, but figuring out how much stress an individual is truly experiencing is difficult. We found that measuring levels of corti - sol, a \"fight-or-flight\" hormone, four times through - out the day\u2014from morning to late evening\u2014yielded useful insight about how our clients were handling stress in their lives. Cortisol, like many hormones, follows a specific diurnal pattern: It is highest in the early morning and then declines throughout the day and evening, reaching a low around midnight, where it remains for several hours before starting to rise again. When an individual experiences chron - ic stress, their cortisol curve may flatten\u2014in other words, it may fail to decline much during the day, or not rise to normal levels in the morning. Poor sleep might appear as an unusually high morning cortisol level, and skipping lunch can lead to a high late-af - ternoon cortisol level, both of which create unusual patterns in the daily cortisol curve. For instance, Re - becca (not her real name), an athletic woman who struggled to lose excess weight, had a stressful job. Her overall cortisol measured very high, and her daily curve was flattened relative to normal. When she realized the impact her work was having on her cortisol levels, she was motivated to find a different and less stressful job. Since high cortisol promotes fat storage and increases appetite, the lower cortisol levels allowed her to lose excess weight. Behavioral Science in Scientific Wellness Data alone does not change human behavior. To get oth - erwise healthy people to make changes in their lives, a wellness program cannot rely solely on its data. For this reason, behavioral science and coaching were key components of our scientific wellness program. Coaching provides motivation, accountability, health education and cognitive restructuring tools to support people in setting achievable goals in service of a larger, personal vision. The vision starts with a person's answer to the question, \"Why do you want to be well?\" Flowing from that vision and from the multiomic data are a series of short-term, specific and actionable goals: swap out two sodas per day with sparkling water, walk for 15 minutes after din - ner three times this week, download a mindfulness app and use it every evening before bed. As each goal is reached, new goals are added to bring the person toward their desired state of wellness. Mindset\u2014what we believe about our health and our healthy behaviors\u2014is an important element of wellness. People who believe they are healthier than others of their same age\u2014regardless of whether they actually are\u2014tend to live longer and develop fewer diseases over time. This placebo effect also applies to lifestyle changes. A Stanford University study showed that when hotel housekeepers were told that the physical activity they engaged in during their jobs met the government guidelines for daily exer - cise, they tended to lose weight and their blood pressure decreased com- pared to a control group, even though they made no measurable changes to their daily activity or diet. The nocebo effect is another im- portant aspect of mindset. The no - cebo effect is a situation in which pa - tients develop side effects or symptoms from a drug or therapy just because they believe the side effects will occur. The classic example of nocebo is when someone is given an allergy test with a substance they believe causes skin reactions and then develops a rash and welt at the site\u2014but the substance was in fact plain water. Nocebo responses are common in nutrition be - cause the gut is highly sensitive to emotional and \"BRAD\" Age: 60s Gender: Male Likes: Hiking Phenome anomaly: Very high levels of ferritin, a biomarker of iron stored in cells Genome anomaly: Two copies of a genetic variant related to hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease Symptoms: Progressively worsening ankle pain, previously undetermined cause Diagnosis: A physician diagnosed Brad and several of his family members with hemochromatosis. Worst case: Untreated, hemochromatosis leads several organs to fail, and the patient dies. Intervention: The patient makes regular blood donations to reduce their iron levels and follows a low-iron diet. Outlook: Brad's ankle pain will probably be with him for life. But by catching the elevated iron levels early, his hemochromatosis was diagnosed in time to prevent major damage to his organs. \"MORGAN\" Age: 30s Gender: Male Symptoms: None Phenome anomaly: levels of lead Intervention: Arivale researchers traced Morgan's lead exposure to a neighbor's renovation of an older home with lead paint. Outlook: Morgan's lead levels weren't high enough to warrant medical treatment and the environmental exposure was temporary, but by identifying the source, Morgan could take steps to limit his exposure by closing windows and running an air purifier. He also worked diligently to avoid other environmental toxins to support his body in detoxifying the lead.Pb8230 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 31 cognitive patterns. For instance, celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes intolerance to the protein gluten, which is found in wheat and other grain products. However, many people without celiac disease also believe they have a sensitivity to gluten. When these individuals consume gluten, they experi - ence a variety of symptoms, which go away when they avoid gluten. Research has shown that mindset often drives this reaction. When some self-identified gluten- sensitive people are given gluten-free bread but are told that it has gluten, they develop the same symptoms they would have if the bread had actually contained gluten. Similarly, when given bread containing gluten but told it is gluten-free, they don't develop the symptoms. The key to changing behavior is to be aware of the power of mindset and its ability to help or harm in our wellness goals, and to leverage the helpful aspects of our minds to the extent possible. In health coach - ing, as with the medical placebo effect, we can use positive psychology strategies such as \"appreciative inquiry,\" which gets people to focus on their strengths and things that are working for them rather than on their perceived weaknesses or barriers to success. For example, a coach might ask someone to reflect on a time when they were successful at making a dietary change and what made it successful, or what types of exercise feel like fun and play rather than a chore. Simply reflecting on these questions often puts the person in a more positive and creative mindset that allows for better problem solving and greater success. But that's not to overlook the power of the data them- selves. Regularly rechecking data for signs of improve - ment is key for motivating people to stick with\u2014or ramp up\u2014healthy new be - haviors. For instance, im- proved diet and exercise show up in altered choles - terol and blood sugar levels, and improvements in stress management can lead to reduced cortisol measures. In some cases, individuals who were initially less engaged with the coaching and behavior change were motivated to improve their life - styles only after they saw their numbers fail to change. Scaling Scientific Wellness Many practical challenges remain before scientific wellness can be widely adopted. Data and behavioral protocols need to be standardized. New laws and regulations will be needed to incorporate personal - ized wellness into standard medical practice. People will need to see for themselves and accept that this approach delivers value to them. New technologies will be important for analyzing and integrating dif - ferent data types and patterns. Artificial-intelligence approaches will help scale behavioral coaching to millions of people, as this cannot feasibly be done solely with human coaches. Research is now addressing some of the gaps in our knowledge of wellness. For example, much of what we know about genetic variants that contribute to health and disease comes from European populations and may or may not apply to non-Europeans. Over the next several years, large genomic studies such as the multiethnic Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, the Human Heredity & Health in Africa (H3Africa) Initiative, and studies in Asian populations expanding on the 2009 HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium are likely to give us the data to begin to incorporate genomic information from non-Eurocentric racial and ethnic groups. We also need to learn more about interventions for modifying the gut microbiome. Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress) or probiotic supplements are the most common approaches. For instance, increas -ing dietary intake of high-fiber foods generally im- proves gut microbiome diversity and overall health at a population level. Only recently have we begun to get enough information to offer personalized rec - ommendations. For instance, we now know that a metabolite called TMAO (trimethylamine-N-oxide) is associated with heart disease. Specific bacteria in the gut produce the precursor to TMAO when red meat and certain other foods are consumed. Know - ing whether an individual has these bacteria allows for personalized recommendations about how much red meat intake is optimal for heart health. Another important emerging area ties the gut mi - crobiome to blood glucose levels and diabetes risk. A recent study from the Weizmann Institute in Israel compared the effects of a diet specifically personal - ized to the individual's gut microbiome vs. a healthy Mediterranean diet in people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The microbiome-personalized diet re - sulted in significantly lower glucose levels and diabe - tes remission in 61 percent of participants. This shows that we can use specific microbiome data to design an individualized diet, and that doing so results in better outcomes than a plant-rich Mediterranean diet. Wearable devices will likely play a significant role in scientific wellness. Nearly 900 different devices and wearable sensors are now on the market, includ - ing smartwatches that measure activity and heart rate as well as devices that measure sleep, autonomic nervous system function, blood oxygen and glucose. Today this technology is underused for wellness\u2014we seem to have more comprehensive and accurate sen - sors for our cars than we do for our bodies. However, considerable investment and ongoing research in both academia and industry are addressing this defi - ciency. New technologies are being developed to au - tomatically measure dietary intake and the impact of diet on key health markers, mental health applica - tions that detect and offer behavioral interventions for anxiety or depression, and women's health-related wearables that track the menstrual cycle, fertility and pregnancy-related factors. Metabolomics and proteomics are still lagging when it comes to clinical applications to scientific wellness interventions. Still, both types of data are providing tremendous scientific insight. For example, a group from Stanford University recently described a metabolite, Lac-Phe (N-lactoyl-phenylalanine), that is produced during exercise and acts to suppress appetite. In lab animals, administration of Lac-Phe suppressed food intake by 50 percent and caused weight loss. However, it will be many years before human safety and efficacy data suffice for this to be used in a clinical setting. In proteomics, clinical and translational findings have emerged primarily in clinical medicine and oncology rather than wellness. The promise of scientific wellness in terms of op - portunities to define and optimize individual health - fulness and generate important scientific discoveries is clear. Unfortunately, consumers don't seem to be willing to pay for data-driven wellness and preven - tion. Until we can get consumers and payers to grasp the value of identifying risk factors and early tran - sitions to disease when they can still be reversed, adoption of scientific wellness will be slow. Govern - ment can help by funding research studies on sci - entific wellness, akin to Pioneer 100 and Arivale's research, that will convince consumers and payers of the efficacy of scientific wellness. Since scientific wellness is foundational to preci - sion medicine, we won't fully realize the benefits and opportunities of one without the other. With some creative solutions to the barriers of cost and mindset, however, scientific wellness can become a standard of care that allows everyone to thrive. Jennifer C.

BY MICHAEL M. MERZENICHjunction barrier in capillaries that keeps blood-based infectious agents and larger chemical molecules out of brain tissues\u2014 limits the detection in blood sam - ples of chemical indicators from the brain that could foretell future neurological decline or dysfunction. Counterbalancing these two disadvantages, there are two major advantages for the brain compared to other organs that support the effective management of its health. First, we have low-cost ways, using scal - able computerized assessment strategies, to identify neurological weakness or distortion, and can now relatively rapidly construct a risk index for a pro - gression to psychiatric or neurological illnesses. For example, we can easily document the speed and accuracy of neurological operations in a patient's brain. Those indices inform us about the physical state of information processes in the brain because, in general, fast and accurate brains are necessarily physically advanced\u2014strongly connected, with well- insulated transmission lines, with highly reliable and stable information transmission, recognition, memory, reasoning and executive control processes. We can also rapidly index the neurological processes governing attention control and the social and emotion - al brain in ways that inform us about neurological limi - tations or distortions that, in the untreated patient, foretell possible down - stream psychiatric and neurological disasters. These same assessments also index the status of the machinery of the brain that controls brain plasticity itself, which equates with the patient's capacity for exercise-driven strength - ening and recovery. Second, we know from a growing number of studies that an advanced state of brain health is a consequence of specific forms of brain engagement, or brain exercise. The brain is like the physical body. When you exercise it in appropriate ways, ev - erything that supports its growing functionality\u2014 including, for example, its blood supply, its intracel - lular metabolic support, its connectional strength and reliability, the machinery that supports its plasticity, and the powers of its immune response, among a long list of other documented positive im - pacts\u2014all strengthen in parallel. Like an appropri - ately exercised physical body, a fast and accurate and reliably controlled brain is necessarily broadly healthier, and, in general, a sluggish and inaccurate brain and impulsive brain is not physically healthy. We're beginning to move into a new era in medi - cal practice, one focused less on treating diagnosed illness and more on broad informative assessments and health management strategies supporting well - ness. We now have tools that enable the routine as - sessment of brain health in a clinical setting. And we are rapidly working toward the day when we can draw on vast amounts of historical and current per - sonal data to reliably record early warning signs that point to future neurological and psychiatric illness. There is every indication that, by paying closer atten - tion to brain health and intervening at the first signs of trouble, we will be able to prevent a substantial majority of neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Our ability to analyze and update a broad range of brain-health-relevant information is rapidly pro - gressing. That information includes data on a per - son's genomics, gene expression, body chemistry. It includes that person's medi - cal history, which can be largely provided by the doc - tor's office. It includes docu - mented life history factors that impact brain health, as well as data on neurologi - cal performance that is col - lected using computerized assessments and wearable sensors. When integrated and subjected to appropri - ate AI analytics, these data will be highly informa - tive about the status of our neurological well-being. To explore these new opportunities, our team at Posit Science\u2014a company that I co-founded in 2014 to translate research advances around brain plastic - ity into new tools to support brain health assessment and neurological resilience, recovery and optimiza - tion\u2014has been working with scientists at Phenome Health. Together we're working to address the re - maining challenges to full implementation of this next-gen medical model. Assessing Brain Health Two challenges stand in the way of routine clinical assessments of brain health. First, while medical scientists have developed many highly sophisticated technologies for assessing the physical and functional status of the brain, practical, scalable tools have not yet made it out of the laboratory into routine clini - cal practice. Second, the blood-brain barrier\u2014a tight It's relatively easy to engage almost any brain in training that accelerates its opera - tional speed and advances its accuracy and reliability. Adoctor would be foolish to conclude that a patient's heart and lungs are healthy merely because they show up alive to the medical office. That's why doctors routinely use a stethoscope to listen for abnormalities, and why they measure heart rate, blood pressure and oxygenation in blood, assess blood cell compositions and blood chemistry, and apply EKG and other simple func - tional indices of cardiovascular-pulmonary health at regular checkups, to head off future problems. In contrast, there is little serious attempt in ev - eryday medicine to manage organic brain health. Even though a majority of people are challenged by a life-degrading neurological or psychiatric illness across a significant span of their lives, there's no equivalent of a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff or EKG to routinely assess brain health during a visit to the doctor. Doctors usually assume that a patient's brain is healthy when they walk into the clinic, hold a conversation, and appear to be sustaining them- selves on an elementary, functional level. LEFT: A visualization of the structural connectivity of aging-related brain areas, produced from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer modeling. 32 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESSSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 35 INPP5D a simple index of brain speed and accu- racy, for example, strongly implies the parallel sta- tus of that long list of physical, vascular, metabolic, immune system and other indices of organic brain health, it can provide clinicians and patients with a powerful simple index of organic brain health. A patient, in a routine clinical visit, can easily com- plete an assessment of brain speed and accuracy in vision, hearing and action control integrated with broader indices of attention, memory, executive con- trol, and social and emotional balance and control. These tools have a diagnostic value for evaluat- ing brain health that are at least equivalent to the multiple measures now used to routinely assess the status of cardiopulmonary health. There is simply no excuse, in modern clinical practice, to continue to as- sume that someone's brain is healthy just because its owner is capable of basic behavioral functioning, any more than it is reasonable to assume that a patient's heart is healthy just because it is beating . This new class of brain assessments supports Phenome Health's broader wellness approach. The data they generate will be integrated with data from genomics, gene expression, blood chemistry, clinical records, personal history records, and wearable sen-sor data. Through AI analysis, these data will inform medical practitioners about brain health and its in- telligent management. Any indication of emergent weakness or distortion in brain function is a well- ness target, and in most of these domains, our highly plastic brain has the capacity to grow its powers us- ing these powerful next-gen tools. The Promise of Managing Brain Health Our neurological health status and the abilities that defi ne our operational personhoods arise from our \"plastic\" brains, molded by our experiences. Every skill and ability that defi nes that operational person- hood is subject to strengthening or refi nement at any age, as personal circumstances evolve. Conversely, gradual diminishment of brain plasticity underlies many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The good news is that we understand how to monitor the brain's health in ways that inform us about how to intervene at the fi rst signs of weakness or decline to put us on a path to sustained wellness. To cite one of many examples of a functional in- dex related to health, \"cognitive reserve\" processing speed with sustained accuracy\u2014off ers a measure of resilience against progression to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. That is another way of saying that faster and more accurate brains\u2014which we have noted earlier are healthier brains\u2014are less likely to progress to disease. Who's surprised? It's relatively easy to engage almost any brain in training that accelerates its operational speed and advances its accuracy and reliability. For example, Posit Science has built a suite of progressive training programs accessed in a computerized \"brain gym\" designed to rejuvenate brain health. Using this sys- tem, called BrainHQ, the average 70-year-old's brain can be trained to match or exceed the performance abilities of an average 30-year-old. Even a very lim- ited dose of such training for individuals in the last decades of life results in broad improvements in neurological fi tness, and in a substantially delayed or reduced probability of progression to dementia or other neurological illnesses. We are now poised to enter a new era of brain medicine in which we track organic brain health and neurological performance, combine it with phenom- ic analysis, and respond to signs of emergent weak- ness or distortion with the full arsenal of wellness and treatment approaches. Lifestyle adjustments and brain fi tness training will be the fi rst line of de- SOURCE: Heath et al., Scienti c Reports, 12, 6117 (2022)New Leads on Alzheimer's Disease More than six million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's disease. Worldwide, that fi gure is estimated to be above 20 mil- lion (and some experts put it closer to 50 million). Alzheimer's has a strong genetic component, but having the gene doesn't guarantee a person will develop the disease. To fi nd clues about how the dementia develops, a team of biologists used data from healthy people in the Arivale cohort. The researchers cast a wide net to snare proteins, metabolites, and other markers of the disease that appear in the blood. These might, one day, provide early fl ags of a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's. The study began with 2,800 healthy people and 25 gene segments known to be linked to Alzheimer's. Five of those segments proved to have correlations with proteins, metabolites, and lab fi ndings in the study population.KEY Each dot represents one marker correlated with an Alzheimer's gene in healthy adults.

These interventions will be backed up, when necessary, by pharmaceutical treatments, medical devices, and surgery. The outcomes of all of these approaches will be documented and analyzed using artifi cial intelligence. Most neurological and psychiatric illnesses arise in brains at risk for progressive collapse. Most ill- nesses are end-stage conditions that develop after an extended period marked by multiple early-warning signs. As the medical world begins to actively man- age brain health, we will discover, in this scientist's opinion, that most of the psychiatric and neurological \"diseases\" that have plagued humankind across the ages are preventable.

The baby seemed healthy, and his par - ents, Tiffany and Rylan, were thrilled. But a few hours later a nurse noticed that Mitchell seemed lethargic and never cried, and monitors indicated that his body was not getting enough oxygen. Mitchell was rushed to the neona - tal intensive care unit at nearby Rady Children's Hospital, where tests revealed that oxygen wasn't bonding to the molecule that car - ries it through the blood, hemoglo - bin, and his red blood cells were dying off. He wasn't nursing, so the hospital put in a feeding tube. Mitchell's doctor ordered CT and brain scans and tested for infec - tious diseases\u2014but she could not figure out what was wrong with him. As a last resort, she suggested sequencing Mitchell's genome. The results from Stephen Kingsmore's laboratory at the Rady Children's Institute for Ge - nomic Medicine came back within about 48 hours. Mitchell had a rare genetic mutation known as hemoglobin Toms River, which prevents oxygen from bonding to the proteins in fetal red blood cells. The mutation\u2014named after the New Jersey hometown of the first patient identified with the problem in 2011\u2014affects only fetal hemoglobin; babies start making healthy adult hemoglobin within a few months. Doctors just had to keep Mitchell alive until that happened. Rady neona - tologist Jeanne Carroll says that \"having his whole genome allowed us to know the starting point\" for treatment. She and Mitchell's team of physicians prescribed a series of blood transfusions, and the baby improved rapidly. In just under a month he was strong enough to go home. 23 and Baby We now have the ability to screen for thousands of genetic diseases in newborns. That may not always be the healthy thing to do BY TANYA LEWIS 38 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 39 tion it can cause brain damage and mental disabili - ties. Within a few years other U.S. states required that Guthrie's test be administered to newborns, and tests for other conditions were soon to follow. By the mid-1980s most states had mandatory screen - ing programs. In 2002 the federal government asked the American College of Medical Genetics to develop guidelines for newborn screening, which culminated in the Recommended Universal Screening Panel, a set of 35 core conditions and 25 secondary ones that are treatable. Most states now test for a subset of these conditions. There are thousands of known genetic diseases in humans, ranging from childhood-onset diseases such as PKU and congenital heart disease to adult- onset conditions such as Huntington's disease and heritable forms of cancer. Some childhood dis - eases, such as PKU, are treatable if caught early. Heel-stick tests look for only a tiny fraction of these diseases, hence the appeal of genetic testing. In the early 2010s re - searchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Human Genome Research Institute launched a program, called NSIGHT (short for New - born Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health), to explore the risks and benefits of DNA screening of newborns. Rady's Kingsmore led one of four projects funded by NSIGHT, which explored the use of rapid, whole-genome sequencing in extremely sick newborns suspected of having a genetic disease. Standard sequencing can take weeks, but using a rapid sequencing method and software that com- pared the genome with the patient's disease char - acteristics, Kingsmore's team could get a genetic diagnosis back in as little as a day or two. For these babies, hours or days can be the difference between life and death or severe disability. The first of two For children like Mitchell who are born with a ge - netic disease, it used to take years to get a diagnosis, and by then it often was too late. Now, however, ad - vances in the speed of genetic sequencing and steeply falling costs have made it possible to screen for hun - dreds or even thousands of childhood-onset genetic diseases. In the past few years, a few dozen hospitals have started offering the ability to rapidly sequence a newborn's genome to help diagnose a life-threat - ening condition soon after birth. Researchers are studying whether such sequencing should be offered to all newborns as part of standard health screening. And companies such as Sema4 and BabyGenes are now marketing 23andMe-style direct-to consumer tests to parents simply seeking to know more about the health of their baby. Prenatal and newborn ge - netic sequencing is expected to grow to a $ 9.5-billion industry by 2027, up from a $4.5-billion market in 2020. Proponents say that ge - netic testing of newborns can help diagnose a life- threatening childhood-on - set disease in urgent cases and could dramatically in - crease the number of genet - ic conditions all babies are screened for at birth, en - abling earlier diagnosis and treatment. It could also inform parents of conditions they could pass on to future children or of their own risk of adult-onset diseases. Genetic testing could de - tect hundreds or even thousands of diseases, an or - der of magnitude more than current heel-stick blood tests\u2014which all babies born in the U.S. undergo at birth\u2014or confirm results from such a test. But others caution that genetic tests may do more harm than good. They could miss some diseases that heel-stick testing can detect and produce false posi - tives for others, causing anxiety and leading to un - necessary follow-up testing. Sequencing children's DNA also raises issues of consent and the prospect of genetic discrimination. Regardless of these concerns, newborn genetic testing is already here, and it is likely to become only more common. But is the technology sophisticated enough to be truly useful for most babies? And are families\u2014and society\u2014ready for that information? In the 1960s microbiologist Robert Guthrie de - veloped a test for phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder that causes the amino acid phenylalanine to build up in the body. PKU is easily treated with a phenylalanine-restricted diet, but without interven -When it comes to genetic information about your child, a lot of people aren't in a position to interpret what the results mean.trials led by Kingsmore took place from 2014 to 2016 at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. The sec - ond ran from 2017 to 2019 at Rady Children's. The group offers newborn sequencing at 23 hospitals around the country. Kingsmore and his colleagues have sequenced more than 1,000 babies with sus - pected genetic diseases, of which about one in three received a diagnosis that identified an illness, and one in four had their existing treatment changed as a result. California and some other states now cover the cost of sequencing critically ill babies through Medicaid. In June, Kingsmore announced that Rady planned to expand its rapid-screening service from critically ill babies to all newborns. It hopes to offer screening for nearly 400 genetic diseases. Mitchell Gorby was one of th e babies who were se - quenced at Rady (but not as part of NSIGHT). Carroll, the Rady neonatologist, says the information \"helped us more confidently give him more transfusions and hold off on other testing.\" It is possible Mitchell may have survived and outgrown his disorder without the test and diagnosis. But in other cases, sequencing has very likely saved lives. Moreover, sequencing proba - bly significantly reduced the diagnostic odyssey such children have to take, Kingsmore says. Extremely sick babies are not the only ones who could benefit from genetic testing. Another NSIGHT project investigated whether sequencing could also be used in clinical settings to screen newborns with no obvious signs of disease. For this study, called the BabySeq Project, Robert Green of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Alan Beggs of Harvard Medical School and their colleagues re - cruited families and randomly assigned half of them to have their babies' genomes sequenced. They de - veloped a list of about 1,500 genes that were highly associated with diseases that begin in childhood or adolescence, then returned information about a sub - set of those genes to the families. The goal was to do the most comprehensive testing possible\u2014to see any - thing and everything that could be discovered about gene-based risks. In January the group reported se - quencing results from 159 newborns\u2014mostly healthy babies but also some ill ones in the neonatal ICU. The scientists found that 9.4 percent of the healthy group were at risk of developing a childhood-onset disease that was not known from their medical or family history, and 88 percent were carriers for re - cessive diseases. So was the testing worth it for parents? A mother named Natalie, who requested we use only her first name out of concern for her family's privacy, has a son who was enrolled in BabySeq. Natalie, who is a physician and lives in Washington, D.C., admits she felt some nervousness about the testing. \"Whenever you have the chance to learn about the health of your child, there's an opportunity for anxiety,\" she says. But overall, she and her husband were comfortable with the project. \"Because they were looking at only genetic defects that affect childhood and only ill -$1,000,000,000 $1,000 2021 2001$100,000 2011 35 genetic diseases can be spotted by blood tests for newborns used in many states. The tests look for parts of proteins or other molecules linked to treatable gene-associated ailments. THE COST OF SEQUENCING A HUMAN GENOME Since the Human Genome Project produced the first human genome in 2001, advances in sequencing technology have reduced costs substantially.

Fortunately, the results of tests on her son, Rus - sell, did not turn up any childhood-onset genetic dis - orders. The exams did indicate that he may be a car - rier for a recessive metabolic disorder called Gaucher disease, but the sequencing of this gene is particular - ly prone to error, so he will need follow-up testing to confirm. For other families, the benefits of sequenc - ing were more clear-cut: one child had a disorder\u2014 missed by standard screening\u2014that makes the body unable to recycle a vitamin called biotin; the condi - tion can cause coma and death if left untreated, but it can easily be treated by supplementation. Although BabySeq was initially focused only on childhood-onset disorders, one baby in the study was found to carry a variant of the BRCA2 gene, which is associated with a high risk of breast and other cancers, so the researchers asked parents for permission to inform them of the risk of adult-onset disorders if they chose. Natalie and her husband opted not to re - ceive this information but said they would leave it up to Russell if he wanted to be tested when he was older. \"We felt it should be our son's decision,\" Natalie says. Because of its complexity and cost, BabySeq was never intended to be a feasible addition to standard newborn screening. \"We have not tried to advocate for this in clinical practice,\" Green of Brigham and Women's says. But sequencing tests are no longer confined to clinical practice. Several companies now offer direct-to-consumer DNA tests for new - borns. The firm Sema4 sells a test for $379 that it says screens for more than 190 genetic conditions that can occur before the age of 10 and that can be treated with medication, diet or other interventions. The company gives results to parents in a genetic- counseling session about four to six weeks after the test. Sema4's CEO, Eric Schadt, says the test can de - tect disease-related genetic variants with 99 percent accuracy. Sema4 only reports results for diseases that have a greater than 80 percent penetrance\u2014the proportion of people with a genetic variant who end up developing the disease. It also discloses informa - tion about the child's sensitivity to certain drugs, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently been pressuring companies not to make such information available, because it says that it has not reviewed the tests and that they may not be backed up by clinical evidence. Schadt admits Sema4 doesn't know whether the kind of testing it offers leads to an overall benefit for patients, although he says the company is doing studies to find out. There are reasons to wonder. The accuracy of these tests in detecting disease is still uncertain. In a third NSIGHT project, led by Jenni - fer Puck, Barbara Koenig and Pui-Yan Kwok of the University of California, San Francisco, researchers sequenced the DNA of dried spots of blood left over from newborn heel-stick tests (California has kept all its blood spots since the early 1980s.) Although the sequencing did detect some genetic conditions that the standard newborn screening panel does not test for, it missed some of those that standard screening caught. And it flagged a lot of genetic variants of un - known significance, Puck says: \"Newborn screening is very different from having a sick individual in front of you for whom you're trying to arrive at a diagnosis.\" When combined with the standard screening, DNA testing did reduce the number of false positives, however. Puck thinks sequencing could be an add-on to standard screening when there's an abnormal re - sult, but she doesn't think it should be used to screen all healthy babies. \"We're just not at the point where we can interpret the sequence with sufficient predic - tive value to say 'yes' or 'no,' this is a disease or not,\" she says. Another issue that concerns physicians and medi - cal ethicists is the possibility that genetic testing will cause unnecessary anxiety for parents about diseases that may appear later in life or never show up at all. genetic testing could lead to a lot of follow-up testing with specialists, which could overburden an already resource-strapped health-care system. If sequencing turns out to save money in the long run, insurance companies may cover it, but there's no guarantee. Yet another problem is that the majority of the sequencing to date has been done in babies whose families are well-off and white, raising concerns that this could become the province of only the privileged. And the racial homogeneity could skew the results: diseases more prevalent in white individuals could be overrepresented in test panels, whereas illnesses more common in racial minorities may be underrep - resented. (New medical data projects intend to ad - dress this disparity.) The U.C.S.F. NSIGHT project included a working group that investigated some of these ethical and policy issues, which culminated in a 2018 report by the Hastings Center, a bioethics nonprofit in Gar - rison, N.Y. The report concluded that newborn se - quencing has many benefits in helping diagnose sick babies and could expand the number of conditions that meet the stringent newborn screening criteria. But using genome sequencing as a replacement for newborn screening is \"at best premature,\" the au - thors say, and direct-to-consumer sequencing should not be used for diagnosis or screening purposes. Barbara Koenig, a professor of medical anthro - pology and bioethics at U.C.S.F. and one of the re - port's co-authors, underscores the fact that sequenc - ing, while promising, is not yet mature enough to be routinely used to screen healthy children. \"This is not a technology that's ready for prime time for use in healthy infants,\" Koenig says. Despite these concerns, the era of newborn se - quencing is now upon us, and the practice will likely become more widespread as costs come down and the results become more accurate and useful. In the meantime, the risks and benefits of sequencing must be weighed on an individual basis. Extremely sick newborns are a completely different case from ap - parently healthy children of worried parents suscep - tible to marketing from genetic-testing firms. For Mitchell Gorby, sequencing was certainly worth it. Two months after he left the hospital, he was doing fine and had doubled his weight. His par - ents had settled into their new routine, somewhat sleep-deprived, but happy to be home with their healthy baby boy. Tanya Lewis is a senior editor at Scientific American who covers health and medicine. Follow her on Twitter @tanyalewis3141,514 genes, each responsible for a different childhood disease, were identified in a research study on newborns called BabySeq. It looked for DNA tied to treatable illnesses, for genes that can affect responses to drugs, and for genes that would not affect the particular baby but could be passed on and cause disease in future generations. 193 illnesses can now be identified through DNA itself, using one of the more popular commercial genetic test panels for newborns, Sema4's Natalis. Like state blood tests, Natalis screens for diseases that are treatable. \"When it comes to genetic information about your child, a lot of people aren't in a position to interpret what the results mean,\" says Nita Farahany, a profes - sor of law and philosophy at Duke University School of Law, who is an expert in genetics and bioethics. \"If they're told their child has a four times greater risk [of some condition], but the population risk is 1 percent, how do they treat their children?\" There is already a shortage of genetic counselors in the U.S., so there would not be enough people to help parents understand their child's genetic results. Then there's the issue of privacy. If the child's ge - netic information is stored on file, who has access to it? If the information becomes public, it could lead to discrimination by employers or insurance com- panies. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), passed in 2008, prohibits such discrimi - nation. But GINA does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees and does not cover insur - ance for long-term care, life or disability. It also does not apply to people employed and insured by the mil - itary's Tricare system, such as Rylan Gorby. When his son's genome was sequenced, researchers also obtained permission to sequence Rylan's genome, to determine if he was a carrier for the rare hemoglobin condition. Because it manifests itself only in child - hood, Gorby decided taking the test was worth the risk of possible discrimination. Cost is another consideration. Clinical sequenc - ing can run $500 to $800, but that may be com- ing down: several firms, including Ultima Genom- ics and China's BGI, have promised sequencing for less than $100. Interpreting those results, however, can add hundreds of dollars to that cost. For fami - lies who can't afford health insurance, this is out of reach. Some experts have also raised concerns that Genetic sequencing \"is not a technology that's ready for prime time for use in healthy infants.\" 42 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 43\u00a9 LAUREN BRENT When Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September 2017, its 155-mile-per-hour winds ripped into a 38-acre islet called Cayo Santiago that lies a half mile off the east - ern coast. This small outpost is home to a colony of some 1,500 rhesus monkeys that has been the subject of hundreds of scientific studies\u2014and the impact of the hurricane on the animals is producing still more. Amazingly, all of the monkeys survived Maria, though some died soon afterward. But their habitat was ravaged. Trees were stripped of their leaves, mak - ing shade a scarce commodity, and the island's tem- perature rose by an average of eight degrees Celsius. Scientists were immediately concerned about the monkeys' welfare. Caretakers rushed to replenish food and repair a destroyed water system. \"It was a terrifying time,\" recalls neuroscientist Michael Platt of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-leads a team that has tracked the biology and behavior of these monkeys for more than a decade. Once the immediate crisis had passed, however, the scientists realized the disaster had opened a door. \"We had a golden opportunity to study the impact of a major natural disaster of the sort that is becoming ever more common with climate change,\" Platt says. The findings of those studies continue to trickle out. A paper published on February 7 in the Proceed - ings of the National Academy of Sciences USA demon - strates how the calamitous disruption to the lives of macaques on Cayo Santiago may have affected their immune system in ways that accelerate the aging pro - cess. The work suggests that storms such as Maria may also lead to premature aging in the people who survive them. More broadly, the work could lead to clues to a mechanism that would explain the effects of natural disasters on disease, wellness and longevity. A starting point for this new research on Maria's impact on the island's monkeys was actually human studies. Humans who survive trauma of various kinds, such as wars, often show chronic low-grade inflammation, elevated rates of cardiovascular dis - ease and other age-related conditions, says Marina Watowich, an evolutionary biology graduate student at the University of Washington and lead author of the PNAS study. And for some types of traumatic stress, scientists have seen hints of molecular chang - es in cells that reflect accelerated aging. But no one had been able to document such changes in the con - text of natural disasters. lows us to identify what are some of the potential factors that might impact the onset and progression of age-related diseases,\" says Noah Snyder-Mackler, an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University and the study's senior author. Storm-stressed monkeys also showed signs of an uptick in the numbers of inflammatory immune cells and a relative decline in cells that suppress in - flammation\u2014shifts the researchers also saw in older animals. Increases in inflammation can lead to or exacerbate many chronic diseases of aging, Snyder- Mackler says. The molecular results are suggestive but not de - finitive, says epidemiologist Daniel Belsky of the Co - lumbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. \"There is no gold-standard measure of biological aging,\" he says. But taken to - gether, Belsky adds, the data indicate an aging of the animals in response to the hurricane. That idea has important public health implica - tions, experts say. \"Since we expect to see many more climate-change-related disasters in the coming cen - tury, quantifying the health costs of exposures will allow us to better estimate the toll these disasters take on our societies and perhaps to proactively in - tervene,\" says evolutionary anthropologist Jenny Tung of Duke University, who was not involved in the research. That toll, Belsky adds, may include a shortened life span and longer periods of disability. Not every monkey that lived through the storm showed signs of accelerated aging\u2014so Snyder-Mack - ler and his far-flung colleagues are investigating what might account for some monkeys' resilience. One hypothesis is strong or numerous social ties. In 2021 a research team that included Platt, Snyder- Mackler and Watowich reported that the macaques reached out and formed more social bonds in the wake of the storm, likely as a coping strategy. Social support is a known protective factor against stress in social species. And in April, Platt, Snyder-Macker and their colleagues reported that the number of so - cial connections in these monkeys predicted the size of certain brain structures. The researchers now want to know if social ties correlate with immune-system re - silience in the macaques. Another question, Tung says, concerns the poten - tial long-term consequences of the molecular chang - es the researchers saw. \"Will animals exposed to the hurricane actually live shorter than expected lives?\" she asks. Ingrid Wickelgren is a freelance science journalist based in New Jersey. These researchers had access to a rare resource: blood samples from the island's monkeys taken be - fore disaster struck. The animals have blood drawn each year as part of a long-term study of how their genes interact with their social environment. So the team was able to compare blood from 435 rhesus ma - caques drawn before the hurricane with blood taken from 108 animals one year afterward. \"You don't typically have before and after samples for humans that are going through horrific events,\" says behav - ioral ecologist Daniel Blumstein of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study. The information from these monkeys \"does of - fer an opportunity, and they really mined it.\" Specifically, the researchers looked at the monkeys' immune cells, which are known to change with age in characteristic ways that can lead to chronic disease. The body's stress response can also influence the im- mune system. So stressful experiences are thought to get \"under the skin\" and lead to chronic conditions by way of the immune system, Watowich says. The researchers found that monkeys that had ex - perienced the hurricane showed, on average, a pat - tern of gene expression in their immune cells akin to that of monkeys sampled before the hurricane that were two years older. \"The average monkey aged about two years biologically, so it's about eight years of human life, which is pretty grim,\" Platt says. The storm seemed to etch its greatest effects on so-called heat-shock proteins, a class of proteins pro - duced in response to stress that assist in the proper folding of other proteins. Blood samples taken from monkeys after the hurricane showed decreased ex - pression of genes for these proteins, a pattern that also occurs with aging. Diminished expression of heat-shock protein genes in humans could raise the risk of illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, in which the misfolding of proteins is implicated, the researchers report in their paper. \"If we are able to show there are these molecular changes, then it al -\"You don't typically have before and after samples for humans that are going through horrific events.\"LEFT: A mother rhesus macaque and her juvenile on Cayo Santiago after the storm.

A Natural Disaster Made Monkeys Age Faster A large colony may provide clues about the biology of traumatic stress resulting from climate change and war BY INGRID WICKELGREN44 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 45 were included: the physical poses, breathing exercis - es, and meditation or mindfulness. The 2020 review paper, led by researchers in Belgium, did not impose this limit and included 34 imaging studies. Gothe admits that this is a \"nascent field,\" most of studies are small and methodologies vary, making explains Jessica Damoiseaux, a cognitive neuroscien - tist at Wayne State University and co-author of the review paper. The significance of having more gray matter volume in these regions is not entirely clear, she says, but \"it suggests there may be more connec - tions between neurons, which can indicate better functioning.\" Damoiseaux's research focuses on aging-related changes in the brain, and she notes that the struc - tures that seem to be beefed up by yoga are ones that tend to shrink with aging, especially in people with demen - tia. The greater volumes linked to yoga are similar to those seen in studies of aerobic exercise. This raises a question: Is there really anything special about yoga, with its meditative components, or is it just another brain-preserving workout? At this point it's hard to say. \"The nice thing about yoga is that it combines a whole bunch of things that are good for you,\" but \"that makes it messy to study,\" observes Catherine Bushnell, a se - nior investigator at the National Center for Comple - mentary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health. In the small observational stud - ies that have been done, it is difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship between yoga and changes in brain anatomy and function. In her own work, for instance, Bushnell has found that veteran yoga practitioners have an increased tolerance for pain compared with non-yogis, and tolerance is associ - ated with increased gray matter in a region called the insular cortex. But she cannot say that yoga is directly responsible. \"It could be something about your personality that makes you want to do yoga, and that same personality factor could contribute to more gray matter,\" she says. Clearer answers will come with better stud - ies that build on the smaller experiments. Gothe, for example, recently received a federal grant for a study that will randomly assign 168 older adults to six months of classes of yoga, aerobic exercise, or stretching and strengthening. The goal is to com- pare the impact of the different regimens on brain anatomy and cognitive performance. Says Bushnell: \"It's exactly the kind of trial we need.\" Claudia Wallis is an award-winning science jour- nalist whose work has appeared in the New York Times, Time, Fortune and the New Republic.

Nonetheless three patterns emerged with some consistency in both reviews: yoga practice could be linked to increased gray mat - ter volume in the hippocampus, a key structure for memory; increased volume in certain regions of the prefrontal cortex, the seat of higher-order cognition; and greater connectivity across the default mode net - work. This network plays a role in processing memo - ries and emotions and \"what we call self-referential processing\u2014processing information about yourself,\" Yoga May Bolster the Brain Regions Most Affected by Aging Brain-scan studies hint that the ancient practice may benefit areas associated with memory, emotion and thinking BY CLAUDIA WALLIS I'll be honest: I'm something of a yoga nut. I've practiced for decades and became a certified yoga teacher a few years ago. But, to be hon - est again, some of the health claims I've heard about yoga make me squirm. Does yoga really fix poor digestion? How on earth can it regu - late thyroid function? In yoga classes, I some - times struggle to calm my mind when a teacher in - vites us to do the anatomically impossible: \"Breathe into your kidneys.\" Yoga is deeply linked to traditional Eastern medi - cine and a view of the body as a system of energy channels and nexuses\u2014a perspective that does not easily align with Western medicine. But since the start of this century, scientific research on yoga has exploded. Many recent studies have found yoga to be helpful as a \"complementary therapy\" to be used alongside more conventional treatments to lower stress, reduce pain and prevent the worsening of symptoms of conditions such as back pain, depres - sion, anxiety and arthritis. Still, yoga studies tend to be of uneven quality, often relying on self-reported survey data. For that reason, I was struck by two re - view papers, one published in 2019 and one in 2020, that focused on a more objective measure: brain scans. Though far from definitive, the findings hint that the practice may improve brain health, and they indicate a way to bring yoga and science more con - vincingly together. The 2019 review, led by Neha Gothe, director of the Exercise Psychology Lab at the University of Il - linois at Urbana-Champaign, examined 11 peer-re - viewed papers that used various types of brain scans to assess the impact of yoga practice on the brain. Six of the studies compared the brains of longtime prac - titioners to \"yoga-naive\" people who were typically matched by age, health, and fitness or level of physi - cal activity. Five examined yoga as an intervention, scanning the brains of subjects before and after they were randomly assigned to a defined period of yoga practice or a control group.

Dozens of fi rms are now off ering aspects of what could eventually grow into an ecosystem of businesses and organizations that provide all the steps in the process of keeping each of us healthy. These steps include administering tests that yield data relevant to an individual's state of wellness, interpreting that data, and providing safe and eff ective interventions to stave off disease. These interventions can be as simple as making it easier for people to choose foods that help them maintain their health, rather than sugary drinks and fries, as well as more targeted actions such as optimizing levels of a vi- tamin or administering a drug. Unlike much of the current wellness industry, these interventions must be rooted in science, personal- ized to the individual and trackable in a way that makes it possible to measure the results over time. Although the scientifi c wellness industry is still in its infancy, a great deal of progress has been made in all three areas: testing, interpreting and intervening. Personal Data An important part of the testing infrastructure for scientifi c wellness is already in place. Numerous testing platforms give insights to individuals or their health-care practitioners to help improve wellness. The vast majority of U.S. adults live within a short drive of labs that can take measurements from blood, which track disease risk factors such as hemoglobin (HbA1c), LDL and HDL cholesterol, thyroid markers, hormone levels, as well as accumulated biotoxins such as lead, mercury or PFOs. Some fi rms are now off ering products to make more eff ective use of data from these standard tests. Inside Tracker, WellnessFx, and others use these kinds of biomarkers to provide personalized insights into nutrition and lifestyle choices. Biological age\u2014 the age your body says you are as opposed to the age the calendar says you are\u2014can provide insights into the health of diff erent organs and biological pro- cesses via common clinical blood measures, such as with the test we developed at Thorne HealthTech. Another way is to use epigenetic methylation mark- ers on DNA, which can be obtained from a test called myDNAge. One way to make testing more eff ective is to make the data collection as easy as possible. For example, at Thorne we recently developed a \"microbiome wipe\" that makes collecting a stool sample as easy as us- ing toilet paper, replacing the old \"poop and scoop\" approach that consumers dislike. Other start-ups are bringing testing now available only in labs or in the doctor's offi ce to the individual. Blood samples can now be collected at home simply, and nearly painless- ly, with devices such as the OneDraw or Tasso. These samples can be paired with commercial health labs for compatible health tests. A device for the home, such as the COR, can provide immediate feedback based on infrared spectroscopy from blood samples, which would be useful for monitoring responses to interventions or behavior changes and measuring the magnitude of change. Genetic testing provides a fundamental basis from which to guide personalized scientifi c wellness. Ances- try, 23andme, and other fi rms have now performed genetic tests for more than 30 million people, provid- ing insights into genetic predisposition to diseases, how well an individual metabolizes caff eine, and more. Many companies provide health advice based on genomics. For instance, 3x4 Genetics produces ge- netic reports intended to be interpreted with guid- ance from a physician. And Self Decode provides personalized diet and lifestyle plans, informed by genetics, directly to consumers, or included in com- prehensive health programs. Much more needs to be done to make genetic test- ing more widely used and eff ective. Although getting access to a genome is as easy as swabbing your cheek and sending it for a commercial test, greater insights will come when we can integrate genomic data with other types of data, such as blood measurements. An individual's genes can predict how successful they will be in lowering their LDL cholesterol through lifestyle interventions, for example. This kind of analysis must be spread across all kinds of health measures if we are to provide each individual with a personalized blueprint for improving health. Wearable devices have great potential to pro- vide data that can contribute to wellness. The Apple Watch, Fitbit and other products now provide infor- mation on activity, sleep, heart rate variability, and more. Such data can be integrated across many de- vices through Apple Health or CommonHealth on Android phones. Continuous glucose-monitoring de- vices, such as the FreeStyle Libre or Dexcom, provide real-time feedback on how blood sugar levels rise after eating diff erent foods. It's now possible to get a Turning Science into a Wellness IndustryA wave of start-up companies off ering evidence-based ways to improve health have created a nascent wellness ecosystem. BY NATHAN D. PRICE The ultimate goal for doctors, medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, insurance com- panies and other health-care organiza- tions is to help each of us lead a longer, healthier life. But at present, incentives in the industry put too much emphasis on treatment and not enough on wellness and prevention. Only about 3 percent of the $4 trillion spent by the U.S. medical industry is currently spent on prevention. Recent advances in scientifi c wellness off er a way to extract more benefi ts from this investment. But science alone isn't enough. Delivering targeted inter- ventions that extend the health-span\u2014the number of years a person lives in good health\u2014of millions of people requires translating scientifi c discoveries into a wellness industry. Wearable technology still has a way to go to reach the full potential of scientifi c wellness.48 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 49Age (years) Weight (Ibs) Height (in) Albumin (g/dL) (mg/dL) Triglycerides (mg/dL) great reading on how well your body controls sugar, a key metric for metabolic health, which is probably the number-one driver of health throughout life for most people. Wearable technology still has a way to go to reach the full potential of scientifi c wellness. Wearables need to encompass an ever greater set of measurements, noninvasively and comfortably, than they do now. For example, devices can now provide continuous monitoring of glucose levels in the blood, but they cannot combine them with measurements of insulin, which would have a big impact on health. Devices also must be able to monitor a much wider range of compounds. No device can accurately and passively monitor the intake of calories, for example. Another way devices can be improved is to more deeply tie noninvasive and passive daily measure- ments to predictions of important health conditions. While lab tests are good as a \"snapshot,\" tests of bal- ance, vision, cognitive abil- ity and other functions fi ll out the picture and are an important way to moni- tor and improve wellness. Brain health monitoring is also important for healthy aging; cognitive training tools such as Posit Science's BrainHQ, supported now by studies reported in more than 200 scien- tifi c papers, can make a big diff erence. Continuing integration of such approaches with deep molecular measurements will provide deep insights into the re- lationship between behavior, nutrition and healthy functioning of the brain. Turning Tests into Action The next step in scientifi c wellness is to turn test- ing data into meaningful insights that can enhance wellness and help each of us to work towards health goals. The two main ways of gaining this insight are through human experts and guided AI\u2014or, more commonly, a combination of both. The key objective is to make the observations actionable for individuals. Since the biology behind scientifi c wellness deci- sions can be complex, this is no easy task. The impor- tant thing is to make sure that the cognitive burden of this complexity does not fall on the individual\u2014 neither the patient nor the doctor\u2014but rather is ab- sorbed in data analytics by whatever company or or- ganization is providing the service. Providers must deliver simple and clear recommendations, backed by evidence that patients and doctors can understand, even when that evidence is hugely complex. Simplicity and transparency are essential for the credibility of the feedback individuals get. At present, too often companies in the wellness industry skip this step and cater instead to people looking for easy answers. This practice has left con- sumers in the diffi cult position of having to deter- mine whether a company's claims for a test or in- tervention are evidence-based or hucksterism. When a product claims to have broad positive eff ects on practically everything, that's a red fl ag. Focusing on trusted brands with long track records or those with high-caliber scientists involved is critical. The same holds for test interpretations aimed at physicians or other health-care professionals, who then provide solutions to their patients. Doctors have a great deal of expertise in their domain, but they can't know everything about every genetic vari- ant and blood marker and the intricate relationships among them. Most impor- tant, practitioners gener- ally have tight time con- straints when dealing with patients and only see them occasionally. Scientifi c well- ness can play a major role through continuous inter- action with individuals as they focus on maintaining and enhancing their health throughout their life. And since medical research focuses on disease, wellness science can fi ll a big gap in data for people who are basically in good health. The analysis of the data sets of scientifi c wellness must lead to simple summaries and clear actions, so the doctor can communicate ef- fi ciently and eff ectively with the patient. The AI that assists in these interpretations must surface the most relevant and pertinent information when it matters most. The logic behind its recom- mendations needs to be understandable to a doc- tor or consumer and cannot just be a black box like search and recommendation algorithms. Transpar- ency makes it possible to integrate the AI with the judgment of experts to know when there might be exceptions or additional context that falls outside the scope of the AI's algorithms. Many companies are developing tools to inter- pret data and suggest personalized actions to im- prove health. Some focus on behavioral change, such as Levels and Noom. Others, such as Thorne HealthTech and DayTwo, interpret microbiome tests to make recommendations about lifestyle, diet and nutrition. Other fi rms, such as January.ai and Nutri- Sense, provide insights based on continuous glucose- INFOGRAPHIC: What Is Biological Age? Chronological age doesn't necessarily correspond with biological age. The data below are from two 44-year-old women who weigh about the same. Almost all of their biomarker levels, taken from blood tests, fall within a clinically normal range for their age and gender, but the levels differ. Both women would be considered healthy by current standards, but according to a trained algorithm called the Biological Age Test from Thorne, a scientific wellness company, one woman's biological age is 39 and the other's is 53. The logic behind AI recommendations needs to be understandable to a doctor or consumer.

This puts a burden on scientifi c wellness companies more akin to food com- panies than those in the pharmaceutical or medical device industries. Precision interventions to improve healthy aging require a higher safety threshold than interventions developed for late-stage disease. For this reason, sci- entifi c wellness won't use the kind of drugs aimed primarily at late-stage disease. Implementing an intervention with serious side eff ects might be war- ranted and chosen for someone with a serious dis- ease, but clearly not with individuals who are for the most part healthy.This means we need to develop interventions that can be deployed with specifi city and with low or no side eff ects. Although particularly safe drugs show promise for use in wellness and to improve aging\u2014metformin, for instance, is currently under study in the Targeting Aging with Metformin trial led by Nir Barzalai, the head of the Institute for Ag- ing Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medi- cine and scientifi c director for the American Federa- tion for Aging Research. Many of these targeted interventions are likely to come from natural products guided by testing and personalized insights. Of course, just because something is in the natural world doesn't necessarily make it safe, and nutraceuticals (nutrients that can also be used as medicines) can have strong biologi-monitoring data. Apps such as Welltory and Human- ity integrate digital health data to provide insights. An exciting development is the use of a \"digital twin\" as an in silico representation of an individual's specifi c biology. In principle, clinicians or companies can use them to make predictions of the eff ects of interventions on the individual and represent the variability of response across large populations. The combination of digital twins that represent indi- vidual biology with machine learning from patient data provides a powerful approach to deciphering the complexity of wellness and disease. For example, Thorne HealthTech has partnered with a start-up digital twin company, Em- bodyBio, to build a detailed predictive model of how the brain maintains its health, integrating data from more than 900 scientifi c pa- pers. We used this model to perform 10 million dig- ital-twin simulations and compared these against 30 human clinical studies, matching closely the age at which people develop Alzheimer's disease based on a host of genetic and lifestyle risk factors. To best serve individuals, the entities that col- lect data and interpret it must be able to share data with one another, including a combination of scien- tifi c wellness data and the disease-focused data from health-care systems. Although the ability to share data is improving as health care moves from the clin- ic to the smartphone, it is still diffi cult to bring it all together. Companies like Particle Health and Seqster are working on the interoperability and shareabil- ity of information on many diff erent platforms, in- cluding traditional electronic health records. These kinds of systems are critical as you move from place to place, and job to job, so that individuals don't lose the continuity of their health-care data as they move through life. Lifestyle and Behaviors Testing and AI-assisted recommendations must lead to concrete solutions that clinicians and providers can present as specifi c interventions. Scientifi c well- ness is predicated on the idea of not being reactive to disease, as is most health care today, but being pro- active in a way that enhances wellness and resilience, and that reverses disease transitions at their earliest, and simplest, stages. Because we are talking about interventions aimed at improving health in people who are not suff ering from disease, any side eff ects of scientifi c wellness interventions must be minimal. Intervening before disease develops is more than simply gathering data and making recommenda- tions. Those recommendations will not be eff ective unless they are carried out. This gets us into the realm of lifestyle and behaviors. The wellness in- dustry, and society in general, must make healthier decisions easier\u2014they should be the default deci- sions in as many situations as possible. Experience and many studies have made it clear that willpower alone, though eff ective for some, will not succeed for most. Wellness fi rms must focus on providing solu- tions that people enjoy and help to make environments in which healthy options are easy to choose. Infor- mation alone is clearly not enough to motivate people to change their behavior or to achieve major improve- ments in wellness across a population. No wellness company that focuses on trying to get people to give up things they enjoy in favor of things they don't enjoy is likely to succeed at scale over time. Solutions for scientifi c wellness must come through making products that enhance healthy living, easier to access and more aff ordable. There are many consumer products that drive dis- ease and poor health. Profi t-driven food companies that optimize their products to sell have invested in processed foods that are addictive, hitting the brain's pleasure center with sugars, salt and fats. A great deal of optimization and research have gone into identify- ing how to make these foods as hard as possible to stop eating. We need products that do the opposite. Part of this will involve educating consumers not to buy products that lead to poor health outcomes\u2014and indeed this consumer pressure is mounting. There are now major initiatives in the food indus- try aimed at simultaneously solving for these three key traits: delicious, aff ordable and nutritious. For example, Olipop has taken one of the unhealthiest categories\u2014sugary sodas\u2014and created botanical so- das. These drinks have many of the same fl avors, but instead of 40 grams of sugar per serving with no fi - ber, they have two to fi ve grams of sugar per serving, off set by nine grams of fi ber. The diff erence shows clearly on a glucose monitor: a regular soda causes a major spike in blood glucose, while Olipop barely causes a rise at all and can help get suffi cient fi ber into a person's diet. Profi t-driven food companies have invested in processed foods that are addictive. Biomarkers and Biological Age In this scenario, scientists compare two women to show how biomarkers affect biological age. Both women have values within the clinically normal range. The 67-year-old woman's biomarkers indicate a biological age of 39, while the 27-year-old woman's biomarkers put her at a biological age Kunces, Thorne HealthTech, AgeHeme-Immune Age 38.427 Age Metabolic Age Liver AgeHeme-Immune Age39 39 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 51SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 53tervention strategies. Doing this well requires a com- bination of expertise in collecting plants, extracting compounds, and analyzing them. For instance, com- panies such as Enveda Biosciences and Brightseed are using mass spectrometry on medicinal plants that have been used by humans, in some cases, for thousands of years, generating data on millions of new natural compounds. Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a professor at Northeastern University, and his team have amassed a complex network of compounds found in food. They have created a tool, FoodMine, that uses natural-language processing to search the scientifi c literature for compounds in foods. Using technology to learn more deeply what exists in the natural world\u2014and building deliverable products from these discoveries\u2014holds tremendous promise for wellness. Challenges and Promise Although many startups have made good progress in bringing wellness out of the lab and into the market- place, the business is still in its early stages. Many challenges still need to be worked out. Fulfi lling the promise of wellness will require a great deal of additional investment. Established and reputable sales and business channels are needed. This can be especially challenging for start-ups that have exciting new technologies but struggle to fi nd the sales channels needed to connect with consum- ers, many of whom are unaware of the benefi ts these new products could bring. Data privacy is another challenge. To strike a balance between privacy and access to data, the in- dividual must be the central connector for all their data and in control of how it's used and shared. Apple Health, CommonHealth and other apps make this easy in some cases, giving the user a single but- ton for controlling what data the apps can share and with whom. Gathering all this health data requires connect- ing the data that wellness companies collect with electronic health records that now house most dis- ease data. Bridging these worlds is a huge opportu- nity to discover new insights into wellness. Compa-cal eff ects. But the focus should be on those natural products that the Food and Drug Administration can categorize as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) or those that can be submitted to the FDA for clas- sifi cation as a New Dietary Ingredient. Natural products can be used in the context of scientifi c wellness. This is a major area of interest to my company, Thorne HealthTech, which produces some 200 of these now, and many other companies operate in this space. Numerous studies have shown the eff ects of natural compounds, such as berberine, an analog of metformin, on improvement of meta- bolic health, control of lipids, and disease prevention. Another example is nicotinamide riboside, which has been shown to extend health-span in animal mod-els. Functional studies in humans have shown that it boosts the production of NAD+, a coenzyme found in every cell in the body, but which declines with age. Time will tell whether the same eff ects on health-span will translate to humans. A probiotic based on Ak- kermansia, a gut microbe, available from Pendulum, was shown in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to improve glucose control after meals and reduce levels in the blood of HbA1c, a diabetes marker. Many molecules identifi ed in human and animal studies as being potentially associated with healthy longevity have yet to be commercialized and need to go through studies and trials. Mining compounds from the natural world off ers big opportunities to fi nd new wellness-promoting in-nies that specialize in integrating biological data, such as LifeOmic, Seqster, G42 Healthcare and CareEvolution, as well as eff orts spun out of most of the large health-care providers, are building the software infrastructure for doing so. Medical data is still largely guarded among competing commer- cial interests and sequestered by various health- care systems in the U.S. Countries with single-payer health-care systems, such as the U.K. and Israel, and more open data sharing are generally further ahead in this regard. The industry also needs to reach a critical mass. As businesses provide more people with the tools of scientifi c wellness, scientists will have more oppor- tunities to collect data and use it to come up with new insights. At present, scientists have to use large longitudinal, multifaceted studies that gather data in ways that protect individuals' privacy, but at the same time allow scientists to tease out useful infor- mation about wellness and disease. For example, these types of data have helped us make many dis- coveries about the health eff ects of the microbiome, such as how much of the diversity of the gut micro- biome is refl ected by compounds that get into the bloodstream, how diff erences in the gut microbiome are predictive of success in weight loss, how the microbiome predicts the effi cacy and side eff ects of statin use, and how the microbi- ome of a person becomes increas- ingly unique over time, if they age in a healthy way. As businesses succeed in delivering meaningful results that keep people coming back, and the number of people who interact re- peatedly in scientifi c wellness programs grows, such studies will become more common, creating a posi- tive feedback loop that will only make the benefi ts of wellness science more apparent. The idea of fostering wellness dates back to an- cient practices designed to meet our universal needs: eating nutritious food, practicing meditation and yoga, and engaging in strength training and aero- bic movement. But bringing the practice of wellness into the scientifi c realm, where we can measure and assess its eff ectiveness, is only now beginning. Al- though the business of scientifi c wellness is still in its early stages, it is an exciting time. Nathan Price is Chief Scientifi c Offi cer of Thorne HealthTech and codirects the Hood-Price Lab for Systems Biomedicine at the Institute for Systems Biology. Fulfi lling the promise of wellness will require a great deal of additional investment.Biological Age in Men and Women In this example, scientists compared a 44-year-old woman's blood biomarkers with those of a 44-year-old man.

A physical exam reveals that the pain is focused in the lower right portion of his abdomen. The doctor worries that it could be ap - pendicitis. But by the time the imaging results come back, Roger is feeling better, and the scan shows that his appendix appears normal. The doctor turns to the computer to prescribe two medications, one for nausea and Tylenol for pain, before discharging him. This is one of the fictitious scenarios presented to 55 physicians around the country as part of a study to look at the usability of electronic health re - cords (EHRs). To prescribe medications, a doctor has to locate them in the EHR system. At one hospital a simple search for Tylenol brings up a list of more than 80 options. Roger is a 26-year-old man, but the list includes Tylenol for children and infants, as well as Tylenol for menstrual cramps. The doctor tries to winnow the list by typing the desired dose\u2014500 mil - ligrams\u2014into the search window, but now she gets zero hits. So she returns to the main list and finally selects the 68th option\u2014Tylenol Extra Strength (500 mg), the most commonly prescribed dose of Tylenol. What should have been a simple task has taken pre - cious minutes and far more brainpower than it de - served. This is just one example of the countless ago - nizing frustrations that physicians deal with every day when they use EHRs. These EHRs\u2014digital versions of the paper charts in which doctors used to record patients' visits, lab - oratory results and other important medical infor - mation\u2014were supposed to transform the practice of medicine. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, passed in 2009, has provided $36 billion in financial incen - tives to drive hospitals and clinics to transition from paper charts to EHRs. Then president Barack Obama said the shift would \"cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests.\" He added that it would \"save lives by reduc - ing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health-care system.\" When HITECH was adopted, 48 percent of physi - cians used EHRs. By 2019 that number had climbed to 90 percent, but the transformative power of EHRs has yet to be realized. Physicians complain about clunky interfaces and time-consuming data entry. Polls suggest that they spend more time interacting with a patient's file than with the actual patient. As a result, burnout is on the rise. Even Obama observed that the rollout did not go as planned. \"It's proven to be harder than we expected,\" he told Vox in 2017. Yet EHRs do have the potential to deliver in - sights and efficiencies, according to physicians and Can AI Fix Electronic Medical Records? Digitization of patient charts was supposed to revolutionize medical practice. Artificial intelligence could help unlock its potential. BY CASSANDRA WILLYARDHow Doctors Feel about Electronic Health Recordsand gave them mock patient data and six scenari - os, including the one about Roger, who presented with what seemed like appendicitis. These scenarios asked the physicians to perform common duties such as prescribing medications and ordering tests. The researchers assessed how long it took the physicians to complete each task, how many clicks were required and how ac - curately they performed. What they found was disheart - ening. The time and the number of clicks required varied widely from site to site and even between sites using the same system. And some tasks, such as tapering the dose of a steroid, proved exceptionally tricky across the board. Physicians had to manually calculate the taper doses, which took anywhere from two to three minutes and required 20 to 42 clicks. These design flaws were not benign. The physicians often made dosage mistakes. At one site the error rate reached 50 percent. \"We've seen patients being harmed and even patients dying because of errors or issues that arise from usability of the system,\" says Raj Ratwani, director of MedStar Health's National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare. But clunky interfaces are just part of the problem with EHRs. Another stumbling block is that infor - mation still does not flow easily between providers. The system lacks \"the ability to seamlessly and auto - matically deliver data when and where it is needed under a trusted network without political, technical, or financial blocking,\" according to a 2018 report data scientists. EHRs are essential in the transition from health care based on treatment to one based on wellness, in which patient records would have to handle far more data than they do now, and do so in a way that makes it efficient for doctors and patients to access them. Artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning\u2014which allows computers to iden - tify patterns in data and draw conclusions on their own\u2014might be able to help overcome the obstacles encountered with EHRs and unlock their potential for making predictions, improving patient care by emphasizing prevention and wellness. Digital Debacle In 2016 the American Medical Association teamed up with MedStar Health, a health-care organization that operates 10 hospitals in the Baltimore-Washing - ton area, to examine the usability of two of the largest EHR systems, developed by Cerner, based in North Kansas City, Mo., and Epic, based in Verona, Wis., respectively. Together these two companies account for 54 percent of the acute care hospital market. The team recruited emergency physicians at four hospitals \"We've seen patients being harmed and even patients dying because of errors or issues that arise from usability of the system.\"from the National Academy of Medicine. If a patient changes doctors, visits urgent care, or moves across the country, her records might or might not follow. \"Connected care is the goal; disconnected care is the reality,\" the authors wrote. In March 2018 the Harris Poll conducted an online survey on behalf of Stanford Medicine that examined physicians' attitudes about EHRs. The results were sobering. Doctors reported spending, on average, about half an hour on each patient. More than 60 percent of that time was spent interacting with the pa - tient's EHR. Half of office-based pri - mary-care physi - cians think using an EHR actually diminishes their clinical effective - ness. Isaac Koha - ne, a computer sci - entist and chair of the department of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, puts it bluntly: \"Medical records suck.\" Yet despite the considerable drawbacks of existing EHR systems, most physicians agree that electronic records are a vast improvement over paper charts. Getting patients' data digitized means that they are now accessible for analysis using the power of AI. \"There's huge potential to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop predictive models and better understand health outcomes,\" Ratwani says. \"I think that's absolutely the future.\" It is already happening to some extent. In 2015 Epic began offering its clients machine-learning models. To develop these models, computer scientists start with algorithms and train them using real- world examples with known outcomes. For example, if the goal is to predict which patients are at greatest risk of developing the life-threatening blood condi - tion known as sepsis, which is caused by infection, the algorithm might incorporate data routinely col - lected in the intensive care unit, such as blood pres - sure, pulse and temperature. The better the data, the better the model will perform. Epic now has a library of models that its custom- ers can purchase. \"We have more than 300 organiza - tions either running or implementing models from the library today,\" says Seth Hain, director of ana - lytics and machine learning at Epic. The company's sepsis-prediction model, which scans patients' infor - mation every 15 minutes and monitors more than 80 variables, is one of its most popular. The North Oaks Health System in Hammond, La., implemented the model in 2017. If a patient's score reaches a certain threshold, the physicians receive a warning, which signals them to monitor the patient more closely and provide antibiotics if needed. After the health system implemented the model, mortality caused by sepsis fell by 18 percent. But building and implementing these kinds of models is trickier than it might first appear. Most rely solely on an EHR's structured data\u2014data that is collected and formatted in the same way. Those data might consist of a blood-pressure reading, lab results, a diagnosis or a drug allergy. But EHRs include a wide \"Health data is like crude oil. It is useless unless it is refined.\" Two-thirds (66%) of primary-care physicians report that they are satisfied with their current EHR system. However, only one in five (18 %) are very satisfied. 18% Very satisfied 48% Somewhat satisfied 21% Somewhat dissatisfied 13% Very dissatisfied Six in 10 agree that EHRs have led to improved patient care, both in general (63 %) and within their practice (61%). Even though 70 percent say EHRs have improved over the last five years, more than half still agree that EHRs need a complete overhaul (59%) and that using an EHR detracts from their professional satisfaction (54%). Seven in 10 agree that: Using an EHR has increased the total number of hours worked on a daily basis Using an EHR takes valuable time away from patients Using an EHR takes valuable time away from patientsAlthough only 3 percent of primary-care physicians see no value in their EHR system, time constraints take a toll and relationships with patients suffer: Of 31 minutes spent on behalf of each patient, 19 minutes are spent with the EHR 12 minutes interacting with patient during visit 8 minutes with EHR during visit 11 minutes with EHR outside visitDoctors spend more time with EHRs than with patients: Half agree that using an EHR detracts from their clinical effectiveness. 17% Strongly agree 32% Somewhat agree 49% Agree Nearly half of primary-care physicians (44%) say the primary value of their EHR is digital storage. Fewer than one in 10 (8%) cite key clinically-related items such as disease prevention and management (3%), clinical decisions support (3%), and patient engagement (2%). SOURCE : National Physician Poll by The Harris Poll for Stanford Medicine (March 2-27, 2018)7 in 10 disagree that: EHRs have strength - ened relationships with patients74% 71% 69%69% 19 min SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 57 56 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS58 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 59 variety of unstructured data, too, such as a clinician's notes about a visit, e-mails and x-ray images. \"There is information there, but it's really hard for a com- puter to extract it,\" says Finale Doshi-Velez, a com- puter scientist at Harvard University. Ignoring this free text means losing valuable information, such as whether the patient has improved. \"There isn't really a code for doing better,\" she says. Moreover, Ratwani points out that because of poor usability, data often end up in the wrong spot. For example, a strawber - ry allergy might end up documented in the clinical notes rather than being listed in the allergies box. In such cases, a model that looks for allergies only in the allergy section of the EHR \"is built from inac - curate data,\" he adds. \"That is probably one of the biggest challenges we're facing right now.\" Leo Anthony Celi, an intensive care specialist and clinical research director at the Massachusetts Insti - tute of Technology's Laboratory for Computational Physiology, agrees. Most of the data found in EHRs is not ready to be fed into an algorithm. A massive amount of curation has to occur first. For example, say you want to design an algorithm to help patients in the intensive care unit avoid low blood glucose, a common problem. That sounds straightforward, Celi says. But it turns out that blood sugar is measured in different ways, with blood drawn from either a finger prick or a vein. Insulin is administered in different ways, too. When Celi and his colleagues examined all the data on insulin and blood sugar from patients at one hospital, \"there were literally thousands of dif - ferent ways they were entered in the EHR,\" says Celi. This data has to be manually sorted and clustered by type before one can even design an algorithm. \"Health data is like crude oil,\" he says. \"It is useless unless it is refined.\" An Intelligent Fix The current pitfalls of EHRs hamper efforts to use artificial intelligence to glean important insights, but AI might itself provide a possible solution. One of the main drawbacks of the existing EHR sys - tems, doctors say, is the time it takes to document a visit\u2014everything from the patient's complaint to the physician's analysis and recommendation. Many physicians believe that much of the therapeutic value of a doctor visit is in the interactions, Kohane says. But EHRs have \"literally taken the doctor from fac - ing the patient to facing the computer.\" Doctors have to type up their narrative of the visit, but they also enter much of the same information when they or - der lab tests, prescribe medications and enter bill - ing codes, says Paul Brient, chief product officer at athenahealth, another EHR vendor. This kind of duplicate work contributes to physician frustration and burnout. As a stopgap measure, some hospitals now have scribes sit in on appointments to document the visit while the physician interacts with the patient. But several companies are working on digital scribes, machine-learning algorithms that can take a conver - sation between a doctor and a patient, parse the text and use it to fill in the relevant information in the patient's EHR. Indeed, some such systems are already available. Nuance Communications, a Massachusetts-based computer software company, has developed a pro - gram called Dragon Ambient eXperience (Nuance DAX). The mobile app uses machine learning, voice recognition and language processing to capture conversations between patients and physicians and turn them into notes, diagnoses and orders in the EHR. Although EHRs turned physicians into da - ta-entry clerks, Kohane says, apps like DAX could serve as intelligent, knowledgeable co-workers. The systems that Robert Wachter, chair of the depart - ment of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has seen are \"probably not quite ready for prime time,\" he says, but they should be in the near future. Artificial intelligence might also help clinicians make better, more sophisticated decisions. \"We think of the decision support in a computer system as an alert,\" says Jacob Reider, a physician and CEO at Al - liance for Better Health, a New York-based health- care system that works to improve the health of communities. That alert might be a box that pops up to warn of a drug allergy. But a more sophisticated system might list the likelihood of a side effect with drug option A versus drug option B and provide a cost comparison. From a technological standpoint, developing such a feature is \"no different from Ama - zon putting an advertisement or making you aware of a purchasing opportunity,\" he says. Wachter sees at least one encouraging sign that progress is coming. In the past few years the behe - moths of the tech world\u2014Google, Amazon, Micro - soft\u2014have developed a strong interest in health care. Google, for example, partnered with researchers from U.C.S.F., Stanford University, and the Univer - sity of Chicago to develop models aimed at predict - ing events relevant to hospitalized patients, such as mortality and unexpected readmission. To deal with the messy data problem, the research - ers first translated data from two EHR systems into a standardized format called Fast Healthcare Interop - erability Resources, or FHIR (pronounced \"fire\"). Then, rather than hand-selecting a set of variables such as blood pressure and heart rate, they had the model read patients' entire charts as they unfolded over time up until the point of hospitalization. The data unspooled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. \"What's interesting about that approach is every single prediction uses the exact same data,\" says Alvin Rajkomar, a physi - cian and AI researcher at Google who led the effort. That element both simplifies data entry and enhanc - es performance. But the involvement of massive corporations also raises serious privacy concerns. In mid-November 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google, through a partnership with Ascension, the country's second-largest health-care system, had gained access to the records of tens of millions of people without their knowledge or consent. The goal was to develop machine-learning tools to make it easier for doctors to access patient data. Although this type of data sharing is not unprec - edented or illegal, the Department of Health and Human Services opened an inquiry into the implica - tions for patient privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (a.k.a. HIPAA). In a 2019 letter to three senators, David Feinberg, head of Google Health, acknowledged that the com- pany did access patient data but maintained that the data was \"de-identified\" or \"obtained in accordance with Institutional Review Board approved protocols and waivers.\" The company is now piloting a tool, called Care Studio, at Ascension facilities in Tennes - see and Florida, and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medi - cal Center in Boston. Privacy concerns should not halt the quest for better, smarter, more responsive electronic health records, according to Reider. There are ways to devel - op these systems that maintain privacy and security, he says. Ultimately real transformation of medical prac - tice may require an entirely new kind of EHR, one that is not simply a digital file folder. All the major EHRs are built on top of database-type architecture that is 20 to 30 years old, Reider observes. \"It's rows and columns of information.\" He likens these sys - tems to the software used to record inventory at a brick-and-mortar bookstore: \"It would know which books it bought, and it would know which books it sold.\" Now envision how Amazon uses algorithms to predict what a customer might buy tomorrow and to anticipate demand. \"They've engineered their sys - tems so that they can learn in this way, and then they can autonomously take action,\" Reider says. Health care needs the same kind of transformative leap. Cassandra Willyard is a science journalist based in Madison, Wis.

BY AMIT KAUSHAL & RUSS B. ALTMANtechnical and scientific issues but also anticipate and articulate the potential risks, benefits and implica - tions of the projects they undertake. We need men and women who can build AI sys - tems in medicine that improve care. It is relatively easy to generate excitement by solving the technical aspects of a problem, but making those advances useful often involves wrestling with the complex in - terplay of regulatory, economic and workflow issues in health-care systems. Successful leaders benefit from deep knowledge and intuition in both the AI and the biomedical domains. But we face a critical shortage of such versatile individuals. Tackling this gap is crucial to ensuring the long- term success of biomedical AI. A primary challenge is the length of study required in these disciplines, but a greater one is training students in two realms that could hardly be more different in their approaches to problem-solving. Computer science involves the quantitative rigor of mathematics, statistics and en - gineering, whereas biology is underpinned by the haphazard products of evolution. Properties of living things are, literally and figuratively, organic. We seek students with the intellectual flexibility and passion to undergo lengthy training in both these contrast - ing cultures. Are we asking for the impossible? These individuals do exist, and their numbers are growing. The first approach to their training is to identify individuals who already have a deep back - ground in either biomedical or computational science and then help them become skilled in the other area. Graduate programs (M.S., Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D.) in biomedical informatics have filled this role since the early 1980s. These programs attract diverse students and have grown to include disciplines that go by var - ious names: computational biology, bioinformatics, clinical informatics, biomedical data science, and so on. All are concerned with different applications of computer science to biomedicine. But what about training students at the inter - section of these disciplines even earlier in their ca - reers\u2014while their intellectual intuitions are still forming? The difference would be like that between learning a second language as an adult and growing up in a bilingual household: fluency is second nature for early starters. In 2001 we launched an engineering major at Stanford University to enable undergraduates to learn computer science and statistics in the context of biology and medicine. The program creates gradu - ates with a bachelor of science degree who have al - ready wrestled intensively with the challenges of applying computational tools to hard problems in biomedicine. Our students take biology with premed - ical students and computer science with classmates who will work in Silicon Valley, and each completes a two- or three-quarter-long research project during his or her time at Stanford. They acquire knowledge with breadth across the biomedical and technical fields and depth in a narrower application area. At least one course on the societal and ethical implica - tions of technology is also required. After almost two decades of training biomedical- computation undergraduates, we can say that the model works. Many of our graduates have gone on to careers in academia, clinical medicine, start-up companies (both in and outside of the biology field), large companies, law firms, venture capital, and elsewhere. And the major has consistently drawn a 50-50 balance of men and women\u2014true for only a minority of quantitatively intensive engineering majors. For most, the major has shaped their professional identity: they are not \"AI people doing bio\" or \"Bio people doing AI.\" Instead, both in - tellectual traditions reside comfort - ably within their minds, each informing their un - derstanding of the other. Whereas it is impossible to learn the entirety of biomedicine and computer science in just four years (or even in 40), these people move freely between the cultures of biology and com- puter science and have already learned to apply deep technical skills to the hardest societal challenges in biology and human health. In addition to graduate programs, the development of a robust set of undergraduate programs at the in - terface of biomedicine and computation could give students who are in a formative period of their edu - cation the ability to move fluidly between these very different disciplines. Such programs would accelerate the emergence of the workforce required for appro - priate use of AI to advance biology and health care. Amit Kaushal, M.D., Ph.D., is an adjunct professor in the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford University; Russ B. Altman is Kenneth Fong Professor of Bioengineering, Genetics, Medicine, Biomedical Data Science and Computer Science. From the popular press to the largest health- care conferences, promises of artificial in - telligence revolutionizing biomedicine are ubiquitous. It often seems as if we are on the cusp of AI systems that can remotely identify a person about to get sick, make a diagnosis (no doctor needed), select a custom AI-designed pharmaceutical and deliver it to the patient just in time\u2014in an AI-powered self-driving car, of course. If indeed this is the future, we are far from reach - ing it. To be sure, the pace of change has been rapid. Deep learning\u2014the fast-growing subfield of AI that enables machines to diagnose pneumonia from chest x-rays or predict health deterioration from medi - cal records\u2014was unfamiliar even to most computer scientists a decade ago. And we do not know what evolutionary or revolutionary advances will drive AI in the coming decades. What we do know is that the success of biomedical AI depends not just on de - veloping the technology but also on developing the people behind it. Translating algorithmic advances to biomedical breakthroughs requires critically considering both realms of knowledge and endeavor on many levels. What, for example, are the true capabilities of a new technology, and what is simply hype? What problems in biomedicine are most likely to benefit from emerg - ing computational capabilities? And how do we go from an interesting biomedical application of a new technology to the implementation of systems that actually improve human health? These challenging, multifaceted questions will need to be answered by interdisciplinary teams. The teams will require ex - perts in AI, experts in biology and medicine, and, most important, leaders who can motivate and guide individuals with such diverse talents. Unlike some domains in which AI has been ap - plied, in biomedicine the consequences of failure are weighty. For a social media company, an AI model that is ineffective at increasing ad clicks can be de - tected and rolled back the same day. When it comes to medicine, however, human lives are at stake. In - adequately informed uses of AI can lead to obvious harm, such as inaccurate diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations, but also to more insidious fail - ures, such as an algorithm that gives racially biased recommendations because it was trained with subtly biased data. Given the complexities of biomedicine and the inscrutable nature of many AI algorithms, it might be years before such a flaw is uncovered. Group leaders\u2014whether in academia, pharmaceutical labo - ratories or start-ups\u2014must not only understand the The success of biomedical AI depends on developing the people behind it.62 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 63\u00a9 BRIAN STAUFFERWhen the race to sequence the fi rst human genome was rushing toward the fi nish line more than 20 years ago, I remember feeling mesmerized by what was about to hap- pen. It was the dawn of a new century, and it seemed we were on the cusp of unlocking the meaning behind the blueprint of life, DNA. Once we could line up all 3.1 billion base pairs of the molecule in our genome, I thought\u2014I was an undergraduate student at the time, dazzled by science\u2014we would understand everything there is to know about human health and disease. Making Genetic Medicine More Equitable Wellness-based health care needs more diversity in genetic data to avoid harmful bias. One big research project is fi xing that. BY STEPHANIE DEVANEY I didn't know that those fi rst decades of genetic medicine would leave a lot of people behind. So I was taken aback several years later, in 2009, just after I got my doctorate in molecular genetics, when re- searchers at Duke University reported that 96 per- cent of the genomic data we had gathered came from people of European ancestry. This was not the result of small numbers: they calculated the percentage using the more than 1.7 million individual genome samples analyzed at the time, but the samples were lacking diversity. Over the next few years, things did not get much better, and as recently as six years ago, genomic databases were still way out of balance, with more representation of Europeans and less of everyone else. This inequity, if it is not fi xed, will continue to feed tremendous health inequality. Today, more and more people are getting answers about the underly- ing causes of their diseases because of medicine's abil- ity to derive insights from their genomes. There are hundreds of drugs that contain genetic information in their labeling because gene variants aff ect how bodies process these drugs, and knowing the variants that patients have helps doctors set the most benefi cial dose for their patients. Moreover, improved knowl- edge about the genomic drivers of diff erent cancers has paid dividends in how physicians currently diag- nose and treat many tumors. Yet, people who are not white and not male have diff erent sets of genes that do not always fi t into these treatment regimens. For example, African Americans and Latinos have the highest rate of asthma in the U.S., but stud- ies show that common drugs used in inhalers do not help them as well as they help white people. Asian people who take the antiseizure drug carbamazepine have a higher risk of a severe, sometimes fatal, re- action. Nobody developing these drugs, or prescrib- ing them when they fi rst came into use, anticipated these problems. If DNA is one important factor in our quest for more eff ective medical treatment, we need to address the lack of diversity in genetic data. The COVID-19 pandemic has only further rein- forced the need to close gaps in genetic data. While social factors\u2014such as an individual's housing, em- ployment, reliance on public transportation and ac- cess to health care\u2014have been clear drivers of the tragically disproportionate toll that the pandemic has taken on Black, Hispanic, tribal and other com- munities, studies have also demonstrated associa- tions between genetics and the risk of poor outcomes. The utility of these fi ndings depends on whether the data sets used in these studies are inclusive and re- fl ect the rich diversity across our country. BIASED GENE STUDIES T o link genes to disease risk and other traits, hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have looked at the DNA of thousands of diff erent people. But 78 percent of the people studied are white Europeans; just 2 percent are African and 1 percent are Hispanic or Latin American. Not surprisingly, possible disease- linked gene variants in non-European people are rarely detected, and therefore poorly understood.

Set up by the Nation - al Institutes of Health and launched in 2018, we are asking a million or more people from all back - grounds to join us as partners in research, not as hu - man subjects, and share all kinds of health informa - tion over the course of their lives. Already data from more than 370,000 participants is available to regis - tered researchers through the All of Us Researcher Workbench . About 45 percent of par - ticipants belong to racial and ethnic minority groups, and overall, nearly 80 percent identify with a group that has been historically underrepre - sented in research data sets. People can join All of Us by going to our program website (www.join - allofus.org) and clicking Join Now. After agreeing to participate, respondents can offer us their medi - cal records, answer a variety of surveys about their health and lifestyle, and participate in other activi - ties such as syncing their fitness tracker data to our program. We also have hundreds of enrollment sites at local hospitals and health centers across the coun - try where participants can provide samples of blood and urine to help researchers study their DNA. If a participant does not live close to one of our enroll - ment centers, they can choose to receive a saliva col - lection kit in the mail. Our hope is for people to stick with us for 10 years or more because, as the program grows, we will regularly add new ways for them to learn about themselves and contribute to research. The Moment is Right A lot of this participant-researcher collaboration is linked to advances in technology. Sequencing that first human genome had a $1-billion price tag. To - day, such a sequence costs less than $1,000, and it is also easier to integrate this information with other crucial medical data. Health-care organizations have been turning their patients' paper-based medical re - cords into electronic versions. As of 2019, 96 percent of all U.S. hospitals and 72 percent of all office-based doctors are using a certified electronic health record system. New apps on smartphones and other digital health technologies, such as smartwatches, collect data from nearly anywhere and directly from a per - son. These trends all make it easier to store, share and mine large data sets for answers to questions about disease causes and effects. Such trends also raise issues about privacy, making it important for projects such as ours to have both strong security and full transparency to all our participants. And it is crucial to treat research participants as partners. The actions of past medical researchers have earned much distrust in minority communi - ties, like the harm caused by the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, where research - ers misled African American men with syphilis and never gave them adequate treatment, and with the widespread use of HeLa cells, which were taken from a patient named Henrietta Lacks without her knowl - edge or permission. People wanted to see research go forward but with them rather than about them. To overcome this kind of distrust, All of Us is using a new model for research, one that invites input from participants as well as researchers with science de - grees. Participants serve on the program's advisory and governing bodies, working groups and task forces. We have also partnered with local health- care organizations, hospitals and community groups to advise us and help find people to participate. Com- munity engagement is not familiar ground for large medical research projects, and we are still learning the best ways to do it. Some studies have provided us with blueprints for developing long-term relationships like the ones we hope to have, studies that have changed medicine for the better. The Framingham Heart Study, for ex - ample, started in 1948 with 5,209 men and women, largely white, from one town in Massachusetts. With a 99 percent retention rate, the study continues to this day. As participants share data year after year, researchers can see how their heart health changes over time. The risk factors for heart disease identi - fied by the Framingham study\u2014such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity\u2014are so ingrained in our collective consciousness and our approach to health care that they feel like common sense. Going Further This kind of medical discovery is what we envision for All of Us, but we want to take it further, with participants who represent diversity in many dimen - sions, not just traditional race labels that, in reality, encompass a lot of different backgrounds. If we're go - ing to get at the root causes of health and disease, Many factors beyond our genes are at play when it comes to disease.this means understanding the differences and simi - larities among us all. For example, sickle cell disease occurs when someone inherits two mutated genes for the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin. It affects 100,000 African Americans and more than 20 mil - lion people around the world. In contrast, sickle cell trait\u2014meaning just one of these genes is mutated\u2014 actually gives people an advantage in surviving ma - laria, which makes evolutionary sense if your ances - tors came from places such as Africa where malaria is prevalent. New studies, however, have found that sickle cell trait might not be as benign as doctors used to believe, because it may increase the risk for kidney disease. Some African Americans are more susceptible to this risk and some less. There's clearly more to learn about why this might be the case and about how different DNA variants might interact to affect the health of people with sickle cell trait. The DNA information from more than a million All of Us participants could help researchers learn much more about complex traits like this. We do have to start with some of the broad-brush categories to recruit enough people to start recog - nizing the more fine-grained groups among them. Currently we are exceeding our goal and overrep - resenting groups that have been historically un - derrepresented in research. For instance, African Americans make up 13.6 of the U.S. population, but people of African ancestry make up just 2 percent of the samples previously used in genome studies. In All of Us , 19.3 percent of participants so far iden - tify as African American. Similarly, Hispanic people constitute nearly 18.9 percent of the U.S. population, but in 2016 people with Hispanic or Latin American ancestry made up less than 1 percent of the samples in genomic databases. Today, 16.5 percent of All of Us participants identify as Hispanic or Latino. That diversity is vital to helping researchers dis - cover more about how DNA affects health across dif - ferent communities, but the molecule is not our sole focus. As we have seen during the pandemic, many factors beyond our genes are at play when it comes to disease. We know that where you were born, what you eat, the stress you feel and other clinical and biological factors affect health, but we still don't un - derstand by how much. For example, when we think about some of the most common chronic diseases that afflict our population\u2014high blood pressure is one example\u2014many of them disproportionately affect the most socially and economically disadvantaged people in our country. And from what we can tell at the moment, the determinants are not simply their race or ethnicity. Risks also include family structure, socioeconomic status, stressors such as trauma, sex and gender inequality, availability of nutrient-rich foods, access to health care and many other factors that we can capture in the All of Us data set. As the data available within the Researcher Workbench continues to grow over the coming years, researchers will be able to compare this increasingly rich data with participants' DNA. As we do so, scien - tists such as myself, the All of Us participants and the general public will start to get a clearer picture of the roles that biology and environment play in disease development, and\u2014most important of all\u2014what we can do about it.

Mining Our Individual Source Code Each one of us may soon generate as much health data as the entire internet does now. Finding meaning presents an unprecedented computational challenge. BY SCOTT PENBERTHY Doctors test our blood. Smartwatches count our steps. Nutrition apps track our diets. We've grown accustomed to having the status of our health mea - sured routinely, and sometimes in real time. In the not-too-distant future, however, inex - pensive tests will reveal what's going on inside our bodies by reading the dense, nanoscale information within our cells. Our doctors and our devices will be able to gather data on the activities of genes, pro - teins, metabolites, bacteria in our digestive tracts, plus real-time measurements of heart activity, exer - cise and stress hormones. The idea is to supplement this raw data with elec - tronic health records, consumer devices, classic blood tests, published research and more. Taken together, this data can help scientists identify which patients are more likely to respond positively to which medi - cation, detect earlier when people are beginning to develop chronic illness, and then learn which next step is best, taking into account a patient's particu - lar genetic makeup. Collecting so much data\u2014much of it at a molecu - lar scale\u2014will produce vast amounts of information. In the phenome age, each of us will generate our own internet-size cloud of biological data. This personal source code, so to speak, will help us understand where we came from and how our bodies work, and it will help billions of people improve their lives. But we must find a way to make sense of it. The task of finding meaning in this explosion of data presents a computational challenge of unprec - edented scale. In a health-care world that stresses wellness, how do we tease actionable recommenda - tions for each individual? To start answering that question, my colleagues and I at Google Cloud have been applying the tech - nologies of web-scale information retrieval\u2014collo -quially known as \"search\"\u2014to the task of handling enormous volumes of data in the phenome age. In collaboration with Phenome Health, we are looking for aspects of phenomics that can be framed as infor - mation-retrieval problems. We've come up with some interesting and prom- ising ideas that we think may help doctors crack our individual source codes. This would create a vast storage of phenomes\u2014the expression of our ge - nomes\u2014and give doctors great insight into wellness. Dense and Voluminous To get a feeling for how much data we're talking about, let's consider a sugar cube. A typical cube measures about one centimeter on each side. By com- parison, a single nucleotide of DNA\u2014one of the basic letters that make up our genes\u2014would fit in a cube about a nanometer wide. That means that a volume of DNA the size of a sugar cube holds about a zettabit of data\u2014that's a 1 followed by 21 zeros. For context, that's nearly the amount of data sent around the in - ternet in 2012. And it would take hundreds of sugar cubes to equal the volume of a human body. The first task is to capture this information. Ad - vances in nanophotonics (the study of light at the nanometer scale) and neural networks (a method of machine intelligence inspired by the networks of cells in the human brain) have given us a new way to read dense chemical and biological information for a few dollars of raw materials and capture that in - formation digitally. Today, most of that comes from expensive reagents\u2014liquids that chemically process biological material. Instead, scientists can now use a small computer chip to count and read molecules in a blend of liquefied material by sensing their electro - magnetic signatures. Jen Dionne, a pioneer in the field of nanophotonics at Stanford University who developed this technol - ogy, is now focused on detecting and counting large SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 67 66 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS \u00a9 YUICHIRO CHINO68 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 69 assemblies of code, such as genomic biomarkers in human DNA, COVID-19 antibodies, and discarded cancer proteins in the blood. Ultima Genomics raised $600 million in funding in May 2022 to develop tech- nology that can read a person's DNA code for $100, a price low enough to create a new market for digital lab tests. Dionne's nanophotonics is just one power- ful technology that we hope will enable doctors to cost-eff ectively read source code from biological ma- terial in minutes. Cleaning and Indexing The next step is to come up with ways of accessing and organizing this data. Many companies now fo- cus on \"data normalization\"\u2014ways of retrieving, cleaning and organizing large pipelines of data for analysis. Once data is put in that form, it's a rela- tively straightforward matter for an information- retrieval (IR) system to \"crawl\" it, much as a private search engine would crawl through a company's web pages to catalog them. Once an IR system has gathered this raw, unstruc- tured data and given it some organization, we need to fi gure out what informa- tion we can extract from it and arrange it in a secure enclave for fast retrieval. This next step, indexing, involves reducing the in- formation to its smallest, quintessential components to make it easier to store and search. Computer en- gineers have a lot of experience in reducing large genomic sequencing fi les to variants of the 25,000 known genes so that it requires far less storage. We can reduce blood tests, tissue analysis and sensor data to a handful of numeric features, such as tem- perature, the count and concentration of molecules, lengths, weights and colors. Artifi cial-intelligence systems can also generate labels to describe what they see inside documents, images, videos, sounds and sensor readings. These labels take much less room than the original media, but are perfect for fi nding patterns. Meaning from Data After ensuring that our information is secure, in- dexed and compact, the next part of the data chal- lenge is how to structure the query. In other words, what is the question we seek to answer? Current search and database technologies map queries to representations of intent and meaning. In-tent is often a collection of words, abbreviated sym- bols or tensors (a mathematical tool that can concise- ly represent information embedded within raw data) that together represent a concept. For phenomics, a query might also include a set of molecular concen- trations, such as metabolites and proteins, and ge- nomic markers, and ask for relevant research to help describe what might be happening. The meaning of a query is what puts it in con- text. Computer engineers have gotten pretty good at building search engines that can extend a query to take context into account, saving people time and ef- fort. For instance, when we search for \"pizza\" on our phones while traveling, we may really mean \"pizza near me, available now.\" This way, a user can ask a simpler, shorter question, then have the computer fi ll out relevant context. For example, a caregiver might open a medical record for a particular indi- vidual within an EHR system, or view the pathology of a slide from another. The query \"abx?\" could mean, \"Is the patient I'm viewing on antibiotics (abx)?\" The next step is deter- mining what information elements are relevant. The earliest search, database and information-retrieval engines matched keywords in a query against keywords extracted from an information source. If an informa- tion source didn't contain exact words and spellings from the query, it was considered irrelevant. Recent developments in natural-language under- standing, automated speech recognition, knowledge graphs and user interfaces allow for more sophisti- cated and accommodating forms of matching. We can now fi nd keywords that have similar phonetic spellings and correct for spelling mistakes. We can fi nd keywords with similar meanings to our query, so that \"large\" and \"big\" are considered a match. We can fi nd keywords that sound similar to what we say, so that \"zeralto\" matches the drug \"Xarelto,\" and \"brahka one\" matches the gene BRCA1 . Knowledge graphs can help us match \"abx\" to \"antibiotics,\" and \"nsclc\" to \"lung cancer.\" Special-purpose processors, some working in par- allel to one another, can process these queries quick- ly. This is the way that many image and video search systems work today, for example, fi nding objects within Google Photos. Such processors would be well suited to handling the fi les from Dionne's nanopho- tonics chip, Ultima's whole genome sequence, x-rays, We are looking for aspects of phenomics that can be framed as information- retrieval problems.USE The answers returned by AI algorithms will also need to be in context and tailored to the user. An expert's query on a handheld device, for example, might require a technical response or a link to recent journal articles on a topic; a patient's query might need more explanation and links to general information.The Internet of YouINFOGRAPHIC: Data that captures the shifting state of your health could off er many health-care practitioners a powerful tool. A family doctor could advise you on your long-term health risks and suggest diet or lifestyle changes to lower them. A psychologist might look for gut microbiome anomalies that aff ect mental health. But the phenome of even one person contains a prodigious amount of data. T o pull out useful answers, researchers will need to treat it like an internet. QUERY The fi nal data product will be queried by many types of health practitioners. Their searches will need to be parsed diff erently in diff abbreviations, and tolerate typos\u2014 just as internet searches do today.

REFINECOLLECT Raw data will accrue from several sources. Some, such as the genome, will be measured once. Others, such as cholesterol levels, will be measured periodi- cally. And some, like heart rate and cortisol, will be constantly monitored. T o make raw data useful, it needs to be reduced to its essence. Removing parts of the genome common to every human, for example, can reduce storage dramatically. The fi nal, compacted product would be carefully indexed and securely stored. The health aide might want to speak a voice command and hear an audible alert when their hands are full. 70 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN CUSTOM MEDIA 71 MRI images and other EHR media from hospitals and devices, which, even after being compressed, will be large. The Presentation Once we have made a rough cut at amassing all in - formation that is relevant to a query, we need to fur - ther refine this list to highlight those elements that are the most useful. Ideally, we'd want to show an ordered list of results, where the top element is the best answer. A random ordering, by contrast, would require more time for doctors to look for an answer. Search systems use a variety of mathematical techniques to prefer one piece of information over another. Most famously, Google's PageRank algo - rithm settles the matter with a tautology: the most relevant web page was the one that had the most links from the other relevant web pages. Today, search systems use hundreds, if not thou - sands, of analytical features to represent relevance. The page rank of a research report gives us the option to prefer well-cited research over less well-known re - search. In the context of phenomics, a recent biologi - cal measurement can get preference over older ones, or measurements from professional medical equip - ment may be preferred over consumer devices. Once an information-retrieval system produces an initial generic ranking of relevant results, the ranking needs some fine-tuning. Artificial-intelli - gence systems can adjust the order of results based on who is doing the searching, the device they're us - ing, or where they're making the search and when. For instance, cancer researchers may prefer to see new, peer-reviewed results from PubMed rather than older, more established and cited papers. The final step is how to best present the set of rel - evant, ranked results. Presenting results has a lot to do with how users like to receive information, taking into account the devices they're using, where they are, and so forth. Doctors speaking into a phone on the way to see a patient may prefer a succinct spo - ken answer, in their native language, followed by a concise display of results on their tablet. Caregivers who don't have a free hand may want diagrams and Presenting results has a lot to do with how users like to receive information.charts projected in a live augmented-reality video feed. A researcher at a desk may prefer a screen full of detailed information, with data organized neatly in a spreadsheet for analysis. A growing number of teams are using these types of techniques from information retrieval to modern - ize medicine and the study of the phenome. Sauvik Chatterjee and his colleagues describe a system that uses tensors and neural networks to detect cancers from methylated DNA found in blood samples. Qi Wu and collaborators combine sophisticated natural- language processing and vision techniques to build question-and-answer systems that explore the hu - man genome. Sebastian Castillo-Hair and colleagues combine synthetic biology and machine learning to predict the efficacy of mRNA designs, improving the performance of COVID-19 vaccines. Technology vendors will create secure, private enclaves for all this information, either on-premise or in cloud environments. These enclaves will fol - low strict guidelines for protecting private health data that are spelled out in laws, such as the U.S.'s Health Insur - ance Portability and Accountabil - ity Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the U.K.'s Data Privacy Act of 2018, and the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation. These laws establish strict rules for managing sensitive user data, ensuring security and privacy. Vendors will have to follow these rules and be certified by regulators. The cloud environments are operated by health-care organizations, such as hospitals, doctor's offices and our medical insurers. (Google has written up best practices for protecting health data on Google Cloud.) These secure, private enclaves can deploy sophisticated technology to ana - lyze our source code, better managing and preserv - ing our health. Soon, inexpensive tests will read the dense, na - noscale information within our cells, revealing what's going on in our bodies. The data we now en - joy on the internet may soon be dwarfed by our own personal source code, helping us understand where we came from, how we work, and how to improve the lives of billions. We will literally be able to search for the meaning of life. Scott Penberthy is director of applied AI at Google.

BY JUAN ENRIQUEZ to get more cumbersome, expensive and, especially considering the recent fall in life expectancy during the pandemic, worse in terms of outcomes. Technology is not the culprit here, of course. What's needed is a shift in the way technology is used and directed. Rather than training most of the nation's technology on treating the sick, what's need - ed is a shift in focus to keeping people as healthy and disease free as possible. That means developing technology and fostering start-up companies that can put in place a wellness infrastructure to imple - ment the scientific wellness ideas being developed by Phenome Health. The U.S. spends close to one-fifth of its GDP trying to help the sick, but this is not paying off in increased lifespan or increased health-span\u2014the number of healthy, productive years a person can be expected to live. When you look at health-care spending world - wide, the U.S. is paying way more than other devel - oped nations\u2014in some cases, three times more per capita\u2014and getting less in return. Although lifespan has increased dramatically for all developed coun - tries in recent decades, the U.S. is lagging its peer group of developed nations. The average Japanese person now lives 85 years compared with 76 years for the average American. Citizens of the U.K., France, It - aly, Chile, among other countries, all live longer than Americans on average. These nations spend half as much per capita on health care as the U.S. A major difference between the U.S. and these other nations is how they prioritize and incentivize health-care decisions. The U.S. uses a fee-for-service model, in which patients pay for the procedures that doctors perform, not for the outcomes they achieve. This financing structure has led to a health-care system that has advanced, technological interven - tions for the very sick, but poor public-health in - frastructure. Fee-for-service has distorted health- care priorities in favor of expensive treatments for people who are sick, rather than measures to keep them from getting sick in the first place. It has en - couraged health-care spending on rare diseases; special-interest groups lobby Congress and the Na -tional Institutes of Health on behalf of small groups of people, sometimes at the expense of focusing on preventive measures that could improve the lives of more people. The U.S. system may work well for people who are rich, but it is not geared to keeping 330 million people healthy over the long term for a reasonable price; the Medicare system, for instance, largely ne - glects people until they reach age 65 and their bodies are beginning to fall apart, at which point they can receive lavishly expensive interventions. From the standpoint of the nation's overall health, this system almost guarantees overspending and underachiev - ing. Keeping people healthy costs far less per capita than treating them when they have already devel - oped preventable illnesses. Things work differently in many other developed nations. In Britain, the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, which is imperfect in many ways, measures the effectiveness of everything it does in terms of disability adjusted life-years (which looks at years of life lost due to disability, poor health, and premature death). When the NHS budgets a medi - cal intervention, whether it's a pill or a transplant or nutritional advice, the operative question is: Will this increase the years of healthy life, unencumbered by disease and disability, for most individuals? The focus on outcomes in the U.K., Can - ada, and elsewhere, is powerful. It creates an incentive to value nutrition, vaccination, exercise and other relatively inexpensive choices. It drives clinicians and educators to pay particular attention to the health of chil - dren, educating them on the importance of eating well, exercising regularly and getting a good night's sleep. In France, for instance, kids learn how to eat nutritiously in primary or secondary school classes. The rise of well care will face much resistance from powerful forces\u2014some health-care companies and hospitals profit greatly from the status quo. Re - cently, however, some parts of the U.S. health-care industry, driven by businesses and insurers, have slowly and tentatively shifted towards prevention. Investment from venture funds, like the one I am a part of, are focusing on health-care start-ups that aim for prevention. Some health-care providers are pay - ing for \"value-based\" care, in which financial incen - tives are structured to keep a population healthy. In September 2022, the White House sponsored its sec - ond nutrition-health summit, 50 years after the first. The summit, which focused on hunger, nutrition and health, was part of the Biden administration's plan The U.S. spends close to one- fifth of its GDP trying to help the sick, but this is not paying off. The U.S. is a powerhouse in technolo - gy, so it's no surprise that the biggest success in the medical field has been technology based. Medicine in the U.S. is a powerful engine of creation, with more clinical trials and more medical start-ups than any other country. If you need a treatment for a rare disease, or heart transplant surgery, or cancer immunotherapy, the U.S. is the best place to be\u2014it is the center of cutting-edge technologies and procedures. But the trend towards faster, better and cheaper that characterizes the evolution of technology has not translated to health care, which each year seems 74 THE NEW SCIENCE OF WELLNESS to end food insecurity in the U.S. within eight years. That should happen every year, because food and ex - ercise are fundamental and underfunded aspects of affordable health care. If the U.S. could reorient its health-care indus - try towards wellness, it would foster the rise of technologies in service of that goal. There is a large pool of capital waiting to be invested in wellness, courtesy of the almost unprecedented creation and concentration of wealth in the U.S. in the past de - cades. Billionaires tend to worry about living long, healthy lives. They want to avoid diseases that will kill them and are pouring money into start-ups that research longevity, healthy eating and lifestyle-preven - tive medicine. One can successfully in - vest in and support these trends. For instance, a com- pany called ShapeUp, ac - quired first by Virgin Pulse and then by a growth eq - uity firm, was founded by two medical students who dropped out of Brown University after realizing just how much patient suffering is driven by obesity and diabetes. They started a nonprofit that got a signifi - cant part of the population of Rhode Island to walk and lose weight. Then they scaled internationally as a for-profit company. Even a five percent average reduction in body weight has a significant impact on the costs and outcomes of a health-care system. Another company we backed, Foodsmart, offers nu - trition advice as a telehealth service, again provid - ing significant results in chronic disease. These out - comes have been verified by large insurers who are now driving similar programs. To live a long, healthy life in this world, you need to keep your brain healthy. But we are just at the early stages of mapping the brain, much less under - standing how to cure diseases and improve brain health. More than 90 percent of drugs that target the central nervous system fail in trials. But this is shifting. Ed Boyden, a neuroscientist at MIT who co-directs the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bion - ics at MIT, has been hyperproductive at generating the basic instruments and technologies to begin to analyze and control the brain. He and colleagues are developing technologies that communicate directly with the nervous system for the purpose of helping people with disabilities.Electrical signals, tailored to the individual, could eventually coax tissues and organs back to health. Michael Levin's group at Tufts, which is experi - menting with radically different ways to regrow brains, has demonstrated the potential of this new technology. They started with a slightly unusual model: the flatworm. If you cut a flatworm in two, a few days later the head grows a new tail, and then the tail grows a new head. (You can cut a flatworm in this way hundreds of times.) So far, so good for brain regeneration. But then Levin and his team found that a little electric - ity after the cut radically alters the morphology of the worms, creating an animal with two heads. Apply electricity in a dif - ferent way and you grow five heads, or the head and brain of a different species, without ever altering the genome. This finding raises some intriguing thoughts. Someday, could we radi - cally alter the morphology of human cells, and even organs, not with chemicals or genome engineering, but with electricity? Perhaps emerging technologies like electroceuticals\u2014using electricity to do the work of drugs or even surgeons\u2014could someday bend the cost curves of health care. Other wellness technologies could make their way into routine medical care. At the health start - up Openwater, Mary Lou Jepsen, a former executive at Facebook, Google and other tech companies, is building inexpensive, portable wearable MRI ma - chines that could be placed in ambulances or be used in doctors' offices, where they could detect strokes or other issues. Eventually, these devices could be used to measure blood flow to the brain, perhaps provid - ing the personalized brain maps that could spot brain abnormalities and prevent damage. With in - centives that direct the U.S. technological enterprise towards wellness, we could scale new technologies like this to a level that would improve the health of entire populations. Juan Enriquez is a venture capitalist who invested in Openwater, Foodsmart, ShapeUp, and a series of other health start-ups. He is the author of several life science bestsellers, has given a dozen TED talks, is an affiliate at MIT's synthetic neurobiology lab, and loves to teach.If the U.S. could reorient its health-care industry towards wellness, it would foster the rise of technolo - gies in service of that goal.
