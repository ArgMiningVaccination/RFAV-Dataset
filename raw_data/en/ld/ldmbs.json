The group of homeopathic medicines called nosodes is the medicines sourced from microbes or diseased products (or tissues). They are precursors or vaccines, but not vaccines. They are comparable with vaccines but their scope in the treatment is more curative than preventive. The preventive role is not yet fully explored. Interestingly the role of nosodes is curative medicines is not restricted to the diseases from which are sourced. For example, the use of homeopathic nosode sourced from Cancer tissues is not only for the cases of cancer but also for diseases such as autism, warts, skin diseases, and more. Nosodes have been in use in homeopathy since 1826; more so from 1875 onwards. However, in those years since microbiology was not well developed, the nosodes then prepared were by using the unsophisticated and crude method. Unfortunately, in spite of marvelous development in the fields of microbiology, immunology, and medicine; the homeopathic method of nosode preparation is still one, which was used in 1880! Very unscientific and obsolete. Dr Rajesh Shah has been researching the nosodes since 1998 and he has revamped the method of nosode preparation and introduced a scientific method. This is a revolutionary move, leading to the review of the entire category of the nosodes as well as other categories where overhauling is required. HIV nosode The HIV virus is a very difficult virus to handle due to obvious biosafety measures. With the help of a team of experts including immunologists, pharmacologists, molecular biologists, physicians, legal experts, and homeopaths, Dr Shah could manage to prepare HIV nosode, which is a revolution in the field of homeopathy. Besides developing the HIV nosode, he also conducted the following studies with HIV nosodes: 1. Homeopathic Pathogenetic Trial (Drug Proving)2 2. Clinical trial on patients suffering from HIV infection.3 The research articles above have been published in peer-reviewed journals in Germany, UK, and India. Hepatitis C nosode Similarly, Dr Shah introduced another nosode from yet more difficult virus called the Hepatitis C virus. This infection has affected the world in a big way. For example, in the United States, the cases of Hepatitis C are two and half times more than those of HIV. India and China have a large number of patients with this infection. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis nosode Tuberculosis bacteria have been creating havoc for humans for centuries. They keep evolving and become more dangerous over the decades. Dr Rajesh Shah has developed a novel, revolutionary nosode from Mycobacterium Tuberculosis at the world-renowned Haffkine Institute (Mumbai).6 The medical fraternity will remember this research by Dr Shah always. The nosode is undergoing several more studies. It may be noted that Dr Shah's pioneering research with the nosodes will take homeopathy to a new level. Cancer tissue nosode Cancer tissues processed and potentized using the currently available scientific methods to prepare novel Cancer tissue nosode. The older version of Carconosin developed about seventy years ago was not well-documented due to a lack of technology in those years. Dr Shah has developed a range of Cancer nosodes using various cancer tissues. The new Cancer nosode has demonstrated anti-cancer effects against cancer cells in cell studies.

Contact [Dr. Shah directly](https://www.askdrshah.com/askyourquestionpage.aspx)! which is commonly known as the baldness in spots, is a kind of hair loss affecting the scalp. It may even occur in other areas of your body. Most often, the loss of hair is observed in the scalp area. However, in some cases of alopecia areata, it can even affect other areas of the body, such as eyebrows, facial hair (i.e. mustache and bread), eyelashes, nasal hair, and cause the development of spots/patches of baldness in other areas of your body. As a matter of fact, [alopecia areata](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/alopecia-areata/alopecia-areata.aspx) is a common health concern occurring due to certain hormonal and immunological factors. The loss of hair due to this condition occurs in both men as well as women. Also, you can find children being affected by this hair loss condition. In fact, it affects about 2% of the total population throughout the world. Understanding Alopecia Areata: So, you might be wondering how alopecia areata occurs, aren't you? Let's see. Keratin, a protein, is one of the crucial components of our hair. It is also a prominent constituent of our nails. Papilla, which is known for being a specialized structure present in our skin, tends to produce the hair. You can see it in the image below. A sac-like structure that happens to surround the papilla is known as a 'hair follicle'. Also, the hair root present in our skin is surrounded by the hair follicle. The part of our hair which comes out of the skin surface is known as a shaft. Alopecia areata is actually an auto-immune disorder. When your body's immune system attacks your hair follicles mistakenly and causes their destruction, you may suffer from the symptoms (i.e. bald spots/patches) of alopecia areata. You happen to experience a hair loss of the affected areas of your body. The most common and perceptible alopecia areata symptom is the development of bald patches on the head/scalp. Most often, hair loss occurs in the round, small coin-sized areas of the scalp. The affected individuals may develop one or many bald patches on his head. Some patients may have static bald patches, while some may develop bald patches involving bigger areas of the scalp. Some individuals may suffer extensive hair loss. In certain cases, the alopecia area can cause complete hair loss on the scalp (Alopecia Areata Totalis) or it can lead to a total hair loss on the head as well as face, and the rest of the patient's body (i.e. Alopecia Areata Universalis). Types Of Alopecia Areata: There are certain types of alopecia areata that can affect your scalp and body. Find them mentioned below. 1.Alopecia Areata Monolocularis: The presence of a single bald spot on the affected person's scalp is characteristic of Alopecia Areata Monolocularis. 2.Alopecia Areata The appearance of multiple the peculiarity of Alopecia Areata Multilocularis. 3.Alopecia Areata Totalis: Complete loss of all the hair present on the scalp is characteristic of Alopecia Areata Totalis. 4.Alopecia Areata Universalis: The loss of all hair on the body, including the pubic hair, is the peculiarity of Alopecia Areata Universalis. 5.Alopecia Areata Barbae: When the hair loss is restricted only to the bread area of an individual, you can say it is Alopecia Areata Barbae. 6. Traction Alopecia: The occurrence of baldness on the temporal and frontal margins of the scalp, on account of persistent tension due to tightly tied hair, is called traction alopecia. All the individuals experiencing alopecia areata should check for these two conditions too, as they often accompany this disorder. 1. An under-active thyroid (Hypothyroidism) 2. Diabetes Mellitus All these three conditions are auto-immune disorders. And, their prognosis and treatment are focused on the regulation of all of them simultaneously, as it's noticed in several cases treated effectively at Life Force. Causes Of Alopecia Areata: Alopecia areata causes are not yet clear yet. This sort of hair loss is regarded to be an auto-immune disorder occurring when your body's immune system happens to attack your hair follicles mistakenly causing its destruction. The affected body area tends to lose hair. Certain factors are known to trigger your immune system to act abnormally in such a manner causing hair loss of the affected body area. Even though the exact cause of such kind of destruction of hair follicles is not yet known, it is suspected that a genetic factor is responsible for it. If you have a family history of this condition i.e. alopecia areata or any other auto-immune disorder (such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroid, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or any other immune-mediated condition), then it can be considered as the cause of alopecia areata indicating the role of a genetic factor. Also, besides the genetic predisposition, certain triggering factors can be considered as [alopecia area causes](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/alopecia-areata/alopecia-areata-causes.aspx). Experiencing stress for a prolonged period too may be responsible for an auto-immune process which may make you suffer from alopecia areata. But, this may not occur in the case of every patient with this disease. Alopecia area treatment needs to consider the possible underlying causes while tackling this condition. In addition to this, alopecia areata can affect you due to some other triggers and causative factors as mentioned below. One or several factors which are mentioned below can be responsible for the development of the complaints of Alopecia Areata: - Hormonal Factor: Excess amounts of male hormones (in both men & women) can be responsible for triggering the development of alopecia areata. - Thyroid Disorders - Drugs & Medications: a)Some of the most common drugs and medications triggering alopecia areata are chemotherapy drugs and some medications utilized for treating hypertension, gout, depression, ischemic heart disease, arthritis, and other diseases. b)When Vitamin A is taken in large doses, it too can stimulate alopecia Oral contraceptive pills - Deficiency of iron - Fungal infection affecting the scalp - Poor intake of proteins - Going for chemical treatment for hair - The exposure of hair to excessive or intense heat. - Lichen Planus affecting your scalp (accompanied with scarring) - Physical Stress: After a major surgery, achieving a rapid weight loss by dieting, or on account of some chronic disease - SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) Alopecia Areata Symptoms: - The occurrence of excessive loss of hair in small, circular patches/spots in a short time span. - Alopecia areata can affect your scalp, beard, eyebrows, mustache, or eyelashes. - One of many bald patches/spots. - The underlying skin of the affected area appears normal. - Diffused Alopecia Areata: Generalized hair thinning occurring over the scalp. - Alopecia Totalis: Complete hair loss occurring over the scalp. - Alopecia Universalis: Extensive loss of hair occurring over the entire body. - Scarred Alopecia Areata: A patch/spot of alopecia which has developed a scar can't be cured with any medicine.

Alopecia Areata When Masked With Areata Masked With Immunosuppressive Medicines? to Patients who have taken immunosuppressive medicines)By Dr. Rajesh Shah, MD (Hom) Several patients, who suffer from one or more of the diseases listed below, approach us for an effective treatment when their ailment happens may get masked by certain immunosuppressants. Some diseases which may get masked by the use of other medications are mentioned below. | | - Psoriasis - Lichen Planus - Alopecia Areata - Rheumatoid | - Urticaria - Psoriatic arthritis - Ulcerative colitis | | (atopic dermatitis) - Vitiligo - Nephrotic Syndrome Immunosuppressive medications help in managing inflammatory, allergic, and auto-immune conditions. They are the conventional drugs that suppress your body's immune response. Even though these immunosuppressive drugs act effectively in treating various diseases, they come with drawbacks which are mentioned below. - Provides only a temporary relief - Cause drug dependency - Significant adverse effects - Lead to a relapse of diseases that you may find difficult to manage. This article does not intend criticism of immunosuppressants nor intends to discuss the adverse effects of these medications, but to analyze the difficulty they pose when homeopathic treatment is initiated for the patients who have used these immunosuppressive medications earlier. Some conventional drugs (i.e. immunosuppressants) whose use may mask the ailments are mentioned below. - Tacrolimus (for treating vitiligo) - Cyclophosphamide (for treating Nephrotic Syndrome) - Cortisone (steroids) can be used as oral, injection, topical application, or mouthwash (for treating all above-mentioned ailments) - Methotrexate (for treating the conditions like Psoriasis, Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, etc.) - Cyclosporine (for treating conditions like Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis, etc.) - Proposals (for treating the disorder of Psoriasis) When approaching us for seeking effective homeopathic treatment, patients, who are currently having one of the above listed immunosuppressive drugs or have used them in the last 6 months, must note some important facts mentioned below. a)When immunosuppressive medications' effect ends, the ailment and its symptoms may relapse in the case of some patients if not all. You may find that in the case of skin conditions, such as alopecia areata, lichen planus, and vitiligo, the skin disorder may crop up on different body areas, though not at the same old affected body area. b)You should never have immunosuppressive drugs life-long, under any circumstances. When you stop having them, the disease is likely to reoccur. So, it is wiser to opt for homeopathic remedies in such cases for better management of the condition. c)The relapse of the condition, which you may experience after curbing immunosuppressive drugs, may coincide with the initiation of homeopathic treatment. You may feel that the disease has returned or an increase in the symptoms of the ailment is occurring due to the homeopathic treatment. However, you must note that homeopathic remedies never aggravate or increase the disease in such circumstances. The increase in the symptoms may occur due to the stoppage of immunosuppressants and not due to homeopathy. d)The relapse of the disease which occurs due to curbing the use of immunosuppressive drugs may be more severe than prior. e)The relapsed condition may be more resistant than prior. It is important to note that some diseases may relapse even after commencing the homeopathic remedies, and you may need to use immunosuppressants for some period. Some of you may think that once you start with homeopathic medicines, you no more need to have any allopathic medications. However, you must note that using immunosuppressive drugs when experiencing a relapse, after you stop using them, is not a sign of the failure of homeopathic treatment. f)You may need it since no milder medication would act to offer you relief. g)The frequent use of immunosuppressive medications may make your body addicted or dependent on it. Such ailments are known as 'drug-dependent diseases'. For instance, using cortisone for treating conditions like Nephrotic Syndrome or Ulcerative colitis can make you dependent on it h)The relapsed skin eruptions in the case of urticaria, eczema, or psoriasis after curbing immunosuppressants may be difficult to manage in the initial few episodes of relapse. These types of cases need to be managed strategically to achieve a greater success rate in beating adverse situations. i)Immunosuppressive drugs dependent ailments of the patients can be tackled effectively with homeopathic treatment; however, it may need some time. Some cortisone-resistant or cortisone-dependent cases, particularly Nephrotic Syndrome or Ulcerative colitis, may be quite difficult to manage and may need time. And, homeopathy can't be considered a shortcut for such difficult conditions. You must be aware that homeopathy is indeed a quite effective medical system. However, certain disease conditions may be quite difficult to manage. Ailments, which are masked or treated using immunosuppressants, are usually considered difficult conditions. Careful and proper evaluation, strategic planning, profound medical knowledge, a sound experience of the homeopath along with compliance of the patient prove helpful in achieving highly effective and long-lasting positive results in case of such diseases.

Phosphoric Acid is often used for hair loss, debility, hemorrhages, gastrointestinal complaints, diabetes, sexual complaints, depression, and other health issues. When you suffer from premature graying of hair or early hair fall, phosphoric acid serves as a good remedy. It also treats conditions where hair falls out of the eyebrows, scalp, genitals, and other body parts, when you experience hair fall due to acute ailments, such as fevers, and when complaints occur after you lose lots of crucial body fluids due to some acute ailments. Fluoric Acid: Fluoric Acid is another wonderful medicine that is prepared by the process of potentization of hydrofluoric acid. It is well-known for being one of the most effective and excellent medicine for hair loss. Some of its common indications are hair loss in spots from the scalp after fever, sticky hair, the loss of hair that occurs due to syphilis, hair gets matted together and entangled, and the occurrence of the loss of hair & alopecia areata after a long-term febrile disease or typhoid. Fluoric acid is an excellent homeopathic medicine for treating the complaints of alopecia areata effectively. anemia-diet Skin diseases must be treated from inside, not from outside Skin is the largest body organ and the diseases of the skin are actually a reflection of what goes wrong within the body at the level of the immune system, hormones, metabolism, and genetics. This basic wisdom is missed out on by conventional medicine. As a result, the treatment modalities for most skin diseases are centered around the use of external, immunosuppressive medicines such as cortisone, Tacrolimus, and the like. Since the auto-immune immunological conflicts; they essentially need to be treated by correcting the inner, internal, immunological dysfunctions. Such internal rectifications cannot be achieved by the external use of immune-suppressive measures. When we use any immunosuppressive medicines topically on the skin, the experience suggests the following complications: a. The disease returns of stopping the use of external lotions, either at the same place or other locations b. The disease returns with more severity c. The disease goes deeper, affecting deeper organs. For example, Psoriasis may lead to Psoriatic Arthritis and Eczema may lead to Asthma. d. Resurfaced disease is more resistant to other medicines. e. The adverse effects of immunosuppressive medicines. Those who have used immunosuppressive creams for a long time would share the experience. After treating many thousands of cases of skin diseases, we at Life Force have understood the above challenges very well. In some cases, the integration of homeopathy with conventional medicine may be called for. For example, in cases of severe Atopic Dermatitis, one may need to use antihistamines to get relief from intense itching. At any given point, homeopathy must be strongly thought about for skin diseases at all stages. Arnold Chiari malformation Arnold- Chiari malformations is a condition where there are structural defects in the lower part of the brain. In this condition, the small brain (cerebellum) gets displaced (herniation) downward through an opening at the base of the skull. This results in a disturbance in the normal flow of the fluid which circulates in the brain and the spine. (The fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid.) This is a type 2 Chiari malformation that was named in the honor of Austrian pathologist Chiari and German pathologist Julius Arnold. Type 1 Chiari malformation is a deformity by birth which involves disorders of connective tissue. Causes 1) Idiopathic: The cause of its occurrence still remains unknown. 2) Congenital: Hydrocephalus (collection of fluid in the skull), vitamin D resistant rickets, neurofibromatosis type 1. It can run in families sometimes if children inherit a gene which causes problems with the skull development. The child may be asymptomatic in the initial years of his life but they may get evident later. However, there is a small risk of children inheriting this problem. 3) Acquired: Post-trauma (Whiplash injury to head) - It is known that the traction force of a ligament in the tail of the spinal cord tries to create pressure on the spinal cord which pulls the cerebellum (small brain) downwards thereby also causing bending of the spinal cord (scoliosis). Signs and Symptoms It gives rise to many pressure symptoms as follows: - Headaches - Dizziness - Irregular eye movements (nystagmus) - Facial pain - Difficulty in swallowing - Nausea, vomiting - Fatigue, muscle weakness - Neck pain - Unsteady gait - Difficulty in concentration - Numbness and tingling in the feet - Speech problems like hoarseness of voice - Difficulty in hand coordination (fine motor skills affected) Rare symptoms - Tinnitus (ringing in ears) - Abnormal breathing This defect can progress slowly or rapidly. Diagnosis MRI is considered to be the best way to diagnose this malformation. However, a good clinical history of the patient with the neurological examination is also important. Diagnosis of the suspected malformation can be made through ultrasound before birth. Exercise There are some exercises that help therapeutically in Chiari malformation. Low impact exercises can be done after consulting your physician concerned. Some precautions like lifting heavy weights, brisk walking, swimming, cycling should be avoided. Scope of homeopathy It is important to know that homeopathy is not a substitute for surgery in such cases. It can only treat symptomatically up to a certain level. It cannot prevent the further progress of the disease since it is a malformation wherein the cerebellum can herniate at any level any time depending upon the patient's lifestyle and nature of the activity. One can possibly delay surgery if the patient benefits symptomatically through homeopathy. At Life Force, we have little experience based on only two cases (as of November 2017) and the results are yet inconclusive. Articles Asthma What is Asthma? Asthma is a respiratory disease that occurs when your airways swell and turn narrow producing an excess of mucus. The word 'Asthma' is of ancient Greek origin and it signifies panting. [Asthma](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma.aspx) may make your normal, easy breathing difficult. Also, you may suffer from coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. This respiratory disease is known to be long-term and recurring. The inflammation of the affected individual's airways recurs, thereby obstructing the easy, normal flow of the air. As a matter of fact, asthma is quite common worldwide, and it occurs in all age groups. You may find it affecting from a few months old babies to aged people. However, asthma is controllable by large, and, to a certain extent, it can be cured depending on the extent of the ailment and its stage. What Exactly Happens in Asthma? (Pathogenesis) Asthma is a very common yet quite problematic disease, you might be eager to learn exactly what happens in asthma, aren't you? Let's see. In asthma, a significant decrease in the lumen of the airway occurs on account of the two-fold response to irritants and allergens. Basically, in the case of hyper-reactive response to allergens, airways' smooth muscles happen to constrict and turn narrow by large. Also, the immune system of the affected individual sends WBCs (white blood cells) & some other immune factors to airways, as a response to the allergens. An inflammatory response is quite common in asthmatic patients, and it leads to an increase in the secretion of mucus and swelling of the airways. Thereby, the asthmatic patient happens to suffer from discomforting symptoms, such as coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Prevalence of Asthma Asthma may affect individuals of all age groups, ranging from kids to aged people. [Asthma in kids](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthmatic-bronchitis/asthmatic-bronchitis.aspx) is often observed. Children coming in the age group of 2 to 12 years are reported with a higher rate of asthma (i.e. 15.7%) than adults coming in the age group of 16 years and above (i.e. 10.1%). The occurrence of asthma in males is reported to be the highest among children coming in the age group of 2 to 12 years. The occurrence of asthma in females is reported to be the highest among young adults coming in the age group of 16 to 24 years. As a matter of fact, asthma has a close connection with allergies. However, most, but not all, asthma patients suffer from allergies. Children, who have a family history of asthma and allergy, are more vulnerable to suffering from asthma. Symptoms of Asthma: There are certain symptoms of asthma that you should never ignore. Find the most common [asthma symptoms](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-symptoms.aspx) mentioned below. - A cough - The production of mucus - Difficulty in breathing - Exhaustion The sense of suffocation or breathlessness is the most prominent and distressing asthma symptom. Breathlessness may vary in its intensity. Some asthma patients may not experience the production of mucus (i.e. expectoration) and cough at all. Occurrence/FrequencyOf Asthma Symptoms: Depending on the circumstances and triggers, the frequency of occurrence of asthma may vary. You may experience the symptoms of asthma as mentioned below. - Periodical (i.e. from once in a week to once in a year) - Continuous (i.e. most often or all throughout) - Seasonal (i.e. Asthma affects for a few weeks in a year) Triggers of Asthma: [Asthma causes](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-symptoms.aspx) are often triggers of asthma. The symptoms of asthma might get triggered by one or more of the mentioned triggers. - Physical exertion - Mental stress - Infection - Change in the weather or temperature - Exposure to pollution (dust, chemical, pollen, etc.) - Also, asthma may occur without any apparent reason Treatment for Asthma: Fortunately, asthma can be treated effectively and naturally with the help of homeopathic remedies. Even though homeopathic [asthma treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-treatment.aspx) is a little lengthy, it is a highly effective solution to get rid of discomforting asthma and to obtain great relief. Asthma Causes: Factors Responsible for Asthma Asthma does not occur due to a particular single cause. It can affect you adversely due to several factors, which are usually divided into two categories as mentioned below. - External - Internal More than one factors are responsible for the cause and maintenance of asthma. Here are some of the prominent causes of asthma. - Genetic factor or hereditary cause - Mental stress - Allergens - Environmental factors (such as pollution, pollen, e.t.c.) - Systemic diseases Most often, asthma tends to have a tendency to recur and affects you for the long term. Often, it's a life-long disease, just like high blood pressure or diabetes. The fact is that one or more above-mentioned factors tend to alter the immunity, and this ultimately can make you suffer from chronic asthma. Often, hereditary factors or genetic tendencies can be the cause of asthma, which may make you prone to it due to internal or external triggers. Allergens Causing Asthma: Certain allergens are responsible to trigger an asthma attack. Some of these common allergens are mentioned below. - Pollens - Respiratory infections - Common cold, Sinusitis - Air pollutants - Cold air - Smoking and second-hand smoking - Physical exertion, excessive exercises - Medications: NSAID, Aspirin, Beta-blockers, etc. - GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) The list of asthma triggers can be exhaustive, though each asthma patient may suffer from an asthma attack due to a different asthma trigger or a combination of triggering factors. Asthma Risk Factors: Here are some risk factors which can increase your vulnerability to developing asthma. - Heredity - Having a family history of asthma where either parents or family members happen to suffer from Asthma. - Work Environment - Exposure to chemicals, pollens, dust, and industrial waste can increase your risk to develop asthma symptoms. - Urban / Industrial areas that have greater exposure to environmental pollutants can be one of the prominent asthma risk factors. - Childhood -A childhood history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and a low birth weight can cause asthma in kids. - GERD - Obesity: Obese or overweight individuals, who have BMI (body mass index) between 25 and 30, are more vulnerable to suffering from asthma and its symptoms in comparison with the people who aren't obese. In fact, obese grown-ups having 30 or greater BMI tend to have twice the risk of developing asthma. The asthma risk for obese individuals might be more for non-allergic asthma than allergic ones. Asthma Symptoms & Severity Levels Of Asthma The intensity, frequency or recurrence, and duration of asthma symptoms can differ from person to person. Besides this, even in the same asthma patients, the symptoms may vary from episode to episode. Some asthma patients may experience long symptom-free periods that are interrupted by periodic attacks of asthma. On the contrary, some asthma patients may suffer from symptoms almost daily. Most often, certain asthma patients experience asthma symptoms only while exercising or on getting exposed to certain viral respiratory tract infections or allergens. Common Symptoms of Asthma: Numerous discomfort symptoms indicate asthma. Some of them are listed below. - Coughing occurs most often, and it turns worse at night. - Breathlessness or shortness of breath - Wheezing. It is a whistling sound you happen to emit while breathing. - Rapid pulse - Nasal flaring - Sweating - Retractions of intercostal spaces - In severe cases of asthma, bluish discoloration of lips/face may occur. Based on the affecting symptoms, asthma is divided into four levels of severity are: - Mild Intermittent: If you suffer from mild intermittent asthma, you may experience asthma episodes twice a week or even less. Between these asthma episodes, however, you may not experience any symptoms and the functioning of your lungs would be normal. - Mild Persistent Asthma: If you have mild persistent asthma, you may experience asthma symptoms greater than twice a week, but not more than once in a single day. Asthma symptoms at night may bother you with discomfort more than twice a month. - Moderate Persistent Asthma: If you have moderate persistent asthma, you may suffer from asthma symptoms daily. Also, discomfort due to asthma symptoms may bother you at night more than once a week. - Severe Persistent Asthma: If you have severe persistent asthma, distressing symptoms of asthma may affect you adversely throughout the day on most days. Often, you may suffer from asthma discomfort at night. Most often, asthma is diagnosed clinically. To assess the intensity of this respiratory disease and its association with other health issues, certain investigations are carried out in most cases. A proper physical examination is conducted and a detailed medical history is considered to assess the severity of the symptoms mentioned below. - The occurrence of recurrent respiratory infections - Sudden breathlessness and onset of wheezing on getting exposed to allergens - An allergic cough which turns worse at night - Medicines you used to help ease your breathing - Your family history of asthma and related allergies A general health check-up and your respiratory system's physical examination is conducted to rule out the possibility of other ailments. After conducting a thorough medical examination and considering the medical history, pulmonary function test & other necessary investigation may be recommended for a complete diagnosis. Clinical Tests Include: Pulmonary function tests include: - Spirometry - Exhaled Nitric oxide test - Challenge test - Chest and Sinus X-rays - Complete Blood count - GERD assessment test (if any associated gastric symptoms are present) - CT scan (not done routinely) Asthma: Homeopathic Treatment For most asthma patients, if not all, adult asthma happens to be life-long health suffering. So, it is crucial to manage and control it effectively by using milder medications and establishing longer periods of remission (i.e. symptom-free phase). It is a noteworthy fact that homeopathy works wonders in treating and controlling asthma effectively and safely without any side effects. Several medical studies reveal that the patients who opt for homeopathic remedies for asthma happen to enjoy far better health and relief than those who don't. In addition to this, homeopathy is an absolutely safe [treatment for asthma](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-treatment.aspx) and it causes no side effects. So, you can count on homeopathy for asthma at any time without any concerns.

Asthma: More about Homeopathic Treatment for Asthma Understanding What Needs To Be Treated In Asthma When speaking about [asthma cure](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-treatment.aspx) with homeopathic treatment, we first need to understand 'what exactly needs to be treated in the case of asthma.'. As a matter of fact, asthma is a multi-factorial respiratory disorder having its roots deeply rooted in your body's immune system. The symptoms of asthma are a symptomatic expression of this disease occurring at the level of your lungs. By considering all this, it becomes very clear that any treatment for asthma that is focused on treating the lung symptoms will only offer you temporary relief from the discomfort. It would be a too superficial approach to relieve your symptoms such as coughing and breathlessness when you need to obtain long-term relief by treating the root cause of this respiratory disease. So, you need to address and correct this respiratory disorder at the immunological level. And, homeopathy does the same by treating the disorder from its root. Homeopathic asthma treatment targets the root cause of the disease and acts at the immunological level to provide you with long-term relief. The Homeopathic Approach to treating Asthma: Homeopathy is a scientific alternative system of medicine that is known for treating a wide range of recurring and chronic ailments, such as asthma. The fundamental approach of homeopathy is an evaluation of asthma as a whole by considering various factors, such as physical generals, psychological generals, family history, past and current medications, and many other factors, of every asthma patient. It emphasizes the patient as a whole and studies several detailed aspects of asthma minutely. To improve or maintain the health of asthma patients, homeopathy works to enhance the defense mechanism of an asthma patient. Allergens are some of the most common external factors which make you suffer from the discomfort of asthma. Homeopathic treatment for asthma focuses on improving your body's innate healing efficiency so that your system does not react to the allergens adversely. In fact, it is an established rule that homeopathy never considers asthma as a local disease. Instead, asthma is regarded as a local expression occurring due to an internal system disturbance. So, homeopathy not only treats the symptoms but also addresses the disturbance in the system. We believe in constitutional prescribing in accordance with classical homeopathy. So, for this purpose, an individual case study is necessary for every asthma patient. In homeopathy, there exists no particular single remedy for all types of cases of asthma. Only an in-depth evaluation of every individual case can help you determine the exact [asthma treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/asthma-treatment.aspx) for the specific individual. When the asthma patients are treated with homeopathic asthma treatment, it not only controls the symptoms of asthma but also makes them stronger by increasing their immunity and resistance power. With homeopathic treatment, they won't react to allergens of asthma as adversely as they used to react earlier before availing the homeopathic treatment. This happens because homeopathy not only treats the symptoms of asthma patients but also treats the patient as a whole. Treatment of Acute Attack of Asthma: An acute attack of asthma can be treated effectively and successfully with correctly selected homeopathic remedies. For this purpose, a careful and elaborative study of every asthma episode is necessary to evaluate the factors which are responsible for the episode, the exact symptoms of asthma, factors that make asthma worse or better, and other factors. However, in cases, if modern medications, such as antiallergic medicines or bronchodilators, are taken during a severe attack of asthma when the patient is on homeopathic treatment, it won't interfere with the effectual homeopathic treatment. Besides this, it is important to note that homeopathic treatment is totally safe and causes no side effects. Aundh-contact-us autism-diet Dr Rajesh Shah, promoter of homeopathy Dr Rajesh Shah, being a promoter of homeopathy, was using all forms of media to spread the message of homeopathy since his undergraduate years. Being convinced of the truth being the homeopathic principles and their role in safe healthcare, even as a young student he used to distribute self-typed leaflets to co-passengers in the train, while traveling to the homeopathic college, daily! When the Internet emerged, Dr Shah envisaged the scope of this medium to promote homeopathy. He soon launched one of the first homeopathy websites in the world and then about 25 more websites, dedicated to homeopathy. After answering singlehandedly thousands of queries from patients across the world, he offered Online medical practice to patients from any part of the globe, way back in 1995.

Not only that but, he also has treated patients from across all continents. Dr Shah is the only doctor in the world who has treated patients from so many countries. And, more importantly, he has promoted homeopathy to millions of people across the globe.

Case Photos Life Force Homeopathy Patient's Case Studies casestudies-hypertension.aspx Case Studies of Lichen Planus on Nails Sixty-six years old, Brazilian resident Mrs. N. R. P. (Patient Identification Number - 16094), availed our online treatment for her complaints of nails Lichen Planus on 2nd March 2009. She had observed these changes in her nails in the past six months. Around 70% of each nail was affected. The nails had been peeled off until the middle portion. She described it as it seems as if I had been biting my nails'. There was no itching. The region on the nails where the top layer was peeled was sensitive to touch. It had started in the middle and little finger of both the hands and spread rapidly within six months and affected all the fingers. The probable cause was some stress. Her case was initially treated as a fungal infection by her skin specialist. With the treatment for a month, there was no improvement. The biopsy then concluded the absence of fungal infection. The treating physician then diagnosed it as Lichen Planus affecting only nails. She was prescribed a steroid-based cream for local application, which she was currently using. She had an associated complaint of left epicondylitis and tendonitis for which she was undergoing acupuncture and physiotherapy treatment. Her appetite was normal with no strong likes or dislikes. Her thirst was less. She was more tolerant to cold. She was lean and thin. There were no complaints with bowels and sleep. She had retired from her occupation 9 years ago; she was now living with her husband, her youngest son and her mother. She had 4 sons. The eldest lived in U.S.A with his wife and children. The second son was also married and stayed in a separate house. The third son had expired at the age of 11 years due to pneumococcal meningitis. All her family members were in good terms with each other. The youngest son was very cautious and would not share his problem with her often. She was a calm person, having full control of her emotions. Occasionally she felt anger or anxiety. She would get anxious if she wanted to do something but could not do it soon. Anger would appear if she was told to do something which did not please her. She would try to solve any problem as soon as it is necessary and possible. She had suffered in her childhood from - whooping cough, measles, chickenpox, and mumps. She had undergone tonsillectomy when an adult and hysterectomy at the age of 44 years. In the family history - her maternal grandmother had suffered from diabetes; paternal as well maternal aunt had suffered from cancer.

The thumb, index and middle finger showed a 40% improvement, while the ring and little finger showed a 30% improvement. She felt a general improvement in her health as well including relief in her elbow and shoulder pains. With a further 4 months of treatment (25/10/09), she reported that the disease progress had slowed down. The improvement was further taking place in a gradual way. With the further 4 months of treatment (22/02/10), there was a substantial improvement of 90% in the thumb, index and middle finger of both the hands. The ring and little finger of the left hand showed 60% and right hand 40% improvement. The nails which were painful at the start of treatment had become absolutely painless. With the next batch of medicines for 4 months,(28/06/10) she reported 98% improvement in all the fingers, except little finger from which the disease was started. She was advised to continue the treatment for another 4 months. After 4 months (28/10/10) she reported 100% improvement. All her fingernails had recovered completely as if the disease never existed.

The encouraging response motivated us to make this event an annual one. We now announce the 10th and 11th Courses. About the Course: Generally, the methods of prescribing taught at seminars merely give a glimpse into how the trainer works. Consequently, participants face great difficulties to put this learning into actual practice. In this context, the Clinical Training course offers an in-depth step-by-step approach to applied homeopathic practice that works for every homeopath. Learning opportunity par excellence! The condensed clinical course for ten days is conducted by Dr. Rajesh Shah and Dr. Rupal Shah, who are experienced and talented practitioners, treating patients from over 100 countries. During the course, you will witness and participate in treating a number of cases in a clinic, one of its kind in the world. This presents a rare opportunity to view transparently, how the teacher addresses multifaceted cases in real life. Dr. Rajesh's innovative but practical approach and teachings offer an effective protocol for daily practice. He terms his way of prescribing as Hard-core prescribing. The Hard-core methods of case analysis make use of Hahnemannian homeopathy. This is a comprehensive course presenting a practical review of the essential homeopathic literature. Live Hard-core Prescribing: Facts and data in the case enable the hardcore prescriber to appreciate the exact totality that needs attention. This approach also places before the practitioner the total perspective of the ailment rather than just outwardly symptoms thereby leaving no room for speculation on the origins of symptoms. There is now increasing awareness that symptoms cannot be understood in a purely cause and effect manner. Theorizing, would not help, especially when it comes to treating complex and chronic cases. Dr. Rajesh's method is simple, logical, and down to earth, which makes homeopathy work by the hands of every homeopath who is willing to learn the simple method. The contents and syllabus: In brief... The condensed clinical course is specially designed to enable participants to obtain detailed practical knowledge at all levels of management of a case. The scope would cover the entire gamut of Homeopathy practice from case-taking techniques to the whole process of arriving at the totality of the case as also analysis and synthesis of a case. It would help develop specific personal skills in potency selection and repetition of doses. The participants would also learn about the whole dynamics of repertorization of a case and be able to develop a systematic approach to homeopathic prescribing and plan every case. The course content targets learning case-analysis, prescription rationales, and long-term patient care. The study of materia medica, encompassing polychrest as well as small remedies, based on the cases observed will be incorporated. Thus applied philosophy, applied materia-medica, and the prescribing techniques would all be included as part of the course wherein the clinic will be the main Classroom, and the patients will be the principal instrument of learning. Learning hours: It involves over four hours of intense clinical training daily for ten days, eight hours a day. The course would be held for six days a week and the rest day offers an opportunity to get glimpses of this wonderful cosmopolitan city which also happens to be the financial capital of India. Eligibility: The Clinical Course is designed for higher study in homeopathy. The participants, who may be practitioners or senior students of homeopathy are expected to be fairly familiar with the fundamentals of homeopathy philosophy, prescribing, and materia medica. Any sincere practitioner or a student who has studied homeopathy well but finds problems at various levels will be benefited from this course. It may be noted that a certificate of attendance will be given to the participants. However, the certificate cannot be considered as a license to practice homeopathy. How to apply?

What some of the teachers have to say about Dr. Rajesh Shah's teachings: \"I was immediately impressed by his wholehearted dedication to the practice of Classical homeopathy; also by his diligent thoroughness and the vigor with which he approaches all aspects of the subject. His insistence on inductive, logical reasoning is a consistent feature of his teaching as also is the breadth and scope of his learning.\" -Misha Norland Director: School of Homoeopathy, UK \"Rajesh is one of the clearest teachers I know. I particularly appreciate his concern to show what is concrete and observable in each patient's story: his phenomenological approach. This makes case analysis and rubric selection a logical process. I first met Rajesh over five years ago. His work has been a key influence on my practice and teaching. I've no hesitation in recommending his teaching to students and practitioners alike.\" -Bob Fordham Director: Sheffield School of Homoeopathy \"I experienced genuine humanity in your approach which means more to me than that found in the teaching of other international teachers who don't seem to have that....I was privileged to enjoy a week of Rajesh's teaching here in the UK some years ago. The quality of his material is immediately obvious, his approach to sharing it gentle and supportive - not only has this event stayed with me ever since, but I also find myself using what he had to offer every day in the clinic.\" -Ian Townsend Senior Teacher: London College of Classical Homoeopathy \"Very much enjoyed being brought back to the basics of homeopathic prescribing...\" -Lecoufle, Germany \"I really appreciated the lectures because you managed to put everything so crystal clear...\" -Janet Westling Sweden Participant at the International Academy of Classical Homeopathy, Alonissos, Greece cliniclocator.aspx Life Force Homeopathy Clinics LifeForce Homeopathy Clinic, Chembur 411, Krushal Commercial Complex, G.

Paud Road, 11 am to 8 pm (Mon to Sat); 10 am to 6 pm (Sunday) | | Contact us Contact Us Coronavirus Genus Epidemicus (GE) in Homeopathy I have been reading random discussions on so-called GE for over a month. There are several opportunists in the profession who would try to encash, knowingly or unknowingly, in such situations. The Homeopathy profession must get matured to understand virology, immunology, internal medicine as well as homeopathy, in order to face such a pandemic. It is unwise to claim so-called GE based on a handful of cases in such self-limiting disease. This is perhaps the first pandemic for all of us. We must realize that we have no experience in handling such a disaster. There is hardly any scientific, historical document to support GE. We shouldn't be naive in declaring GEs here and there. Whatever medicine one chooses must have depth, ability, and affinity to alter the Pathogenesis that of severe pneumonitis rather than some superficial nasal symptoms. Essentially, certain medicines such as Phosphorus, Arsenic, Antimonium tart, Lycopodium, Kali carbonicum, etc. might get indicated. Maybe some Nosodes. We should not be in a hurry to declare any magical GE for such a deadly infection. If we have really grown in the last century, the very idea of GE may need to be debated. I can't expect any GE to do magic. Systematic and scientific immunological and other preclinical/clinical studies with a large sample size could add value to the Homeopathy profession. In fact, this is a great opportunity for researchers, scientists, institutions (government and non-government) to join hands and conduct some research in developing homeopathic solutions for Covid19. If we could bring some solid solutions to the table, we could attract the attention of many scientists, governments, and the world to Homeopathy. Dr Rajesh Shah, MD (Facebook post on 16th March 2020) Coronavirus nosode in Homeopathy Proposal for Coronavirus Nosode sent to Ministry AYUSH In this critical time of the Corona crisis, where we are left with no sure shot prevention or treatment, I have urged the Ministry AYUSH, PMO, and CCRH to explore developing a Corona Nosode. Logic: Homeopathic Nosodes prepared from viruses, bacteria, and other biological materials have shown anti-viral anti-bacterial effects. Some examples: 1. HIV Nosode has shown Anti-HIV effects 2. Hepatitis C Nosode has shown Anti-Hep C effect 3. Cancer Nosode has shown Anti-Cancer effects 4. Malaria Nosode has shown Anti-Malaria effect 5. E-Coli Nosode has shown Anti-E coli effect 6. Candida Nosode has shown an Anti-candida effect 7. Influenza Nosode has shown an Anti-influenza effect Based on such rationale and experience, a Coronavirus Nosode could show a potential role against Corona. I have submitted a formal Concept Paper with a full solution, based on my experience of having developed about 10 Nosodes in the last 20 years. I have offered my unconditional support and expertise in developing it. If any government or non-government organization in India or in any part of the world is willing to work in this project, please write to me privately. The project time is approximately 3-4 weeks. Tweeted again this morning to the respective authorities. I hope the government responds at the earliest.

Feedback: Clinical Training Course: February 1999 Leon du Plessis, South Africa: Very organized, structured way of case taking. A really practical course, which gives better insight into the study of the Materia Medica. It gave good practice in case taking. The course gave me much more than I had expected. I have gained tremendous confidence. I have learned more in three weeks than what I learned in 5 years at the college, especially the case taking, analysis, practical prescribing. Mary Cawley, Ireland : Lectures and clinical cases are very good for both lecturers. A major stimulus for any progress with homeopathy. Now I have renewed my interest in interest in homeopathy. The course was really very interesting. Overall I have learned a lot. The course itself is very well designed to cover the very important basics of homeopathy. Thank you for your guidance and care. Anne Mari Klarin, Sweden : What I learned is to take a case systematically. Reflecting more on what do they really mean. Not to have fixed ideas about any remedy. Reflecting on what the patient is telling you. Not take causation for granted. I really appreciate Dr. Shah couple as teachers. They helped me sort my thoughts out. To pick out the most important symptoms. I also learned a lot about acute treatment from Dr. Rupal Shah. She differentiated the remedies in a very understandable way. A lot of \"homeopathic thoughts\" having in the air have been confirmed or false. A lot of fixed ideas have started to get away from my mind. I expected a lot of this course, and I am not disappointed at all. You are a good pedagogue taking everything basically step to step, even if some of us are a little life too eager and impatient, asking questions \"too early\". Lots of things I have been thinking of having \" fallen on its place\". You are an explainer and pedagogue. The examples of the fights, crime, police, ministers, etc. were interesting and have helped me to understand the basic applications. I am really thankful and excited about all the knowledge and experience. You have shared with us, I have learned a lot about acute cases, and to handle acute cases, I was not really sure about that three weeks ago. This was indeed an intense course. Dr. Vinnikov Vladimir, Russia I learned some treasure hints for my practice and especially for my teaching practice. During the course I practical hints on Repertorisation, lots of hints in philosophy that influenced my thinking process. Janet Westling, Sweden: I learned a lot on case taking, how to put it down on paper as well as how to \"meet\" the patient. Give space, what questions to ask, etc. Friendly, relaxed atmosphere in the clinic, interesting discussions. I feel relaxed to speak \"in class\". I feel that I will have great help with what I've learned so far. Not to take everything the patient says as being \"the truth \" , but to always find out why he's doing this or that. The importance of prescribing on the balanced totality. The Concept of Facets was very useful and an important reminder of not having fixed ideas about remedies. We must focus on what is there and leave out the rest. The \"flow\" of the Phenomenon approach is a great help. The overall experience has been very positive. We have learned a lot of essential basic things that have not been included in my previous education. Case taking, potencies, finding out what's important in a case. I feel that I've got a big \" push \" forward. Elana Cossever, Canada : A much easier method of case taking. A more practical application of homeopathy. Homeopathy can become simpler than I thought possible. It just requires a sharp mind and lots of studies. Grethel Rokman, Sweden: What I learned in the course is the way to take a case, analysis, understand rubrics. A lot of cases are common and uncommon. The course contains basic applications. A Well-structured course. Refreshing study of the remedies. A truly great experience to boost the practice. Ian Harris, England: The logical structure of case taking, definitely more structured, user-friendly to which I was accustomed. Use of repertory as key to open up cases. Interesting features about certain remedies. Practical clues for remedies. Really a practice orientation course. Now, I have some heat to put on my skeleton. Improved repertorial familiarity. Structured with more effective case taking. Exposure to a different variety of cases and pathology. An interactive and intellectually stimulating homeopathic experience. Dr. Marijan Montani, Croatia : Organizing the case taking, evaluation of symptoms. Many details of repertory. Many useful clinical tips. The principle of repetition of the remedy. Some structured understanding of the potency selection and clinical applications. Almost all fields of homeopathy are covered. A very systematic and practical approach to homeopathy. The course gives a deeper insight into homeopathy and also helps in practical therapeutics. An excellent approach to the treatment of cases with distinct pathology. A most useful understanding of how to use the repertory. A wonderful system for choosing the potency and repetition. Helene Piper, Sweden : This course has made a lot of things clearer to me. I think your \"ascending \" learning that you being with the basics to take a case and end with miasm was very good for the understanding of homeopathy. I am grateful for your help in my containing work as a homeopath. I feel more confident as a homeopath.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685414](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685414) Early and mild cases of covid19 treatment at home with homeopathy Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) is a contagious disease caused by the SARS CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory disease novel coronavirus), which has resulted in a global pandemic. In spite of the strict government measures, the Covid19 infection continues to spread in the community. It is predicted that the majority of the population will suffer from the infection. The good news is, approximately 80% of the cases are mild and can be managed very well right at the comfort of your home, but with essential steps and measures. Homeopathic medicines for Covid19 infection work by strengthening your immunity, reducing the severity/strength of the virus, thereby minimizing the possibility of life-threatening complications. Homeopathy helps you recover faster from the viral infection and develop long-term resistance against the virus. The symptoms of Covid19 usually appear between the 2nd to 8th day of getting the viral infection. The symptoms can vary from person to person, depending on the age and overall immunity status. People who were otherwise previously healthy, getting infected, and developing mild symptoms can manage themselves well at home. If you do not suffer from any other chronic (immune-compromised) disease like Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Cardiomyopathy, Cancer, HIV, etc., there are chances that you might not develop any symptoms and simply recover out of the infection within 7-12 days. More severe cases tend to last from 3 to 6 weeks. The mild/moderate symptoms of Covid19 are : - Loss of taste - Loss of smell - Low-grade fever, ranging from 99 to 101 degrees F - Loss of appetite - Extreme fatigue / weakness / lethargy - Sore throat - Diarrhea - Vomiting / Nausea - Pain in abdomen / lower backache / generalized body ache - Flue like symptoms - running nose, nose block, sneezing, headache, cough - Dry cough - Breathlessness Why think of homeopathy for Covid19? Homeopathic medicines help improve immunity, thereby potentially reducing the chance of getting the infection. Homeopathic medicines reduce the severity of the viral infection and effectively relieve the symptoms produced by the virus, thereby minimizing the life-threatening complications arising due to Covid19 infection. Steps to Homeopathic treatment at home : - Get yourself registered (Link) - Our \"Home-Kit\" includes 2 batches of medicines - the first batch for 2 weeks includes active treatment to reduce the severity of virus & treating the symptoms, and the following 2 weeks medication includes post-infection recovery treatment - Fill up the online progress report by logging into your Patient Support System, on a daily basis so that our doctors are aware about your health status - This includes updating your existing symptoms as well as any new symptoms that could probably be noted - Contact 022-66-888-888 for a quick consultation with our doctors Tips for quick recovery from Covid19 infection : - Take rest. The virus deranges your immune system to such an extent that it leads to extreme fatigue, exhaustion, and tiredness. Taking enough rest helps your body recover quicker from the viral infection - Hydrate yourself. Symptoms of Covid19 like fever, vomiting, coughing, diarrhea lead to loss of fluids from the body.. Have fluids in form of water, juices, soups, coconut water, etc. - Complete your daily dose of multivitamins that includes - vitamin C, vitamin B complex, Vitamin D3, Zinc - Opt for a vegetarian diet.

And, most of them need homeopathy treatment. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of awareness about the science of homeopathy, and many people are deprived of the benefits of homeopathy simply due to their ignorance. We live in the age of Information Technology. We know so much about so many things which we did not have access to two decades ago. However, most people still do not know about some very important facts about their health (and that of their dear ones) and the role of homeopathy treatment. Background: Before we go and discuss some of the many diseases for which homeopathy is strongly recommended, let us review why is a lack of awareness about homeopathy. There are three or four major systems of medicine recognized by WHO (World Health Organization). 1. Conventional medicine (often called allopathy, evolved in the last 300 years in the western world) 2. Homeopathy (Originated 216 years back in Germany and spread to many countries) 3. Ayurveda (5000 years old medicine popular in India) 4. Chinese medicine including Acupuncture. All the medical colleges training doctors across the world study conventional medicine. Unfortunately, our education system is not still evolved to incorporate all the methods of treatment under one roof. As a result, doctors all over the world learn only conventional medicine; and not other systems of medicine like homeopathy. In India, the Government has recognized the importance of homeopathy for the last 60 years and there are parallel homeopathic medical colleges, training homeopathic doctors. However, this is not the scene in other countries. In the countries such as the US, UK, Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, etc., conventional doctors may choose to study and practice homeopathy after their formal medical education. As a result, what has happened is that most doctors are not exposed to homeopathic training; and they remain unaware of its benefits. Due to the limited thinking of some of the medical doctors, they often considered homeopathy as a rival system! All of these led to the fact that they did not learn to consider homeopathy as an option for a range of diseases that could be better treated if homeopathy is timely introduced. Some examples: - Is there a child in your family or neighborhood who suffered frequent bouts of one of the following and required a course of antibiotics, cortisone spray, anti-allergy shots? - Asthma or wheezing episodes - Frequent colds - Frequent ear infection - Frequent Tonsillitis The timely introduction of homeopathy can be a blessing to such children. Homeopathy can safely reduce attacks of all of the above disease conditions and also drastically reduce the need for chemical-based medicines. - Have you known any elderly person around you, maybe your parents or grandparents, suffering from one of the following, and taking courses of painkillers, anti-spasmodic, anti-neuralgic, antibiotics, etc.? - Arthritis or joint pains - Back pain and muscle aches - Neck pain, shoulder pain, body pain - Neuralgia - Migraine or stress headaches The above conditions may find significant relief, reduction of episodes of pain, once homeopathic medicines are administered. - Are you or your family member or a relative, some executive in the corporate world, complaining of one of the following conditions; who is on a daily dose of chemicals as medicines? - Gastritis, acidity, or GERD - Migraine headache - Anxiety, depression - IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), colitis - PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease), painful menses - Fatigue - Skin diseases like Psoriasis, eczema, allergy - Frequent colds, asthma - Sleeplessness - Breast tumor, Fibroadenoma - Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Ankylosing Spondylitis - Cervical Spondylitis, stiff neck - Loss of sex drive - Asthma, colds, pollen allergy - Hypertension (high blood pressure) If they opt for homeopathy, they can have a much better life. Homeopathy is well-known for treating and giving relief in most of the above conditions. - Is your mother, sister, wife, girlfriend, cousin, friend, neighbor, colleague having one of the following conditions, requiring frequent medications? - Underactive thyroid (Hypothyroid) - Mood swings due to hormonal changes - Menstrual pain (Dysmenorrhea) - Hair loss, Alopecia areata - Breast tumor (fibroadenoma) - PCOD (Cysts in the ovaries) - Menopausal syndrome - Irregular or heavy menses - Fungal infections, Pruritus vulva - Acne (Pimples) - Loss of libido (low sex drive) - Depression, Anxiety, Phobia - Backache, body ache, fatigue Homeopathy is strongly indicated for the above conditions and helps well at different stages. Do not ignore to take homeopathy opinion from an expert, to check if your disease could find help with it.

About Prescription: Due to the complex nature of homeopathy prescribing, please note that it is not within the scope of the online treatment service to give an elaborate explanation of the prescription. Dr Shah's expert opinion: Scope of homeopathy for your disease Some diseases are curable, some can be relieved and some cannot be cured. Depending on the nature of the disease, its cause, its extent, and the overall health of the patient, the doctors can decide if the patient having a particular disease is curable or not; or to what extent is it curable or treatable. At Life Force, based on Dr Rajesh Shah's experience and expertise, patients are given instructions about the prognosis and the scope of treatment for a given disease and its stage. Please examine your disease and what Dr Shah has to say about the scope of its treatment based on his vast experience. Diseases of the skin are disease of simply diseases on the skin! If one has a severe headache due to high blood pressure, what should be the treatment? A painkiller or a medicine to reduce blood pressure? Similarly, if one has skin eruptions of Psoriasis or Eczema due to the altered immune system or autoimmune disease; what should be the treatment? A lotion of cortisone to reduce skin rash or correction of the internal immune system? Chronic skin diseases are never skin-deep. They erupt due to immunological, metabolic, hormonal, and genetic reasons. They are often triggered by external agents such as allergens, dust, change in climate, pollen, bugs, chemicals, cosmetic material, metals, food, medicines, etc. All of the above and other skin diseases need to be evaluated in terms of their internal causative factors. One has to scrutinize the genetic factors, metabolic factors, and immunological parameters not only to diagnose the disease but also to plan the treatment accordingly. Conventional doctors are certainly very good at diagnosing the stated diseases up to their root cause. However, homeopathic medicines and treatments are often highly effective in treating skin diseases at a deeper level, minimizing the relapses. The modern medical wisdom lies in checking the homeopathy option for the treatment of any skin disease. All kinds of conventional doctors are treated at Life Force Doctors are also humans and they too fall sick! It is often (mis) understood that the conventional (so-called allopathic) doctors do not use homeopathy. Well, it is not correct. The conventionally trained doctors may also suffer from chronic diseases, which are often not treated by conventional medicine. When their diseases are not treated effectively with modern medicine, just like laypeople, they often turn to homeopathy. At Life Force, we come across two kinds of conventional doctors who approach Dr Shah for homeopathic treatment. 1. Those who have are familiar with the efficacy of homeopathy. 2. Those who are skeptical about homeopathy, but want to try it out. Nowadays, conventional doctors are increasingly getting convinced about the benefits of homeopathy. We have observed that the conventional doctors are ill-informed about homeopathy or they may have some prejudice. However, once they or their family members suffer from some chronic disease, which remains untreated with conventional medicine, they start exploring homeopathy. And, many of them get convinced about the benefits of personal experience. Doctors from all specialties including physicians, surgeons, gynecologists, pediatricians, dentists, oncologists, orthopedics, ophthalmologist, dermatologist, etc. from across India and from many other countries often visit Life Force for homeopathic treatment. There is nothing exciting about various doctors opting for homeopathy. This looks like news simply because many of them have ignorance about homeopathy to start with, and they (most of them) finally convert themselves as friends and supporters of homeopathy. Don't keep rubbing lotions on your skin disease! If you have been suffering from any skin disease such as eczema, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or lichen planus, it is quite likely that your local, conventional skin doctor must have prescribed to you some form of a lotion. Most of such lotions, creams, or ointments are likely to contain some form of immunosuppressive medicines such as Cortisone or Tacrolimus, or the like. It is a common experience of millions of patients across the world that when they use such lotions, the disease resurfaces after an initial, temporary improvement. Many such patients also observe that the disease which returns after stopping the use of such topical ointment is more severe than before. This is true for all skin diseases including Vitiligo, pemphigus, alopecia areata (local injection of cortisone). The freshly diagnosed patients do not recognize this phenomenon and they are tempted to start using some form of local application. It has been imposed on our thinking process that skin diseases must be treated with ointment! Unfortunately, even medical education has not addressed this challenge. Of course, many senior dermatologists do acknowledge that the use of topical immunosuppressive medicines serves only temporary benefit. real Ideally, the moment you are diagnosed as having any skin disease, it is wiser to find out the internal factors responsible for it; and look out for a treatment that could address the disease at the internal, root level. Homeopathy has earned credit for the treatment of skin diseases by internal medicines. Homeopathy does not believe in treating any skin disease by the application of the medicines on the skin, except using some non-medicinal moisturizers. A well-thought homeopathic treatment designed for the patient on the basis of internal, individual, genetic, immunological factors; is the best way to treat a wide range of common and uncommon skin diseases.

He has authored four books (from 1994-2015). He has authored about 11 scientific articles published in international, peer-reviewed journals (July 2016), and some more are pending publication. He has authored many more articles in many journals in India, UK, USA, Australia, Ireland, etc. He has written many articles to promote homeopathy, which is published in magazines in many countries. He has written several columns on homeopathy in English and other languages, in India and elsewhere. He was one of the first to write a column on homeopathy in the UAE, in reputed newspaper Khaleej Times. Dr Rajesh Shah: Homeopathy educationist Teacher, thinker, researcher Dr Rajesh Shah has extensive teaching experience. He was one of the youngest homeopaths who joined as a visiting lecturer at CMPH Medical College, under Mumbai University in 1989. Around the same time, he started teaching in the international circuit. He conducted seminars for homeopaths as well as conventional doctors in India, the UK, Holland, Belgium, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic, Ireland, and more. In 1994, he started conducting a Clinical Training Course in Homeopathy, at his clinics in Mumbai; especially for homeopaths from foreign countries. The training courses became popular among homeopaths that attended training from Germany, Sweden, the USA, Canada, Italy, Japan, Croatia, Australia, South Africa, Russia, etc. The training was clinic-based involving 8-9 hours of hands-on learning daily for six days a week. Dr Shah believes in teaching which works for all homeopaths. He is against the imaginary and non-scientific approaches in homeopathy, which are floated by some teachers in recent years. He has raised queries on the unfounded approaches in a series of editorials in Homeopathy Times, way back in 1994-95-96. His teachings are based on research in homeopathy. His involvement in new drug discovery and the use of new medicines for difficult diseases form a major part of his teachings.

He is involved in animal studies, in-vitro and in-vivo studies of homeopathic medicines in collaboration with world-class institutes such as ICT (Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai), Haffkine Institute (Mumbai), etc. International standards have been used in conducting homeopathic research. The new drugs have been standardized and have undergone extensive scientific research. The safety of drugs has been established. Dr Shah has conducted several clinical trials on human models and has proved the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in controlled studies, in tune with the conventional medical protocols. Some of the studies include Clinical trials in HIV, Hepatitis C, pain control, etc. He has developed a potentization method with standardized, scientific force-parameters. ISO 9001:2000 certified clinic with research wing: His clinic Life Force is ISO 9001:2000 certified homeopathic clinics with an attached research wing, one of the first in the world. There is a battery of experts from different scientific fields who are a part of the Scientific Advisory Board guiding Dr Shah in homeopathic research. A small research team, doctors, and support staff assist his research work. The team has given proper training to conduct the work according to established standards. Some of the projects are conducted in collaboration with other reputed institutes. Research projects i. Preparation of HIV nosode (May-2010) A new HIV nosode sourced from HIV positive (type I and II negative for other co-infections) was scientifically prepared. The ethics committee, which is constituted and functions as per ICMR guidelines approved the project. The source material, fifteen-step preparation process, and the standardization with respect to viral count, protein profile, pH, and the process of potentization were documented. The HIV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies was prepared. Safety and efficacy were established through clinical trial and homeopathic pathogenetic trials (Drug proving). ii. nosode, 30c potency was conducted using accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim to introduce a new nosode in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. Usable symptoms derived from the study. iii. HIV nosode clinical trial (May-2010) An open-label exploratory clinical trial in thirty HIV positive individuals was conducted using the HIV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of HIV nosode in HIV-infected participants in terms of reduction in viral load and improvement of the immunological parameter such as CD4 and CD8 count and CD4 percentage and general health parameters. iv. Preparation of HCV nosode (May-2010) HCV nosode from sera of HCV type I and III positive (negative for other co-infections) consented donors were prepared by serial dilution and potentization method described in Homeopathic Pharmacopeia. The source material and the preparation process were standardized. The HCV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies was prepared. Safety and efficacy were established through clinical trial and homeopathic pathogenetic trials (Drug proving). v. HCV nosode clinical trial (May-2010) An open-label exploratory clinical trial in twenty-six HCV positive individuals was conducted using the HCV nosode in 30c and 50c potencies. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of HCV nosode by observing the reduction in viral load from baseline and general health parameters. vi. Homeopathic 30c potency was conducted using accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim to introduce a new nosode in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. Usable symptoms derived from the study. vii. Homeopathic drug proving) of CP-010 was conducted, using the accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation. viii. CP-010 clinical trial for pain management (Nov-2011) A double-blind, randomized, comparative study to evaluate efficacy and safety of CP- 010 with Magnesium phosphoricum was conducted. 116 patients having sub-acute and chronic painful conditions were randomized in the study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of potentized preparation CP-30c potency by measuring the reduction in the intensity of pain using the Numeric rating scale (NRS). ix. Homeopathic Pathogenetic drug proving) of Hydroquinone was conducted, using the accepted guidelines, ethical approval, and scientific documentation; with the aim of introducing a new medicine in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. x. Preclinical study (animal- Wistar rats) to evaluate the efficacy of CP 010 in arthritis (Oct- 2012) The anti-arthritic activity of CP 010, Magnesium Phosphoricum were studied in 60 Albino Wistar rats in 6 different groups using a positive and negative control to observes the effect of homeopathy medicines on the animal model. The study proved that homeopathic medicines are as effective as anti-inflammatory Diclofenac on certain days. xi. Preparation, Standardization and in safety testing standardized using different Mycobacterium strains. Bacterial characteristics, strains, and quantity used, and the process of preparation was documented so that the nosodes can be re-visited, re-developed with scientific validation and standardization. In vivo studies and sterility testing of the nosode were carried out. xii. A method for preparation of Nosode developed: The old method of nosode preparation required revamping in the light of the latest development in the areas of microbiology. A scientific, standardized 15-step method was developed for making reproducible nosodes now and in the future. xiii. Several ongoing research projects in collaboration with reputed institutions. Dr Rajesh Shah Interviews Dr Rajesh Shah: Mentor and Life-coach Dr Rajesh Shah has met, interacted with, and touched the lives of thousands of people. Homeopathic communication is a more holistic, life-entangling involvement rather than merely pathological interpretation. His work entailed an active understanding of the life-space situations of many thousands of people. As a result, over the last three decades, inadvertently Dr Shah has worked not only as a clinician but also contributed a lot to the lives of his patients by active guidance and mentoring. Hundreds of patients from many walks of life, varying from high-end industrialists to professionals, doctors, artists, businessmen, and others, would often visit Dr Shah as patients, even after they were cured of the ailments; simply to spend some time and take guidance for some tough life situations. And, Dr Shah would generously offer his thoughts, suggestions, and guidance. Dr Shah's knack for putting himself in the position of others; with his wisdom and approach, allows him to think of solutions for them. He tends to be brutally honest explain exactly how it is rather than downplay any weaknesses he might see in his clients. He is a motivational trainer, having an ability to evoke hope in anyone, directing one to wake up and move ahead no matter how hard-hitting the situation in life may be. He knows how to show hope even in an apparently hopeless condition. Some of the areas of work where Dr Shah could professionally contribute as a life coach or mentor include personal life development, professional growth, relationship management, and business expansion. Being a medico, researcher, and entrepreneur, Dr Shah offers life-coach and mentoring service to any professional or industrialist who desires to have a trusted advisor, the sounding board who could assist in taking you to the next level. Award for Independent Research - What it means to me I wish to share some thoughts on how I look at having received an award from the Ministry of AYUSH, from the hands of the honorable Vice President of India. (I don't look at it as any personal achievement.) - This recognized the efforts of an independent researcher not working full time at any institution, university, or college, but a clinician conceptualizing and coordinating the research with several institutions. I'm not a scientist but a researcher, a full-time clinician. This appreciation should encourage many more scientific-minded clinicians to explore research in collaboration with other institutions. - This award is for New Drug Research in developing Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Nosode. This is a big thing for many reasons. This marks the scientific revisiting of Nosodes using modern technology. - This is the first-ever new Nosode ever developed systematically in the world in the last 50 years. - This is the first major new homeopathic drug ever developed in India. - The Indian government and the profession have finally recognized the importance of New Drug Research, that too in the Nosode category. - The Nosode was developed at a highly reputed Government body, Haffkin Institute, which also makes the BCG vaccine. That means the Conventional medical research body has helped to make the Homeopathic Nosode. This is historical. - Many more Nosodes can be expected to bring a revolution. - This new Nosode is one of the series of several, namely HIV Nosode, Hepatitis C Nosode, Malaria Nosode, Cancer Nosode, and more. - The recognition has opened doors to the era of new Nosodes, from India. - This research is for revamping the existing Tuberculinum Nosode, also recognizing the need for remaking all other existing Nosodes. - This step will also facilitate further setting up the regulation for New Drug Development in India, for which I'm striving for over a decade. - This will hopefully encourage more research by researchers, scientists, institutions, pharmaceuticals, and clinicians in many parts of the world. Honestly, this award is not a sign of any personal achievement for me. More importantly, I'm looking at it as a mark of the beginning of recognizing the need for New Drug Research in Homeopathy. My dream is to have a wide range of new Nosodes scientifically processed, researched, introduced and brought formally to the medical profession benefitting millions of patients now and in the future. (My sincere thanks to various scientists, institutions, coinvestigators, ethical boards, technicians, and colleagues who contributed to the work.) - Dr Rajesh Shah, MD (from his Facebook post) Related links: - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1475491616000175](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1475491616000175) - [https://m.timesofindia.com/city/mumbai/Haffkine-comes-up-with-homeo-drug-for-TB/amp_articleshow/46648115.cms](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/mumbai/Haffkine-comes-up-with-homeo-drug-for-TB/amp_articleshow/46648115.cms) - [http://www.ijrh.org/article.asp?issn=0974-7168;year=2017;volume=11;issue=3;spage=203;epage=205;aulast=Shah](http://www.ijrh.org/article.asp?issn=0974-7168;year=2017;volume=11;issue=3;spage=203;epage=205;aulast=Shah) - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23870381/](http://www.ijrh.org/article.asp?issn=0974-7168;year=2017;volume=11;issue=3;spage=203;epage=205;aulast=Shah) Dr Rajesh Shah: An entrepreneur Dr Rajesh Shah evolved professionally from a humble medical practitioner of homeopathy, way back in 1985, by setting up a very small clinic which he hired on rent on an hourly basis; using two hours a day at the modest rent. Modest beginning but with high aspiration; the clinic was inaugurated by ace homeopath of the time Dr BN Chakravarty, then a personal homeopath to the president of India as well as to the superstar Amitabh Bachchan, who came all the way from Kolkata to launch Dr Shah's career. He wrote in the guestbook: I know Dr Rajesh will create something unprecedented in homeopathy. Dr Shah saw a huge opportunity in homeopathy. An opportunity to bring an enormous change in the lives of people. He also recognized that the homeopathy system of medicine, though highly sophisticated in approach, there were gaps in its application due to inadequate research. He soon got involved in the teaching and promotion of homeopathy. He became a part of a group, which invited George Vithoulkas (and many others) to India for his first conference in 1985. He was inspired by Vithoulkas' vision for homeopathy; invited him again in 1994 to Mumbai, India. Dr Shah started teaching actively at CMPH Medical College as well as in many countries, conducting seminars and workshops, from 1990 to 2000. Interestingly, Vithoulkas invited Dr Shah to conduct a two days seminar at his institute in Alonissos, Greece, in 1997. In early 1995, the Internet emerged and Dr Shah immediately grabbed the opportunity of using it for the promotion of homeopathy. He launched probably the first medical website from India and also initiated the concept of Online medical practice; one of its kind in the world. He realized that no other medium would help to reach out to the mass other than the Internet. He launched over 25 websites devoted to homeopathy, which helped promote homeopathy in a big way. His involvement, integration, and homeopathy commitment, added a huge number of clients to his already successful practice from across the world. His entrepreneurial approach allowed him to set up several 'firsts' in India, for instance, a first medical website, first video conferencing, e-commerce, ISO 9001:2000 certification for research linked clinic, paperless clinic, etc. Life Force Homeopathy was set up in 2003; which was one of the largest homeopathic clinics in India. With increasingly busy practice, Dr Shah also decided to focus on research, the area of interest close to his heart. He started developing new homeopathic medicines and improved the older method of drug discovery in homeopathy. After being recognized as the doctor treating patients from the highest number of countries in the world, Dr Shah genuinely feels that his reach is not yet enough; he has yet to touch the lives of a lot more, bringing the benefit of the marvel of healing science of homeopathy. Dr Rajesh Shah's dictum: Promote what you believe in While choosing to be a homeopath, way back in 1979-80, Dr Rajesh Shah researched about scope in becoming a homeopathic doctor. Once thoroughly convinced of the wonders of the science of homeopathy; he has not only pursued it seriously but also started promoting it to the benefit of many. Interestingly, as a young medical student, while traveling on a local train for about an hour from home to the college, he used to meet many co-passengers, who were not aware of homeopathy. At that time, he used to talk to the co-passengers about the benefits of homeopathy; and used to circulate one-pager, typed notes! After graduating from medical school, he became keen on promoting homeopathy at various levels in the form of lectures at different social clubs such as Lions Club, Rotary Club, Giant's club, etc. He used to conduct camps and exhibitions talking about the science of homeopathy to highlight the benefits of homeopathy. He has written numerous articles and several columns on homeopathy in many leading newspapers in India and abroad. The publications he wrote include The Times of India, The Indian Express, The Pioneer, The Bombay Samachar, Gujarat Samachar, Janma-Bhoomi, Maharastra Times, Navabharat Times, and many more. He started writing a column for Khaleej Times, which was the very first column on homeopathy in the Gulf Countries. Dr Rupal Shah and Dr Rajesh Shah were approached by a publication house in Australia for an article on homeopathy for a textbook for class XII, IB curriculum, which was published in 2001. Dr Shah appeared on many television and radio shows, on news channels, and in interviews in India, the UK, the USA, the Czech Republic, etc. discussing the role of homeopathy in treating various diseases. As soon as the internet emerged, Dr Shah launched the first medical website from India, dedicated to homeopathy. This website ( [www.askdrshah.com](https://www.askdrshah.com/)) is one of the first websites in the world, devoted to homeopathy promotion. From 1995 to 1997, Dr Shah launched over 25 websites devoted exclusively to the promotion of homeopathy. All these websites talk about the role of homeopathy in treating various diseases, which became a great source of information about specific diseases and the role of homeopathy at the same time. Following websites were some of the many websites initiated by Dr Shah, which eventually got merged with [www.AskDrShah.com :](https://www.askdrshah.com/) Soon after launching the first homeopathy website, Dr Shah started receiving many queries from across the world. He personally used to answer over 60-70 queries every day during 1995-96, where he was promoting his views on the scope of homeopathic treatment for various diseases. Today, Dr Shah's team of doctors continues homeopathy promotion activities. Anyone from any part of the world could get genuine information on the scope of homeopathic treatment of many diseases, from Dr Shah's team of doctors. This educational service is available for free from Dr Shah's websites. Over a million people have received answers from Dr Shah and his team, as a part of the homeopathy promotion mission. Report on Dr Rajesh Shah and Dr Rupal Shah seminars in the UK by Bob Fordham (Courtesy the Society of Homoeopaths journal) Like all good homeopaths, Rajesh and Rupal are clear about their mission! The world needs more homeopaths. It needs homeopaths who can prescribe confidently and accurately and who can manage the whole range of cases likely to come their way. How will this best be achieved? By being down to earth! That's exactly how Rajesh describes himself and the Phenomenological Approach he has developed. He insists on working with the direct experiences (signs and symptoms) of the patient. His observation is that it is unnecessary to speculate about a pre-existing state of symbolic representation of the patients suffering. The symptoms themselves are concrete and available to our senses. These should be our primary concern. They will furnish us with a highly individual description of the patient. In the remedy provings, we find analogous information: provers produced significant changes marked by groups of symptoms when undergoing drug testing. Rajesh's method depends on identifying significant expressions and representative groups of symptoms in the patient's history and finding as precise a reflection of these as possible in the suffering of a single prover. For us, it was a delight to open up Allen's Encyclopaedia and use such precise information in this way. It seemed to represent the best in a scientific application of homeopathic principles. And it was exciting too!! Rajesh graduated as a gold medallist from the Bombay Homeopathic Medical College. Both Rajesh and Rupal practice in homeopathic hospitals and medical colleges in Bombay. They also run their own general practices. Their teaching was crammed with the clinical experience amassed from managing a large and diverse caseload. This and well-selected videos gave their teaching tremendous breadth. Rajesh and Rupal took to stress the totality, finding significant symptoms not just in the mental state of the patient, but also in the individual expression of particular symptoms. They also stressed the organ or system affinities of illness as a necessary part of the whole. They taught in Devon, London, Leeds, Glasgow, and Darlington, contributing to college-teaching, teaching- clinics, and a seminar. The clinics were particularly well-received. Rajesh saw a practitioner's difficult cases and discussed his approach with the participants. It was very useful to have such an immediate appreciation of the method in practice and participants re-marked at the clarity with which very complex cases could be understood. Rajesh and Rupal exude enthusiasm. As experienced teachers of homeopathy, they were well- organized in their presentation of their material. Their commitment and the sheer joy with which they taught were truly infectious. They now have many friends in the UK, all of whom will be wishing them a speedy return! Dr. Shah's multifaceted persona makes him a homeopathy activist and reformer Dr Rajesh Shah is a homeopathy activist, as he calls himself. Every system needs reforming at various stages. Homeopathy is the 220-year-old system of medicine, a wonderful science with tremendous potential; but it calls for organized facelift and overhauling, without which, it will not survive, as Dr Shah feels very strongly. Innovation is a key growth factor required for an upgrade. Scientific approach and innovation if clubbed could lead to research-based development. Dr Shah is seriously engaged in the innovative research, development of new medicines, improvising old methods, reviewing the 200-year-old database, re-looking at older concepts in the light of modern science. Research needs massive funds. Corporates and governments poorly support homeopathy research. Dr Shah's entrepreneurial attribute has led him to build Life Force, a center of excellence in homeopathy; which treats patients from across the world, one of its kind in the world; where he has corporatized homeopathy offering professionally managed services to patients globally. Dr Shah's research work is self-funded. It is a very unusual situation where the clinician is a self-funded researcher. Being a lover of Gandhian philosophy, he believes in the highest ethics in medical practice. He is a teacher at heart, he is happy to share unparalleled experience gained through his global practice of the treatment of difficult diseases. Being an educationist, he intends to come back to the teaching and share his learning based on profound experience and scientific research. He is a General Secretary, heading the Scientific Committee of an NGO called Global Homeopathy Foundation, making himself fully available for the promotion of homeopathy. Dr Shah's only focus, for which he is committed to using all his skill sets, is to bring homeopathy close to mainstream medicine. That is a part of his professional mission.

Obviously, there are good doctors in all countries. Patients from many countries still contacted Life Force because they did not get well, due to the very nature of those difficult-to-treat-diseases. It is always challenging to treat chronic and recurring diseases with any system of medicine. The patients with difficult diseases posed the challenge and encouraged Dr. Shah to pursue research in different areas of homeopathy to find better solutions. The results improved. However, it must be noted that chronic diseases present with complexities. And, research is an ongoing process that helps us keep improving the results. Dr Shah's Seminar Report Clinical courses in Homoeopathy have been offered since the early days of prescribing in a variety of locations by a wealth of talented educators around the globe. Students and practitioners often travel vast distances at a great personal expense in order to understand better the tools of their science and to perfect their art in prescribing. An opportunity to widen one\u00b9s view of the Materia Medica, to experience first-hand different methods of prescribing and to see a variety of live cases not only helps one grow as a prescriber but as a person as well. One opportunity to achieve this scope of understanding awaits students and practitioners in a small clinic in a northern suburb of Mumbai on the west coast of India. Dr. Rajesh Shah and his wife Dr. Rupal Shah, both classical Homeopaths and educators, team-teach a three-week intensive course every February for foreign practitioners to further the understanding of Homoeopathic prescribing. This past February\u00b9s class which I personally attended consisted of eight practitioners representing five countries. The course itself provided a once in a lifetime experience, India as the back-drop provided the adventure. The main requirement for participants of the course was to come with an open mind for learning. This requirement was a pre-requisite for anyone staying for even a short period of time in the liveliest, most densely populated suburb in Mumbai. What the clinical experience impressed on the intellect, the journey to and from the clinic impressed on the emotions tenfold. One simply could not walk a block without experiencing at least 10-20 rubrics of the Mind section simultaneously. India is a place where the senses will never atrophy from a lack of stimulation. The daily schedule easily satisfied the hunger to learn to start with Materia Medica lectures which were taught in the mornings by Dr. Rupal Shah. For three hours each day participants were graphically taken on a journey through all aspects of a remedy straight from her vault of knowledge and personal clinical experience. Her depth of understanding, as well as the passion she held for the peculiarities of the materia medica, infected the atmosphere to the point that if you didn\u00b9t end up proving the remedy by the end of the lecture, you simply were not paying attention. The evening sessions at the clinic were conducted by Dr. Rajesh Shah who taught an organized and well-paced approach to case taking, analysis and evaluation, prescribing, and long term case management. Each lecture followed a progressive flow of strategies involved in building the totality of a case. When sufficient ground was covered in theory, the real case-taking started when the patients were called in for their consultations. This was where the gap between theory and practice was bridged; where the charismatic teaching of a practitioner was put to the test by a mob of suffering patients in a packed waiting room. This is what we all came to see. As the procession of beautiful sari\u00b9s filed in, one after another, there was a realization that the cultural differences being observed would shed new light on previously stereotyped remedy pictures. Most patients were accompanied by relatives, all telling in competing levels of excitement how the medicine had taken away their suffering. After the first five hours of follow-ups, it occurred to most participants that there seemed to be only two kinds of patients coming to see Dr. Shah: patients rapidly moving toward the direction of cure, or cure patients. The consistency of the cure was impressive. Consultations in Hindi were translated by Dr. Shah and the participants were invited to examine and question the patients at any time. At the close of the first evening, the general consensus of the participants was that there simply were not enough good out-of-work actors from The \u00b3Bollywood Actor Factory\u00b2 to cover the volume of patients filing in. These were people who had truly benefited from Homeopathy and that message could be read on their faces. What was witnessed that evening was encouraging. For myself, two realizations were driven home: 1) Homoeopathy works and 2) Any practitioner can achieve this level of success if they apply themselves. Although unquestionably brilliant, dynamic and driven, Dr. Shah was not a magician. He was a person fulfilling the goals of an achievable endeavor: practicing the science and the art of Homeopathy and doing well. Throughout the entire course, individual case strategies were discussed in-depth. Often patients had to sit through the banter of the peanut gallery while their symptoms were evaluated from conflicting points of view in four different languages. The collective knowledge of the participants could be likened to an orchestra tuning up before a performance. Dr. Shah as maestro guided the thoughts both receiving as well as giving key points which led the group to create perfectly tuned case totalities. Each case was as dynamic as the analyzing process which eventually led to the prescription. Dr. Shah\u00b9s clinical tips were spontaneous, and though the objectives of the course were structured, learning had no boundaries. One of the main objectives of the course was to teach a strategy by where all the participants could collectively arrive at a similar understanding of a case. Only through this method would our individual practices be successful. If fixed philosophies or rigid dogma prevented us as practitioners from operating in a practical manner, we would not get the results we wanted from Homeopathic prescribing and our patients would not benefit. This as the most important objective reinforced the knowledge we all had of the principles of classical Homeopathic prescribing. Dr. Shah\u00b9s therapeutic lectures provided the insight into what is common in disease allowing us to recognize what is uncommon in the patient and what is uncommon in a common symptom. The variety of patients seen during the course finely-tuned the powers of observation both for the experienced practitioners attending and the practitioners starting out. Practical skills were also taught pertaining to all aspects of running a practice from simply writing out an organized case to administrative issues and this proved key to some of the participants previously working in a method of organized chaos. Dr. Shah\u00b9s strength as a practitioner matched his talent as a teacher as humor, compassion and strength of character were the icings on the cake. This intensive clinical course holds for participants an opportunity to experience the best of what Homoeopathy can offer. I highly recommend it to those in search of a highly seasoned and enlightening journey down the path of understanding the tools of our trade. by Laura Fenton, Japan Telephonic Consultation with Dr Rajesh Shah The Concept We receive many requests from across the world for creating a facility for a telephone consultation with Dr Rajesh Shah.

The nosodes are like vaccines, but very different in nature and action. In our consistent efforts of developing a range of nosodes, systematically and scientifically, these E. Coli nosodes add to therapeutic potentials in practice. The latest entry is that of the E. Coli group of nosodes. Our recent paper is published in the August 2020 issue of \"Homeopathy\", the most valued peer-reviewed, international journal in the field. Sincere congratulations and thanks to the entire team of scientists at the Dept. of Clinical Pharmacology at Nair Hospital, a Government-run medical college and hospital in Mumbai, and at Life Force Homeopathy. From the year 1996, Dr Rajesh Shah has been working on new drug discovery including the nosodes. After having identified the need for developing new nosodes from un-attended organisms/tissues as well as re-development of the old nosodes, a series of development and experimentations has led to the making of following nosodes. - HIV Nosode - Hepatitis C Nosode - Myco Tuberculosis Nosode Falciparum Nosode - Cancer Nosode - HPV Nosode - Others The full article can be read from the following link: [https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0040-1710044](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0040-1710044) Dr Shah's Seminar in England A Report on Dr. Rajesh Shah's seminar in England by Bob Fordham, Tricia Graffin, UK (Courtesy The Society of Homoeopaths newsletter, England) Like all good homeopaths, Rajesh and Rupal are clear about their mission! The world needs more homeopaths. It needs homeopaths who can prescribe confidently and accurately and who can manage the whole range of cases likely to come their way. How will this best be achieved? By being down to earth! That's exactly how Rajesh describes himself and the Phenomenological Approach he has developed. He insists on working with the direct experiences (signs and symptoms) of the patient. His observation is that it is unnecessary to speculate about a pre-existing state of symbolic representation of the patients suffering. The symptoms themselves are concrete and available to our senses. These should be our primary concern. They will furnish us with a highly individual description of the patient. In the remedy provings, we find analogous information: provers produced significant changes marked by groups of symptoms when undergoing drug testing. Rajesh's method depends on identifying significant expressions and representative groups of symptoms in the patient's history and finding as precise a reflection of these as possible in the suffering of a single prover. For us, it was a delight to open up Allen's Encyclopedia and use such precise information in this way. It seemed to represent the best in a scientific application of homeopathic principles. And it was exciting too!! Rajesh graduated as a gold medalist from the Bombay Homeopathic Medical College. Both Rajesh and Rupal practice in homeopathic hospitals and medical colleges in Bombay. They also run their own general practices. Their teaching was crammed with the clinical experience amassed from managing a large and diverse caseload. This and well-selected videos gave their teaching tremendous breadth. Rajesh and Rupal took to stress the totality, finding significant symptoms not just in the mental state of the patient, but also in the individual expression of particular symptoms. They also stressed the organ or system affinities of illness as a necessary part of the whole. They taught in Devon, London, Leeds, Glasgow, and Darlington, contributing to college-teaching, teaching- clinics and a seminar. The clinics were particularly well-received. Rajesh saw a practitioner's difficult cases and discussed his approach with the participants. It was very useful to have such an immediate appreciation of the method in practice and participants remarked at the clarity with which very complex cases could be understood. Rajesh and Rupal exude enthusiasm. As experienced teachers of homeopathy, they were well- organized in their presentation of their material. Their commitment and the sheer joy with which they taught were truly infectious. They now have many friends in the UK, all of whom will be wishing them a speedy return! Homeopathy Medicines for Erectile Dysfunction These are some of the many homeopathic medicines for erectile dysfunction which cater to relieving ED specifically Agnus castus: This remedy may be helpful if problems with impotence develop after a man has led a life of intense and frequent sexual activity for many years. A cold sensation felt in the genitals is a strong indication for Agnus castus. People who need this remedy are often very anxious about their health and loss of abilities and may have problems with memory and concentration. This remedy is one of the best homeopathic medicine for ED. Argentum nitricum: This remedy may be helpful if a man's erection fails when sexual intercourse is attempted, especially if thinking about the problem makes it worse. People who need this remedy are often nervous and imaginative. A person who needs Argentum nitricum is usually warm-blooded, with cravings for both sweets and salt. Caladium: This remedy may be helpful to a man whose genitals are completely limp, despite having sexual interest. Nocturnal emissions can occur without an erection, even if dreams are not sex-related. A person who needs this remedy often craves tobacco. Causticum: This remedy may be indicated if physical pleasure during sex has diminished and sexual urges are reduced. The person feels tired and weak and may experience memory loss, with a compulsive need to check things (to see that doors are locked, etc.) Prostate problems may be associated with impotence, and urine may be lost when the person coughs or sneezes. Lycopodium: commonly called club moss, is the best homeopathic medicine for Erectile Dysfunction. People who need this remedy may have problems with erections because of worry, and can also be troubled by memory loss. They often lack self-confidence (though some may overcompensate by acting egoistically). People who need this remedy often have digestive problems with gas and bloating, and an energy slump in the late afternoon and evening. Selenium metallicum: Selenium is a nutrient needed by humans in micro amounts. It is widely distributed in nature. Brazilian nuts, sea-foods, yeast, whole grains are all excellent sources of selenium. A homeopathic remedy is highly potent and has a wide curative spectrum for disorders like impotency, chronic fatigue syndrome, sterility, depression, etc. This remedy is often helpful to men who have diminished sexual ability, especially if the problem starts after a fever or exhausting illness. The person feels weak and exhausted, but interest is usually still present. Erection is slow, insufficient, weak and has involuntary seminal emissions. [Unusual hair-loss](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/hairfalling/) (body hair or eyebrows) can also suggest a need for Selenium. Staphysagria: Staphysagria is a homeopathic remedy made from the seeds of the Delphinium Staphisagria, which has lovely purple-blue flowers, and in its raw form is highly poisonous, historically used to kill vermin. The homeopathic remedy, through its preparation, is no longer toxic yet remains extremely powerful. Staphyagria is often an indicated remedy when there is a history of abuse. This can either be physical, sexual, or emotional misuse of power and the sufferer generally does not have the ability to fight back for whatever reason. Gentle-natured, quiet men with deep emotions may respond to this remedy. Problems with impotence often occur from embarrassment or shyness. People who need this remedy often have a history of emotional suppression and very sensitive feelings. Other remedies to be considered in treating erectile dysfunction Life Force: Ethics and Values Life Force is founded on high ethical values. In the age of the Internet, one comes across the commercialization of medical services. Life Force policies are based on Good Medical Practice (GMP) guidelines. - We, at Life Force, offer authentic and genuine guidance to all those who make an inquiry for homeopathic treatment. - We do not force anyone to opt for treatment. - We explain the scope and limitation of treatment for one's disease condition, based on the extent and the stage of the disease. - We do not over-promise. - We undertake treatment of only those patients whom we think we would be able to help to a certain extent. - We gracefully refuse treatment for those disease conditions where homeopathy has no role to play. - At Life Force, ethical values win over commercial values. Homeopathy Myths and Facts Myths and Facts about Homeopathy by Dr Rajesh Shah, MD (Hom) Myth: Homeopathy is slow to act. Fact: Not really. Homeopathy is fast acting in acute conditions such as infections, fever, diarrhea, etc. Chronic and old diseases such as psoriasis take a long time to treat hence homeopathy has been labeled as slow acting. One may say that homeopathy may be slower than the effect of pain-killers, anti-inflammatory medicines, and steroids. One must know that homeopathy is faster in the treatment of conditions such as allergy, asthma, eczema, migraine, arthritis. Homeopathy is like a tortoise in the well-known story of tortoise and rabbit. Myth: Homeopathy is useful only for chronic conditions and has no role for acute ailments Fact: Homeopathy is a great alternative medicine for acute diseases. In fact, at on time, we at Life Force used to treat a large number of acute ailments varying from cough-cold-fever to otitis media, pneumonia, tonsillitis, hepatitis, sinusitis, etc. Homeopathy is real alternative medicine for most acute conditions. Myth: When it comes to handling infections, nothing can beat antibiotics. Fact: This misbelief is an example of mass ignorance in the hi-tech era that we are living in. Over an again, thousands of practitioners the world over, have repeatedly and regularly observed that infections of all kinds including bacterial infections respond beautifully to homeopathy and no antibiotics are required for most of such conditions. It is in rare cases when the infection is very massive and the body has lost the vitality to recover, probably antibiotics are required in addition to homeopathy. One, day homeopathy will be recognized as the latest generation antibiotic measure. Myth: Homeopathy is more placebo effect and faith healing... Fact: Scientific double-blind studies have indicated that homeopathy far above the placebo effect. The effect of [homeopathy medicine](homeopathic-medicines.aspx) has been observed millions of times, which cannot be labeled as the placebo effect. Newborn babies, infants, animals such as lions, dogs, etc. have shown the healing effects of homeopathy, which goes against the placebo effect. Saying that homeopathy is a placebo, in the light of the above facts, is not just a misbelief but a prejudice. Frankly, this is an insult. However, over the period, we have realized that those who continue assuming that homeopathy is a mere placebo, are superstitious. Myth: Homeopathy can only help functional problems such as pain, weakness, where there are no structural changes in the body. Fact: Homeopathy has proved its efficacy for the treatment of structural pathology. Numerous documented cases where the reversal of the structural pathology has taken place indicating the depth of homeopathy action. The skeptics should keep the eyes open to evaluating the documented cases. Myth: Homeopathy is practiced by some quacks and those who have no scientific background... Fact: Well, homeopathy in most parts of the world is practiced by qualified conventional doctors, the practitioners of modern medicine. The founder of homeopathy, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, MD was a German scientist. And most of the masters and the pioneers in the past were enlightened conventional doctors. Those who think we are quacks, we just smile... Myth: Homeopathy is a miracle medicine and it cures every disease under the sun. Fact: Homeopathy is no panacea. It has its own set of limitations. We do fail in many cases and keep learning to heal the suffering humanity. Homeopathy is not an ultimate medicine, for nothing is ultimate in this universe. Myth: Is that homeopathy would worsen my symptoms initially and then bring about improvement\". I am scared to try Homeopathy since I cannot afford to see my symptoms getting worse than what I have at the moment. Fact: It is not true that Homeopathy would lead to an initial aggravation of your complaints. After Dr. Shah's 23 years of dedicated and sincere practice in homeopathy, he claims that he is yet to see any homeopathic aggravation!. The aggravation which the patient experiences at times after taking the medicines is usually coincidental with the progress of the disease wherein it worsens in its natural course. This confirms that the [homeopathic remedies](homeopathic-remedies.aspx) are usually harmless, but the myths associated with them are not. Facts and Myths (lay-men) (Part II) Myth: Homeopathy is simply herbal medicine. Fact: Not really. Homeopathy is much more than herbal medicine.

This communication is made towards creating awareness about homeopathy among conventional medical doctors (allopaths), in turn, benefit their patients. 2. As per the WHO, homeopathy is the second most used system of medicine after conventional medicine (allopathy). And, homeopathy is WHO approved. 3. Homeopathy was introduced by a German scientist Dr Samuel Hahnemann, MD. He also coined the word 'Allopathy' to differentiate his new system from the old. The term Allopathy is used interchangeably with modern medicine or conventional medicine in this document. 4. Homeopathy is a major health science practiced by the conventional doctors (allopaths) in France, Germany, UK, USA, Australia, Holland, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, India, and other countries. 5. Homeopathy and conventional medicine are simply two different approaches to treat patients. 6. Homeopathy and allopathy are not contrary, rivals, or competitive with each other. They must complement each other. 7. Both systems are scientific in nature. No science can be contrary or inimical to any other science, and the same implies to both of these medical systems. 8. As every physician's only mission is to restore the sick to good health, it is highly recommended that the doctors of both the systems are familiar and respectful to both the systems. 9. Homeopathy is the youngest medical system, allopathy is about a few hundred years old, and Ayurveda is over 4000 years old. 10. There are certain diseases, such as critical and emergency situations, severe infections, many acute cases, etc., are treated faster or better by conventional medicine than other systems. For instance, myocardial infarction, cardio-respiratory failure, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, typhoid, diabetes, cancers, epilepsy, some hormonal and metabolic disease, anaphylaxis, severe infections and inflammatory conditions, certain collagen diseases, etc. are more effectively treated with allopathy. 11. Similarly, chronic and recurring diseases are better treated by homeopathy. For instance, allergies (asthma, colds), autoimmune diseases (lichen planus, psoriasis, RA), certain chronic, recurring and resistant infections (malaria, non-healing ulcers), psychosomatic diseases (migraine, IBS), psychological diseases (anxiety disorder, depression), neurological diseases (autism, ADHD, neuralgias), viral warts, etc. are treated well with homeopathy. 12. All of us know that some diseases are very resistant so much so that they may need an Integration of all the systems of medicine for cure. 13. The latest and the smartest approach in healthcare is that of Integration and Pluralism. The use of multiple therapies for the benefits of the patients is highly beneficial for effective recovery. 14. The diseases where homeopathy and allopathy may need to be integrated into some cases are as follows: Anxiety disorder, bipolar disease, cancer, depression, ED, fungal infections, GERD, HIV, hypertension, ILD, juvenile RA, lupus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, otitis media, zoster herpes 15. Homeopathic medicines do not contain cortisone or steroids in any form. 16. Even as a conventional medical practitioner, it is your privilege and duty to recommend homeopathic treatment to your patients if called for. 17. For every doctor, it is important to have an understanding of the Scope of Homeopathy, so that no patients are deprived of the benefits of homeopathy. 18. Evolved patients and educated community will expect every physician to know the basics of all medical sciences so that due guidance is made available to all. 19. Homeopathy works. Yes, now it is well-proved that by multiple scientific studies that homeopathy works. 20. Scientists, such as molecular biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers, pharmacologists, physicians, surgeons, and others, have proved the efficacy of homeopathy. 21. Research using the following models have demonstrated the efficacy of homeopathy: - Preclinical - In-vitro - Animal models - Plant models - Clinical trials - RCTs 22. Please explore Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, and other popular authentic websites for peer-reviewed homeopathic research publications. 23. Conventional scientists at esteemed government and private institutions, which are mentioned below, have conducted homeopathic research: - IIT-Bombay - Haffkein Institute - BARC - ICT (UDCT) - ICMR - CDRI - Mumbai University and many more 24. Homeopathy has progressed from being called Energy Medicine to Nano-pharmacology. Thanks to major research by scientists at IIT-B. 25. If the homeopathic benefit is not recommended by any physician to his/her patients who could potentially be helped by homeopathy, it should be considered an omission and vice versa. 26. Homeopathy is a growing science with its own strengths and limitations, just like any other system of medicine. It is not a panacea. 27. As the homeopathic doctors cannot be excused for missing out suggesting (referring) the patient requiring critical care to an allopath, how can an allopath be excused for not recommending homeopathy for certain chronic diseases? 28. The homeopathic system of medicine is based on the fundamental principle of The Law of Similars. Simply put, it's a principle of Like cures Like. It's comparable to vaccination. 29. Homeopathy and vaccination were born in the same year in 1796. Homeopathy is much wider in its application. 30. Homeopathic medicines are prepared by a distinct and unique process called Potentization, where the drug substance undergoes a series of dilution and agitation rendering the drug substance into Nanotherapeutic particles. 31. The Homeopathic Nanotherapeutic particles have demonstrated effects with regards to preclinical and clinical models. 32. The homeopathic medicines are mainly sourced from plants, chemicals, minerals, animals, biological materials, microorganisms, and imponderables. 33. The homeopathic medicines do not adversely interact with conventional medicines. They can be taken together safely without any concerns. Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, founder and director of Life Force Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, is a medically trained homeopath, researcher, educationist, author, and speaker, always wanted to use media to reach out to the world with the message of homeopathy, ever since he was a student at a medical college in the early eighties. Being the pioneer of the Online Medical Practice, he used all possible tools and technology, including video conference and e-commerce, in those years. \"Reaching out to the patients across the borders is a huge experience for any doctor,\" said Dr Shah in an interview, \"and that too, to be able to contribute significantly in lives to thousands of patients in all the continents turned out to be a lifetime achievement for me.\" Online connectivity with thousands of patients across the world has brought in heavy-duty responsibility on Dr Shah and his team at Life Force, as the patients approached for the treatment of difficult diseases and not for regular diseases. \"This made me develop a research wing in the clinic set up in the year 1998, where I started working on new drugs for the treatment of chronic diseases, as the regular homeopathic medicines were less effective for many patients,\" he said. Research became the strength of Dr Shah's homeopathic practice at Life Force, as all the patients were offered the benefits of the new drug discovery and development, which elevated the level of homeopathic services above regular clinics. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, MD, founder of homeopathy Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, MD, founder of homeopathy The system of homeopathic medicine was introduced to the world by German scientist Dr. Samuel F. Hahnemann during the years 1793-96. The bicentenary of homeopathy is being celebrated this year. On the 10th of April, it is the 239th birth anniversary of Dr. Hahnemann. One of the most leading contemporary homeopaths George Vithoulkas says about Dr. Hahnemann: With time, I am certain that this man will rank as one of the greatest in history, alongside such giants of discovery as Einstein, Newton, and Hippocrates. In this article, Dr. Rajesh Shah gives a bird's eye view of Dr. Hahnemann's exceptionally remarkable contribution to the medical world. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, father of homeopathy, lesser-known and under-appreciated medical scientist of sovereign caliber, his 239th birth anniversary falls on 10th April 1993. He was a great experimenter, original thinker, thorough scientist, a genius who dared to live ahead of his time. He was born when it was dark: Those were the days when patients were treated with inhumane and cruel methods of bloodletting (cutting the veins to remove impure blood), application of Leeches on the skin to suck impure blood, purgatives, etc. The medical system had no direction, no scientific principles, no light. His Childhood: Hahnemann was born as a son of a porcelain painter in Meissen, a town in West Germany. His father used to provide him `thinking exercise' by locking him up in a room for hours. Hahnemann cultivated the habit of original thinking since childhood. His Youth: Hahnemann was a linguist, he knew German, Latin, Greek, French, English, Italian, etc. He had a deep interest in Chemistry, Botany, Literature, Natural Sciences, Philosophy, etc. He had written several articles on these diverse subjects. He received his M.D. degree from the most famous medical school in Leipzig, Germany, in the year 1779. After a short time, he gave up his practice since he felt that the system of medicine then practiced was cruel, inhuman, unscientific, and without any logic. He maintained his family chiefly through literary work, translations, and research work. For forty years it was Hahnemann's custom to sit up the whole of one night out of every four; working, translating, studying, and writing. Translating Coolin's Book: While translating Coolin's materia medica, he was amazed by a statement: \"Cinchona Bark (Quinine) cures Malaria because it is bitter in taste.\" Hahnemann found this very illogical and he started experimenting with himself, by taking two spoonfuls of Quinine three times daily. To his surprise, he started developing some effects of quinine, viz. fever, chill, exhaustion, etc. The fever was of periodic type (intermittent fever). These symptoms which he developed after quinine intake, were very similar to the symptoms of Malaria! His genius mind interpreted that Quinine cures Malaria because it produces symptoms like Malaria. He experimented with various vegetables, chemicals, and toxins to prove that: The substance which has the capacity to produce certain symptoms also has the capacity to remove/cure similar symptoms. And thus the first fundamental principle called \"THE LAW OF SIMILARS\" was propounded and Homeopathy was born. Drug Proving on Human Beings: Hahnemann was occupied in the work of investigating the effects of various medicinal substances on human beings. He was testing such drugs on himself and his students to note different effects very minutely. Such work was never done in history prior to Hahnemann. He tested and proved carefully the action of over 90 drugs, to be used according to his new system of medicine. The entire procedure of drug proving was done on healthy humans and not on animals. LIKE ANY OTHER GENIUS: He was treating hundreds of patients and producing amazing results. The physicians practicing orthodox medicine were annoyed and could not tolerate his novel scientific method and his success. With political pressure, he was given the choice of stopping the homeopathic practice or leaving the country. While he received a rejection from various places to settle down, thousands of patients from all over Europe kept coming to him for treatment, wherever he was! A domineering medical group appointed one Dr. Hering to prove that Hahnemann and Homeopathy were baseless. Dr. Hering, while doing so, was so much impressed that he became Hahnemann's pupil and later on wrote 10 volumes of \"Encyclopedia of Materia Medica\"! Of course, Hahnemann's struggle ultimately bore fruit and was appreciated all over Europe in his days. Hundreds of doctors started learning and practicing homeopathy In the year 1810, he published one of the most revolutionary books of medical history: \"Organon of Medicine\", in which he came up with the most scientific, novel, and time-tested concepts about health, disease, life, treatment, cure, etc. Let us have a look at some of them. (a) Vital Force: Hahnemann said that the human body is not mere material but consists of dynamic, spirit-like power, which he termed as `Vital Force'. This vital force is responsible for the animation of life, for the maintenance of health, for the development of the disease, and also for the recovery from the disease. (b) Health and Disease: Health is a state of balanced vital force. Any disturbance in the vital state results in diseases. The disease is nothing but a dis-eased vital force. The disease is not material but dynamic in nature. The disease is a dynamic disturbance of the vital force, which expresses itself by physical symptoms. (c) Cure: The cure is nothing but the restoration of diseased vital force. Restoration of vital force has to be brought about with the medicine, which has to be of similar dynamic nature. (d) Similar and Dynamic Remedy: The medicine, which has the capacity to produce disease-like symptoms in a healthy human being, should be administered to cure similar symptoms in a patient. This medicine or remedy has to have `dynamic power' and should not be `crude'. There should be no `material', no `crude' substance in the remedy, but only dynamic curative power. (e) Potentisation: Hahnemann gave the most revolutionary concept and method of drug-power and preparation. Even current nuclear science is not able to understand and explain the nature and form of homeopathic medicines. He invented a method of drug preparation, in which the end result will contain only the \"dynamic power\" of the drug substance, without even a single atom of the drug! The homeopathic medicines are in `potentized' (attenuated) form and possess only dynamic-spirit-like energy, whose efficacy can be tested over and again. Recent research has identified nanoparticles in potentized homeopathic medicines. (f) Minimum doses and single remedy: Hahnemann's intelligence gave another basic principle; that of minimum dose. He said, to bring about the desired change in human vitality, the amount of quantity (dose) of medicine required is the least possible. Single medicine has to be administered to any patient, at a time. Homeopathy never approves any combination of medicines. (g) Inherited diseases and Genetics: Hahnemann was the first person in history who highlighted the inherited disease tendency (from parents and forefathers) and introduced the terminology of `Miasms'. Not only was he able to recognize the role of genetic influence on health but he was also able to discover the remedial measures to neutralize or blunt the tendencies of hereditary diseases by finding out anti-miasmatic remedies. In this regard, homeopathy is much ahead of time! (h) Bacteria and Vaccination and Immunity: Hahnemann (1755-1843) was among the first to recognize the role of Bacteria in disease development. Jenner (1749-1823) was the first to use the vaccine (based on Hahnemann's 'Law of similars') in the year 1796. Father of Bacteriology, Louis Pasteur (1822-95), first used inoculation long after the birth of homeopathy Homeopathic medicine called `Hydrophobinum' prepared from rabid dog's saliva, was used by homeopaths long before Pasteur introduced vaccine prepared from rabid dog's saliva. The homeopathic medicine called `Tuberculinum' was in use before Robert Koch (1843-1910) discovered TB organisms. Of course, Tuberculinum was prepared from TB. germs. Von Behring (1854-1917), who was called the father of Vaccine therapy, was born 12 years after Hahnemann's death. In fact, Von Behring had acknowledged his debts to Homeopathy Before the concept of bacteria as a cause of the disease was brought forth, bacteria were recognized and also used as medicinal agents by Dr. Hahnemann and his followers. The concept of vaccination has its roots in the principles of Homeopathy Dr. Hahnemann must be recognized as one of the foremost Bacteriologists and it would be without any exaggeration to call him the real father of vaccination. (i) Not Bacteria but host factors: In those days scientists were busy discovering various bacteria and microbes, emphasizing their 0prime role, in disease development. Hahnemann was a very advanced thinker. He realized that bacteria can do nothing without the susceptibility (vulnerability) of the host patient. Modern immunologist has realized this fact only for a few decades. (j) Psychosomatics: Mind and Body: Hahnemann was most modern in his views on the role of the mind in the development of physical disease. He associated the mind and body relation with health disease and cure. Not only that but he also could present to the world very definite therapeutics based on such Psychosomatic correlation. (k) Individualization: Hahnemann said there are no diseases but diseased individuals. A human being is a wholesome entity where no organ of the body is affected in isolation. You have to treat the patient as a whole and the disease will be spontaneously cured. He said, treat the patient and not the disease. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, whose contribution to the suffering of humanity has been unique. We have yet to fully comprehend some of his concepts, especially regarding drug dynamization. Let us salute this man of the greatest caliber who dared to think beyond his time. QUOTING DR. HAHNEMANN: Dietary Instructions For General Disease patients Dr Rajesh Shah, M.D.(Hom.): Global doctor Dr Rajesh Shah had a dream. As a fresh, young, passionate [homeopath](homeopathic-doctors.aspx); way back in 1985; he had a dream to help people globally, to be a global doctor. He was a university topper with a brilliant academic background. As it has been said that when you have an intense dream, the invisible forces help the dreams come true. With an intense desire to help people the world over, hard work, and dedication; Dr Shah's fame brought him, patients, from inner parts of India as well as from many countries in the initial years as well. Once he started teaching globally in 1989, many referrals from his students from many countries brought him patients who required an expert opinion. With the invention of the Internet and its popularity, Dr Shah launched many websites devoted to homeopathy, popularizing the science amongst those people who did not know about [homeopathy](homeopathy-brief.aspx). Dr Shah's patients vary from poor patients from India, Somalia to the Hollywood stars as well as the family of the past president of the US. His patients include people from all walks of life such as students, IT professionals, scientists, conventional doctors, diplomats, teachers, housewives, and the like. The process has helped Dr Shah to bring the benefits o homeopathy to those countries and places where people had no source to find genuine information about homeopathy. Credit goes to Dr Shah for this service. Patients from so many countries either visit Dr Shah's Life Force Homeopathy in person or through the net. It is an uncommon phenomenon for a medical professional to have such a wide range of global experiences. Global Teaching Collaboration As a part of worldwide teaching projects: Homeopathy Teaching Worldwide Collaborators invited. Local institutes and individuals may join hands to promote classical homeopathy. Friends, The Foundation for Homoeopathic Research (India) invites collaborators from the world over to participate in organizing homeopathic teaching in their respective cities or countries. We look forward to a response from Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa, and those places where homeopathy is lesser-known or unknown. Homeopathic institutes and individuals may respond with details and background. We have designed a homeopathy promotional and teaching protocol, which simplifies the organizational procedure, in turn, allowing the spread of classical homeopathy world over. For the collaborators, there are professional growth opportunities and reasonable incentives. Note: Currently, we do not conduct any training program. How to identify a qualified, good homeopath We shall discuss in brief about how could you locate and identify a good and qualified homeopath, who could help you treat your ailment. Let us talk about the following important aspects of it. What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is an alternative system of medicine, originated in Germany in 1794. In the early part of the 20th century, about 30% of doctors in the US were homeopaths. However, the homeopaths have reduced in number due to many reasons. Who is a homeopath? 'Homeopath' is one who is a qualified medical practitioner who has been trained in homeopathy through a full time, full-length course; and is legally and technically certified to practice homeopathic medicine, as per the local governing body. Unfortunately, not many countries offer a full-length course, which should be practically identical to the mainstream medical course of M.B., B.S, and M.D. It is important that the qualified homeopath should have studied in detail the following subjects in full length. - Anatomy (for 18 months) - Physiology (for 18 months) - Pathology (for 12 months) - Internal medicine (Minimum 12 months) - Surgery (Minimum 12 months) - Gynecology and Obstetrics (Minimum 12 months) - Preventive and Social Medicine (Minimum 12 months) - Medico-Legal Medicine (Minimum 12 months) - Pediatrics, Psychiatry, ENT, Dermatology, etc. (as a part of the course) - Homeopathic Philosophy (Minimum 3 years) - Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia (Materia Medica) (Minimum 3 years) - Homeopathic Pharmacy (Minimum 12 months) - Clinical Medicine ((Minimum 2 years) - Hospital training ((Minimum 3 years) In all different fields of medicine, surgery, Gynecology, ENT, Skin, Psychiatry, etc.) - Internship ((Minimum 1 year) Through full-time study for at least five and a half years including practical training in the hospitals is required for any homeopath to have granted doctorate degree. Such intense training is available only in some countries like India. It is very important the homeopath is able to understand the medical language, able to read and evaluate all kinds of investigations modalities (such as blood work, ECG, X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Electromyelogram, EEG, etc.) and apply in practice, to determine and decide the treatment protocol. What qualifications should my homeopath have? Your homeopath should have either a post-graduation or at least a graduate qualification in medicine. Medical qualification for homeopaths varies from country to country. However, it is important that every 'homeopath' has adequate training in all medical subjects as above. Most countries have courses in homeopathy minimum after 12 years with science subjects. The homeopathy course has to be a 'graduation' course in science subjects. It cannot be a short-term course with a background in commerce or arts subjects. In some countries, there are 'medical homeopaths' while in some countries there are also 'lay-homeopaths'. In many European countries including the UK as well as the US, there are courses for lay people which may legally permit them to practice homeopathy. However, such courses are not adequate in medical training and it is highly debatable if such practitioners could be called 'homeopaths'. The problem with such homeopaths is that they fail to understand the diseases from the medical perspective.

We shall discuss in brief how could you locate and identify a good and qualified homeopath, who could help you treat your ailment. Let us talk about the following important aspects of it. What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is an alternative system of medicine, that originated in Germany in 1794. In the early part of the 20th century, about 30% of doctors in the US were homeopaths. However, the number of homeopaths has reduced in number due to many reasons. Who is a homeopath? A 'Homeopath' is one who is a qualified medical practitioner who has been trained in homeopathy through a full-time, full-length course; and is legally and technically certified to practice homeopathic medicine, as per the local governing body. Unfortunately, not many countries offer the full-length courses, which should be practically identical to the mainstream medical course of M.B.,B,S, and M.D. It is important that the qualified homeopath should have studied in detail the following subjects in full length. - Anatomy (for 18 months) - Physiology (for 18 months) - Pathology (for 12 months) - Internal medicine (Minimum 12 months) - Surgery (Minimum 12 months) - Gynecology and Obstetrics (Minimum 12 months) - Preventive and Social Medicine x(Minimum 12 months) - Medico-Legal Medicine (Minimum 12 months) - Pediatrics, Psychiatry, ENT, Dermatology, etc. (as a part of the course) - Homeopathic Philosophy (Minimum 3 years) - Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia (Materia Medica) (Minimum 3 years) - Homeopathic Pharmacy (Minimum 12 months) - Clinical Medicine ((Minimum 2 years) - Hospital training (Minimum 3 years) In all different fields of medicine, surgery, Gynecology, ENT, Skin, Psychiatry, etc.) - Internship ((Minimum 1 year) Through full-time study for at least five and a half years including practical training in the hospitals is required for any homeopath to have granted a doctorate degree. Such intense training is available only in some countries like India. It is very important the homeopath is able to understand the medical language, able to read and evaluate all kinds of investigations modalities (such as blood work, ECG, X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Electromyelogram, EEG, etc.) and apply in practice, to determine and decide the treatment protocol. What qualifications should my homeopath have? Your homeopath should have either a post-graduation or at least a graduate qualification in medicine. Medical qualification for homeopaths varies from country to country. However, it is important that every 'homeopath' has adequate training in all medical subjects as above. Most countries have courses in homeopathy minimum after 12 years with science subjects. The homeopathy course has to be a 'graduation' course in science subjects. It cannot be a short-term course with a background in commerce or arts subjects. In some countries, there are 'medical homeopaths' while in some countries there are also 'lay-homeopaths'. In many European countries including the UK as well as the US, there is a course for lay people which may legally permit them to practice homeopathy. However, such courses are not adequate in the medical training and it is highly debatable if such practitioners could be called 'homeopaths'.

Naturally, all homeopathic clinics are not the same in terms of quality and services. We have covered three large cities of India namely Mumbai, Pune, and Bangalore. We have 8 homeopathy clinics in Mumbai, four homeopathy clinics in Pune, and two homeopathy clinics in Bangalore (Bengaluru). I shall now proceed to discuss some of the qualities of a good homeopathic clinic. A homeopathic clinic cannot be considered effective unless it is managed by good homeopathic doctors. 1. Headed by good homeopathic doctors: A good homeopathic clinic has to be headed by qualified and experienced homeopathic doctors who are capable of offering homeopathic treatment. The head of the clinic must be a qualified and certified homeopath with sound medical knowledge. For details regarding the qualification criteria, please check the details provided in a separate article on how to find a good homeopath. 2. Professional staff: A visit to a homeopathic clinic entails interaction with both the medical and non-medical staff. The professionalism of the staff reflects the professionalism of the homeopathic doctors behind the scene. 3. Associate homeopathic doctors: A homeopathic clinic headed by an experienced and busy homeopathic doctor should have a system in place that allows you to communicate with the head doctor or associated doctors, as and when you require. 4. Patient support system: In the professional world of today, it is important that any enterprise has efficient customer care facilities, which in the case of homeopathic clinics would be an efficient Patient Support System. Make sure that your homeopathic clinic has a Patient Support System. 5. Genuine information on subjects: Homeopathic clinics should be able to offer information, literature, brochures, websites, presentations, e-books, etc., on the scope of homeopathic treatment for various diseases. Also, the said literature should ideally be based on the experience at the respective homeopathic clinic. 6. Accessibility: A good homeopathic clinic is one that is accessible to the patients in terms of physical distance and telephonic and/or virtual contact. The staff at a homeopathic clinic should be contactable by phone for at least eight hours, e-mail, personal visits, internet chats, and possibly video-conference facilities. 7. Long-term commitment: A good homeopathic clinic is one that is committed for the long term to homeopathic treatment. Treatment of chronic disease might last over a long period, so, it is important that your homeopathic clinic offers such commitment. What to look for in a good homeopathic doctor by Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, Director: Life Force Center, Mumbai, who has treated patients from 180 countries. (Introduction: Dr Shah heads a large homeopathic center in Mumbai, treating patients from across the world. Life Force is not only a major homeopathic clinic in Mumbai, India but it is one of its kind in the world.) All over the world, there is a renewed demand for homeopathic doctors as there is growing awareness about homeopathy. It is not easy to find the best possible homeopath or homeopathic doctor in one's area, as homeopathic doctors all over the place are not equally trained. The Internet throws a large number of homeopathic doctors across the screen; however, it is not very easy to identify one who is suitable for your needs, for your ailment. Let me give some thoughts on 'how to identify best homeopathic doctors', based on my (Dr Shah) active experience in the field of homeopathy for almost 30 years, at my clinics in Mumbai, India. I suggest seeing the following aspects in a good homeopathic doctor or a homeopath. - Medical qualification and medical exposure - Experience relevant to the disease you are seeking help - Professionalism - Accessibility of services Let me tell you that all homeopathic doctors globally are not the same in terms of qualification and proficiency; just like in any other profession. 1. Medical qualification and medical exposure The homeopathic education system varies from country to country. So as the homeopathic doctors. Only in some countries, homeopaths are conventionally trained medical doctors. For example, Germany, Austria, India, Australia, South Africa, etc. It is important that your homeopathic doctor has medical exposure and training. Your homeopath should be able to read, understand medical reports, and apply that knowledge in prescribing for your disease. 2. Experience relevant to the disease you are seeking help: If you are getting treated for, say [Eczema](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/eczema/), Neuralgia, or Arthritis, it is important that your homeopathic doctor has relevant experience in handling patients with the same disease. Depending on the disease, your homeopath should have undertaken treatment of at least 50 common diseases (like allergies, [urticaria](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/), arthritis, [alopecia areata](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/alopecia-areata/), etc) at least [Nephrotic Syndrome](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/nephrotic-syndrome/), [Psoriatic arthritis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriatic-arthritis/), [Ankylosing spondylitis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/ankylosing-spondylitis/), etc.) Scleroderma, [Lichen Planus pigmentosa](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/), Pulmonary Fibrosis, etc.); in order he can treat you successfully. 3. Professionalism: Your homeopathic doctor should ideally have a professional setup, a well-staffed clinic and infrastructure, and a professional method of handling your case over a period of time. In big cities like New York, London, Mumbai, Dubai, etc., it is not expected of homeopathic doctors to have a professional setup. Life Force homeopathy clinic in Mumbai has a professional setup with well-trained staff for handling your cases. 4. Accessibility of services: Homeopathic treatment for chronic disease may take time. During the entire course of treatment, it is important that your homeopathic doctor or his associate is available to you through personal visits, phone, email, video conferencing, etc. It is important for your homeopathic doctor to offer you a professional Patient Support System for easy communication.

A small presentation by Life Force about sources of homeopathic medicines We shall discuss homeopathic medicines in terms of the following points : (A) Source (B) Method of preparation (C) Therapeutic application (D) Adverse effects (E) Commonly used homeopathic medicines A. Source: Homeopathic medicines are prepared from the following 6 major sources : - Plant kingdom: About 60% of the homeopathic medicines are prepared from one or more parts of plants. The whole plant or some parts of it, such as leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, and berries, may be used in the preparation of the medicines. All types of plants, benign, poisonous, and carnivorous, have been used as homeopathic medicines. Common 20% of the homeopathic medicines are prepared from minerals, including metals, non-metals, and their compounds. Some of the medicines prepared using minerals are Aurum metallicum (gold), Kali carbonicum (potassium), Natrum muriaticum (common salt), and Silica (sand). The therapeutic properties of almost all known metals and non-metals and many important compounds have been exploited in homeopathy. - Animal kingdom: Some homeopathic medicines are derived from certain animal products, which are obtained without killing animals. Animal products, such as snake poison, spider poison, etc., are used in extremely minute doses to prepare homeopathic medicines. Examples include Tarantula hispania, Lachesis, Diseased tissues: Some homeopathic medicines are prepared using tissues or secretions containing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Thus, homeopathy advocated the therapeutic use of minuscule amounts of microorganisms long before the introduction of vaccines. Some commonly used homeopathic medicines prepared in this manner include Tuberculinum, Syphillinum, and Variolinum. - Hormones and healthy tissues: Healthy human/animal tissues and secretions are also used to prepare homeopathic medicines. Examples of such medicines areThyroidinum and Adrenaline. - Imponderables: Certain energy sources, such as magnetism, x-ray, radiation, etc., are also used to prepare homeopathic medicines. B. Method of preparation: Potentization: Homeopathic medicines are essentially nano-medicines. The original drug substance is used in extremely minute quantities to prepare a given homeopathic medicine. The method of preparing homeopathic medicines is called potentization; in this method, one part of the original drug substance (say, 0.1 mg of a plant extract) is mixed with 99 parts (9.9 mg) of a suitable carrier (say alcohol) and shaken vigorously by a special device that converts the preparation into the 1c potency. One part (0.1 mg) of the 1c preparation is then mixed with 99 parts (9.9 mg) of the carrier and the process of potentization is repeated to prepare the 2c potency. This process is continued until the required potency is reached. Homeopathic medicines are available in certain standard such as 30c, 100c, medicines: The therapeutic application of homeopathic medicines is based on the Law of Similars. All homeopathic medicines are tested on humans, by a method that is similar to clinical trials, before use. The clinical use of these medicines is governed by specific tried-and-tested laws and principles. D. Adverse effects of homeopathic medicines: Since only minuscule amounts of the original drug substance are used, homeopathic medicines, essentially, do not cause any adverse effects. E. Common medicines used for various diseases: Some of the homeopathic medicines Homeopathic medicines undergo a sophisticated process of potentization, which activates the hidden potency of any drug substance, making it usable to treat diseases. The medicines have been found to be in the form of nanoparticles, as per the recent research; and work at the immunity level to treat even deep-rooted ailments. Thuja Occidenalis Thuja Occidentalis, for example, is a huge plant, commonly called white cedar or tree of life. This medicine, when transformed through the process of potentizing, and administered in a safe, small dose to humans, can bring amazing improvement in diseases such as serious allergies, tonsillitis, breast-tumors (benign), asthma, anxiety states, and also some forms of arthritis. Typically, when this medicine is required, the patient's emotions and mental symptoms are evaluated and they are found to be full of anxiety, deep-rooted apprehension, some kind of rigidity in thoughts and actions, dogmatism, and sadness. There may be a thermal preference for heat rather than cold, but it is not a rule. Such patients may also suffer from Lichen planus, cancer, prostate hypertrophy (BPH), uterine fibroids, ankylosing spondylitis, or such semi-reversible disease pathology. The entire list of indications cannot be described here. The use of Thuja is a great illustration of how homeopathy applies mind and body symptoms in the form of totality. Silica: Silica is sourced from the element Si, the sand; a great example showing how the homeopathic method of potentization could actuate inert substances like Silica into a powerful medicinal ingredient. While choosing Silica for a patient, the homeopath would check if the personality of the patient matches with a certain trait such as one who is intelligent but may be lacking confidence, shy yet firm, mild yet strong-willed, efficient yet nervous, stubborn yet apprehensive, egoist yet gentle. A person requiring Silica is likely to be sensitive to cold wind, having hormonal and immunologically mediated diseases like frequent infections, headaches, skin diseases, hair loss, colds and coughs, tonsillitis, arthritis; just name some. Silica is an example of a polychrest (working a wide range of diseases) remedy, found useful in children, adults as well as elderly people. Homeopathic Remedies A drug is a substance that has medicinal properties. Medicines are drugs whose exact medicinal properties are known. A remedy is a medicine that is suitable for a specific patient at a particular time point. Apparently, one might think that the drug, medicine, and remedy mean the same. Homeopathic remedies are those homeopathic medicines that are selected for a patient on the basis of the following points: - Patient's disease - Patient's individual symptoms (other than those of the disease) - Patient's emotional and intellectual characteristics - Patient's past history, family history, and other factors The homeopathic remedies are selected from among the 3000 homeopathic medicines available in the armory of homeopathy. On the basis of a patient's characteristics, only a few medicines will be selected for a patient at a given time and prescribed in a particular sequence. To select the appropriate homeopathic medicines for a patient, the physician will require a detailed case study. The homeopathic doctor has to investigate the patient thoroughly and gather information on all the points mentioned above. Homeopathic remedies can be classified as follows: - Constitutional homeopathic remedies - Disease-specific homeopathic remedies - Inter-current homeopathic medicines a. Constitutional homeopathic remedy or remedies are those selected on the basis of a complete study of the patient's physical and mental constitution. Such medicine has to be deep-acting medicine and must have the power to address the disease at a fundamental level. A patient may require one or maybe a couple of constitutional homeopathic remedies over a period of time. Commonly used constitutional homeopathic remedies are chosen on the basis of the following points: - Nature of the disease and its pathogenesis - Extent or stage of the disease - Curability or incurability of the disease - Reversibility or irreversibility of the disease Homeopathic remedies are sometimes chosen to relieve disease symptoms, while constitutional homeopathic remedies are used to act at a deeper level. Commonly used disease-specific homeopathic remedies are Hepar c. Inter-current homeopathic remedies: These are the medicines that assist, push, and enhance the effects of constitutional homeopathic medicines. These homeopathic remedies are selected largely on basis of the genetic characteristics of the patient and are very powerful and deep-acting. It is very important that these remedies be carefully chosen by the homeopathic doctor. The selection of homeopathic remedies involves a deep understating of homeopathy, medicine, and the art of patient interaction on the part of the homeopathic doctor. Skill, training, wisdom, experience, and knowledge are the basic requirements that will help a homeopathic doctor select the appropriate homeopathic remedy in each case. All about homeopathy you always wanted to know - by Dr Rajesh Shah All About Homeopathy Explained by Dr. Rajesh Shah Homeopathy is an alternative method of treatment, based on nature's law of cure, namely 'Like Cures Like'. The truth of this law was discovered by a German scientist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 and has been verified experimentally and clinically for 200 years. Homeopathy is a revolutionary, natural medical science. Homeopathy is a gentle and effective system of medicine. The remedies are prepared from natural substances to precise standards and work by stimulating the body's own healing mechanisms. Why should homeopathy be the choice of therapy? Homeopathy is a scientific, logical, safe, quick, and extremely effective method of healing. It offers a long-lasting to permanent cure (in select conditions), treating the disease from its roots. Homeopathy is one of the most rational sciences with respect to its concepts of health, disease, and cure. Homeopathy does not treat superficially by just driving away from the symptoms but heals the patient from within. However, it is not claimed that homeopathy can cure all diseases. Homeopathy: Holistic Medicine: The concept of disease in homeopathy is that disease is a total affection of mind and body, the disturbance of the whole of the immunogenetic system of the organism. Individual organs are not the cause of illness but disturbance at the inner level (disturbance of the life force, the vital energy of the body) is the cause of illness. Therefore homeopathy does not believe in giving different medicines for different afflicted parts of the body but rather give one single constitutional remedy, which will cover the disturbance of the whole person. Homeopathy treats the patient as a whole and not just the disease. Medical philosophy is coming more and more to the conclusion that the mere treatment of symptoms and organs can only help temporarily and that it is the healing power of the body as the whole that has to be enhanced. Homeopathy believes in a holistic, totalistic, and individualistic approach. Why is homeopathy known for its Minimum dose? Homeopathy has a unique approach to the method of preparation of the drugs in which the end result will contain only the ultra-molecular dose of the source drug substance. In recent research, the minimum dose in the Homeopathic medicines has been found to contain the nanoparticles of the source material. So, now, Homeopathy is found to be a form of nano-pharmacological system. By a special mode of preparation called 'potentization', over 2500 homeopathic medicines are prepared from sources such as vegetables, animals, minerals, chemicals, etc. Hence homeopathic remedies with its ultra minute dose are non-toxic, absolutely harmless, and bring about a safe and sure cure. Homeopathic remedies are dynamic agents influencing the body's immunological state. Homeopathy: Ideal for Infants and Children: Most of the children ailments like Cold, Cough, Fever, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Dysentery, Colic, [Tonsillitis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/tonsillitis/), Bronchitis, [Asthma](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthmatic-bronchitis/), Measles, Chickenpox, Mumps, Dentition problems, etc., could be very effectively and quickly treated with homeopathy without producing any side effects whatsoever. Unlike antibiotics and other such medicines, homeopathic pills do not hamper digestion or lower the body's resistance. Neither do they cause any allergies nor cause any damage even if taken over a long period. Children, willingly ingest homeopathic pills being sweet in taste. Indeed, homeopathy is child-friendly! Besides, homeopathy is effective also in temperament and behavioral problems are seen commonly in children like irritability, obstinacy, temper-tantrums, fears, phobias, destructiveness; and thumb- sucking, nail-biting, bed-wetting; as well as in mentally and physically backward children. Is Homeopathy a substitute for the use of antibiotics? Homeopathy is an effective alternative to antibiotics in many infectious diseases (if not all), producing no toxic side effects and bringing about rapid recovery. Homeopathy has treatment for many of the infectious diseases such as Sinusitis, Tonsillitis, Bronchitis, Otitis media (pus from ear), Gastroenteritis (vomiting-diarrhea), Dysentery, Urinary Infections, etc. Homeopathy, however, is not the best option for critical infections such as cerebral malaria, typhoid, acute tuberculosis, severe infection, etc. Homeopathy may not be suitable for certain critical and aggressive infections. Homeopathy offers wonder treatment for Viral infections: Viral infections such as common cold, influenza, measles, chickenpox, mumps, viral hepatitis (jaundice), viral meningitis, etc. are very well treated with homeopathy Allopathic system has no curative treatment for viral diseases except infusing antibiotics under the pretext of preventing secondary bacterial infection. Homeopathy: Often avoids Surgery Homeopathy is not against surgery. Surgery is an art and science by itself. Surgery is called forth in the conditions where medicines have limited or no role, and where surgical aid, the operation can cure or improve the condition. There is a number of diseases that are labeled as 'surgical', where homeopathy works curatively and can avoid surgery. Some such ailments are Septic recurrent Tonsillitis, Piles, [Fissure-in-ano](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/fissure-in-ano/), Fistula, Appendicitis (except Polyp in nose-ear, Kidney and Biliary Uterine Fibroid, Ovarian Cysts, [Warts](warts.aspx), [Corns](https://www.askdrshah.com/corns_callosities.aspx), etc. Homeopathy: Answer to Allergic diseases In modern life, infections have diminished and various allergic disorders have grown rampant. Homeopathy offers very effective treatment for allergic diseases such as various skin diseases like [Urticaria](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/), [Eczema](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/eczema/), [Contact Dermatitis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/eczema/), as well as gives unbelievably miraculous results in [Asthmatic Bronchitis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthmatic-bronchitis/). Homeopathy: Excellent for etc. are successfully treated with homeopathy. Homeopathy has long recognized the psychological origin of somatic (body) symptoms. Homeopathy always examines a patient's mental make-up in all cases and remedies are given acting at the level of mind and body together, thus eradicating the disease. Perhaps no other system of medicine has such a superb approach to tackling the mind-body disorders with definite therapeutic agents. Homeopathic remedies are capable of influencing the state of mind. They can specifically act to alleviate emotional disturbance such as excessive [anxiety](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/anxiety-neurosis/), irritability, insecurity, obsessive traits, undue jealousy, suspicion (paranoid) fears, depression, neurosis, etc. By relieving the emotions such as above, homeopathic remedies bring about a harmonious state of health. Thus homeopathy demonstrates the possibility of the highest goal of medicine, the therapy for the person rather than for the disease alone. Homeopathic remedies can treat mental and emotionally disturbed states. Homeopathic Opinion: A must... In this scientific era of health consciousness, the time has come that for the treatment of any disease, which does not respond to any particular line of treatment, one must take a homeopathic opinion immediately. Often patients lose their early time going from one specialist to another helplessly, without permanent relief, and approach homeopathy only when other medicines fail. Homeopathy: Not a last resort To obtain the best results and full benefits of homeopathic science, one should resort to homeopathy in the early phase of sickness. Because of ignorance and lack of awareness in the general public about the usefulness of homeopathy in all kinds of diseases ranging from Cold to Cancer, many patients approach homeopathy late. By this time the disease process advances to an incurable stage and homeopathy can offer little then, to the otherwise curable disorders. However timely given homeopathic treatment could be a blessing to the ailing humanity. Homeopathy: A near-complete system of medicine: Homeopathy is not limited to certain diseases but is universally applicable to most kinds of diseases. It is the time when people must be made fully aware of the benefits and the scope of homeopathy in various day-to-day diseases. Homeopathy should be more and more made available to the benefit of ailing persons, as it can positively help 90% of the diseases we have today. Homeopathy also works for many uncommon, difficult diseases Diseases are diseases; common or uncommon. Homeopathy works for most chronic diseases. Here, we shall talk about some of the uncommon chronic diseases where homeopathy has shown results when treated by Dr Shah and the team at Life Force. The following opinion is based on real experience. This list is not a complete list, but illustrative. Epidermolysis Bullosa: An uncommon, severe, serious, genetic skin disease affecting very young kids, who present with multiple, recurring blisters on the skin. These blisters will lead to peeling of the skin, they are painful and do not heal easily. Based on our experience with about 3-4 cases so far, we can say that homeopathy works and it is strongly recommended for this disease. (Link) Hailey-Hailey Disease: Another rare disease of the skin, which is genetic and it runs in family. Usually, brothers or father and son (s) present with the disease. We have treated about twelve cases (December 2015) thus far with excellent results. Prurigo Nodularis: Several cases treated with success at Life Force. Homeopathy works very well. Urticaria Pigmentosa: We have great success with this uncommon skin disease; even affecting infants. Hydrastis adenitis Suppurativa: This infection affecting the lymph glands of axillae (armpits) is resistant to treatment many times, and they often do not respond to antibiotics. We have treated several cases with success. In addition, the following diseases can find some definite help with homeopathy. Adenomyosis, eyes, Fibroadenoma, Genital warts, Post Herpetic Neuralgia, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), Pancreatitis (Chronic), Peanut allergy and more. Homeopathy explained in brief by Dr Rajesh Shah, MD What is homeopathy? Homeopathy (=homoeopathy) is a branch of medicine that originated in Germany in 1794, which is based on the principle of The Law of Similars. In a way, it is an advanced form of vaccination; whereby a substance that is capable of producing a disease-like state is administered to the patient, but in a very minute dose, to cure a similar disease. Homeopathy works much beyond vaccination. Here, the homeopathic dose administered is unbelievably minuscule, which renders if absolutely harmless yet very powerful. Contrary to conventional medicine, the action of homeopathy is much safer, deeper acting, somewhat slower, and results much longer lasting by energizing the body's curative powers. Homeopathy is amongst the youngest and latest medicines calling for more research and promotion. Homeopathic treatment has become increasingly popular over the last decades. How does it work? There are theories on how exactly homeopathic medicine works. As supported in major clinical trials and in practice, it is believed to be working by stimulating the body's own healing mechanisms. For example, in the case of diseases that are caused by infection, it seems to be working by stimulating the production of antibodies, defense blood cells, etc. In cases of immune diseases, homeopathic medicines work by correcting the immune mechanism. In case of painful conditions, by activating the body's anti-pain mechanisms. Similarly, its action must be on the lines of being antispasmodic, anti-allergic, immuno-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, hormone stimulatory, anti-carcinogenic, etc. Large-scale studies alone will allow a full exploration of this young science. What can it do? Homeopathy boasts of tremendous powers as a system of medicine. Especially in case of chronic, long-standing, and recurring diseases like etc, homeopathy offers results that can change the life of patients. In the cases of allergic diseases like Asthma, urticaria, and the like, it can enhance the body's immune mechanism is such as the way that the body no more reacts in an abnormal way by producing constricted bronchial tubes, the abnormal release of histamine, spasm, inflammation, etc. In cases of ulcerative diseases (like Ulcerative colitis), it leads the immune mechanism to enhance the ulcer healing mechanism. This goes true for most chronic diseases. [Read about What homeopathy is not](what-homeopathy-is-not.aspx) [Read about What doctors will not tell about homeopathy](what-doctor-should-know.aspx) Homeopathic and conventional medicines can be used together in many diseases Homeopathy and Conventional Medicine One of the many myths that surround homeopathy is that homeopathic medicines and conventional (allopathic) medicines cannot be taken together! Well, it is not true. How does Dr Shah look at homeopathy and conventional medicine (allopathy) is, that they are two of the methods of treatment; with their own strengths and limitations? No system of medicine, yet, is complete and perfect. There are many diseases, which can be treated by homeopathy alone, without the help of any other modes of treatment. The examples include: - Eczema - Urticaria - Lichen - IBS - Molluscum Contagiosa - ADHD - Autism - Allergies - And more There are many diseases, which can be managed by conventional medicines alone. For example: - High blood pressure - Diabetes - Rheumatoid Arthritis - Ulcerative colitis - Tuberculosis - HIV - Some forms of cancer - Asthma - Many infections - Gout - Malaria - Typhoid - Pneumonia - Epilepsy - And more. There are many diseases, which are better treated if both the systems of medicines are thoughtfully integrated. The examples are: - Recurrent Tonsillitis - Psoriatic Arthritis - Rheumatoid Arthritis - HIV - Hepatitis C - Ulcerative colitis - Peptic Ulcer - Ankylosing Spondylitis - Depression - Anxiety Neurosis - Autism - Diabetes Neuropathy - Some forms of cancer - Some chronic infections like fungal infections - Meniere disease - Bronchial Asthma - Underactive thyroid - And many more. Are homeopathy and conventional medicine enemies? How can they be? It is imprudent to think like that. Some homeopathic and allopathic doctors might consider each other in opposition. It is their shortsightedness. Dr Shah believes that Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering cannot be opponents of each other, and they work complementing each other; so as do homeopathy and any other system of medicine. Belonging t It is a duty of the attending physician who may be belonging to any system of medicine, to advocate for the patient whatever is best indicated to the patient's benefit, depending on the nature of the disease. For this, it is imperative that all doctors have proper knowledge and orientation about all the systems of medicine. Time will come if any doctor missing on advising homeopathy for certain diseases, will be a case of medical negligence. Which diseases are curable using homeopathy? Is your disease curable using homeopathy? Dr Rajesh Shah explains based on his experience of over 36+ years (Since 1985) Some patients and homeopaths are of the belief that all diseases are equally curable using homeopathy. This is an extreme view and it needs to be discussed. All the diseases, obviously, cannot be cured using homeopathy... Let us be very clear that homeopathy is a science and not magic! Homeopathy has its own strengths and limitations as well. The believers of homeopathy, at times, have over-expectations from this science. Also, some of the homeopaths have wrong notions; wherein they promote the idea that if symptoms match, all diseases, from colds to cancer find a cure in homeopathy. The curability of diseases using homeopathy depends on some of the following factors, but randomly as under: 1. Nature of pathology: All diseases are not the same. The diseases can be allergic (e.g... asthma, hay fever), infective (viral, bacterial, fungal, etc), autoimmune (e.g. underactive thyroid, alopecia areata), metabolic (e.g. diabetes, lactose intolerance), functional (e.g. Irritable Bowel Syndrome), structural (e.g. Ulcerative colitis), reversible (e.g. GERD, Migraine), irreversible (e.g. Hernia, Cataract, Male Pattern Baldness), benign (e.g. Chalazion, lipoma), malignant (e.g. Cancer), emotional (e.g. Anxiety neurosis, [Erectile dysfunction](https://www.askdrshah.com/erectile-dysfunction.aspx)), psychological (e.g. depression), psychosomatic (e.g. collagen (e.g. Polymyositis, Myasthenia gravis, (e.g. Lichen Planus, cortisone myopathy), etc. The prognosis varies based on the nature of the disease. 2. Nature of the disease: My new categories of the disease will be Acute, subacute, chronic, recurring, or critical; instead of only Acute and Chronic. Most of the Acute (tonsillitis), Chronic (Eczema), and Recurring (Asthmatic Bronchitis) diseases are treatable using homeopathy. However, some of the acute diseases which are critical in nature, such as severe infection (septicemia, cerebral malaria) heart attack (myocardial infarction), etc are not curable using homeopathy. 3. Nature of infection: Most bacterial and viral infections find good treatment using homeopathy. However, severe infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, Gonorrheal Meningitis, Typhoid, etc are better not treated using homeopathy as the conventional treatment is more effective for them. Cases of HIV can find a supportive role in homeopathy. Homeopathy is effective for bacterial infections such as abscess, tonsillitis, otitis media, recurring boils, osteomyelitis, etc. Homeopathy is also effective for viral infections such as measles, chickenpox, hepatitis A, B, and C, viral warts, herpes, molluscum contagiosa, etc. Fungal infections such as Tenia Versicolor and tenia corporis respond to homeopathy. However, very old standing Tenia corporis is often difficult to treat with any medicine. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of nails, difficult to treat yet treatable. 4. If or not the pathological changes of the disease are functional or structural in nature: The diseases with functional changes (Aplastic anemia, Migraine) are easy to treat by and large. In the diseases with structural (Psoriatic arthritis), changes take longer to get results. Some of them are completely curable (e.g. Ulcerative colitis, Hepatitis C) while some are partly curable (Trigeminal Neuralgia), and some are incurable (e.g. Deformities in Rheumatoid arthritis). 5. If or not the pathological changes of the disease are irreversible or irreversible in nature: Reversible disease pathologies such as Psoriasis, Urticaria, Asthma are curable. The diseases with irreversible changes such as psoriatic arthritis can be palliated but not cured; while some of the irreversible diseases such as some forms of cancer cannot be cured but can be symptomatically helped using homeopathy. 6. Extent and stage of the disease: Most diseases have different stages. The success of treatment varies according to the extent and stage of the disease. For example, Vitiligo with mild extent is curable but the same disease if extensive, cannot be cured. 7. The depth of the disease: Various diseases have varying roots in terms of the depth of the diseases. For example, some diseases such as acute urticaria are usually not deep-seated; it is superficial. It can be treated quickly with success. When Urticaria becomes chronic, say five years old, and it is recurring, again and again, its depth is more. This form of urticaria is still curable, but it takes time. Now, the same example of urticaria, when presented with severe form what is called Angioedema and dermatographism, it becomes all the more difficult to treat, since its 'depth of the disease' is much more. All diseases need to be understood in this manner. 8. Cause of the disease: Every disease needs to be scrutinized in terms of the origin and causes such as genetic, metabolic, immunological, etc. and the prognosis can be determined accordingly. 9. Maintaining factors of the disease: Some diseases have maintaining factors untreated. For example, cases of hair loss using hair dye or harsh shampoo will still have a loss of hair, in spite of the best homeopathic treatment. 10. Current medications: Some of the diseases are triggered or maintained by some drugs or medicines. For example, cases of psoriases who are on beta-blockers may obstruct the cure of psoriasis. Some of the strong immunosuppressive medicines such as methotrexate or cortisone may not allow the right homeopathic medicine to work in some cases such as Nephrotic Syndrome, Atopic dermatitis, Psoriasis. 11. Past medications: Some strong immunosuppressive medicines such as methotrexate, cortisone, cyclophosphamide, etc. may delay cure with homeopathic medicines. 12. The overall health of the patient: If the patient's general health and vitality are good, the results are better and faster. 13. Associated diseases that the patient may be having: Associated diseases have an impact on the treatment of other diseases. For example, if the patient with Alopecia areata also has Underactive thyroid and/or diabetes, it takes relatively longer to get success. 14. Genetic factors: A strong genetic tendency in the background calls for a defined line of treatment and the response time may vary accordingly. 15. Lifestyle factors: [Patients with Oral Lichen Planus](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-oral.aspx) continuing with smoking, or cases of IBS living erratic lifestyles will alter the response time of the treatment. 16. Selection of homeopathic medicine and its dose: In fact, the most important factor is the selection of the correct medicines for the patients, based on a detailed history and understating of the totality. Also, correct medicine in the right dose and correct repetition will make the cure successful. 17. Patient's compliance: It is important to have the patient's active participation and compliance in the process of cure. A qualified homeopath can and should be able to help you by suggesting to you the possibility of a cure and an estimated timeline. A good homeopath who has adequate experience, expertise, medical training combined with proper case studies can make your life easy.

Yes, in the olden time (pre-internet era), [qualified and experienced homeopathic doctors](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224213301/http://www.lifeforce.in/good-homeopath.aspx) were not available everywhere. Now, we have been serving patients from all across the world using the online treatment protocol. Life Force is a pioneer of Online medical practice and we treat patients from 180 countries; probably including someone in your neighborhood! Homeopathy: Born in Germany, brought up the US, flourished in India Homeopathy was born in 1796 in Germany. Dr Samuel Hahnemann, MD, the founder of this science, made it popular almost all over Europe and the US during his lifetime. It spread to Australia and Scandinavian countries and came to India in 1810. Around 1930, an estimated 30% of doctors in the US were involved in homeopathic practice. Homeopathy is popular in Africa and getting popular in the UAE, Iran, Singapore, Japan, and also China. There are regularized homeopathic colleges and institutes training doctors in homeopathy in many countries. There are homeopathic hospitals in India and the UK. People the world over are interested in checking homeopathy options for the treatment of their chronic and recurring diseases. There are research grants offered by the Government in some countries like India. India is the only country in the world to have a dedicated Ministry under the central government devoted to the complementary systems of medicine, including Homeopathy. In India, about 250 homeopathic medical colleges are offering five and a half years of long, full-time undergraduate courses in homeopathy. Many of these colleges offer an MD program, that is, Doctor of Medicine, for an additional three years. Some of them offer a Ph.D. program in homeopathy. There are many homeopathic hospitals in India. There are an estimated 250000 qualified homeopathic doctors in India. Over 30% of the Indian population use homeopathy during their lifetime. There are many elite scientific institutions in India, including IIT-B, ICT, Bose, Haffkine, BARC Mumbai University, Nair Hospital, Tata Memorial, and many more, which undertake homeopathy research projects. The scientists such as engineers, biotechnologists, virologists, immunologists, molecular biologists, chemists, physicists, nuclear scientists, pharmacologists, etc., get involved in homeopathic research in India. Homeopathy cannot grow without research Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, the founder-director of Life Force believes that homeopathy as science would not grow if not supported by constant research work. He is a clinician, homeopath, researcher, and scientist. Life Force is a rare homeopathic clinic, which has an in-house research division and a team of researchers working on several projects in the areas of homeopathy. In fact, Life Force is the only clinic with an attached R & D, which is ISO 9001:2009 certified. At Life Force, the research is conducted in the fields of clinical research, clinical trials, human trials, animal studies, and fundamental research. Life Force is supported by a team of scientists from varied fields, not restricted to homeopathy or medicine, which offer their expert opinions for exploring newer horizons. There is an independent Ethics Committee associated with Life Force, which reviews various projects. The Ethics Committee has been formed as per ISMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines. Newer medicinal molecules have been developed and systematically studied at Life Force. It may be noted that several new research-based molecules have been granted Patents in the US, Europe, Australia, India, and Africa. Some of the articles based on the research work at Life Force have been published d in peer-reviewed international journals. Let me ask some pertinent questions: * Have you been suffering from any of the chronic diseases which keep visiting you frequently or all the time? (For example, some allergy, migraines, asthma, acne, eczema, arthritis, colitis, etc.) * Have you accepted that conventional medicine is the only way to treat your diseases? * Is it that you have not heard about or did not get a chance to try Homeopathy? * Did you know that homeopathy helps many chronic and recurring diseases without any adverse effects? If your answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes', then it would be worth reading what I have to say in this small write up. Well, since 1985, I have been engaged not only in the practice of homeopathy but also in promoting the benefits of this science to the world. Ever since the Internet came into existence, I launched the first homeopathic website in 1995 and have been talking about the benefits of homeopathic treatment to the world. I consider this my duty or obligation to let the world know what can homeopathy do for them. What does homeopathy treatment entail? The homeopathic treatment essentially entails the intake of oral medicines, which are prepared by a very specialized process called Potentization, which consists of intake of medicine, which is in the form of nanoparticles. Recent breakthrough research at one of the most leading engineering institutes (IIT-B) has found nano-bubbles in homeopathic medicines. The treatment is selected on the basis of the patient's in-depth case-study and medical reports. Since the treatment is more focused on Chronic and recurring diseases, which are deep-rooted and deep-seated, the treatment takes some time to show results. It may require being consumed for about four to twelve months or more, depending on the nature and complexity of the disease. The treatment is very safe, free from any adverse effects. Safe for babies, pregnant mothers, and elderly people as well. The treatment could be taken as stand-alone or along-with the conventional medicine. What is homeopathic treatment good for? Homeopathic treatment is good for and strongly indicated for all kinds of diseases which last for a long time and those which keep recurring, again and again. Just to name a few categories: - Allergic, metabolic, hormonal, auto-immune, psychosomatic, neurological, psychiatric, infections, developmental diseases in children, some stages of malignancies, etc. What is homeopathy not good for? Homeopathy is not at its best in critical diseases requiring urgent attention such as severe infection, heart attacks, accidents, truly surgical diseases, cancers, etc. Why didn't your primary doctor inform you about homeopathy? Homeopathy medical science is not taught in conventional medical colleges. Your primary doctor or family doctor is likely to be trained in conventional medicine, who is likely to be completely unaware of the scope and role of homeopathy. Medical education has not yet evolved fully. Time will come when all the doctors will have training and exposure to all the medical faculties. What must you know about homeopathy as an informed patient? As an educated and well-versed patient, one must know of the option of homeopathy as a way to treat chronic diseases. It should not happen that you or your loved ones get deprived of the benefits of homeopathy only because you didn't know that homeopathy existed! Have questions? Contact us: If you have any questions about the scope of homeopathy for the treatment of your disease or for someone you know, please feel free to chat with our doctors online (from this page) or send a query or call or visit us. We consider it our duty to educate anyone who needs to know about homeopathy. Which diseases can be treated? Which diseases could be treated by homeopathy? The strength of homeopathy lies in the management of a wide range of diseases. However, homeopathy is more popular in the treatment of chronic and recurring diseases and not so much for acute and critical diseases, which are often better treated by conventional medicine. Which chronic diseases? The diseases which last for many months or years are called chronic diseases, for example, skin diseases like [psoriasis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/default.aspx), [lichen thyroid](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/underactive-thyroid/)). Recurring diseases also fall under the category of Chronic diseases, for example, [migraine](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/migraine), [nephrotic syndrome](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/nephrotic-syndrome/), [asthma](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/asthma/), [urticaria](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/), [allergies](https://www.askdrshah.com/allergy.aspx), etc. which keep resurfacing over and again. Homeopathy has varying potentials to treat and help all of the above-stated diseases to a definite extent depending on the stage and severity of the disease. Which disease could be treated online? At Life Force, we have been treating many chronic diseases online since 1996. Over the years we have experienced that certain diseases are successfully treated online. Here is a small list of diseases that could be efficiently treated online and also a list of diseases which is better treated online, as some personal contact would be preferred. List of chronic diseases treated online The chronic and recurring diseases which may not have acute criticality involved could be treated online. We do not treat the following diseases: Acute ailments: Cough-cold, fever, diarrhea, traumas, heart disease, Influenza, Typhoid, Malaria, Pneumonia, Meningitis, etc Other diseases: Diabetes, Male Pattern Non-reversible pathologies, of developing/revamping new/old Nosodes, I am happy to present to the profession one more nosode prepared from Human papillomavirus (HPV). My research article is recently published in a peer-reviewed, international journal from Brazil. The title of the article: Preparation and standardization of Human papillomavirus (HPV) (Genotype 6) Nosode The Nosodes in homeopathy is a category of highly effective medicines sourced from biological materials such as microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) as well as diseased tissues. They have been found to be effective not against the infections or the diseases they are sourced from, but also useful against a wide range of disease conditions. | ||HPV (Human papillomavirus) is a common infection producing not only viral warts on the genitals through sexual or textile transmission but also potential carcinogens. Most of the cancers of the cervix are caused by HPV. Many cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, and throat are also caused by this virus. | Our past experience with the development of some new nosodes has taught us many lessons. The preparation and standardization of this new HPV nosode is the first step. This nosode is tested for its safety. It is ready for further exploration of its efficacy studies and more research. The full article is available at [https://www.highdilution.org/index.php/ijhdr/article/view/965](https://www.highdilution.org/index.php/ijhdr/article/view/965) - Dr Rajesh Shah, MD Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare disorder of the immune system. The cause of this disorder is unknown (idiopathic). In this condition, the body has less number of fighter cells called CD4. The CD4 cells are glycoproteins found on the surface of immune cells called lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that is responsible to attack bacteria and viruses during the course of any infection in the body. There is another serious disease, HIV infection, in which one finds lowering of the CD4 count. However, in the case of ICL, the HIV infection is absent. People with this disorder have a weak immune system and they are prone to catch infections readily. Cause- The cause of ICL unlike other idiopathic conditions is unknown. Some of the patients of ICL have a certain problem related to certain genes. Symptoms Some of the patients with ICL may have no symptoms, others may have conditions that suggest a low immune system such as hemolytic anemia, other infections like chickenpox and herpes zoster. At Life Force, we recently had a patient (Patient identification number: 34386) who had visited to get treated for this disorder. There was a gradual reduction in his absolute CD4 count and CD4 percentage. He was on immunosuppressive (steroid) medication. ICL patient's story Patient's report dated 21.9.2017 suggested the following; - Absolute CD4 lymphocyte: 149 (Low) - CD3:CD4: 16 (Low) The genetic testing was normal and HIV was negative. He complained of recurrent dry cough, generalized weakness, body pain with a rapid weight loss of 5-6 kgs in five months. The most important history which determined the diagnosis was recurrent tuberculosis. The patient narrated of being affected by tuberculosis at an interval of every two years where the lymph nodes, lungs, abdomen, liver, spleen, and spine were affected. There was also a strong history of tuberculosis in his paternal family. The conventional treatment does not have any strong evidence about the genetic link of tuberculosis or it resulting in an autoimmune disease later in the family. However, the homeopathic philosophy and the thought process support the hypothesis that there are some inherited tendencies that are passed on from one generation to another. A strong family history of tuberculosis makes one prone to inherit tubercular tendencies (tubercular miasm) and may give rise to similar conditions unlike tuberculosis (lupus, some type of cancers, aplastic anemia are some of them) in the future. This trait was also found in this patient who was prescribed homeopathic medicines which have the power to produce tubercular tendencies when given to healthy human beings. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on the following criteria - A low number of CD4+ cells on two or more measurements within six weeks - CD4 cell count less than 300 cells - Lack of laboratory evidence of HIV infection A low CD4 count can be accidentally diagnosed during testing for repetitive infections. A low CD4 count is also found in leukemia, chemotherapy, or in people who are on some immunosuppressive medicines. Scope of homeopathy We do not have specific experience, but we do have experience with a range of other immunologically mediated diseases. Homeopathy is recommended for the treatment of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. Unlike the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, homeopathy aims to boost the patients' weak immune system and thereby improve the CD4 count. It also helps in controlling the deterioration in the CD4 count and improves the general health of the patient in order to help individuals fight opportunistic infections. Homeopathy plays a supportive role in treating this disorder. It can be amalgamated with other indicated conventional modes of treatment. At Life Force, we would like to undertake more cases of ICL and evaluate the role of homeopathy. Dr Rajesh Shah Home page Ingredients Homeopathic medicines are distinct in the way they are prepared and applied. A small presentation by Life Force about sources of homeopathic medicines We shall discuss homeopathic medicines in terms of the following points : (A) Source (B) Method of preparation (C) Therapeutic application (D) Adverse effects (E) Commonly used homeopathic medicines A. Source: Homeopathic medicines are prepared from the following 6 major sources : - Plant kingdom: About 60% of the homeopathic medicines are prepared from one or more parts of plants. The whole plant or some parts of it, such as leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, and berries, may be used in the preparation of the medicines. All types of plants, benign, poisonous, and carnivorous, have been used as homeopathic medicines. Common 20% of the homeopathic medicines are prepared from minerals, including metals, non-metals, and their compounds. Some of the medicines prepared using minerals are Aurum metallicum (gold), Kali carbonicum (potassium), Natrum muriaticum (common salt), and Silica (sand). The therapeutic properties of almost all known metals and non-metals and many important compounds have been exploited in homeopathy. - Animal kingdom: Some homeopathic medicines are derived from certain animal products, which are obtained without killing animals. Animal products, such as snake poison, spider poison, etc., are used in extremely minute doses to prepare homeopathic medicines. Examples include Tarantula hispania, Lachesis, Diseased tissues: Some homeopathic medicines are prepared using tissues or secretions containing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Thus, homeopathy advocated the therapeutic use of minuscule amounts of microorganisms long before the introduction of vaccines. Some commonly used homeopathic medicines prepared in this manner include Tuberculinum, Syphillinum, and Variolinum. - Hormones and healthy tissues: Healthy human/animal tissues and secretions are also used to prepare homeopathic medicines. Examples of such medicines areThyroidinum and Adrenaline. - Imponderables: Certain energy sources, such as magnetism, x-ray, radiation, etc., are also used to prepare homeopathic medicines. B. Method of preparation: Potentization: Homeopathic medicines are essentially nano-medicines. The original drug substance is used in extremely minute quantities to prepare a given homeopathic medicine. The method of preparing homeopathic medicines is called potentization; in this method, one part of the original drug substance (say, 0.1 mg of a plant extract) is mixed with 99 parts (9.9 mg) of a suitable carrier (say alcohol) and shaken vigorously by a special device that converts the preparation into the 1c potency. One part (0.1 mg) of the 1c preparation is then mixed with 99 parts (9.9 mg) of the carrier and the process of potentization is repeated to prepare the 2c potency. This process is continued until the required potency is reached. Homeopathic medicines are available in certain standard such as 30c, 100c, medicines: The therapeutic application of homeopathic medicines is based on the Law of Similars. All homeopathic medicines are tested on humans, by a method that is similar to clinical trials, before use. The clinical use of these medicines is governed by specific tried-and-tested laws and principles. D. Adverse effects of homeopathic medicines: Since only minuscule amounts of the original drug substance are used, homeopathic medicines, essentially, do not cause any adverse effects. E. Common medicines used for various diseases: Innovation in global Homeopathy care Way back in 1995, Dr Shah started the first medical clinic online. His vision was to reach out to people across the globe with authentic information on homeopathy. Soon on setting up his website, which was designed all by himself, as there were no agencies to develop websites in those years; he started receiving queries from many parts of the world. \"I started receiving over 7o to 100 queries daily, which were replied personally by me, giving genuine guidance to people sitting in distant parts of the world,\" Dr Shah had said in an interview. Most people had no clue about the science of homeopathy and its benefits. Many of them wanted to get treated by homeopathy. Dr Shah recommended the names of homeopaths in several countries, as he had students in many countries; due to his active involvement as a teacher in many European countries, as well as the US. It was observed that the inquiries poured from remote places and also from those countries and towns where homeopathic doctors were not available. This promoted Dr Shah to develop a model of offering Online homeopathic treatment. And that was the beginning of online medical practice. Dr Shah will be remembered for this pioneering work. Very soon he developed over 25 websites dedicated to the treatment of various diseases and their homeopathic treatment. For example [www.Urticaria.com,](https://www.Urticaria.com) [www.LichenPlanus.com,](https://www.LichenPlanus.com) [www.Asthma.net.in,](https://www.Asthma.net.in) [www.NephroticSyndrome.com,](https://www.NephroticSyndrome.com) [www.TrigeminalNeuralgia.us,](https://www.TrigeminalNeuralgia.us) and many more. He was also one of the first to use e-commerce as a part of the online model, since 1995; long before e-commerce became popular. Enabling the patients to have more personal attention, Dr Shah started a video conference in 1998; again one of its kind in the healthcare space. Innovation is a key ingredient in Life Force. Such transparency and patient-friendly system are in practice at Life Force since 2005; which is hardly heard anywhere! All of the Life Force clinics are paper-less; where no medical information is stored on paper. From registration to case-details, examination findings, medical reports, prescriptions, communications, etc. are recorded digitally and accessible forever, just by a click. Even if the patient visits us after 20 or 50 years, the case-details in total would be retrieved instantly. Innovation in homeopathy profession \"Innovation leads to evolution,\" says Dr Rajesh Shah. The science of homeopathy was born around 1796. The homeopaths believed in the age-old approach, which hardly underwent an upgrade in spite of dramatic developments in the areas of medical technology, physics, immuno-genetics, and the like. As a result, homeopathy turned more of merely a philosophical system of medicine. Of course, the philosophical foundation in homeopathy is integral and fundamental in the application of this science. However, many innovative renovations were missed out in the last century. Innovations in the areas of scientific research, management of the clinical practice, use of technology for creating a soothing experience for the patients, etc. are some of the highlights initiated by Dr Shah at Life Force One of the examples of innovation is a paperless approach. Life Force clinics are paperless since 2007; probably one of the world's first paperless clinics. Likewise, innovation in patient care, innovation in a new approach to treatment (Dr Shah developed 'The Phenomenological Approach in Prescribing\", way back in 1991, which became the topic of his research for his master's degree in homeopathy medicine. Innovation in research, developing new homeopathic medicinal molecules, revamping the method of medicine preparation, etc. are some of the areas of innovation practiced and introduced by Dr Shah. The patients at Life Force receive the benefits of innovations in homeopathy. Inside Life Force Life Force: Dr Rajesh Shah's workplace Life Force is amongst Asia's largest homeopathic clinics, one of its kind, dedicated to the practice, promotion, scientific research, education, and medical training. Patients from over 180+ countries have been treated at Life Force, which is an established world record. Life Force has a commitment from the entire team, offering the best in patient-care. Our services at Life Force have evolved over the last three decades. We are constantly working on enhancing the patient experience in homeopathic treatment, making it friendly and meaningful regardless of where the patients are situated. Committed to offering the best of quality treatment, setting up international standards in homeopathic practice.

Shah on the World Homeopathy Summit 2015 (Interview Clever H. - the Mag!): About Dr Rajesh Shah, MD(Hom): Rajesh is a homeopath, a homeopathy activist (as he calls himself), a scientist, teacher and promoter of homeopathy. He is a pioneer of online medical practice. He is in the Limca book of world records for treating patients from the highest number of countries. The count is 180 countries, now! He has not only developed new nosodes such as HIV nosode and Hepatitis C nosode but also has revamped the method of nosode preparation. His work on animal model research is well-known, where it was proved that homeopathic medicines have anti-inflammatory activity as much as conventional medicine Diclofenac. Rajesh is Organizing Secretary of World Homeopathy Summit in Mumbai, India, which is designed to bring a new wave of scientific thinking in homeopathy. More information about him is at [www.AskDrShah.com](https://www.askdrshah.com/) and about the conference at [www.GlobalHomeopathyFoundation.com](www.GlobalHomeopathyFoundation.com) - To start off, some information about you...How did you come to homeopathy? What made you want to learn homeopathy and treat patients? Dr Rajesh Shah: I think I was programmed to be a doctor ever since I was a boy. My uncle was an herbalist whose work inspired me to pursue a natural system of medicine. On completing my high school, I researched homeopathy and found it to be a perfect fit for making my career. Treating patients and finding solutions for them is not only my (passion) profession but also my mission. My deep yearning to find out solutions for chronic lingering cases not getting better with long-term homeopathic treatment got me into doing research by introducing new remedies in homeopathy. Conducting research also satisfies my creativity and ability to innovate. It's like meditation for me! - Where did you learn homeopathic medicine? Since when are you practicing homeopathy? Dr Rajesh Shah: I graduated in homeopathy from CMPH Medical College, under Bombay University in 1984 and did master's in 2005. I have been in practice since 1985. Yes, pretty long time! For the last 35 years, I've studied, practiced, taught, promoted, dreamt and breathed homeopathy! - You are engaged in the organization of the World Homeopathy Summit 2015 (WHS), to be held in Mumbai on April 11th - 12th. What called for this summit? Dr Rajesh Shah: WHS is my dream coming true. Let me give you some background. Being scientifically oriented, I was a big skeptic of homeopathy myself. I became fully aware of the limitations and gaps in homeopathy science. Also, I got engaged in serious research since 1998. I have realized that homeopathy would find its deserving position only if it's supported by scientific research. I observed that many (read most!) homeopaths have blind faith in homeopathy and lack scientific attitude. Also, fortunately, there are scientists who have conducted fundamental research with high dilution medicines and documented its existence as well as the effects. However, homeopaths, conventional doctors, and the common public do not seem to know about such research in homeopathy. As a result, homeopathy's acceptance is still limited. World Homeopathy Summit is a step towards filling the gap between scientific research and the homeopathy profession. WHS has been designed to bring major research conducted in the last 15 years to the profession and the media. This will benefit the homeopaths, other doctors, teachers, scientists, policymakers and all. I personally believe that WHS will change the way people would approach homeopathy. -Who initiated this event? Dr Rajesh Shah: In fact, WHS is an initiative by Global Homeopathy Foundation, which is formed by a group of committed homeopaths like Dr Eswara Das, Dr Sreevals, Dr Sanghavi, Dr Praveen, myself and others. It's a non-government, non-commercial, non-political organization working purely for the cause of homeopathy. MsEla Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter is one of our patrons. - This promises to be an outstanding event with many of the contemporary greats of homeopathy confirmed as speakers at the conference...what is the focus, what are the aims and objectives of this summit? Dr Rajesh Shah: Yes, it's unique in a way that over 25 scientist-speakers from varied streams are gathering for the first time on a common platform in India. Interesting, over 80% of them are not homeopaths but pure-scientists from the areas of molecular biology, pharmacology, nuclear physics, chemical and electrical engineering, nanotechnology, virology, veterinary science, agriculture, zoology, etc. They are from 24 different universities, and all of them have spent many years in fundamental research in homeopathy. Isn't it amazing? The focus is very simple: to prove to the world that that homeopathy is a science. To enhance the confidence of homeopaths in practice, to encourage conventional doctors to integrate homeopathy in practice, to motivate scientists to conduct much more research, to influence government policymakers and to promote homeopathy benefits to the masses. WHS is a step in that direction. - The topics to be discussed are varied. Some insights are expected from which topics? Dr Rajesh Shah: In fact, WHS is a bouquet full of diverse topics. Nanotechnologists will demonstrate Nanoparticle in homeopathy dilutions, breaking an age-old myth of homeopathy as energy medicine. Pharmacologist will demonstrate the effects of medicines in animal models. Clinical trials will show proven effects of homeopathy for diseases such as HIV, Cancer, atopic disorders, Hemophilia and more. Nuclear physics and electrical engineering will give evidence of the measurability of the effects of high dilutions beyond Avogadro's number. Cell line studies will prove the effects of medicine outside of the human body. And more. This conference will help us break our own fixed ideas, and look beyond. - The creation of awareness is undoubtedly a focus of such a reputable event. Who, other than the homeopathic community, do you aim to reach? Dr Rajesh Shah: As said before, at one go, we intend to reach out to homeopaths, conventional doctors, teachers, scientists, pharmaceuticals, policymakers, media, and the masses. WHS is intended to benefit all. - What are your hopes that visitors of the event go away with after the summit? What is the vision to be spread? Dr Rajesh Shah: I don't want to sound over-promising, but I personally believe that WHS will change the way homeopathy will be looked at in the future. It is likely to change homeopaths' perception. It will create fresh interest in homeopathy. It may attract scientists to explore unknown aspects of homeopathy science. Homeopathy science, in my opinion, is primitive, calling for exploration. I will be happy if at least 10 scientists undertake some new research projects after WHS. - Rajesh, tell us something about your practice. You seem to have a unique practice of treating patients from across the world. How has this happened? Dr Rajesh Shah: Well, my practice has evolved over the last 30 years. Somehow, patients started coming to me from all over the world, I don't know why! Maybe because many of them got improved with homeopathy and they spread a word. I believe that there is a profound scope for homeopathy practice. People world over are looking out for alternatives; and homeopathy is the best alternative to mainstream medicine, especially in the treatment of chronic and recurring diseases. Getting to treat patients from over 180 countries brings with its a high level of responsibility. My involvement in research and developing newer homeopathic medicines is the result of high-expectations by my patients - What is your personal message to the homeopathic community worldwide? Dr Rajesh Shah: Due to my involvement in homeopathy as an activist, global doctor, researcher and teacher, I've observed that there is a profound scope for homeopaths to improve their outlook and every homeopath must have a highly scientific outlook. Hahnemann kept himself updated up to the age of 88 years! We got stuck there! We refuse to go beyond what Hahnemann has written. Homeopathy is not a religion but science; so let's learn to practice the science of homeopathy. Shah At the Riga conferenceFrans van Rooijeninformally met a leading Indian homeopath, Dr Rajesh Shah, MD. Fransgatheredsome insight into the very professional way of Rajesh' homeopathic practice, PR, and research. Rajesh works as a medically trained homeopath since 1985. He and his wife Rupal have a homeopathic center called Life Force in Mumbai. Interestingly, Rajesh has been deeply involved in, what he calls as 'four pillars of my work', viz. practice, research, training homeopaths, and homeopathy promotion. He is a thorough professional homeopath; which can be understood by the fact that his clinic is a corporate entity. He has several teams of professionals working for him, giving shape to his vision; which includes not only 30 full-time homeopaths but also engineers (IT), management and finance graduates, conventional medical researchers as well. Rajesh works with his teams for his four pillars of work, which he emphasizes, are interlinked. Talking about his homeopathic practice, Rajesh receives patients from not only from all across India but also from all the continents. Rajesh is the homeopath who treats patients from the highest number of countries; from 177 different countries. He treats doctors, scientists, film-stars, poor people as well as the family of the past-president of the US. Rajesh contributes to the global spread of success to invent the Internet. He has almost pioneered online homeopathic (medical) practice since 1995, which is now followed by many practitioners. Science By communicating with Rajesh, I realized that he is a homeopathy scientist. He does not believe in whimsical methods of prescribing which are based on individual interpretation of cases. He showed concern about the rising of non-scientific methods, which, according to him are responsible for the non-acceptance of homeopathy today. Rajesh says that 'uncertainty' is the biggest challenge that we have in homeopathy. \"How can we use fancy methods of prescribing which escalate uncertainty?\" he asks. He works mostly with the polychrests. \"With two hundred to two hundred fifty remedies we can cure 80% of the clients,\" he states. Research in homeopathy using conventional medical research methods in the area of interest for Rajesh. At Life Force, he has some ongoing clinical trials. All the cases treated at his clinic are scientifically documented, and statistics are generated. On the homeopathic treatment of Vitiligo, for instance, he has convincing research on 4500 cases. Interestingly, Rajesh is working on some new homeopathic medicines and he has been granted patents for his research work. Two of his 'gifts', as he calls it, to the world is HIV and Hepatitis C nosodes. He has also developed a scientific and revised method of nosode preparation, which he presented at the Riga Conference. Rajesh has conducted seminars in many countries. Due to his pre-occupation with practice and research, he has stopped teaching for the last ten years. Promotion of homeopathy The promotion of homeopathy is one of his interests. He has launched 25 websites discussing the role of homeopathy for various diseases. For instance, urticaria.com, lichenplanus.com, e-psoriasis.com, etc. (Check the complete list at www.RajeshShah.com) It is fascinating to learn that anyone can ask for free advise on the role of homeopathy for ones ailment to Rajesh's team of doctors. He and his team have given free advice on homeopathy to over a million people since the birth of the Internet. There are some self-assessment tools, presentations, etc. developed by his in-house IT team. If you are a Mac user, you can download AskDrShah, a mobile (iPhone, iPad) application, offering information about homeopathy. Life Force is a paperless clinic. The entire case-taking and data storage is online. Remarkably, every patient treated by Rajesh has an online account with Life Force, which the patient can access anytime. The account has all the medical information, scanned medical reports, disease photos, etc. which can be accessed by Rajesh, his doctors, other staff as well as the patients, from any computer or mobile phone. Every patient has to sign up a contract for treatment of at least 4 to 12 months, paying in advance; which allows enough time to produce results. He works on difficult and challenging but not critical (severely acute) cases. Rajesh says, \"The strength of homeopathy is not acute or critical conditions such as severe infections, renal failure, cerebral malaria, etc. Homeopathy is more effective for chronic and recurring diseases such as asthma, lichen planus, urticaria, migraines, psoriasis, frequent tonsillitis, fibromyalgia, etc. Any homeopath can consult me for professional help for one's patients. Homeopaths need to define the scope and limitations of homeopathy, for better success rate.\" I asked Rajesh to give some tips on how to make successful practices. \"What I can say based on my experience is that if you want success for yourself; you will have to work for the system (homeopathy). You cannot get success in seclusion. Homeopathy is passing through a struggling phase, simply due to a lack of scientific teachings and research. Broad vision, scientific attitude, sound medical knowledge, full-time commitment to the practice, use of technology, and honesty can make homeopaths successful.\" He further says, \"Homeopaths need to enhance their own confidence in homeopathy by applying scientific methods to obtain predictable results in most cases, by almost all homeopaths. This, in turn, will help patients have more confidence in homeopaths; leading to more success in practice. Try to make professional setup in your clinic, be available for long hours, (8 hours a day, ideally), making homeopathy as a full-time career, for better success.\" Rajesh can be contacted for new drug discovery regulation in homeopathy - An interview with Dr Rajesh Shah Dr Rajesh Shah is a well-known homeopath, researcher, and teacher and Director of Life Force Homeopathy in Mumbai, India. He is a pioneer of online practice and has treated patients from 180 countries. He has developed many new homeopathic medicines, including those from biological sources such as HIV nosode, Hepatitis C nosode, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis nosode, and more. He has also conducted double-blind, placebo-controlled Drug Provings, Clinical trials, experiments in animal models, as well as in-vitro studies with many new homeopathic medicines, doing this in collaboration with reputed institutions such as Haffkine Institute, ICT (UDCT), IITB, etc. He has introduced a scientific method of development of nosodes. His research papers are published in peer-reviewed, international journals. He has authored several books, including A New Approach to Homeopathic Prescribing\". He is one of the founders and Organizing Secretary of the Global Homeopathy Foundation, which conducted the World Homeopathy Summit in India in April 2015. He is on the advisory committees of CCRH under the Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India. Dr. Rajesh has initiated a petition to the Minister, AYUSH for setting up a mechanism for new drug discovery in homeopathy. The petition can be signed and supported at [http://chn.ge/2cy7asI](http://chn.ge/2cy7asI) 01 Dr. Shah, welcome to Hpathy! You are the epicenter of the movement to create guidelines for introducing new homeopathic remedies in our pharmacopeias and Materia Medica, especially in India. Why and when did you feel the need to raise this issue on a wider scale? Dr. Rajesh Shah: Thank you, Dr. Manish for this interaction. I must start by saying that new drug discovery in homeopathy has been a neglected area, not only in India but also across the world. While I started working on developing new drugs in 1998, it was also observed that there were many issues in the making of old drugs as well, which needed to be addressed. If homeopathy has to stand up as a scientific system of medicine, the core sector of drug development would need serious attention. As a strategic move, my initial focus is on the new drug discovery; eventually, we shall also look into the challenges with the old or existing drugs in the materia medica. If you want to know how my journey of new drug discovery started, I must say that it started with the first nosode of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (initial version) developed in 1998. To my surprise, the old nosode Tuberculinum was made around 1880, which was found to be 'not reproducible'! The fact of 'nonreproducibility' of our nosodes was intimidating news to me that opened the windows and doors to my future journey in this space.

Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, the organizing secretary, who is also a practitioner, researcher, and teacher, speaks his mind about the international conference, which will have about 24 speakers from 8 countries, coming together for the first time ever in India. Dr Shah emphasizes that homeopathy will not survive without research. 01 Congratulations on the formation of Global Homoeopathy Foundation. Can you give an insight into forming the foundation, its objectives, and goals? Dr Rajesh Shah: Thank you, Dr Gouri. Global Homeopathy Foundation (GHF) is formed by a few of the senior homeopaths, whom I would call homeopathy activists willing to contribute to the profession, give something back to the profession. GHF is a non-political, non-government, non-profit making entity simply working for the elevation of the profession. The major focus of GHF would be to support the growth in the areas of education, research, and promotion of homeopathy. 02 Within a few months of forming the foundation, it is indeed a herculean effort to organize an international conference of this stature. Congratulations on being the Organizing Secretary of the conference too. How is it shaping up? Dr Rajesh Shah: Thanks for the compliments. Yes, the World Homeopathy Summit (WHS) is getting organized in a slight hurry. Actually, we wanted to focus on the most burning and basic issues. Through brainstorming sessions within our group, we collectively identified the need to 1. Boost the confidence of the homeopaths and students 2. Highlight the importance of scientific research for the growth of homeopathy, and 3. Improve media perception about the scientific side of homeopathy. We also realized that there was significant research conducted in many parts of the world, including India. However, there is a disconnect between scientific work and the homeopath's orientation. The WHS is a step towards filling up the gap. The WHS is expected to serve several purposes such as showcasing to the homeopaths the outcome of research in different areas, motivating them to have a scientific approach, encouraging the younger generation to get involved in research, heighten the conviction of homeopaths about the science of homeopathy, motivate other scientists to conduct more research, spread positive message about homeopathy through media. It is about a month (10th December) since we started the preparation. Yes, it is going great! 03 In a short span of time, how do you propose to reach out to over 1000 delegates? Dr Rajesh Shah: Well, at GHF we believe in saving paper and saving ecology. We have decided not to waste much paper in the form of brochures. We shall use electronic media, the Internet, and mobile media. It is amazing that in seven days' time, there are 36 Whatsapp groups discussing the event! Anyone can join the Whatsapp group by sending us a message to any of the groups or to +91.9930790804. Through this channel, we intend to keep updating those interested in research in homeopathy. 04 Who is all coming to the Summit and how did you manage to get speakers from diverse fields? Dr Rajesh Shah: As you must have seen on the GHF website (www.globalhomeopathyfoundation.com) and in our communications, about 24 scientist-speakers from eight countries, including India, have agreed to come to share their research work. It was a task to identify them and bring them together. Interestingly, the speakers are from distinct areas such as molecular biology, pharmacology, chemical engineering, physics, nuclear medicine, and homeopathy. They have done fundamental research examining homeopathy from different angles, which is very interesting. We have Prof Paulo Bellavita from Italy who will talk about his work on the effects of medicines invoking sensitivity to bio-electromagnetic information, the participation of water chains in signaling, and regulation of bifurcation points of systemic networks. Prof. Sathaye will talk about the anti-inflammatory effects of homeopathy in the animal model. Dana Ullman of the USA will talk about evidence-based experiments in the treatment of allergies. Prof. Michael Frass from Austria will share his experience in cancer treatment with homeopathy supported by controlled studies. Likewise, Prof Gustav Bracho from Cuba, who is famous for his work in the treatment of Leptospirosis will share a new perspective. Dr Prashanth Banerjee will talk about cancer cell line study. Similarly, Dr Joshi from TIFR, Dr Bellare from IIT-B, Dr Jindal from BARC, etc. will give a newer perspective to homeopathy. There are over 20 such papers, a power-packed event! I must say that the speakers and the topics are really diverse; which will enlighten the delegates to have a completely novel perspective about homeopathy. 05 Homeopathy has always faced challenges and what are the issues you would like to address at this conference? Dr Rajesh Shah: Homeopathy is one of the youngest sciences. Unfortunately, due to inadequate research, it has attracted criticism. Criticism is due to us! Using this conference as a forum, we would like to educate the homeopaths about the recent scientific updates and convey the message to the public about the scope of homeopathy as scientific medicine. Some of the speakers will share their research proving the effects of high-dilution medicines in various models such as cell-line, animal model as well as human trials. 06 As far as homeopathic education is concerned there is a gap and lack of professional approach. In such a scenario, how do we expect our science to grow? Do you feel this conference has a suggestion to make in this regard? Dr Rajesh Shah: This is a big subject. I personally believe, that, the faculty in each college should have a strong scientific basis so that the students could be trained accordingly. The GHF's contribution through this conference would be an attempt to sensitize the practitioners, teachers, and students to bring a shift in their thought process. 07 It may not be to our liking but homeopathy is still concerned unscientific through major countries. We need research not just from the clinicians but also from pure sciences. Would the conference share the platform for these ideas? Dr Rajesh Shah: This is due to a lack of research. The WHS will have scientists from pure sciences, as I said earlier, sharing their research in homeopathy, expanding the horizon for scientific understanding. To give you an example, we have scientists from IIT-Bombay, BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Center), ICT (Institute of Chemical Technology), TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), Haffkine institute, Bose institute, etc. who have done research in homeopathy. They are not homeopaths, but scientists, sharing a common platform. 08 The best part of homeopathy is that there are several ways to arrive at a prescription. Would WHS be a platform for one or more of such protocols? Dr Rajesh Shah: WHS is not proposing any treatment protocol. The role of WHS and GHF is to encourage and promote the growth of homeopathy. At this point, the focus is to create a scientific spirit among homeopaths and students. 09 What do you want the students, clinicians, academicians, researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, and the thinkers of homeopathy to take from the conference? Dr Rajesh Shah: There are distinct messages for each of them. The students will go home with a science-torch to review each aspect of homeopathy; they will benefit immensely. The clinicians will have heightened confidence in managing a range of diseases, with evolved thought process. They will be able to win the confidence of patients more than ever before. They will learn about some newly developed medicines and their application in practice. The researchers will have new modalities to consider and apply their knowledge and skill in homeopathy research. The pharmaceutical people will learn clues about new drug-discovery methods, which will also motivate them to allocate funds for research. And, the policymakers will identify the need to modify certain systems and processes. 10 There have been regular international conferences through other fora but the usual criticism is that nothing is done afterward. How different is WHS going to be? Dr Rajesh Shah: The conference is just a platform for sharing. The conference cannot do the follow-up. Homeopathic organizations or institutes have to design suitable programs. 11 More often than not our allopathic brethren are supportive of our system but not very aware of the science. Would there be an effort to associate open-minded specialists as invitees at the summit? Dr Rajesh Shah: We are going to invite several conventional doctors who are open to learning about recent developments in homeopathic research. Through this interview, I invite doctors from all specialties to attend the conference. IN fact, this conference is open to anyone with an open mind to explore homeopathy. 12 What are the likely innovations at the summit that would enhance the confidence of the common man with regard to homeopathy? Dr Rajesh Shah: In fact, several. For the common man, the WHS will send a clear message that the use of homeopathy has been proved in in-vitro and in-vivo models. The clinical trials in a controlled environment have shown the efficacy of homeopathy. It will also hint that the nature of homeopathic medicine is comprising of nano-particles, which could be evaluated using certain gadgets, laser beams, and have definite effects even in animal models. The common man will feel assured that there is research happening in homeopathy; which will help win his confidence. 13 The CCH, CCRH are the bodies that have under their purview the maximum number of homeopathic hospitals, dispensaries, colleges, practitioners on their rolls. Their potential is immense for the turnaround of homeopathy. What would the summit advise to them? Dr Rajesh Shah: The WHS has technical collaboration with CCRH. The message likely to emerge from WHS could be that CCH should especially encourage scientific research in every college, train the faculties to take up research projects, and engage students in the development of homeopathy. India has an unbelievable perspective for the growth of homeopathy as it has over 180 homeopathic colleges, provided the potential is strategically exploited. The message is very clear, that, homeopathy will not survive without research. Nowhere in the world, you will find such an institution with such a large infrastructure and government support which CCRH enjoys. Also, there is a need for well-defined protocols for research in homeopathy in India. CCRH under AYUSH should have easy to follow methods for new drug discovery, which is lacking at this point. There have been some welcome changes that happened at CCRH, for example, peer-reviewed journal IJRH. Suitable reforms and policies will be required to be made, which, I am confident that CCRH will work upon in due course. Encouraging and nourishing research by homeopaths and students must be encouraged, in Homeopathic remedies are nano-medicines administered in micro doses to stimulate the body's healing powers. These remedies contain potent energies, which treat the symptoms and cure the diseases at a deeper level. Is homeopathy a scientific theory? How does it differ from herbal medicine or Ayurveda? The major difference is that homeopathy does not use any material substance. It treats the underlying causes of illness rather than addressing outward symptoms. Herbal medicine is based on the use of pure constituents from plants and the biological response varies directly to the dose or concentration of the remedy. Ayurveda, a more traditional (and older) treatment, uses various alternative forms of healing such as herbs and chemicals along with physical elements such as yoga and massage. Many believe homeopathy is quacks' theory but FYI, it's supported by WHO and practiced in over 100 countries. It is approved by the US, European FDA, and the Indian DCGI. So does homeopathy cure it all? For what ailments would you NOT recommend homeopathy? Diseases can be divided into two categories to understand the scope of homeopathy: Chronic and recurring: Homeopathy is very effective in these cases and has had considerable success in their treatment (asthma, vitiligo, psoriasis, migraine, eczema and so on). Acute and critical: Homeopathy is less effective in cases requiring urgent attention. Also, the critical nature of conditions such as a heart attack, high fever, severe attack of asthma, severe infection would warrant allopathy. Also, I do not prescribe homeopathy in cases such as malaria, typhoid, and TB as these diseases take long to be treated and usually, allopathy fares better. Homeopathy has its own set of limitations, as does allopathy. I want to take other medications while my homeopathic treatment is underway. Absolutely. Homeopathy, in some cases of diabetes, asthma, arthritis, ulcerative colitis, can be married to allopathy and help in successfully managing the ailments. It is a wrong notion that homeopathy cannot be used in conjunction with other therapies. In our unregulated homeopathy market, how do I trust homeopathic products from my local health food store? How do I even trust a doctor? The Government of India currently manages over 200 homeopathy medical colleges but fails to regulate the thousands of homeopathic manufacturing units. Regarding the products, one needs to look out for properly labeled products. The chances of them being phony these days are low if it is a reputed health food store. A homeopath is just like any other doctor. His qualifications would be the same as those of an allopathic doctor. So, the way one chooses their allopathic doctor (referrals, word of mouth, qualifications, etc), is the same for the manner in which one would choose a homeopathic doctor. Allopathy would give me a quicker solution, right? That homeopathy takes long to cure an ailment is not completely true. Since science is popular for treating chronic (long-standing) diseases, they obviously take time to be cured. For a given nature of the disease, for instance, asthma, homeopathy may take a year-and-half to give lasting results. However, this period is too small compared to many years of suffering if homeopathy is not opted for. For quick solutions, one must opt for homeopathy in the early stage of diseases such as allergies, asthma, eczema, urticaria, ankylosing spondylitis, migraines, etc. If you approach homeopathy as a last resort, it might take longer to take effect because of your already weakened system. What precautions do I take and which side-effects do I consider while taking homeopathy? Homeopathy has no side-effects if professionally prescribed. Contrary to myths, it is extremely rare that a disease intensifies before getting cured. My relative tried homeopathy once didn't see a cure and gave up on it. Would it fail on me too? No system of medicine works all the time. The success or failure of any medicine (including homeopathy) depends largely on the nature of the disease, the body's response to medicine and the strength of the medicine. (Dr Rajesh Shah is MD of Life Force, a Homeopathy portal & editor, Homeopathy if research is not pursued passionately: Dr Rajesh Shah World Homeopathy Summit (WHS), an international conference dedicated to scientific research in homeopathy is getting organized in Mumbai. This is the first of its kind event in India, which is expected to change the perception of homeopathy. Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, Organizing Secretary for the Summit, who is a researcher himself, shares his mind with the readers of NJH, explaining the why, what, and how of the event. He emphasizes that homeopathy will not survive without research. Let us have chai-pe-charcha with Dr Shah, who is the director of Life Force Homeopathy and enjoys an unbeaten position in the Limca book of world records for treating patients from the highest number of countries (now 180) in the world. WHS is scheduled for 11-12 April 2015 in Mumbai at Birla Matushree auditorium, Near Bombay Hospital. NJH: Dr Rajesh, let's start with your campaigning of WHS by using the Whatsapp channel. How did you think of using Whatsapp as a medium? Dr Rajesh Shah (RS): Yes, there are over 80 Whatsapp groups started in the last three weeks across the country as well as in other countries talking about WHS (World Homeopathy Summit). You see, the whole idea is to stimulate the minds of homeopaths and students about the need for change in the way homeopathy is looked at. Social media is a great thread to connect with the target audience and kindle thought process. Also, we at Global Homeopathy Foundation (GHF) have decided not to use papers and to save ecology. NJH: Tell us about Global Homeopathy Foundation and its purpose. RS: After having an active involvement in homeopathy for 15 to 40 years, about six homeopaths from different parts of India decided to put hands together to work for homeopathy, taking it to its next level. Dr Eswara Das (New Delhi), Dr SreevalsMenon, Dr Sait, Dr Kanan (Kerala), Dr Jayesh Sanghvi from Chennai, and myself decided to put hands together and founded GHF. We are fortunate to have MsEla Gandhi (Gandhiji's granddaughter), Mr Nambiar (retired IAS officer), MrDangayach (director, Sintex) as our patrons. And, we have found that there are hundreds of professionals who are willing to work for the common cause, that is homeopathy. The vision of GHF is to work strategically to boost the position of homeopathy, by supporting research, education, and promotion. WHS is the first step in that direction. NJH: How did you conceive WHS and what is it all about? RS: Well, as you are aware, there is a lot of negative publicity in the media about homeopathy, lately. Homeopathy has been criticized as a non-science system, especially in the UK and Australia. This wave may affect India anytime. We realized that the criticism about homeopathy is simply due to the fact that it is getting distanced from science. This is because of inadequate research. Personally, I am involved in organized research for over 15 years. I have firmly believed that homeopathy will not survive if research is not pursued passionately. In retrospect, we observed that there is definite scientific research in many parts of the world. However, this research has not reached to the media, homeopaths, conventional doctors, and the masses. As a result, there is a gap. Also, this gap is responsible for the lack of confidence among young homeopaths about the science of homeopathy. So, as a first step, we decided to bring as much original research as possible from all over, and showcase them to the homeopathy professionals, students, and the media. I am happy to say that we could persuade over 25 scientists-speakers from 9 countries (Austria, Brazil, Cuba, India, Italy, Nederland, France, UK, US,) to come together for the first time in the history of homeopathy, that too, in India! That is WHS. NJH: That's amazing. Please tell me more... RS: Yes, it's incredible that in a short time so many of them agreed to present papers on fundamental research in homeopathy and to share how we could benefit from their work. This conference will be a great learning forum for all of us. NJH: So, are the speakers' homeopaths? RS: Interestingly, about 80% of them are not homeopaths! They are basic scientists from the areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, pharmacology, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, molecular biologist, proteomics, etc. And, they have worked on homeopathy research! Isn't it astonishing? NJH: How is it that such scientists do research in homeopathy? Why should they be interested in homeopathy? RS: Well, this question is coming to us because we have forgotten that homeopathy is a science! Research in any medical field is done by scientists and not by practitioners. Even in conventional medicine (allopathy), research is done by molecular biologists, pharmacologists, biomedical engineers and the like; not really by the doctors. NJH: In that case, what is the relevance of such research to the practitioners? How will it help the homeopaths in practice? RS: Good question! The research in homeopathy can change the way we have been applying homeopathy in practice. Since most of us are not simply unaware of the recent advances in homeopathy research, our approach tends to be a bit old-fashioned and rigid. The latest research can help us to think differently. For example, the research done by IIT-B can change the very belief that homeopathic medicines contain energy. The breakthrough research by IIT-B engineers has compelled us to think very differently. Likewise, the investigators will share many such path-breaking outcomes. NJH: Will there be anything for the clinicians? After all, we have to go back to the clinic and treat patients! How would research help in practice? RS: I am also a full-time practitioner; and also a researcher. I have understood that only research and the scientific approach can bring more success in practice. WHS has a lot for practitioner-speakers. The diseases which will be touch-based at WHS will include cancer, hemophilia, eczema, atopic diseases, HIV, Hepatitis C, Leishmaniasis, auto-immune diseases, infections, and many more. There will be papers on clinical trials, animal studies, as well as new medicines with their evaluations. I can say that the moment you will reach the clinic after the conference, your approach will likely to be drastically different. NJH: What about scientific research in India? Are there scientists who are engaged in research in homeopathy? RS: You will be amazed to find that scientists from eminent institutions such as TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), BARC, IIT-B, UDCT (ICT), Haffkine Institute, Bose Institute, ICMR, CSIR, etc. are going to present their homeopathy research works! This unprecedented conference will surely change the way homeopathy has been looked at all these years. NJH: Would it be useful to students of homeopathy? RS: let's not forget that we all are students of science. This conference will be a boon for all students (Ph.D., PG, and UG) of homeopathy. They will learn the newer thought process, new technology, new methods, new remedies, and new application. The research-based information will boost their self-confidence as well as reinforce their faith in the system of medicine. This will help them take up good projects, write a grander thesis, and select useful topics for higher studies. WHS is likely to change its language! NJH: Will there be anything for the teachers of homeopathy? RS: In my personal opinion, WHS has come as a blessing for the faculties of all homeopathic colleges; as well as for the principals. How else can you expect to have access to such a huge treasure of information, that too, directly from the mouths of the investigators? The teachers will become much better in their skill-sets after the conference. Also, on a lighter side, if students will attend the WHS, it would be highly embarrassing for the teachers if they would find themselves not updated about the recent advances! Interestedly, there are two colleges where the management has decided to send all of the teachers to WHS. That is the wisest thing the management could do. I also suggest that the homeopathic colleges should also sponsor their allopathic doctor-teachers NJH: Please tell us in brief, what will be the take-home message from WHS? RS: We have chosen the best of the scientists and speakers; about 25 of them! Every scientist has invested at least 3-4 years, which makes about 100 years of accumulated research, after having invested a few million dollars; which is going to be made available to us in two days, right here in Mumbai! What else can be a better treat than this? Simply log into the conference. Introduction: 'World Homeopathy Summit' (WHS), a scientific international conference devoted to recent advances in homeopathy, is happening for the first time in Mumbai, India on 11-12 April 2015. This unique conference will be organized by Global Homeopathy Foundation. Here is an interview with Dr Rajesh Shah, MD, Organising Secretary for the conference, discussing what the conference is all about. Vital Informer: Dr Shah, please tell us something about World Homeopathy Summit (WHS). Why this conference? Dr Rajesh Shah: Well, being a homeopathy researcher I've known that there is significant research in the field. Also, there is criticism about the lack of research. The homeopaths, other doctors, scientists, media and the common public are unaware of the latest research. There is a gap between the homeopaths and the researchers. As a result, homeopaths are not able to use the latest knowledge in their practice. WHS is an effort to bridge this gap. VI: Please tell us who will benefit from WHS? Dr Shah: All those who are connected with homeopathy are going to be benefitted in a huge way. WHS will help senior and junior homeopaths, it will help students, teachers, principals, pharmaceuticals, management of colleges, etc. This will be a mega event for all. No one should miss this opportunity. VI: What will be clinical benefits to the delegates? Would this WHS help the delegates to be better practitioners? VI: Good question! The conference is expected to help immediately to the practitioners, by giving them reliable understanding of the scope of homeopathy for various difficult diseases such as Cancer, Eczema, various infections, HIV, Leptospirosis, Hepatitis C, Hemophilia, etc. More importantly, it will help practitioners boost their faith in the system as well as their self-confidence. It's likely to change the way you looked at homeopathy earlier! VI: Can you tell about the speakers at WHS? Dr Shah: Yes, there will be over 25 speakers from 8 countries including India. The speakers from Italy, Cuba, Brazil, France, USA, Holland, etc are university professors who are coming to India for the first time. Very interestingly, scientists from some of the most prominent Indian institutions such as BARC, IIT-B, TIFR, Haffkine, Bose, ICMR, etc. who have conducted homeopathy research, will be sharing their findings. It's amazing. This will benefit homeopaths immensely. VI: Please tell us who are the people behind WHS? Dr Shah: WHS will be organized by Global Homeopathy Foundation, which is an NGO, non-commercial, non-political organization formed by a group of committed, senior homeopaths. They are Dr Eswara Das (New a Delhi), Dr SreevalsMenon (Cochin), Dr Jayesh Dr Praveen Kumar (Hyderabad) and myself (from Mumbai). We have decided to work for homeopathy upliftment. GHF collaboration with CCRH, HMAI, IHMA, IPRH for the conference. We do not compete with any organization, we would like to collaborate with all those who are working for homeopathy. Anyone can join us as an associate member. VI: What will be the take-home message from the conference? Dr Shah: The delegates will go home with revised faith in the science of homeopathy. Scientific evidence about the nature of homeopathic medicines, their proven efficacy through accepted scientific norms and also some probable mechanism of action will be updated in the conference. The delegates will have a lifetime experience of learning directly from those scientists who have contributed in the growth of homeopathy. It is my assurance that a day after the conference, you will attend your clinic with a totally Bangalore Find your dream job at Life Force!

This obstinate skin condition has bemused not only the affected individuals but also several medical practitioners equally. Lichen planus is a recurring, non-contagious, and non-allergic skin disease. It affects people of any skin color, gender, and race. You may find only a little help from the current medical faculty to tackle this chronic skin ailment. Fortunately, homeopathy, which is an effective alternative medicine experiencing rapid growth, offers a definite, safe, and promising [Lichen Planus](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-treatment.aspx) treatment. The exact cause of Lichen Planus is not yet known. This skin disorder tends to affect various areas of the body, such as skin, scalp, nails, genitals oral mucosa, and tongue. But, the probability that it would affect all these areas of the body at once is less. Often, Lichen Planus happens to reoccur after a period of some years or even months. The frequency of the occurrence of Lichen Planus in females is more as compared to that in the males. However, the occurrence of lichen planus in kids is rare and uncommon. Of the total population, more than 1.9% is known to be affected by this skin ailment. See the typical lesions of lichen planus on the skin in this photo. Get a larger and better view of this photo by clicking it. Signs & Symptoms Of Lichen Planus: There are certain symptoms that indicate lichen planus. Some of the common signs and symptoms of lichen planus are as mentioned below. - Irregular or round raised eruptions (They are a slightly raised above your skin) - Brown, black, or pinkish lesions - Itching present at the affected area/rash. - Bumps or purplish lesions having flat tops on your genitals or skin. - Thin white-colored lines over the rash - [Lichen planus](http://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-diagnosis.aspx) in mouth displays lacy-whitish lesions which may be accompanied by burning sensation or pain. - Lesions that occur & spread over the skin of the body in a few months or weeks. Commonly Affected Parts By Lichen Planus: Lichen Planus largely and prominently affects the skin of the body. Besides the skin, it may affect other areas of your body, such as the scalp, mouth (including the tongue, gums, & palate), nails, or genitals (penis, vulva, glans). One or more of these body areas may get affected by this skin disorder. It's not necessary that all these mentioned body areas would get affected by lichen planus. In females, lichen planus could affect vagina or vulva, while in males it may affect penis' glans. The fact is that the more the body areas affected, the more it is difficult to treat lichen planus. Besides this, [lichen planus in the mouth](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-diagnosis.aspx) and genital lichen planus are more difficult to treat as compared to lichen planus affecting the body skin. When lichen planus affects your scalp, it may cause scarring and may make you suffer from permanent hair loss, which, of course, is quite difficult to treat. Lichen Planus and Hepatitis C: Certain latest medical studies have revealed the occurrence of lichen planus along with a rare type of [Hepatitis C](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/hepatitis-c/). However, the exact causative factor or exact connection is not yet discovered between these two diseases. It is important to note that the patients of Hepatitis C possess some vulnerability to develop the discomfort due to lichen planus, however, the reverse is not true. The typical textbook description goes: The typical appearance of lichen planus occurs with polygonal eruptions which are flat-topped and shiny. You may have few or many spots of this skin disorder on your body that often occur bilaterally symmetrical. The eruptions may be small, thick, oily or rough to touch and appear dirty at times. This is a typical appearance of Lichen Planus as described as Wickham's striae. (Refer to this photo) Under The Microscope: Often, the microscopic view of the Lichen Planus tissues is not known to the patients. Below is the microscopic view of it. Sometimes, you may see eruptions of Lichen Planus present at a scratch mark's line or site of injury. This is called Koebner's phenomenon. It may affect genitals too. In male individuals, it may affect the glans, while in females it may affect the vulva. When the lichen planus affects the nails, they may become deformed. Some of the most common types of lichen planus are those affecting the skin, [lichen planus in mouth](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-diagnosis.aspx) (i.e. oral lichen planus), and vaginal lichen planus. When the genital or oral mucosa gets affected by this skin disorder, the condition is often overlooked, reported quite late, or diagnosed wrongly. One of the rare types of lichen planus is the one affecting the food pipe (i.e. esophagus). Even though it is uncommon, some cases of this condition are reported at some organizations. The best part is that all types of lichen planus respond to the homeopathic treatment for lichen planus very well. Homeopathy provides outstanding results when it is used to treat the lichen planus of skin, genitals, and mouth. So, you can say that homeopathy is an effective [lichen planus cure](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-treatment.aspx) safely without any side-effects. Lichen Planus after stretch marks: One of the recent cases of lichen planus recorded at Life Force had featured the occurrence of this skin condition after stretch marks on weight loss. Such an occurrence of lichen planus is called \u00c3\u00c2 Koebner phenomenon, which signifies the occurrence of lichen planus after your skin experiences trauma. [Click to see the large size photo](https://www.askdrshah.com/manage/Page_Content/lppic4.jpg) Before Treatment After Treatment Causes of Lichen Planus Lichen Planus is known to be an autoimmune disorder. Even though the exact [lichen planus cause](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/default.aspx) is not yet clear, there are certain triggers which are clinically found to cause the development of lichen planus. There are certain theories too which predict the cause of this skin condition. In some cases of lichen planus, there are obvious links that tend to be responsible. Some of them are as follows. 1. Modern Medicines Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAID), amalgamated dental filling, antihypertensive drugs, and some other modern medicines are known to cause lichen planus. And, this skin condition may persist in spite of you stopping the use of these modern medicines. Here is a list of some of the common medicines which may lead to lichen planus. 2. Chemical Contact One may also develop lichen planus after coming in the contact with certain types, such as paraphenylenediamine, Quinacrine, arsenic compounds, and certain metals like Bismuth, gold, and exposure to the light during photography development, etc. 3. Stress Leads to Lichen Planus Detailed studies reveal that prolonged and intense emotional stress, such as traumatic childhood, disappointment, humiliation, anxiety, sadness, failure etc tend to initial lichen planus symptoms. Intense stress & anxiety stimulates certain immunological processes which lead to lichen planus. Even though the exact mechanism causing lichen planus is not yet understood, stress is a prominent trigger in several cases of lichen planus, but not all. This crucial information is obtained from the study conducted at our center & it may not be present in other standard dermatological material. 4. Genetic Causes: Hereditary is one of the prominent causes of lichen planus. We have noticed that this skin disorder runs in the family. But, it's not a standard rule that if you happen to suffer from lichen planus, your kids too will get it. Also, it's not an established rule that every lichen planus patient must have their relatives or parents the same disease. It's been noticed that autoimmune disease like Lichen Planus present in a family then it is suggestive of a genetic link. 5. Allergic Component: Certain medical studies have revealed that the presence of peculiar cells known as HLA A-3 cell markers indicates allergic & immunological links leading to Lichen Planus. It Planus Symptoms symptoms](https://www.askdrshah.com/app /lichen-planus/default.aspx) can surface on your skin, scalp, nails, mouth, or genitals in one or many ways as mentioned below. - Gradual onset - Irregular, round, thick, dark, flat-topped lesions on the skin - Eruptions can be brown, pink, reddish, or gray in color. They are rough, raised above the surface of the skin with mild scaling. - The appearance of the lesions is oily. - The lesions may bleed on scratching. - It may itch intensely or not itch at all. - The scratched or injured skin may experience the development of new lesions according to Koebner's phenomenon. - The burning sensation occurs in the mouth while consuming spicy food. - Lichen planus affecting the nails may cause deformed, ridged nails. - Oral lichen planus (lichen planus in the comes with white streaks on your mouth's mucosa, gums, and tongue. You may get ulcers, which may be mild or extensive, in any part of the mouth in the oral mucosa. - The occurrence of white streaks or ulcers on the prepuce, the shaft of penis, vagina, or vulva are symptoms of genital lichen planus, which is painful in both the sexes. Diagnosis of Lichen Planus Experienced eyes can easily diagnose Lichen Planus clinically. The typical appearance of skin lesions of this skin disorder as mentioned in the symptoms and their presence on the legs, nails, back, mouth, genitals, scalp, and on other parts of the body is crucial while diagnosing it. Lesions of lichen planus are peculiarly grayish, pinkish, or silvery eruptions of about 1 to 4 mm in size, round, irregular, or oval in shape, and itchy and scaly. In the initial stages of this disease, the eruptions may resemble other skin ailments, such as psoriasis, candidiasis (in the mouth), atopic dermatitis, (mouth) aphthous ulcers, leukoplakia (affecting the mouth). If you are doubtful about the diagnosis, a biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is often suggested in the cases of the scalp and oral lichen planus. Besides this, lichen planus of nails too may resemble fungus infection affecting the nails or psoriatic nails. Clinically experienced eyes can easily differentiate and diagnose them appropriately in most cases. Also, lichen planus affecting the scalp may present scarring by the time the affecting individual seeks treatment. So, going for a biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis of scalp lichen planus. Also, it may be associated with loss of hair known as alopecia areata. Before Treatment After Treatment Before Treatment After Treatment Homeopathy Treatment for Lichen Planus Even though skin, scalp, mouth, nail, and genitals are affected by lichen planus, this skin disorder has its roots in the immune system which is regulated by certain genetic aspects. So, [lichen planus treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-treatment.aspx) should focus on correcting and enhancing the immune system of the affected patient. If this is achieved, this skin disorder can be cured or treated for a long period. Superficially treated lichen planus by applying immunosuppressive medicines or cortisone will only result in resurfacing or relapsing of the disease as soon as the effect of such medicines is over. Fortunately, homeopathy provides highly effective, scientifically documented, and research-proven treatment for tackling lichen planus. Unlike allopathic treatment where cortisone is used treatment for lichen planus is excellently curative, longer-lasting, and quite safe. At Life Force, we have carried out research on Lichen Planus for more than two decades. The Homeopathy Treatment Lichen Planus is treated with homeopathy by considering the individual case study of every other patient, its cause, the affected body area, its spread, mindset, and emotional aspects, genetic tendencies, and many other factors specific to each patient. Homeopathic treatment for lichen planus is designed to correct the disturbed immune system of the patient and treating the disorder from within. Dr. Rajesh Shah, M.D. has carried out outstanding research on Lichen Planus for more than 27 years. Patients of Lichen planus worldwide avail of his unique homeopathic treatment protocol to get relief. His research-based molecules have been granted the patent in the US & Europe. Today, patients from about 177 nations are under Dr. Shah's treatment & care and it's a world record. And, [Lichen Planus cure](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/lichen-planus/lichenplanus-treatment.aspx) is certainly possible now. The Duration Of Treatment: The span of homeopathic treatment for lichen planus may differ from patient to patient based on the factors mentioned below. - Affected body areas (whether its skin, scalp, mouth, nails, or genitals) - Duration of the disease - The extent of spread (whether only one part or many parts are affected) - Medication used previously (Extensive use of cortisone may delay recovery requiring more duration) - Associated ailments & general health of the patient You may get a significant improvement in your condition in about three to five months of the treatment, depending on the extent of disease. The total duration of treatment may vary from 6 months to 2 years or even longer.

It is characterized by oval grayish-brown marks that appear on the neck and face or limbs and trunk with the absence of the inflammatory phase. Causes Of Lichen Planus Pigmentosa: The exact cause of Lichen Planus Pigmentosa is not yet clear.

Also, sporadic spots or some scattered spots or large patches may occur in bilateral symmetrical areas due to it. The patches of lichen planus pigmentosa can be big or small and they may spread or remain steady. Generally, the affected individual suffers minimal or no itching. Unlike lichen planus, there are no elevated lesions or eruptions. In about 30% of cases of lichen planus pigmentosus, genetic predisposition happens to be the cause. It occurs in females and males equally, and it is more common in aged individuals and young adults. Lichen Planus pigmentosa does not make you suffer from any major discomfort, the prominent concern being cosmetic. Face, neck, and arms are some of the most commonly affected body areas. Diagnosis: Upon the proper examination of the affected skin, a trained physician can easily diagnose it. A biopsy can confirm it. Conventional Treatment: The conventional mode of treatment for lichen planus pigmentosa mostly includes the use of local cortisone. Homeopathic Treatment: Homeopathy is the most effective and safest treatment for lichen planus pigmentosa, which evolves over a long span of time and tends to respond slowly to treatment. Homeopathic treatment when followed for a long duration offers you outstanding results, regulates the spread of this skin condition, curbs the disease activity, and reverses the occurred hyperpigmentation to a certain extent. Even though complete recovery from hyperpigmentation may not happen in most of the cases of lichen planus pigmentosa, you can achieve great control over it.

The global patients vary from poor families from countries like Ethiopia to the family of the ex-president of the United States. Besides his teaching visits to countries and his articles in international periodicals, the Internet has played a major role in helping his patients find him directly. He has started [Homeopathy Information Cell](contact-us.aspx) a unique interactive service on the Internet.\" Excerpts from Limca Book of Records, 2003; Over the period of the last 18 years, Dr. Rajesh Shah has been communicating with the people through various media to spread the message of homeopathy. \"I am a homeopathy activist,\" says Dr. Shah.

[\"Homeopathy treatment just a click away\": Dr Rajesh Shah story in India's most leading newspaper, The Economic Times,](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Starting_Up/Homeopathy_treatment_just_a_click_away/articleshow/2863288.cms) Homeopathy Doctor in Lokhandwala, Andheri Homeopathy Doctor in Malleswaram, Bangalore Medicine instruction for patients registered at Life Force Instructions about medicine - The medicine should be taken into the mouth directly from the lid of the bottle to avoid any skin contact. Please put the said number of pills on your tongue and chew or suck them. - Please do not eat anything for 10 minutes before and after the medicine. - Since the medicine is absorbed from the mucosa of mouth, please avoid garlic, onions, tobacco, smoking etc. for at least half an hour before and after the medicine. - In case of kids or infants, the pills may be dissolved in a teaspoon of plain water and given orally. - Please note that the smell and taste of medicine might get altered after a few weeks, which does not affect its efficacy. - The medicine can be taken on empty stomach as well after food. - If you are already taking medication for some other ailment such as for blood-pressure, diabetes, etc., please do not discontinue them without medical advice. It is safe to take conventional (allopathic) and homeopathic medicines together, if indicated, but keeping a gap of about 20 minutes between them. - Please keep the medicines out of reach of childre - . - Multiminicore muscular dystrophy is a genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting the skeletal muscles. It usually gets evident in infancy or early childhood as the child has a muscular weakness. It is characterized by spinal rigidity, the excessive curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and respiratory impairments. Cause The major cause which is pointed out in half of the cases of multiminocore muscular dystrophy is a genetic error in the SEPN1 and RYR1 genes. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive pattern which means that both the parents must carry the genetic error to affect their child. Although the parents remain asymptomatic. There are four subgroups of minicore myopathy 1) Classic form 2) Progressive form with hand involvement 3) Antenatal form with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 4) Ophthalmoplegic form Clinical features The classic form commonest group accounts for 75% of minicore myopathy. The onset is usually at birth or at the initial few months after birth. It presents the following symptoms 1) Muscular weakness and delay in achieving the motor milestones (walking, talking, speech, etc.) 2) Some infants have a problem in feeding, hence a feeding tube is usually required 3) Generalized weakness, but weakness around the neck muscles and trunk is more severe 4) Excessive curvature of the spine (scoliosis) is common 5) Underdeveloped respiratory muscles causing breathing difficulty Diagnosis Muscle biopsy is the basis for diagnosing this disorder. Multiple structures called \"cores\" can be seen in the muscle fibers under the microscope. CPK levels are usually normal. Prognosis The progression of this condition may vary among individuals. In some people, the condition may remain static while in others the muscle weakness may be progressive. In patients with a classic form of myopathy, scoliosis may be progressive which leads to a decline in respiratory function. It has been noted that most of the cases become stable in late childhood and many people continue to walk in adulthood in spite of scoliosis. At Life Force, we have recorded one case of a 13-year-old boy with multiminicore muscular dystrophy (Patient identification number: 33986). He was diagnosed at the age of three years when his parents observed neck tilting at one side. After consulting a neurosurgeon, a muscle biopsy was advised where it was confirmed to be a case of SEPN1 mutation. The parents and patient's brother were also screened for the same who were found to be carriers of the SEPN1 gene, though asymptomatic. The CPK levels were normal. The child presented with the following symptoms - Progressive scoliosis but could walk independently without any support. - Muscle tone was reduced due to which there was slowness in his movement. Slow chewing and complete mouth opening were difficult. - He was using a face mask due to breathlessness whenever he required it. - Gastrostomy was done since there was difficulty in swallowing food. A feeding tube was inserted from where food was introduced. - Reflux oesophagitis - Frequent cough and cold - Pulmonary hypertension - Used reading glasses for near vision. Conventional treatment There is hardly any promising treatment specifically for this condition. Symptomatic management is the main course of treatment. Treatment of scoliosis through exercise and corrective surgery is advised. A face mask is advised for a patient having breathing difficulties. To prevent choking during swallowing a feeding tube is advised to give food and fluids directly into the stomach. Homeopathic treatment Homeopathy aims at preventing and controlling the further progress of the disease through certain medicines. There are medicines that have an affinity towards the neuromuscular system that help in controlling the further deterioration of muscles and nerves. Homeopathic treatment is more of a supportive therapy that is administered to improve the general health condition of the patient thereby improving his immunity and resistance towards recurrent infections. The progressive muscular weakness could be slowed down and the quality of life of the patient could hence be improved. Homeopathy Doctor in Mulund Facts and Myths many homeopaths have! by Dr Rajesh Shah, MD This write-up was written by Dr Shah for a Facebook post, in response to some discussion on the myths. Many homeopaths appreciated it; so it is reproduced. Homeopaths across the world have different myths about homeopathy. The myths about homeopathy are many; affecting not only the patients or laypeople but also many homeopaths! While interacting with homeopaths, students as well as teachers in many countries, I have observed some common myths. Some of them have been described here. Myths about any scientific faculty are simply suggestive of a lack of development and research. Each of the myths can be discussed in detail and can help throw light on the corrective thinking required at various levels. It is likely that some of the myths might be considered as 'rules' or 'basic understanding' in homeopathy by some... It is normal to think that way! Readers are welcome to discuss and explore learning. The purpose of this write-up is only to stimulate the grey cells of the professional homeopaths. Following are some of the most prevalent myths: 01. All diseases are curable by homeopathy if symptoms agree. 02. Homeopathy has no limitations, only homeopaths have. 03. Constitutional medicine if correctly chosen, can cure 'any' disease at any stage. 04. All diseases are caused by my emotions or mental attributes. 05. If the remedy matches the mental symptoms of the patient, it does not need to match the physical (disease) symptoms. 06. If the remedy is repeated after getting some improvement, it will aggravate the disease. 07. If the remedy is repeated, it will lead to suppression. 08. The medicine is correct only if the disease is cured 'permanently'. 09. Anything, which is not written in Organon, does not exist. 10. Anything that is written in Organon is final and binding, and cannot be challenged. 11. If the remedy is right, it will always aggravate the disease in the beginning. 12. If there is an aggravation after giving homeopathic medicine, it means the medicine is correct. 13. The use of conventional medicine (so-called allopathy) is always wrong. 14. Homeopathy and allopathy are against each other. 15. Homeopathy can cure 'all' acute diseases. 16. Homeopathy can cure 'all' chronic diseases. 17. If mental symptoms are improving (enhanced sense of well-being) and physical pathology deteriorating; the remedy is right and a cure would follow. 18. Nosodes (Tuberculinum, Carcinosin, Psorinum, Medorrhinum) should not be and cannot be repeated. 19. Homeopathy is a religion and not a profession. 20. Homeopathic medicines are spiritual tools; homeopathy is spirituality and not a science. 21. Homeopathy is ultimate and there is no need for any research. 22. Homeopathy can cure cataracts, hernia, cancer, hydrocele, paralysis, tumors, lipoma, etc. because these diseases are listed in the repertory. 23. Homeopathy is against surgery. 24. Surgery will always suppress the disease. 25. Homeopathic nosodes and some medicines can be used as prophylactic against Malaria, Measles, Tuberculosis; and can work as a substitute for vaccines. 26. All vaccines are very bad and should not be used. 27. All the major symptoms described in materia medica (such as by Kent, Boericke, Hering) have been 'proved' in drug proving. 28. More rubrics the repertory has, the better is the repertory. 29. The doctrine of Signature is a universal law and it stringently applies to homeopathy. 30. The use of vitamins, intravenous saline, hormone supplements is against homeopathy. 31. If you are a good homeopath, you should use the single remedy, single-dose, and should not think of changing the remedy even if the patient is not better. 32. Classical homeopathy means single remedy, single dose; regardless of the criticality of the situation and experience of the prescriber. 33. Homeopathy can \"cure\" mental retardation, Down syndrome, paralysis, cerebral palsy, coma, and many hopeless conditions. 34. Homeopathy can professionally be practiced without knowledge of medicine or medical training. Neurodermatitis Neurodermatitis and Its Homeopathic Treatment Introduction: Neurodermatitis is also known as lichen simplex. It is commonly known as scratch dermatitis. It is a chronic disease characterized by itching and/or scaling. It starts with localized itching, but scratching increases itching and makes it more intense. Because of this cycle of chronic itching and scratching, the skin may become thick and leathery. Signs and symptoms - Excessive itching in a limited and single area like the neck, wrist, thighs, abdomen, thighs, etc. - Leathery skin - Raised, a rough patch that is red or darker than the rest of your skin. - Chronic itching and scratching cycle can lead to a bacterial skin infection and permanent scars or changes in skin color. - Itching may disturb the sleep pattern of patients. Cause of neurodermatitis Generally, the cause is not known. Stress, anxiety can be triggering factors for it. Most of the times itching begins with something that simply rubs or irritates the skin, such as tight clothing or a bug bite. As the patient starts scratching, the itching increases more and the cycle goes on till the skin becomes leathery. Risk Factors - Age between 30-50 years - The condition is most common in this age group. - Females are affected more than males. - History of skin disease: Patients with a personal or family history of eczema, psoriasis or similar skin conditions are at risk of getting neurodermatitis. Investigation Diagnosis is based on the skin's appearance and a history of itching and scratching. The following tests can rule out other causes. - Patch testing/ Allergy testing - Small quantities of allergens are applied to small patches, which are then placed on the skin. Two days after application, if the patient develops a raised bump or a reaction limited to the skin just beneath the patch, the diagnosis goes in favor of Allergic dermatitis. - Skin biopsy - to rule out other conditions, such as lichen planus, eczema, psoriasis, that may mimic neurodermatitis. Conventional medication Conventional treatment of neurodermatitis is directed at controlling itching and dryness of skin and preventing and reducing secondary infection. It gives short-lasting results. It does not treat the root cause of the disease. Steroids and antihistamines - It suppresses itching may lead to an aggressive flare-up. Antibiotics - Antibiotics are used to control secondary infection and inflammation of the lesion. Antidepressants or anti-anxiety - In case of stress-related itching. Moisturizers - To retain moisture in the skin. E.g. Petroleum jelly, moisturizing soaps, etc. Homeopathic Treatment for Neurodermatitis - It addresses an altered immune system, treating the roots of this autoimmune disease. - It can offer long-lasting to almost permanent results in most cases. - It is absolutely harmless, safe, and non-toxic. Homeopathic treatment for Neurodermatitis is strongly suggested.

Psoriasis What is Psoriasis? [Psoriasis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/default.aspx) is a chronic disease on the skin due to a disturbed immune system. IN psoriasis, the skin produces an excessive and abnormal amount of skin scales. Normally, skin cells tend to develop deep in one's skin and rise to the surface gradually. Each skin cell has a lifecycle of about one month. However, in psoriasis affected individuals, the skin production process takes place rapidly and overproduction of skin cells occurs leading to patchy, scaly skin. Psoriasis is characterized by red, raised, scaly skin patches on the skin's surface. Usually, whitish-silver scales happen to develop in red, thick skin patches. At times, cracks may develop in the patches which may bleed. However, psoriasis is not contagious and its lesions are not infectious. Know information on Psoriasis and its Homeopathic Treatment [What is of Areas of The Body That are Affected by Psoriasis: Most often, scales of psoriasis develop on the joints, such as knees and elbows. About 15% of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis causing inflammation of the joints leading to symptoms of arthritis. However, psoriasis can affect any area of your body. Patches of psoriasis may occur on your scalp, neck, hands, palms, face, lower back, soles of the feet, or any other body part. A less common type of this skin disorder may also affect your nails, such as toenails and fingernails, the area around the genitals, and soft tissues within your mouth. (See pictures where psoriasis affects the back, thighs, legs, area behind the ears, nails, and margins of hair. Most common psoriasis-affected areas are elbows and knees.) Grades of Psoriasis: Based on the percentage of the psoriasis-affected body area and its impact on the quality of life, psoriasis is graded as severe, moderate, or mild. The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index parameter that helps express how severe the psoriasis is. It comprises three clinical signs, namely erythema (i.e. redness), induration (i.e. thickness), and desquamation (i.e. scaling). The severity of the psoriasis parameter is calculated on the scale of 0 to 4. The Occurrence of Psoriasis: Psoriasis tends to appear and disappear with medicines or without medicines. Such phases are called Remissions and Relapses. At times, the patches of psoriasis vanish (which is called remission), while, in some instances, the patches reappear (which is called relapse). Longer remissions and minimum and shorter relapses give great relief to psoriasis an affected individual. Factors Affecting Psoriasis: Certain factors can trigger a flare-up making the psoriasis patches reappear in a short time span. Factors, such as stress, skin injuries, infections, medications, climate, obesity, tobacco, genetic factors, and alcohol, are some common psoriasis causes that you should watch out for. On the contrary, certain factors, such as sunlight, tend to alleviate the discomfort and intensity of psoriasis. How Commonly Psoriasis Occur? Usually, 1% -2% of the general population is affected by this chronic skin condition. Psoriasis occurs in both males as well as females in equal proportions. An individual can get affected by psoriasis at any age, however, most often, psoriasis occurs in grown-ups between the age groups of 15 and 35 years. Psoriasis can affect children as young as one year age. How Psoriasis Affects our Body? The skin comprises two layers, such as an inner layer (called dermis) and an outer layer (called epidermis). Skin cells that make up the upper layer grow in the inner layer and then move upwards. New cells developed in dermis replace the old cells of epidermis at a typical interval of 28 to 30 days. However, in psoriasis, the cell formation process in the inner layer is accelerated. So, a greater number of new cells are formed in the inner layer and they move upwards to the upper layer at a faster rate than normal. As a result, excess of skin cells conglomerates which leads to scales and patches of psoriasis. Causes of Psoriasis: Even though the exact cause of psoriasis if not yet clear, it is known to develop due to the body's internal disharmony and certain environmental triggers. Psoriasis causes include genetic predisposition and disturbed immunity. Certain internal and external factors also cause psoriasis. Internal Factors: - Defective/Disturbed Immune System: The latest medical research reveals that psoriasis result due to a disturbed or defective immune system. An overactive immune system tends to create inflammation in your body. It produces excessive healthy skin cells, and they are pushed to the upper surface of the skin quite quickly resulting in psoriasis. - Genetics & Heredity: Some of the most prominent psoriasis causes are genetic and hereditary factors. One out of every 3 individuals affected by psoriasis happens to have a relative suffering from psoriasis. External Factors: Psoriasis affected individuals may experience that at certain times their skin condition and discomfort turn worse. Certain factors or conditions that cause relapses or flare-ups of psoriasis are called triggers of psoriasis. Some of them are mentioned below. - Climate: Often, the onset of the cold climate can trigger a flare-up of psoriasis. On the contrary, hot and sunny weather can provide relief from this skin condition. - Skin Injury: Physical trauma, such as skin injuries due to an accident, scrape, sunburn, or cut, can cause psoriasis. Psoriatic lesions may occur at the site of skin injury after 10 to 14 days of the injury. Also, vaccines and shots can cause an outbreak of psoriasis. - Infections: Psoriasis causes also include skin infections and systemic (integral) infections. Upper respiratory infection, HIV infection, and strep throat are some of the common systemic infections that may make you suffer from psoriasis or trigger a flare-up of the same. Besides these, skin infections causing boils and ulcers can also trigger psoriasis lesions. - Stress: Another common factor that can be the cause, as well as the trigger of psoriasis, is stress. Psychological stress affects both the mind and body of an individual. So, unusually intense stress can trigger a relapse of psoriasis. To prevent the flare-ups of this skin condition, you need to learn to manage and minimize the stress. - Certain Medications: Lithium or medications which treat depression, beta-blockers that regulate high blood pressure, mepacrine, antimalarials, and NSAID can lead to psoriasis or trigger relapse of a psoriasis flare-up. Symptoms of Psoriasis: Psoriasis usually occurs starting with small, red bumps on the surface of the skin which progress to larger, scaly psoriasis patches. Some of the common symptoms of this skin condition are as follows: - Red, inflamed and raised skin patches - Burning and itching affecting around the psoriasis lesions - A white crust of silvery scales surfacing the red patches - Soreness is present around the lesions - Dry skin which may crack or even bleed - Swollen and painful joints - Thick, pitted nails Types of Psoriasis: There are several variants of psoriasis. Some of the common types of psoriasis are as below. - Plaque psoriasis: The most common type of psoriasis which is observed in the majority of psoriasis patients is plaque psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris. It results in red, raised, inflamed, and thickened patches of red skin, which are often covered with whitish-silver plaques. You can find these plaques on knees, elbows, and scalp. - Scalp Psoriasis: Another common type of psoriasis is scalp psoriasis, which is relatively quite difficult to treat. You may have it only on your scalp or together on your scalp and skin. In several cases of scalp psoriasis, it lasts for many years before it affects the body. Most often, mild psoriasis which affects the scalp is inappropriately identified and treated as dandruff. - Pustular Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis is quite common among adults. It is characterized by white blisters which are filled with pus and the broad areas tend to turn red and inflamed. Typically, this type of psoriasis is restricted to the body's smaller areas, such as feet and hands, however, it may even widespread. - Erythrodermic Psoriasis: This type of psoriasis is quite rare but severe. Often, it affects large areas of the body at once. It causes intense redness, swelling, itching, and pain. The skin of the affected person appears to be almost sunburnt. Scales that are formed tend to slough off in big sheets. The patient may also suffer from fever or fall sick. This type of psoriasis can be life-threatening, so those who are affected by it should consult a doctor immediately. - Guttate Psoriasis: Guttate psoriasis commonly occurs in childhood. It is characterized by small pink spots on legs, trunk, arms, and scalp. Thick or raised spots like psoriasis patches develop very rarely. - Palmo-Planter Psoriasis: It is one of the common types of psoriasis which affect either soles, palms, or both. Thickening and scaling of the affected skin area occur along with painful, deep fissures on the affected soles and palms. Certain substances, such as cleaning and washing products and detergents, tend to irritate these psoriasis lesions and obstructs them from healing. - Inverse Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis causes red, inflamed, shiny lesions in the folds of skin of the affected body areas. Inverse psoriasis patches develop under the breasts or armpits, around the skin folds present near the genitals, and in the groin. It causes increased sweating and sensitivity to friction, and it can be quite itchy or painful. - The Psoriatic Nail: About 50 % of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis affecting their toenails or/and fingernails. At times, psoriasis may affect only nails and no other part of the body. The nail may develop yellow to yellow-pink discoloration or nail plate may get depressed or deeply pitted crumbling into yellowish patches. At times, the affected nail may be lost completely. - Psoriatic Arthritis: One of the most difficult types of psoriasis is psoriatic arthritis where you suffer from psoriasis along with the discomforting joint pain. It can affect any joint of your body. A good [psoriasis homeopathic treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/homeopathic-treatment.aspx) may help psoriasis cure if it's diagnosed and treated in earlier stages. How Psoriasis Affects Social & Mental Health? At times, psoriasis is so mild that it goes unnoticed. So, it doesn't affect the individual psychologically or socially. On the contrary, there are psoriasis affected people who have patches of psoriasis everywhere on their bodies. These individuals may suffer emotional distress, discomfort due to the itching and pain, and restricted motion of the affected joints. Besides this, psoriasis patches impart an unpleasant appearance to the person. Chronic itching and flaking bring embarrassment when getting social. Even though it's not a life-threatening condition, it largely impacts the lifestyle and self-esteem of the affected person adversely. Often, psoriasis is misunderstood and it brings awkwardness and embarrassment while carrying out social interactions. As a result, the psoriasis patient may suffer emotional problems, such as anger, depression, anxiety, and inferior complex. Diagnosing Psoriasis: - Physical Examination: Usually, the doctors diagnose psoriasis clinically by examining the affected skin carefully, considering the family history and medical history, and the spread on the affected body parts. A simple physical exam is enough for physicians to diagnose psoriasis. - Biopsy: When the symptoms are not clear or when the doctor feels the need to confirm the possible or suspected diagnosis, then they may suggest a biopsy. A small sample of the affected person's skin is taken and sent to a lab for examination under a microscope. It diagnoses not only whether it's psoriasis or not, but also the type of psoriasis. It helps rule out the possibility of other skin infections or disorders. Available Treatment Options For Psoriasis: Psoriasis is indeed a difficult skin condition to treat. In fact, treating psoriasis is quite challenging for the medical science and faculty since, in most cases, after using any modern or available treatments, psoriasis happens to relapse. Several therapies and methods exist when it comes to psoriasis cure. Most methods offer positive outcomes lasting for varying timespans. Some of the popular treatments available for alleviating psoriasis include allopathic treatment (conventional medicine), psoriasis homeopathic treatment, Ayurvedic treatment, herbal remedies, phototherapy, acupuncture, psoriasis home remedies, and many other treatments. Also, [psoriasis treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/treatment.aspx) can utilize various modes of administration, such as topical application of oils, creams, or lotions, injections, oral medications, the use of UV rays, and the use of needles when treating with acupuncture therapy. Conventional Treatment: The conventional medicines, more commonly known as allopathic or modern medicine, use the medicines mentioned below for treating psoriasis. These are immunosuppressive medications in some way or the other. - Psoralen (with or without P-UV rays) (Oral) - Retinoids (Oral) - Methotrexate (Oral) - Cortisone (Oral, injections, topical) - Cyclosporine (Oral) Psoriasis Homeopathic Treatment: Psoriasis is not an external or superficial condition but an intrinsic or deep-seated disorder resulting due to a disturbed immune system or genetic or hereditary factors. To treat this disease occurring due to the body's internal disharmony, well-planned and deeply working medications are necessary. Even though cortisone (by the conventional treatment) may succeed in suppressing the symptoms of the disease, it can't cure this skin ailment. On the contrary, homeopathy is quite effective in stimulating the natural healing mechanism of the body of the affected individual and restoring the disrupted immune system to normalcy. Psoriasis homeopathic treatment focusses on treating the immunological factors which tend to cause psoriasis. Various factors, such as physical, genetic, hormonal, environmental factors, and many others, affect your immune system. So, homeopathy aims the recovery by taking into consideration the totality of the individual suffering from psoriasis. The homeopathic medicines are easy to have as you always need to take them in the form of oral pills through the mouth. Homeopathy does not recommend the application of any medical matter on your affected skin to treat it, except for a good moisturizer. The application of a good moisturizer is a crucial part of the psoriasis treatment, no matter what kind of medication you are having as a primary treatment. It helps you have great relief from excessive dryness and scaling of the skin, itching, and flaking. How Does Homeopathy Work & Prove Beneficial For Psoriasis Patients?

Psoriasis What is Psoriasis? [Psoriasis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/default.aspx) is a chronic disease on the skin due to a disturbed immune system. In psoriasis, the skin produces an excessive and abnormal amount of skin scales. Normally, skin cells tend to develop deep in one's skin and rise to the surface gradually. Each skin cell has a lifecycle of about one month. However, in psoriasis-affected individuals, the skin production process takes place rapidly and overproduction of skin cells occurs leading to patchy, scaly skin. Psoriasis is characterized by red, raised, scaly skin patches on the skin's surface. Usually, whitish-silver scales happen to develop in red, thick skin patches. At times, cracks may develop in the patches which may bleed. However, psoriasis is not contagious and its lesions are not infectious. Common Areas of The Body That are Affected by Psoriasis: Most often, scales of psoriasis develop on the joints, such as knees and elbows. About 15% of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis causing inflammation of the joints and leading to symptoms of arthritis. However, psoriasis can affect any area of your body. Patches of psoriasis may occur on your scalp, neck, hands, palms, face, lower back, soles of the feet, or any other body part. A less common type of this skin disorder may also affect your nails, such as toenails and fingernails, the area around the genitals, and soft tissues within your mouth. (See pictures where psoriasis affects the back, thighs, legs, area behind the ears, nails, and margins of hair. Most common psoriasis-affected areas are the elbows and knees.) [Ask your questions to Dr. Shah's team directly & get an expert opinion on your ailment!](https://www.askdrshah.com/askyourquestionpage.aspx) Grades of Psoriasis: Based on the percentage of the psoriasis-affected body area and its impact on the quality of life, psoriasis is graded as severe, moderate, or mild. The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index parameter that helps express how severe the psoriasis is. It comprises three clinical signs, namely erythema (i.e. redness), induration (i.e. thickness), and desquamation (i.e. scaling). The severity of the psoriasis parameter is calculated on a scale of 0 to 4. The Occurrence of Psoriasis: Psoriasis tends to appear and disappear with medicines or without medicines. Such phases are called Remissions and Relapses. At times, the patches of psoriasis vanish (which is called remission), while, in some instances, the patches reappear (which is called a relapse). Longer remissions and minimum and shorter relapses give great relief to psoriasis in an affected individual. Factors Affecting Psoriasis: Certain factors can trigger a flare-up making the psoriasis patches reappear in a short time span. Factors, such as stress, skin injuries, infections, medications, climate, obesity, tobacco, genetic factors, and alcohol, are some common psoriasis causes that you should watch out for. On the contrary, certain factors, such as sunlight, tend to alleviate the discomfort and intensity of psoriasis. How Commonly Psoriasis Occur? Usually, 1% -2% of the general population is affected by this chronic skin condition. Psoriasis occurs in both males as well as females in equal proportions. An individual can get affected by psoriasis at any age, however, most often, psoriasis occurs in grown-ups between the age groups of 15 and 35 years. Psoriasis can affect children as young as one-year-old babies. How does Psoriasis Affect our Body? The skin comprises two layers, such as an inner layer (called the dermis) and an outer layer (called the epidermis). Skin cells that make up the upper layer grow in the inner layer and then move upwards. New cells developed in the dermis replace the old cells of the epidermis at a typical interval of 28 to 30 days. However, in psoriasis, the cell formation process in the inner layer is accelerated. So, a greater number of new cells are formed in the inner layer and they move upwards to the upper layer at a faster rate than normal. As a result, excess skin cells conglomerates lead to scales and patches of psoriasis. Also Read: [What are the triggers of psoriasis and how to manage it](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/triggers-psoriasis-manage/)? Causes of Psoriasis: Even though the exact cause of psoriasis is not yet clear, it is known to develop due to the body's internal disharmony and certain environmental triggers. Psoriasis causes include genetic predisposition and disturbed immunity. Certain internal and external factors also cause psoriasis. Internal Factors: - Defective/Disturbed Immune System: The latest medical research reveals that psoriasis results due to a disturbed or defective immune system. An overactive immune system tends to create inflammation in your body. It produces excessive healthy skin cells, and they are pushed to the upper surface of the skin quite quickly resulting in psoriasis. - Genetics & Heredity: Some of the most prominent psoriasis causes are genetic and hereditary factors. One out of every 3 individuals affected by psoriasis happens to have a relative suffering from psoriasis. External Factors: Psoriasis-affected individuals may experience that at certain times their skin condition and discomfort turn worse. Certain factors or conditions that cause relapses or flare-ups of psoriasis are called triggers of psoriasis. Some of them are mentioned below. - Climate: Often, the onset of the cold climate can trigger a flare-up of psoriasis. On the contrary, hot and sunny weather can provide relief from this skin condition. - Skin Injury: Physical trauma, such as skin injuries due to an accident, scrape, sunburn, or cut, can cause psoriasis. Psoriatic lesions may occur at the site of skin injury after 10 to 14 days of the injury. Also, vaccines and shots can cause an outbreak of psoriasis. - Infections: Psoriasis causes also include skin infections and systemic (integral) infections. Upper respiratory infection, HIV infection, and strep throat are some of the common systemic infections that may make you suffer from psoriasis or trigger a flare-up of the same. Besides these, skin infections causing boils and ulcers can also trigger psoriasis lesions. - Stress: Another common factor that can be the cause, as well as the trigger of psoriasis, is stress. Psychological stress affects both the mind and body of an individual. So, unusually intense stress can trigger a relapse of psoriasis. To prevent the flare-ups of this skin condition, you need to learn to manage and minimize the stress. - Certain Medications: Lithium or medications which treat depression, beta-blockers that regulate high blood pressure, mepacrine, antimalarials, and NSAID can lead to psoriasis or trigger relapse of a psoriasis flare-up. Symptoms of Psoriasis: Psoriasis usually occurs starting with small, red bumps on the surface of the skin which progress to larger, scaly psoriasis patches. Some of the common symptoms of this skin condition are as follows: - Red, inflamed and raised skin patches - Burning and itching affecting the psoriasis lesions - A white crust of silvery scales surfacing the red patches - Soreness is present around the lesions - Dry skin which may crack or even bleed - Swollen and painful joints - Thick, pitted nails Types of Psoriasis: There are several variants of psoriasis. Some of the common types of psoriasis are as below. - Plaque psoriasis: The most common type of psoriasis which is observed in the majority of psoriasis patients is plaque psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris. It results in red, raised, inflamed, and thickened patches of red skin, which are often covered with whitish-silver plaques. You can find these plaques on the knees, elbows, and scalp. - Scalp Psoriasis: Another common type of psoriasis is scalp psoriasis, which is relatively quite difficult to treat. You may have it only on your scalp or together on your scalp and skin. In several cases of scalp psoriasis, it lasts for many years before it affects the body. Most often, mild psoriasis which affects the scalp is inappropriately identified and treated as dandruff. - Pustular Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis is quite common among adults. It is characterized by white blisters which are filled with pus and the broad areas tend to turn red and inflamed. Typically, this type of psoriasis is restricted to the body's smaller areas, such as feet and hands, however, it may even be widespread. - Erythrodermic Psoriasis: This type of psoriasis is quite rare but severe. Often, it affects large areas of the body at once. It causes intense redness, swelling, itching, and pain. The skin of the affected person appears to be almost sunburnt. Scales that are formed tend to slough off in big sheets. The patient may also suffer from fever or fall sick. This type of psoriasis can be life-threatening, so those who are affected by it should consult a doctor immediately. - Guttate Psoriasis: Guttate psoriasis commonly occurs in childhood. It is characterized by small pink spots on the legs, trunk, arms, and scalp. Thick or raised spots like psoriasis patches develop very rarely. - Palmo-Planter Psoriasis: It is one of the common types of psoriasis which affects either sole, palms, or both. Thickening and scaling of the affected skin area occur along with painful, deep fissures on the affected soles and palms. Certain substances, such as cleaning and washing products and detergents, tend to irritate these psoriasis lesions and obstruct them from healing. - Inverse Psoriasis: This variant of psoriasis causes red, inflamed, shiny lesions in the folds of skin of the affected body areas. Inverse psoriasis patches develop under the breasts or armpits, around the skin folds present near the genitals, and in the groin. It causes increased sweating and sensitivity to friction, and it can be quite itchy or painful. - The Psoriatic Nail: About 50 % of psoriasis-affected individuals have psoriasis affecting their toenails or/and fingernails. At times, psoriasis may affect only nails and no other part of the body. The nail may develop yellow to yellow-pink discoloration or the nail plate may get depressed or deeply pitted crumbling into yellowish patches.

These individuals may suffer emotional distress, discomfort due to itching and pain, and restricted motion of the affected joints. Besides this, psoriasis patches impart an unpleasant appearance to the person. Chronic itching and flaking bring embarrassment when getting social.

Often, psoriasis is misunderstood and it brings awkwardness and embarrassment while carrying out social interactions. As a result, the psoriasis patient may suffer emotional problems, such as anger, depression, anxiety, and inferior complex. Diagnosing Psoriasis: - Physical Examination: Usually, the doctors diagnose psoriasis clinically by examining the affected skin carefully, considering the family history and medical history, and the spread on the affected body parts. A simple physical exam is enough for physicians to diagnose psoriasis. - Biopsy: When the symptoms are not clear or when the doctor feels the need to confirm the possible or suspected diagnosis, then they may suggest a biopsy. A small sample of the affected person's skin is taken and sent to a lab for examination under a microscope. It diagnoses not only whether it's psoriasis or not, but also the type of psoriasis. It helps rule out the possibility of other skin infections or disorders. Available Treatment Options For Psoriasis: Psoriasis is indeed a difficult skin condition to treat.

As the name (neurilemmoma) suggests, the tumor grows along the length of a nerve anywhere in the body, commonly affecting the nerves in the brain and neck. The tumor contains Schwann cells (cells producing nerve sheath) hence the tumor is named \"Schwan-nnoma\". Schwannomas are slowly growing tumors and are less likely to turn malignant (cancerous). These tumors remain outside the nerve but as they grow gradually, they may produce symptoms due to pressure on the surrounding structures. Schwannomas are the most commonly found benign tumors of the nerves in adults. Most commonly occurring schwannomas are the vestibular tumors that affect the eighth cranial nerve (nerve arising from the brain supplying the ear) i.e vestibulocochlear nerve. They can also affect the upper limbs where it usually presents with a painless soft swelling. Cause: Certain genetic tendencies in the family might make one prone to have the tumor. It has also been linked with conditions like neurofibromatosis, where present with one or more Schwanommas. Symptoms: The symptoms depend upon the site where the tumor is located. If it affects the arms, one can see or feel a lump. If the tumor affects any nerve in the brain one might experience recurrent headaches, dizziness, tingling, and numbness. If the nerve supplying the ear is affected one might experience hearing deficits, tinnitus (noises in the ears). Generalized weakness, body aches are quite common. Some patients might also remain asymptomatic. Diagnosis: Schwannomas are best diagnosed through imaging techniques like MRI, CT scan, X-ray, and ultrasound. A biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment: The conventional treatment treats the tumor symptomatically (with the help of medicines) if diagnosed early. Surgery opts if the tumor is progressive. Malignant (cancerous) tumors might need a combination of surgery and radiotherapy Homeopathic treatment aims at slowing down the further growth of the tumor, preventing the recurrence of the tumor post-surgery, and giving symptomatic relief. Homeopathy can also be opted for when the tumor is recently detected and the patient does not have any symptoms. One can think of homeopathy for treating schwannoma when the tumor is stable along with symptoms and one is not willing to go for surgery. We do not have adequate data to suggest any cure for the Schwannomas using homeopathy. At Life Force, we have recorded two cases of schwannoma under treatment. Dr Rajesh Shah promotes Scientific homeopathy - Promoting, practicing, and teaching scientific homeopathy - Documenting every case and generating statistics - Clinical research, research on new molecules, and clinical trials - Case evaluation using the conventional medicine system Homeopathy has received criticism time about its non-scientific nature. Well, there can be a big debate on this issue. However, Dr Shah has always believed in what he called the practice of scientific homeopathy. Homeopathy is a science and the practice of homeopathy has to be scientific. Dr Shah's practice since 1985 has been based on his strong medical background and excellent training in conventional medical subjects. As a result, he has tremendous clarity as to what is curable what is not. His opinions on the curability of various diseases based on the understating of underlying pathology may be considered final in homeopathy. Unfortunately, the practice of homeopathy in all parts of the world may not be as per the scientific methods. In many countries including the UK, USA, it is not mandatory for homeopaths to have a medical background. As a result, many homeopaths have messed up the practice of homeopathy, by going astray; by deviating from sound principles. Lately, fanciful concepts related to dreams and over-stretching of mental symptoms have been used in homeopathic practice, which is a clear deviation from scientific homeopathy. In the last twenty years, many developments have happened in the area of scientific homeopathy. Many molecular biologists, chemists, physicists, and pharmacologists have researched, and have arrived at conclusions that homeopathic medicine is a form of a nano-pharmacological system having effects that are documented in in-vitro models, animal models as well as in placebo-controlled human trials. Dr Rajesh Shah has written many articles criticizing the unscientific elements in the practice of homeopathy; which have been largely appreciated by experts the world over. [How to find a qualified homeopath?](good-doctor.aspx) Search Result Sitemap Askdrshah.com Sitemap Homeopathy Treatment Details for Skin Diseases Skin being the largest organ in the human body, presents with many diseases on it. In fact, the skin is the reflection of what is happening under the skin, or rather, inside the body. Most of the internal systems and organs in the body when get affected or diseased, they show their effects in the form of skin diseases, in various forms. For example, when the immune system gets haywire, it shows on the skin in the form of diseases like psoriasis or lichen planus. When the immune system gets hypersensitive or delicate, it shows internal disease in the form of allergies such as urticaria or eczema. When the internal immune system is weakened, it gets impacted by external germs and there are various skin infections such as pyoderma, boils, carbuncles, warts, molluscum contagiosa, fungus infections, etc. Similarly, when the hormonal system inside gets sick, it can lead to some of the symptoms of hormonal diseases such as hair fall, alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, hyper-pigmentation, melasma, vitiligo, dry skin, and the like. Also, some of the genetic tendencies are displayed in the form of skin diseases, such as vitiligo, skin cancer, psoriasis, pemphigus, etc. In other words, the skin is like a mirror of our body, which reflects the internal changes, internal diseases. They need to be understood accordingly. That means, the skin diseases are not skin deep; they are much deeper than the skin. They give us a signal about the internal disease. The homeopathic approach to skin disease In homeopathy, when we approach the treatment of skin diseases, we evaluate skin disease in its totality; and try to understand its inner cause, at the level of immunology, hormones, genetics, metabolic, etc. and plan the treatment in such as way that the disease is addressed at the root level, treating the related cause. By treating the disease such as psoriasis or urticaria or lichen planus or vitiligo, we treat the disease at a deeper level so that the disease does not recur for a long time, for many years or months. While treating the skin diseases at such a deeper level using homeopathy, the homeopathic medicines are administered orally. Homeopathy does not believe in treating skin disease by using lotions or cream. Homeopathy believes that if you treat skin disease by using external lotions, you are actually going to 'suppress' or 'mask' the disease and not 'cure' it. Conventional treatment for skin diseases The conventional or allopathic method of treating skin disease is different from that of homeopathy. Though conventional medicine understands that the skin disease is essentially the reflection of internal systems, as described above, however, the treatment approach entails the use of external medicines such as immuno-suppressive lotions and ointment, to 'suppress' or 'mask' the skin diseases. As a result what happens is that most of the skin diseases when treated by applying such lotions, comprising of cortisone (or such immunosuppressive medicines), show an initial result. However, on stopping the treatment, most diseases return or resurface in a short time. This is a common experience of millions of patients and thousands of doctors. Which of the skin diseases are treated with success using homeopathy? Most chronic skin diseases respond positively to homeopathic treatment. Let us talk about some of the common skin diseases and the scope of homeopathic treatment for them. | || | Psoriasis: Homeopathy offers excellent treatment for all cases of psoriasis, regardless of its extent. We have observed and documented excellent results even in the most severe cases of [psoriasis](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/psoriasis/), at Life Force.

Related Condition How are the homeopathic medicines prepared A small presentation by Life Force about sources of homeopathic medicines Sources of Homeopathic Medicine: And How they are made by Dr. Rupal Shah, MD and Dr Rajesh Shah, MD What are the sources of homeopathic medicines? Homeopathic medicines are prepared from a wide range of natural sources. Over 75% of the medicines originate from the vegetable kingdom, i.e. flowers, roots, leaves, and juice. Certain chemicals and minerals are also used to prepare certain medicines. For instance, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid. Most minerals and metals are used as a source of medicine, such as gold, silver, zinc, tin, iron, and so on. Some microbes, bacteria, viruses are also used to prepare a special group of medicines (called Nosode), for instance, influenza virus, bacteria that produce tuberculosis, etc. Certain hormones, enzymes, and other biological materials also form one the important sources of homeopathic medicines, after getting processed in a unique method of potentization. The animal kingdom has a special place in the homeopathy pharmacy and homeopathy medicines are prepared from animal sources almost in a nonviolent technique. Some insects such as the Spanish fly (Apis Mellifica) and certain animal products such as the venom of the Cobra snake (Naja) are used in a unique manner. How are the homeopathic medicines prepared? The revolutionary method of drug preparation in [homeopathy](homeopathy-brief.aspx), called Potentization, utilizes a very minute quantity of the original drug substance. A very small portion of any substance, say a drop of Surukuku snake venom, as one part, is mixed with 99 parts of alcohol or distilled water. Some powerful strokes are given to this mixture of about 100 drops/ml. It makes so-called 1c potency. Now, out of these 100 drops, one drop is taken and mixed with 99 drops of alcohol, again to undergo the process of vigorous strokes, making the potency 2c. The process is continued higher level up to 30c, 200c, 1000c, 10000c, 50000c and 100000c. No material, only the medicinal power... As you can realize, there is infinitesimal original drug substance in the higher potency medicines. Actually, it crosses Avogadro's limit. There is no detectable material in the potency higher than 24. What is left behind is the power or energy of the medicine. One may call it dynamic power, which is capable to induce definite changes in the body system to bring about the healing process. Absolutely safe and non-toxic: As you can see that the special method of homeopathic medicines renders them absolutely free from any toxic substance in it. The medicines thus are absolutely safe and free from any side effects. They are safe for even babies and pregnant women. It works! It has been the day-to-day experience of thousands of [homeopaths](https://www.lifeforce.in/good-homeopath.aspx) world-over, for the last 200 years, that homeopathy medicines, even in the smallest form, work! Some documented cases on these pages can convince anyone who wants to see the healing power of a minimum dose!

[Click here to read some of the commonly used remedies for various conditions](ingredients.aspx) Cortisone (Steroids) and Homeopathy There is a misconception in some parts of media and the public in general about homeopaths using cortisone or steroids. Unfortunately, this has done more harm than good to the cause of homeopathy. Steroids have been used by conventional medicine doctors for just about everything under the sun, whenever they need help to give relief to the patient. The steroid is the easiest recourse and sometimes the primary or ultimate choice. The response to the administration of steroids in a lot of diseases is unbelievably amazing and fast. This may lead to thinking that any problem that responds quickly or positively to a prescription should be because of steroids! If a given case under homeopathic prescription does unbelievably well and responds in time less than anticipated, it is often blamed on a steroid or a steroid-like effect. To make things worse, homeopathic medicines sometimes give a false positive result to certain nonspecific tests used for detecting steroids. The most common Non-Specific Test used for testing steroids is the calorimetric method and other tests based on color development (UV Spectrophotometry). A salt named Tetrazolium Blue is used commonly in such a test. The reaction depends upon the reduction of tetrazolium blue salt to give a highly colored compound known as Farmazan. Under controlled conditions, the amount of Formazan developed is proportional to the quantity of steroids or any reducing sugar present in the material being tested. It is important to note here, that both reducing sugars and aldehydes will show a false positive color change and unfortunately both reducing sugars and aldehydes may be found in homeopathic medicines which are made of chiefly cane sugar/ lactose or alcohol (may not be entirely free from aldehyde remains). Also, the test report generally mentions \"traces found\" and is unable to give the amount of steroid as it is a nonspecific test. If we really want to find out whether the content has steroids, then, Indian Pharmacopoeia 1996 mentions some Specific Tests in Appendix 3.6 (identification of steroids) and Appendix 3.7 (identification of related foreign steroids), for testing steroids including TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) or HPTLC (High Power Thin Layer Chromatography) which when applied to homeopathic medicines, give negative results for steroids. It is also important to know that almost all steroids show UV absorption between 235 and 240 nm in dehydrated alcohol or methanol in a clear solution. If an ultraviolet spectrum of this solution is taken between 400 nm and 200 nm on a suitable spectrophotometer, any steroid present will show up as a maximum between 235nm and 240 nm. The absence of such a band means the absence of steroids. When homeopathic remedies are tested for steroids using the UV absorption method, none of the samples show up as a maximum between 235nm and 240 nm. Thus it is clear that homeopathic medicines do not contain any steroids, and one must understand the testing procedures used to eliminate the possibility of a misleading result. So the next time someone or you yourself want to know the truth, you know where to get it from. Swine Flu Swine flu took India by surprise. We are by nature not 'pig eaters' and so the comfort level, negating the fact that it was just not a swine here but the flu as well and the flu knows no boundaries. Official figure on the 19th of August 2009 was 1928 with a mortality of 29. We all were worried to move out and so were millions of Indians on the streets. This called for some immediate protective measure and life force did not wait for the government to make homeopathy mandatory or free. We went on the streets requesting people to allow us to put banners in residential apartments, petrol filling stations and where ever we could find a place, making people aware of protective measures and how homeopathy could help them in this crisis. A protocol was formulated and dose instructions with information fliers were distributed. Everybody at life force was helping prepare medicines for free distributions and people were pouring in, companies with a field sales force of over 300 plus came in asking for medicines for the entire staff. It wasn't easy but we did it. LifeForce distributed over 3000 medicine bottles over a period of 7 days free of cost and the count continues till date.

Things you might like to know about Dr. Shah! (Non-professional aspects of Dr Rajesh Shah)(Separate link to his CV and profile) Early years: Dr Rajesh Shah was born in a humble family, in a remote village called Simar in Gujarat; where he studied up to class III and then moved to Nadiad; where he studied in New English School (where national leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also studied). He moved to Mumbai for secondary school and higher studies. He did his medical graduation in homeopathy from CMPH Medical College and MD from YMTH Medical College. Dr Shah lives in Mumbai with his wife Dr Rupal Shah and son Nihaar; in a house facing mountains and the lake. Nihaar completed his Master of Engineering from Oxford University (UK) and MS from Columbia University, USA. Dr Rupal is a lifelong companion, a homeopath, and a collaborator. He has very simple food habits. Dr Shah believes from his experience that our thoughts and health are also influenced by the food that we eat. He slowly reduced from his regular food to 80% raw vegetables, fruits, and dry fruits. Always a vegetarian, he is convinced of a vegan concept, which he is practicing to a significant extent if not totally. He has reduced dairy by about 90%. His experience suggests that vegetarian food (non-spicy, non-oily, non-dairy) keeps the mind healthy, free from negative thoughts. He plays badminton regularly and likes to walk for about an hour if his baddies are not around! Having a highly scientific temperament, Dr Shah has a spiritual bend of mind. He has been exploring the theory of karma, and he is a lover of the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita. He is spiritual but not religious. He is impressed by his Guru, who happened to be his uncle; as well as by Shrimad Rajchandra (who was a spiritual Guru to Mahatma Gandhi). Dr Rajesh is a strong believer in Gandhian philosophy. He is an explorer of metaphysics, enjoys investigating the synthesis of science, neuroscience, and spirituality. The practice of the highest ethics in medical practice is the reflection of spiritual outlook. He is a techy doctor! He likes to explore all kinds of new gadgets, tools, apps, etc. From the internet to Kindle or mobile apps or Amazon Echo, his eyes will always look out for new technology and its use in day to life as well as for the use of his patients. Avid reader (takes up 2-3 books at a time, and may complete 1 or 2), he reads science and spirituality. He considers himself an open-minded skeptic. He is a meditator (following Vipassana), Dr Shah has been a poet since his early teen years, and now experiments with poetry only once in a while. He is a certified PADI scuba diver. He plays piano as his latest exploration. Dr Rajesh Shah Training doctors in all five continents: Inspiring the next generation of homeopaths He has held seminars in the US, UK, Holland, Belgium, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Croatia, Japan, etc. His research-based publication My Experiences with Ferrum Metallicum (1992) has been recognized Dr Shah loves sharing and teaching. His teachings are simple, based on experience and practice. He teaches what he preaches. He believes that teaching helps in saving years of learning. Dr Shah is an ex-visiting lecturer at renowned Bombay University until 1996. He has conducted seminars and workshops in many countries such as the USA, UK, Holland, Belgium, Ireland, Croatia, Greece, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Norway, India, Japan, etc. Dr Shah's 'Clinical Training Courses in Classical Homeopathy' were attended by homeopathic physicians, teachers, and students from all continents. Currently, Dr Shah is devoting his time to research in homeopathy and has almost stopped teaching globally. What Dr Shah's students have to say: What I have spent the last 4 years studying seems to have all been put together in a way that is so much more understandable. The cases and results have been very interesting and inspiring to me. I feel I have a better grasp of many of the aspects of homeopathy. I am so excited about starting in the clinic to use what I have learned here. I have so much more confidence in myself and in Homeopathy. This course has been invaluable. Tanith Davidson Leon du Plessis, South Africa: Very organized, structured way of case taking. A really practical course, which gives better insight into the study of the Materia Medica. It gave good practice in case taking. The course gave me much more than I had expected. I have gained tremendous confidence. I have learned more in three weeks than what I learned in 5 years at the college, especially the case taking, analysis, practical prescribing. The course was very informative and helped fill in the gaps about Homeopathy in my mind. Many of my questions were answered. The course is presented in a simple, easy-to-understand manner with many funny explanations and analogies by Dr Shah. It has helped me see how to apply homeopathy practically in my practice. I've learned about case management and exactly what I can expect from my treatment. I have a much clearer understanding of how to practice. Ameesha Manga Mary Cawley, Ireland: Lectures and the clinical cases are very good by both lecturers. A major stimulus for any progress with homeopathy. Now I have renewed my interest in interest in homeopathy. The course was really very interesting. Overall I have learned a lot. The course itself is very well designed to cover the very important basics of homeopathy. Thank you for your guidance and care. I started this course with a very open mind because I had no idea what to expect from it. So I have not been disappointed, except maybe that I would have liked a little more 'hands-on' Clinical experience. On the whole, I have enjoyed the course very much and have seen and learned about things that I would probably not see much back home, which has been very interesting. My faith in homeopathy has also been enhanced. Because I have not really started treating patients yet, I'm open-minded, and I think that what I have learned here will definitely help me in practice. Zoe Bengis Anne Mari Klarin, Sweden: What I learned is to take a case systematically. Reflecting more on what do they really mean. Not to have fixed ideas about any remedy. Reflecting on what the patient is telling you. Not take causation for granted. I really appreciate Dr. Shah couple as teachers. They helped me sort my thoughts out. To pick out the most important symptoms. I also learned a lot about acute treatment from Dr. Rupal Shah. She differentiated the remedies in a very understandable way. A lot of \"homeopathic thoughts\" having in the air have been confirmed or false. A lot of fixed ideas have started to get away from my mind. It was excellent to see how Dr. Shah works. Got a better understanding of the scope of homeopathy and how to implement it. It is better in the long run because I will aspire to reach the standards of practice I saw here at Life Force. I will go back to South Africa with a lot more self-confidence. I am excited to start treating everybody I know with a small or large ailment. I expected a lot of this course, and I am not disappointed at all. You are a good pedagogue taking everything basically step to step, even if some of us are a little life too eager and impatient, asking questions \"too early\". Lots of things I have been thinking of having \" fallen on its place\". You are an explainer and pedagogue. The examples of the fights, crime, police, ministers, etc. were interesting and have helped me to understand the basic applications. I am really thankful and excited about all the knowledge and experience. You have shared with us, I have learned a lot about acute cases, and to handle acute cases, I was not really sure about that three weeks ago. This was indeed an intense course. Obviously a successful practice. The results achieved are impressive. The course provides good exposure on miasms, nosodes treatment protocol and also a useful format for structuring, case taking personally. A good outline of case taking. The good, open & realistic expectation of what you can achieve (& whatnot). Cynita Conradie Dr.Vinnikov Vladimir, Russia: I learned some treasure hints for my practice and especially for my teaching practice. During the course I practical hints on Repertorisation, lots of hints in philosophy that influenced my thinking process. Janet Westling, Sweden: I learned a lot on case taking, how to put it down on paper as well as how to \"meet\" the patient. Give space, what questions to ask, etc. Friendly, relaxed atmosphere in the clinic, interesting discussions. I feel relaxed to speak \"in class\". I feel that I will have great help with what I've learned so far. Not to take everything the patient says as being \"the truth\", but to always find out why he's doing this or that. The importance of prescribing on the balanced totality. The Concept of Facets was very useful and an important reminder of not having fixed ideas about remedies. We must focus on what is there and leave out the rest. The \"flow\" of the Phenomenon approach is a great help. The overall experience has been very positive. We have learned a lot of essential basic things that have not been included in my previous education. Case taking, potencies, finding out what's important in a case. I feel that I've got a big \" push \" forward. It was great to finally see Homoeopathy within a structure. It helped to consolidate a lot of information that was previously vague. To see the amazing results with the right approach to different cases gave me more confidence. I have learned better how to approach different cases, observing how to manage cases & the strategies used will be beneficial. I always thought the strength of homeopathy lay in encompassing the mentals and emotions of a person, that's what appealed to me. I got a very different perspective here and I do have a better understanding of the relevance of the clinical approach. Kashi Richard Elana Cossever, Canada: A much easier method of case taking. A more practical application of homeopathy. Homeopathy can become simpler than I thought possible. It just requires a sharp mind and lots of studies. I have learned that you can do too less when u don't repeat a remedy if required. Also how to be more precise to enter into acute or chronic totality. It was very impressive for me and I think the biggest difference is that Indian homeopaths have passed the college with a very good ground level. Most homeopaths in the west have to gather their knowledge on their own at a lot of places, so it's more confusing. Roland von Neida, Germany Grethel Rokman, Sweden: What I learned in the course is the way to take a case, analysis, understand rubrics. A lot of cases are common and uncommon. The course contains basic applications. Well-structured course. Refreshing study of the remedies. A truly great experience to boost the practice. This course taught me a better assessment of the depths and prognosis of the case, a better grasp of case planning, and how to use the full range of potency and frequency of repetition. It would be good to have a level 2 course where we continue to use and apply the principles laid down in the first course. This would raise our knowledge further. Also, it could include more in-depth pathology and miasmatic knowledge. Kaare Troelsen, Egypt Ian Harris, England: The logical structure of case taking, definitely more structured, user-friendly too which I was accustomed. Use of repertory as key to open up cases. Interesting features about certain remedies. Practical clues for remedies. Really a practice orientation course. Now, I have some heat to put on my skeleton. Improved repertorial familiarity. Structured with a more effective case taking. Exposure to a different variety of cases and pathology. An interactive and intellectually stimulating homeopathic experience. How to make case-taking flow was important learning. We also saw that Homeopathy isn't as dangerous as thought (suppression, etc). I got to see the importance of considering miasms in prescribing and to see where I have failed with my own prescribing, especially in acute cases. Donna Williams, Laos Dr. Marijan Montani, Croatia: Organizing the case taking, evaluation of symptoms. Many details of repertory. Many useful clinical tips. The principles of repetition of the remedy. Some structured understanding of the potency selection and clinical applications. Almost all fields of homeopathy are covered. A very systematic and practical approach in homeopathy. The course gives a deeper insight into homeopathy and also helps in practical therapeutics. An excellent approach to the treatment of cases with distinct pathology. A most useful understanding of how to use the repertory. A wonderful system in choosing the potency and repetition. I got to see what is structured case-taking and complete case-taking. Different chronic states need different modes of repetition, and this realization is important. The value of the use of nosodes was important learning. I also understood better how to differentiate functional and structural states and their miasmatic relevance. I enjoyed the passionate lectures on Materia Medica by Rupal. Rajesh I think you are an excellent teacher. I benefited or will benefit a lot from your teaching. Veetkaya, USA Helene Piper, Sweden: This course has made a lot of things clearer to me. I think your \"ascending \" learning that you being with the basics to take a case and end with miasm was very good for the understanding of homeopathy. I am grateful for your help in my containing work as a homeopath. I feel more confident as a homeopath. I'm very satisfied with this course. The strategy about choosing a remedy, potency, the dose was very fine. Natsu Watanabe, Japan Anthony Agnew: I have learned how to take a case and put it into an understandable format. this has not only simplified the procedure for me but any other practitioner as well. exposure to the Materia Medica with Rupal has been great, as well as the tips you provide about different remedies and rubrics. Mainly a really good and structured method to decide potency and repetition. Management of acute cases and the usage of sector remedies and intercurrent remedies in chronic cases were important learning. I also got to learn the practical meaning of miasms. This was one of the best courses I ever visited. Gesine Seck, Germany Dr Sheikh: Well-balanced, organized, and structured course. It was presented in the most logical manner than what is written so far. As a novice, you have clearly presented Homoeopathy to me to the level that has inspired me to practice it. Dosage, repetition, case-taking, second/ third prescription, support of nosodes were amongst the important things I learned during this series. Certain hints and aspects of Materia medica and how to judge the clinical features (aggravations, palliation, etc.) were also very interesting. Dr. Ulrich Scheub, Germany Evaluation of symptoms and considering remedies according to pathology also, not only according to the symptoms were value additions by this course. Olaf Schrann, Germany Peter Staikos: It was nice to know that there are many ways to cure in Classical Homoeopathy and that we must not just stick too much to one way. To differentiate very exactly the cases and the ways to choose and repeat the remedy was also learned. Understanding the dynamics in the healing process became clearer. This course has cleared up a lot of vague issues for me. It was done in a structured logical sequence. Dr Shah was very willing to share his knowledge & experience with us & answered all our questions patiently & made sure that no one felt uncertain about any issues. Jurgens Staats This course showed me how a well-organized and efficient clinic works. Dr Shah explained a few aspects that I was not clear about pertaining to homeopathy very clearly & vividly (especially his explanations and diagrams). I saw many skin pathology cases that healed through stages and the treatment for each pathology. The remedy selection and potency were helpful and so well described and how Dr Shah analyses each case as well as his treatment with miasms. All of this I will be taking back and using these theories. Using a camera to take photos of pathology to help your analysis of improvement was a good concept. Ivana Blazevic The course has been an extraordinary experience. I have come to realize how diverse the scope of homeopathy is and how all the theoretical knowledge comes to life. I have learned how to develop a mental process and reasoning for every patient and that the depth of a profession is infinite. I have learned an unbelievable amount about the profession and have understood more about science than ever before. I have learned to develop a process of treatment for every individual, how to understand a case with all its complexities, and to follow certain protocols to ensure optimal treatment for every patient. This course gives the practitioner student a very scientific view of treatment which is not taught in SA. Our education has many flaws and our lectures don't have such an understanding of the science themselves, so this course has put all the theories into a logical thought process. I will, without a doubt, recommend this course to any practitioner eager to learn. Leanne Scott The course has been an interesting insight into a very clinically based practice. We saw cases of diseases only read in textbooks, and constitutions only read about in Materia Medica. We were taught a very structured format of running a practice and a very methodical way of selecting the remedy. I think my scope on miasms has been very much broadened. The course will bring structure and methodically, and thus hopefully, success. Mark Leite [Link to a report by Laura Fenton on Dr Shah's seminar](drshah-seminar-report.aspx) [Link to Dr Rajesh Shah and Dr Rupal Shah seminars in the UK](dr-shah-uk-seminar-report.aspx) Treatment Trigger-finger Trigger finger is also known as tenosynovitis which means inflammation of the tendon. A tendon is a flexible elastic cord of collagen tissue attached to a muscle or bone. The word \"trigger\" denotes the popping back of the finger suddenly, similar to the releasing of a trigger in a gun. This mechanism is similar to the working of a pulley. It happens due to disparity and inflammation in the tendons at the base of the fingers and thumb. In this condition, only one finger gets affected but it can also involve more than one finger. It mostly affects the thumb, index finger, middle, or ring finger. Incidence: It is estimated that roughly 2% of the general population suffers from this condition. It is one of the common causes of hand pain in adults. Trigger finger is more common among women than men in the fifth or sixth decade of their life. Causes: This condition is seen where the work involves repeated strong catching movements like gripping onto some object, however, the exact cause is still unknown. It is also associated with certain underlying medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, gout, diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome and may occur as a consequence of hand surgery. Symptoms: - The patient may experience some discomfort at the base of the thumb or affected finger - Restriction in finger movements - Tenderness on pressure - Lump or swelling in the affected area - Painful finger movements - Catching, popping feeling - Symptoms are mostly aggravated at night, morning, or while catching an object firmly. Diagnosis: A trigger finger is often diagnosed clinically by a good physical examination and thorough case history. Treatment: Conventional treatment: The conventional or allopathic treatment usually calls for painkillers, anti-inflammatory medicines, and local steroid injections which are temporarily effective and help to give quick symptomatic relief. In some severe cases, surgery may be indicated. Splinting of the affected finger at night is also advised to get relief from swelling and pain. Homeopathic treatment: Homeopathy is strongly recommended for the treatment of trigger finger. There is a wide scope of homeopathy in the initial stages of the trigger finger. Early diagnosis and prompt homeopathic treatment along with certain hand exercises help in providing significant relief. There are certain homeopathic medicines that help in relieving the stiffness, inflammation of the underlying tendon, thereby reducing pain and easing out finger movements. Surgery can be postponed if the patient responds well to homeopathic treatment. Homeopathy may also be indicated in cases that have not responded to surgery. Some cases may start responding immediately after a few weeks of starting the treatment but some in chronic cases, the treatment may be advised for a longer time. At Life Force, we have recorded a few cases which have responded well and experienced a significant recovery in a few months of treatment. We would be happy to take up more cases of trigger finger and treat them with the best of homeopathic medicines. Unconventional thinking, scientific approach and innovative outlook If you want to bring a huge change, you have to take a huge step; and learn to think objectively from the outside. Dr Rajesh Shah, who was active in teaching in about 15 countries, from 1990 to 1998, decided to move outside of the circle and focus on the challenges and issues within the homeopathic profession. He disconnected himself from the profession, focused on clinical practice and research; concentrated on the challenges the homeopathy system faced. He realized a need for lateral thinking and started evaluating the science of homeopathy with an unconventional standpoint, unbiased perspective, different from the formal learning that he had. A need for a paradigm shift was identified. Homeopathy was found to become increasingly theoretical, unreasonably philosophical, and unscientific, in the hands of opportunist teachers, especially in the last three decades; who were far from the scientific understanding behind the science of homeopathy. Scientific research and development alone would take homeopathy to the next level, and the lack of which would lead to the decline recognized Dr Shah. In brief, starting from scratch, he started investigating the very fundamental principle of homeopathy by fresh experiment; and revalidated the truth of the Law of Similars, the fundamental principle of homeopathy. Further, he re-worked out some homeopathic medicines to examine the application of the principle; and reconfirmed. In the process, several flaws were identified and he corrected them, which had existed for over 150 years. He realized that the old repertoire of homeopathic medicines prepared 200 years ago would not be enough to address today's diseases. He started working on many new medicines, improved the processes and systems; introduced newer approaches and methods. He discovered that the homeopathic medicines available in the market today, are based on some basic data collected 200 years ago; which are almost obsolete now. He realized that a large part of the huge data used by the homeopathic practitioners is of doubtful origin, and the profession is completely unaware of it. This is dangerously serious. Urticaria What is Urticaria? Urticaria, which is commonly known as hives, is a discomforting skin condition that affects several individuals worldwide. It is also called nettle-rash, weals, or welts, and it's characterized by itching with rash or skin eruptions. Medically, urticaria is an allergic or non-allergic immunological ailment that reflects your skin and is accompanied by profound itching and development of the red round or irregular eruptions on any area of your body. Typically, the skin eruptions of urticaria are raised above the skin, erythematous, and itching. Usually, they turn worse with a slight local warmth and by itching. This skin condition can be chronic or acute, and, most often, it has a tendency to relapse frequently for years or months. [Also Read: Urticaria Cure: Myth or Reality?](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/urticaria-cure) Location & Duration: Any area of your skin can be affected by urticaria. Often, urticaria presents with angioedema, which is a condition affecting the deep tissues and resulting in swelling beneath the skin. Eruptions of urticaria may be limited to just a couple of spots or they may occur as widespread rashes for days or months together. Typically, lesions may last from 1 to 30 minutes, while certain lesions might last even longer. Also, some patients with urticaria may experience these unpleasant eruptions once in a while, while some may experience it several times in a day. The duration and frequency of these eruptions are as per the urticaria's variants, namely sub-acute, chronic, acute, and recurring. Urticarial eruptions have a tendency to vanish and reappear, and they happen to vanish leaving no trace behind. Histopathological View: The microscopic view tells that a typical rash or hives may perivascular cellular infiltrate comprising eosinophils & lymphocytes. Thus, it indicates an allergic behavior. Also, it reveals the findings concerned with mucosal inflammation and the swelling condition called edema. Urticaria: The Inner War: The urticarial rash, which affects your skin, is an inner immunological and allergic event that reflects on your skin. Even though the exact cause of hives is somewhat elusive, it is known to be a hypersensitive reaction occurring due to the release of histamine. When antibodies & antigens (IgG or IgM) combine in order to stimulate the immunological reaction, the mast cells produce histamine. Thus, urticaria is known to occur due to an antibody-antigen reaction. The released histamine or/and acetylcholine tend to cause the dilatation of the vessel resulting in swelling, pain, rash, and itching. Certain drugs and medicines, such as aspirin, morphine, antibiotics, and others, and foods, such as milk products, can trigger the symptoms of urticaria. Causes of Urticaria (Hives): Like several other ailments, most of us know more about exactly what happens in urticaria than what the exact [urticaria causes](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria-causes.aspx) are. Even though, in nearly 50% of cases, we know what induces or triggers urticaria, most of us have no clue about its exact cause. Several medical professionals and doctors believe that hives are an allergic reaction. But, it is important to note that this skin condition is not allergic all the time. The causes of chronic [urticaria](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria.aspx) can be allergic or non-allergic. Some of the non-allergic urticaria causes are stress, auto-immunity factors, drugs, hormones, exercises, temperature-related factors, and other causes. Here are some of the common factors, which can make you suffer from urticaria. 1. Allergens: One of the most common causes of urticaria known is allergens. There are numerous allergens which happen to induce urticaria. Hives occur due to the hypersensitivity of an individual to a certain allergen. So, certain allergens may affect some urticaria-prone people making them experience discomfort due to hives. 2. Food allergens: The consumption of certain foods can make some urticaria-prone individuals suffer from the unpleasant symptoms of hives. These are called food allergens. Some of the foods which can induce or trigger urticaria are milk, egg, protein products, nuts, cheese, cereals, wheat, certain pulses (daals), chicken, peas, fish, oranges, and other foods. Also, artificially-flavored food preparations and synthetic food additives can be one of the urticaria causes. Ensuring that the food allergens are excluded in the urticaria diet of the patient can help regulate the relapses of this condition. 3. Urticaria &Alcohol: Severe anaphylactic reactions to ingested alcohol are quite rare. We know that most reactions to the consumed alcoholic drinks are secondary to the rest of the chemicals in the drink, such as papain, metabisulfite, dyes, or others. But the fact is that there are some reports and cases of truly harmful, allergic reactions to alcohol (ethanol). In cases of such individuals, anaphylactic symptoms may be observed after they consume beer or/and wine. You may experience an urticarial rash after the ingestion of ethanol. Also, coming in the contact with ethanol may make certain individuals suffer from hives. 4. Environmental factors: Certain environmental factors too are responsible for the onset of hives. Some of them include the change in temperature, exposure to pollen, dander of buffalo, fungi, and other factors. Extreme heat, pressure, or cold too can make you suffer from the symptoms of hives. 5. Drugs: One of the prominent causes of urticaria is man-made drugs. These include NSAIDs, hormonal preparations, indomethacin, aspirin, and other anti-inflammatory drugs, foreign sera, contraceptive pills, vaccinations, antibiotics (like Penicillin), and other drugs. The animals, which are treated with penicillin, happen to excrete a little quantity of it in the milk, which can induce urticaria in sensitive individuals. 6. Cholinergic Factors: In some individuals, performing exercises, the change in the body temperature after sweating, and pressure on a certain body part can trigger the symptoms of urticaria. These changes tend to affect the skin's nerve ending that ultimately can make you suffer from hives. You may experience a burning sensation, itching, and local heat on your skin. 7. Urticaria & Cocaine: There are some cases of urticaria that are known to occur due to morphine. Individuals who smoke cocaine or inject heroin may suffer from bronchospasm. This is more common in individuals who have a prior history of asthma. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis to cocaine is known to be associated with increased IgE levels resulting in urticaria. 8. Infections & Infestations: Certain infections, such as frequent bacterial infections (UTI), fungal and protozoal infections, viral infections (like Hepatitis), are known to make people suffer from urticaria. Also, infestations, such as insect bites, worm infestations like tapeworms or roundworms, and others can lead to the symptoms of urticaria. Also, in some cases, domestic contact with pets can result in the symptoms of hives. 9. Synthetic Products: Certain synthetic products too are responsible for the onset of urticaria. These include the personal use of cosmetic products, such as talcum powder, deodorants, perfumes, some animal derivatives, and other synthetic products. 10. Emotional Factors: Emotional factors happen to play a vital role in the development of urticaria, particularly in the cases of chronic urticaria. Emotional stress and anxiety can directly or indirectly make you vulnerable to experience the symptoms of urticaria. Certain psychological factors can become the maintaining, triggering, or aggravating cause of hives. If you happen to suffer from stress, sadness, anxiety, insecurity, or intense emotions for a prolonged span of time, then these prolonged unpleasant emotions can alter your immunological state adversely and make you suffer from hypersensitivity leading to urticaria. 11. Autoimmune Causes: Certain autoimmune causes are responsible for the development of urticarial symptoms, particularly chronic urticaria. The existence of autoantibodies against IgE tends to cause the release of histamine, thus making you suffer from chronic urticaria. So, long-term hives tend to have an autoimmune link. 12. Systemic&General Disease: In some cases, urticaria may occur as a sign of some other general or systemic internal ailment, such as SLE, reticulosis, hormonal disorders (such as hyperthyroidism), polycythemia, and others internal conditions. In some types of cancer, urticaria can occur as a precursor. 13. Idiopathic Cause: It is important to note that some cases of urticaria occur and its cause happens to be unknown. So, an idiopathic cause is counted when it comes to the causes of urticaria as the exact cause of urticaria is not yet fully understood. Symptoms of Urticaria: The symptoms of urticaria are quite apparent. They are often round, irregular shaped, or vertical lines of the eruptions. They may appear on your affected skin singly or several in number. Urticarial eruptions may appear at once or they may occur and disappear and reoccur in a random manner. Intense itching is the most irritating and annoying symptom of hives as it is uncontrolled and makes the affected individuals impatient and restless. At times, itching and eruptions cause sleeplessness and disturbance at work. Besides these, Angioneurotic edema, which is also known as Giant Urticaria, may also occur in urticaria patients. It may make you experience severe skin swelling at deeper cellular levels i.e. edema. If it happens to involve your respiratory system with respiratory organs, such as the larynx, then you may experience suffocation and it may lead to a medical emergency. Also, your lips may get swollen terribly due to Giant Urticaria. Another variant of urticaria is dermatographism, which is uncommon occurring about 4%. In this condition, if you rub the affected skin forcibly and try writing on it with your fingertips, you can see your written letters raised on the kind. This is observed in a patient treated at Life Force.? Urticaria Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis of urticaria is usually done by examining the skin eruptions closely. Once the affected individual has observed and experienced this condition, the patient himself can identify urticaria. Careful and proper evaluation and analysis are necessary to diagnose this condition correctly. An evaluation of a systematic history of the patient is done in order to rule out the possibility of any systemic ailment, such as respiratory disease, endocrine disorders, allergic disorders, lupus, malignancy, and others. It may even need a thyroid profile and hormonal study as the clinical requirements would suggest. The rare possibility of malignancy is ruled out, at times, after studying various clinical findings and factors. Studying the clinical history of the patient in detail and considering the checklist of various causes and the affected individual as a whole is more crucial than going for superficial consideration, symptomatic medication, and certain anti-allergic medicines or the use of cortisone. [Also Read: Everything One Must Be Aware Of Urticaria or Hives](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/everything-one-must-aware-urticaria-hives/) Urticaria Treatment in Homeopathy The [urticaria treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria-treatment.aspx), particularly in chronic cases, needs to be addressed at the root cause of the ailment. As urticaria is an immunological disorder, its treatment needs to target to correct the disturbed or affected immune system in such a manner that hypersensitivity which causes urticaria is taken care of and the body of the affected individual does not react adversely, as it reacts with hives. As a matter of fact, antihistamines provide you only symptomatic relief from hives and they act superficially without correcting the root cause i.e. underlying problem with the immune system. This is why the effect of antihistamines remains for a short span of 8 to 10 hours and so you need to depend on these medications almost daily. Likewise, cortisone is another medication which when used to treat urticaria acts instantly to provide you great relief, but it is habit-forming. Also, cortisone comes with certain side-effects and you develop a dependency on it. So, cases of chronic urticaria that are dependent on the use of cortisone are more difficult to treat effectively. [Urticaria Homeopathy treatment](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria-treatment.aspx) is the best and safest treatment for this skin ailment. Homeopathy provides you with highly effective, safe, and research-proven treatment to help you obtain great relief from chronic and recurrent hives. Individuals suffering from chronic urticaria are most often dependent on the use of cortisone or antihistamine medications for lifelong by their regular physicians. Once a chronic urticaria patient begins to count on these dependent medicines, it becomes impossible for them to skip them even for a couple of days. So, you need to go for a treatment that is more effective and safe than antihistamines. And, it's homeopathy. [Also Read: Treatment for Urticaria - A Scratch for Every Itch](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/treatment-for-urticaria/) The Homeopathy Treatment Urticaria homeopathy treatment for the chronic cases of hives is promising, as it is quite advanced and developed by a scientific approach that not just aims to relieve the discomforting symptoms of urticaria but also treats the root of the disease present at the immunological level. [Urticaria treatment in homeopathy](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria-treatment.aspx) is designed to address and correct the patient's immune system, thus, in turn, it treats the urticaria at its roots from within. Dr. Rajesh Shah, M.D. has carried out outstanding research on chronic urticaria and its effective homeopathic treatment for more than 25 years. His research-based molecules are well-known for their international patent. His unique and effective homeopathic treatment protocol is made available to numerous patients of urticaria throughout the world. Today, there are many patients from 127 countries that are getting treated under Dr. Shah's care and guidance, and it's indeed a praiseworthy world record. Duration of Urticaria Treatment: The total duration of urticaria treatment differs from patient to patient based on the factors mentioned below. - The duration of Urticaria - The extent of spread (whether it's affecting mildly, moderately, or severely) - Allergic or non-allergic nature - If there is angioedema, the frequency of it (as the cases with frequent episodes of Angioedema are comparatively more difficult to treat than usual) - Current and past medicines followed by the patient. (Antihistamines or cortisone) - General health& well-being and associated ailments With urticaria homeopathy treatment, in chronic cases, one may experience a definite improvement in health in about 1 to 3 months. In the case of acute urticaria, one may experience positive results in hours. The total duration of medication for the cases of chronic urticaria can be from 4 to 8 months or even longer. Why Homeopathy for Urticaria? Urticaria treatment in homeopathy is highly effective and beneficial. Some of the prominent benefits of homeopathy are mentioned as below - Homeopathy provides excellent treatment for urticaria which is known to have a success rate of more than 80% to 85% - Homeopathy is known to work on appropriate immuno-correction so it ensures deep-level healing - Homeopathy provides the patient with a long-lasting cure and relief instead of a temporary relief. - Homeopathy is totally safe, non-toxic, and harmless on which you can count on anytime. As mentioned prior, urticaria is actually an external reflection of an internal immunological disorder or disturbance. So, the urticaria treatment should be one that would target immune system restoration by considering the necessary internal factors. Simply a symptomatic elimination of the urticarial eruptions won't be enough. And, [urticaria treatment in homeopathy](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/urticaria/urticaria-treatment.aspx) is exactly based on this philosophy so it addresses the root cause of the condition and promotes internal healing appropriately. The homeopathy system of medicine does not believe in the superficial treatment of urticaria by preferring merely some steroids or anti-histamines. The Homeopathic Approach: As an established rule, homeopathy never considers hives as a local disease. Urticaria is always considered as a local expression resulting due to a systemic disturbance in homeopathy. According to classical homeopathy, we, the experienced homeopaths, prefer to go for constitutional prescribing. So, we choose to consider an individual case study in detail of every patient with urticaria to recommend the most effective urticaria homeopathy treatment to him Chronic Urticaria: Its causes and long-term treatment When you experience urticaria for a long span of time it's called chronic urticaria. Recurring & chronic urticaria is one of the most challenging issues for medical science to tackle, as most often the times its exact cause is not clear. Besides this, unfortunately, this chronic skin condition is treated just symptomatically by the use of the conventional mode of treatment. As mentioned earlier, it is more difficult to learn what causes hives than the affected individual experiences during the episode of urticaria. When you experience the symptoms of urticaria for a short span of time or maybe just for some minutes, it is called acute urticaria. As a matter of fact, chronic urticaria (or recurring urticaria) is a major cause of concern since it keeps bothering you again & again, for instance, 3 to 4 times in a day for some months or even some years. Thus, this chronic skin condition poses a real challenge so you need an effective urticaria homeopathy treatment. [Also Read: How to Treat Urticaria during Pregnancy](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/treat-urticaria-pregnancy/) Here are some of the most common causes which can make you suffer from chronic or recurring urticaria. 1.

In some types of cancer, urticaria can occur as a precursor. 9. Idiopathic Cause: It is important to note that some cases of urticaria occur and its cause happens to be unknown. So, an idiopathic cause is counted when it comes to the causes of urticaria as the exact cause of urticaria is not yet fully understood. Dermatographism in Urticaria A severe form of expression of urticaria, where the affected individual is able to write on his affected skin area, is known as dermatographism. This happens due to an increased sensitivity of the skin, where if you press the affected skin with a fingertip or an object then the skin features raised eruptions of hives which may stay on the concerned skin for some time. Writing letters, words, or lines on the affected urticarial skin is known as dermatographism. You can find dermatographism in about 4% to 5% of patients suffering from urticaria. You can find the typical appearance of dermatographism in the image present above one of the urticaria patients who is treated at Life Force. In this case of hives, the eruptions are linear, swollen, raised, and inflamed which may be accompanied with or without any itching. Some patients with urticaria may not experience the discomfort of dermatographism on their skin, but they may suffer from pressure urticaria. Causes: What Goes Behind The Skin Writing? When one experiences dermatographism on the skin, it occurs as a result of a complicated role of the immune cells present in your body. Generally, this occurs because the blood cells tend to release histamine, which causes urticaria, in response to allergens or allergy. But, in the case of dermatographism, mast cells happen to release histamine without any presence of allergens. (Mast cells are the normal cells present in your tissues of the skin that are helpful in the healing of the wounds.) The weak membrane of mast cells is the cause of histamine release on account of the pressure. Even though the exact cause of the occurrence of dermatographism is not yet known, its trigger factors are similar to those of urticaria. Symptoms Of Dermatographism: The symptoms of dermatographism are words or lines which one writes on the skin affected by urticaria which is associated with swelling and itching. Dermatographism may last for some minutes or hours, and rarely days. In certain cases, hives may appear simultaneously elsewhere on the affected person's skin as well. The tendency of urticaria patient to experience dermatographism may last for some months or years. Treatment for Dermatographism: 1. Conventional Treatment For Dermatographism: Practically, the conventional treatment for dermatographism is quite similar to the urticaria treatment, which comprises antihistamines, cortisone, and H1 or H2 antagonists. By taking into account the symptomatic treatment option, it is very difficult to cure dermatographism due to its recurring tendency. 2. Homeopathic Treatment For Dermatographism: Homeopathic treatment for regulating dermatographism is highly effective, as it focuses on treating the root cause of dermatographism. In homeopathy, this severe skin condition is considered to be an expression on the skin of an immunological disturbance occurring internally. So, the dermatographism treatment in homeopathy is different than the urticaria treatment for simpler cases. Homeopathic treatment for dermatographism calls for another level of medicines. Most importantly, the results of treating the cases of Dermatographismwith effective homeopathy are quite positive. Urticaria Pigmentosa (Mastocytosis) Urticaria pigmentosa is a kind of skin ailment which is known to be a form of hives and mastocytosis. Due to it, you happen to develop brown patches on your skin with intense itching. By rubbing these brown skin spots, you may develop urticarial patches. Urticaria pigmentosa is one of the forms of mastocytosis. In order to understand what mastocytosis is, you need to first learn a bit about mast cells. As a matter of fact, mast cells are quite normal cells present in your skin throughout the body. They comprise particular granules, which when stimulated happen to release histamine and sort of other chemicals resulting in mastocytosis. Thus, mast cells can also be called inflammatory cells. Incidence: Generally, urticaria pigmentosa occurs in children and infants. But, some adults too may develop it. CausesOf Urticaria Pigmentosa: Even though the exact cause of this rare disease is not yet clear, some recent studies and research reveal that the genetic modification in a protein (known as c-kit) on the mast cells' surface may cause an abnormal increase in these cells. Variety Factors Which Can Cause Or Aggravate The Symptoms Of Urticaria Pigmentosa: - Emotional factors, such as stress - Physical stimuli, such as excessive exercise, heat, and friction - Eye drops comprising dextran - Morphine - Bacterial toxins - Alcohol - Venom SymptomsOf Urticaria Pigmentosa: - The presence of brownish skin lesions, particularly on the forehead and chest. - Development of fluid-filled blisters when scratched, particularly in kids. - The face of the affected person may turn flushed - Rubbing the affected sore skin result in a hive-like bump. - In severe cases of urticaria pigmentosa, headache, diarrhea, and palpitation may occur. Darier's Sign: In the case if urticaria pigmentosa, you can observe a peculiar presentation on the skin which is known as Darier's sign. On rubbing the brown patch of urticaria pigmentosa, the rubbed skin area turns swollen, red, and itchy. This expression confirms the occurrence of mastocytosis. Something About Mast Cells: Mast cells are the cells that are normally distributed widely in your skin. They comprise histamine and many other chemicals. When these mast cells in your body are disturbed, histamine & chemicals are released into your surrounding skin. The release of such chemicals leaks your blood vessels making you suffer from localized itching, swelling, and redness Diagnosis & Investigations: - Most often this skin disease is confirmed by clinical diagnosis. - The presence of mast cells is confirmed by the doctors by rubbing the affected skin. The presence of urticaria pigmentosa is confirmed if hives develop on rubbing the skin. - A skin biopsy reveals the boost in the mast cells which confirms the diagnosis. Here are some tests that help to learn more about it, if the symptoms indicate internal involvement. - X-rays of long bones of the body and skull may reveal areas of bone thinning and a diffuse ground-glass look. - The levels of 1,4-methylimidazole acetic acid or urinary histamine might be raised. Prognosis: - This skin condition vanishes on its own till the affected child attains puberty in 50% of the urticaria pigmentosa, but medicines are necessary since it's a trouble-causing ailment. - If it affects adults, it may develop into a more serious ailment known as systemic mastocytosis.

Conventional Treatment For Urticaria Pigmentosa: Treating urticaria pigmentosa with the conventional mode of treatment is very difficult. - Going for oral antihistamines is helpful as they minimize the mast cells' ability to release urticaria causing histamine. - A restricted role is played by the topical steroids. - In some cases, oral medication of disodium cromoglicate is beneficial as it acts as a mast cell stabilizer. - Photochemotherapy can help in treating it to some extent for longer periods. 2. Homeopathic Treatment For Urticaria Pigmentosa: Homeopathy is highly effective in treating urticaria pigmentosa. Homeopathic treatment considers genetic, allergic, and immunological factors while treating this skin disease and treats its root cause. Homeopathy offers highly positive, safe, and encouraging results in cases of this skin condition. So, homeopathy is strongly recommended for urticaria pigmentosa. The approach of homeopathic treatment is prominently based on constitutional therapy. Here are some of the recommended urticaria Use &Misuse Of Cortisone (Steroids) For Urticaria As a matter of fact, cortisone is no more helpful and effective for treating urticaria for a long span of time. Here are some reasons which explain why cortisone can't be used as a long-term urticaria treatment. - Initially, just for a short period of time, cortisone may help you. - You may experience a relapse of urticaria on curbing the use of cortisone. - The cortisone treated urticarial relapse tends to be more complex & more severe. - The cases of urticaria that are treated with cortisone are more complicated to treat. - At any stage of hives, it is wise to avoid the use of steroids. - Steroid tends to subject you to a vicious cycle of dependency. - If you happen to become steroid dependent, you need to get out of the vicious cycle. As per our experience and as far as the medical philosophy of homeopathy is concerned, cortisone is not a wise choice to treat or alleviate urticaria, be it in local, oral, or systemic form. As per the philosophy and the approach of homeopathy, cortisone happens to be a suppressive measure, and, in addition to this, after you stop using cortisone, there is always a possibility of relapse. What has been noticed in regular practice is that the use of cortisone tends to offer a dramatic outcome initially. However, the effect of cortisone is quite superficial, as the skin eruptions of urticaria, not just relapse after you curb the use of cortisone but also recur in a more aggressive manner. Here are some of the common observations due to which the use of cortisone is not preferred or not recommended. 1. Cortisone helps only superficially. 2. After stopping the use of steroids, relapse of urticaria occurs with the reappearance of the skin eruptions. 3. The skin eruptions recurring after the use of steroids happen to be more resistant than earlier. 4. Also, after you stop having steroids, the extent of urticarial skin eruptions increases in most of cases. 5. Some of the side-effects produced by the use of cortisone are lowered resistance, hampered immunity, disturbed hormonal cycle, and similar others. Here are some more facts which explain why suppression with cortisone is not recommended. As you know, urticaria is an expression occurring due to some internal disharmony. What cortisone does is that it masks the skin eruption without addressing and without correcting the internal cause. So, it is considered to be suppressive. Homeopathy never recommends the use of local cream for treating any kind of skin ailment, particularly hives. And, as a matter of fact, non-suppressive treatment is always regarded as superior for treating any medical disorder. Are You On Antihistamines? Antihistamine Is Not An Answer To Chronic Urticaria - by Dr. Rajesh Shah, MD If you happen to suffer from urticaria for a long span of time i.e. chronic urticaria (hives) by experiencing bouts of urticarial rashes frequently, your family doctor or dermatologist, most probably, would recommend you to have a daily dose of antihistamines. As a matter of fact, antihistamines are the medicines that tend to inhibit the histamine's action on your body. Histamine is a chemical resulting due to an allergic reaction occurring in the body that ultimately leads to the development of rash and itching. The effect of histamine is inhibited when an antihistamine medicine is ingested, thus, antihistamine relieves you from itching and skin rash. However, it is essential for you to understand that the release of histamine occurs on account of an allergic process in your body, which is basically immunologically mediated. So, the fact is that your body's immunological reaction to an allergen is the actual cause of the development of urticarial skin eruptions and itching. And, the release of histamine is not the basic cause of hives. In fact, histamine release is simply the outcome of an allergic reaction. Thus, by using antihistamines, you are treating and nullifying the effects of histamine i.e. you are treating just the effects of this skin disease and not addressing the actual cause of urticaria. In case you are consuming an anti-allergic or antihistamine medication for several months or years, it is very important for you to understand this crucial fact. Cetrizine, Allegra (Fexofenadine), Levocetirizine, and others are some of the common antihistamines that you can find people often go for. Also, you can find plenty of such medicines present in the market as over-the-counter medical products. For the occasional urticarial rash, the use of antihistamine can be justified. However, if one happens to use an antihistamine for many months & years, it should be regarded as superficial, symptomatic, and unwise. In my profound global practice, I come across patients of chronic urticaria every other day. Most of the patients of this chronic skin condition consult me for urticaria homeopathy treatment after going for antihistamines for many years. The most unfortunate part is that in spite of having antihistamines for a span of five years, the patients can't stop the discomfort of this skin ailment even for just five days. As soon as they stop having the antihistamines, the skin rash and itching discomfort recur in no time and this indicates that the treatment with antihistamines is superficial. It is important to note that long-term use of antihistamines is habit-forming. The most-concerning problem arising with the prolonged use of antihistamines is the patient's dependency on this drug. This means that the patient, who has an antihistamine for many months or years, tends to become addict to it and dependent on it. In the case of chronic urticaria, a deeper-level healing approach is necessary to get rid of urticaria from its roots. Fortunately, homeopathy offers such an effective yet safe urticaria treatment. The homeopathic treatment for this skin disease acts at an immunological level to address the concerned allergic process and treat the root cause of urticaria. The urticaria homeopathy medicine not only alleviates the symptoms of hives but it also treats the hypersensitive allergic condition of the urticaria patient effectively. Homeopathy is efficient enough to provide you a deeper-acting and non-habit forming remedy for longstanding cases of urticaria. Several patients worldwide who have experienced outstanding yet safe benefits of homeopathy know that it is possible to eliminate the dependency on antihistamines. Even though you cannot stop the use of antihistamines all of a sudden, there is a process that your homeopathic doctor would recommend you to follow to avoid the dependency on this drug and obtain great relief from this skin condition effectively. Adverse Effects Of Antihistamines Antihistamines, which are also popular as histamine antagonists, are used as conventional medicines for treating several allergic ailments, such as urticaria, colds, eczema, hay fever, and many other diseases. You can find that antihistamines are available as over-the-counter medicines in the market. As per their name, antihistamines are meant to act against the histamine release. Often, histamine is an end product resulting due to our body's allergic reactions, and it leads to the development of an allergic rash on our skin, such as inflammation, urticaria, and itching. Antihistamines are known to be the chemicals that inhibit the histamine-effect, so the discomfort and symptoms of urticaria are suppressed for some time, but the root cause of urticaria is not cured. As a matter of fact, histamine is one of the parts of our body's natural defense mechanism. So, the release of histamine is not bad or harmful per se. It is important to treat the allergens and hypersensitive state of the body. But, unfortunately, the conventional mode of medicine does not appreciate this idea. And thus, the use of antihistamines turns to be a more superficial and more suppressive solution than a curative remedy, as antihistamines do not address the disease at a deeper level. There are several medical products and antihistamines available in the market. Some of the most common antihistamines available are Cetirizine, Allegra (Fexofenadine), Levocetirizine, and many other medications. There exist many patients of urticaria who happen to consume Cetirizine, Allegra (Fexofenadine), or Levocetirizine regularly for a long time of months and years so much so that they almost become addict to the antihistamines, such as Cetirizine or Allegra. To regulate the symptoms of urticaria, antihistamines can be a good solution, But, they are unable to cure urticaria of its roots, particularly chronic urticaria. Here are some side-effects of the use of antihistamines for your reference. 1. A headache 2. Dullness of senses 3. Blurring of vision 4. Sleepiness or drowsiness 5. Giddiness 6. Loss of appetite 7. Dryness of mouth, nose, and throat 8. Feeling sick or vomiting 9. Constipation or loose stools 10. Difficulty in passing urine 11. Stomach upsets 12. Nausea and or vomiting 13. Irritability In case you are taking an antihistamine, it is important for you to check the instructions which are mentioned in the medicine's medical information. Often, it is recommended that you need to avoid driving after having an antihistamine as some of the antihistamines tend to make you experience dullness of senses and sleepiness after you consume them. Homeopathy Doctor in Vashi Testimonial Videos of Patients who got Best Results with Homeopathy Treatment Vitiligo What Is Vitiligo? [Vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/) is a somewhat unpleasant skin condition where a loss of pigment (melanin) of skin cells, which impart normal color to your skin, occurs resulting in white patches on the affected skin. Even though vitiligo happens to be a harmless skin disorder medically, it affects the social life of the patient adversely. Vitiligo-affected skin area varies from person to person. It can affect various parts of your body, and it can also affect the eyes, hair, and area within the mouth. It is a photosensitive condition such that vitiligo-affected areas are more sensitive to sunlight than the rest of the skin. Know information on Vitiligo and its Homeopathic Treatment [Vitiligo causes](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo-causes.aspx) due to either of the two processes which are mentioned below: 1. Melanin Cell Destruction: This causes the loss of normal skin color resulting in white patches of vitiligo. 2. Defective Melanin Formation Process: Due to the faulty melanin formation process, normal skin color is not formed resulting in patches of vitiligo. You can find vitiligo-affected individuals throughout the world. Vitiligo happens to affect about 2% of the total global population, which includes the population comprising white skin individuals. Around 8% of the total Indian & Mexican population tends to suffer from this skin disorder. As per the survey carried out by the American Academy of Dermatology, about 1% to 2% of Americans in the USA tend to suffer from vitiligo. Both males & females happen to get affected by vitiligo equally. This skin condition can develop at any age. Children of all age groups are affected by it. Vitiligo in childhood is common. We, at Life Force, have vitiligo patients of most nationalities (from more than 180 countries) possessing different skins under our care. So, we got a unique opportunity to understand this skin condition in a much better manner than what other ordinary clinics can. What Causes Vitiligo? Even though the exact vitiligo cause is not yet known, there are various causes known to be responsible for the development of this skin disorder. Several external and internal factors may predispose, worsen, or trigger, or maintain the unpleasant process which causes the onset of vitiligo. Most cases of this disease have a mix of various causes. Find some of the commonly known causes of vitiligo: - Autoimmune Cause: When the melanocytes in your skin happen to get destroyed mistakenly by the immune system, vitiligo occurs. As per the medical observations, particular genes present in the body may make the individual more likely to suffer from vitiligo. An overactive immune system may also cause vitiligo. As per a medical study, neuropeptide (i.e. NYP) may be responsible for the damage of melanin. The release of neuropeptide may occur as a response to emotional stress or skin injury, thus it happens due to a combination of causative factors. - Hormonal Changes: A hormonal disorder may cause vitiligo. Disorder of certain hormones, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) or thyroid hormone, can be one of the vitiligo causes. Hormonal changes occurring in the body, for instance, during the teenage, might be responsible for the progression of vitiligo. The occurrence of vitiligo and any other hormonal disorder simultaneously can occur due to an underlying genetic aspect. - Genetic/Hereditary Factor: Vitiligo may run in families. 20% to 30% of familial incidences of vitiligo are noted among the family members of the affected individuals. If one or both the parents happen to suffer from vitiligo, the chances are that their child may develop the same. But, it's not a rule. In several cases of vitiligo, the family history of this disease is not present. We came across a crucial observation by studying several patients that most vitiligo-affected individuals have one of their family members suffering from either one or more of the below-mentioned autoimmune ailments. a. Vitiligo b. Hypothyroid or an underactive thyroid c. Diabetes d. Alopecia Areata (patchy hair loss) e. Cancer f. Other auto-immune diseases (such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lichen planus, etc.) Vitiligo after injury - Neural theory - Autocytotoxic theory: According to this theory, melanocytes get self-destructed and so does the melanin. This might happen due to neural, genetic, stress, or immunological factors. - Stress - Exposure To Certain Chemicals: Symptoms Of Vitiligo: One of the most common [symptoms of vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo-symptoms.aspx) is the development of one or more milky white depigmented spots. You may find a single white spot or plenty of them present on your skin. Also, the shape of the white spot varies from round or circular to irregular. You may find an occurrence of generalized de-pigmentation over the entire body, in very few cases of this skin disease. Usually, vitiligo begins with a single spot and it expands in number as well as size. The affected individual may develop single to plenty of spots on his back, limbs, or abdomen that later spread to various other body parts. In some cases of vitiligo, the hair of the patient may turn grey indicating the loss of melanin at the hair roots. Certain vitiligo cases, where the body areas such as finger-tips, area around the eyes, corners of the mouth, and genitals are affected by this ailment, tend to come under the mucocutaneous junction category. Just like the spread of vitiligo is generally slow and progressive, its healing timespan too is quite long. Also, the symmetrical occurrence of the spots on the body's both sides (for instance, hands, legs, etc) is common. In very few and rare cases, vitiligo happens to affect and spread over the entire body of the person. Even though it's a common concern of most patients whether this disorder would spread to all their body areas, it happens quite rarely. How Vitiligo Spreads? Here are some factors which are responsible for the spread of vitiligo to various body areas of the affected individual. 1. Genetic activity 2. Continued Stress factors 3. Hormonal factors 4. Exposure to chemicals Actually, it is not possible to anticipate the pace at which the vitiligo would spread. In several patients with vitiligo, this skin ailment begins with a single white spot and the person might not even develop more spots for plenty of years or throughout his life. On the contrary, in some patients, vitiligo may spread quite rapidly, i.e. from one white spot to hundreds of spots, in just a few months. In some cases, vitiligo may spread intermittently. With rich experience, it is observed that individuals whose certain body areas, such as finger-tips, are affected by this unpleasant skin disease are at greater risk of experiencing an aggressive spread. However, it's not a rule. Some patients may develop grey hair, which indicates a loss of pigment in the hair root.

Surgical Modalities Comprises: A\u00b7 Autologous skin grafts: This surgical technique works by removing the skin from an area of the body of a patient and attaching it to some other area of his body.

Thereafter, the tops of these created blisters are cut out as per the procedure and transplanted to the other skin area which is depigmented due to vitiligo. However, this surgical process comes with the risks of deprivation of re-pigmentation and scarring.

Around 8% of the total Indian & Mexican population tends to suffer from this skin disorder. As per the survey carried out by the American Academy of Dermatology, about 1% to 2% of Americans in the USA tend to suffer from vitiligo. Both males & females happen to get affected by vitiligo equally. This skin condition can develop at any age. Children of all age groups are affected by it. Vitiligo in childhood is common. We, at Life Force, have vitiligo patients of most nationalities (from more than 180 countries) possessing different skins under our care. So, we got a unique opportunity to understand this skin condition in a much better manner than what other ordinary clinics can. What Causes Vitiligo? Even though the exact vitiligo cause is not yet known, there are various causes known to be responsible for the development of this skin disorder. Several external and internal factors may predispose, worsen, or trigger, or maintain the unpleasant process which causes the onset of vitiligo. Most cases of this disease have a mix of various causes. Find some of the commonly known causes of vitiligo: - Autoimmune Cause: When the melanocytes in your skin happen to get destroyed mistakenly by the immune system, vitiligo occurs. As per the medical observations, particular genes present in the body may make the individual more likely to suffer from vitiligo. An overactive immune system too may be a vitiligo cause. As per a medical study, neuropeptide (i.e. NYP) may be responsible for the damage of melanin. The release of neuropeptide may occur as a response to emotional stress or skin injury, thus it happens due to a combination of causative factors. - Hormonal Changes: A hormonal disorder may cause vitiligo. Disorder of certain hormones, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) or thyroid hormone, can be one of the vitiligo causes. Hormonal changes occurring in the body, for instance, during the teenage, might be responsible for the progression of vitiligo. The occurrence of vitiligo and any other hormonal disorder simultaneously can occur due to an underlying genetic aspect. - Genetic/Hereditary Factor: Vitiligo may run in families. 20% to 30% of familial incidences of vitiligo are noted among the family members of the affected individuals. If one or both the parents happen to suffer from vitiligo, the chances are that their child may develop the same. But, it's not a rule. In several cases of vitiligo, the family history of this disease is not present. We came across a crucial observation by studying several patients that most vitiligo-affected individuals have one of their family members suffering from either one or more of the below-mentioned autoimmune ailments. a. Vitiligo b. Hypothyroid or an underactive thyroid c. Diabetes d. Alopecia Areata (patchy hair loss) e. Cancer f. Other auto-immune diseases (such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lichen planus, etc.) Vitiligo after injury - Neural theory - Autocytotoxic theory: According to this theory, melanocytes get self-destructed and so does the melanin. This might happen due to neural, genetic, stress, or immunological factors. - Stress - Exposure To Certain Chemicals: Symptoms Of Vitiligo: One of the most common [symptoms of vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo-symptoms.aspx) is the development of one or more milky white depigmented spots. You may find a single white spot or plenty of them present on your skin. Also, the shape of the white spot varies from round or circular to irregular. You may find an occurrence of generalized de-pigmentation over the entire body, in very few cases of this skin disease. Usually, vitiligo begins with a single spot and it expands in number as well as size. The affected individual may develop single to plenty of spots on his back, limbs, or abdomen that later spread to various other body parts. In some cases of vitiligo, the hair of the patient may turn grey indicating the loss of melanin at the hair roots. Certain vitiligo cases, where the body areas such as finger-tips, area around the eyes, corners of the mouth, and genitals are affected by this ailment, tend to come under the mucocutaneous junction category. Just like the spread of vitiligo is generally slow and progressive, its healing timespan too is quite long. Also, the symmetrical occurrence of the spots on the body's both sides (for instance, hands, legs, etc) is common. In very few and rare cases, vitiligo happens to affect and spread over the entire body of the person. Even though it's a common concern of most patients whether this disorder would spread to all their body areas, it happens quite rarely. How Vitiligo Spreads? Here are some factors which are responsible for the spread of vitiligo to various body areas of the affected individual. 1. Genetic activity 2. Continued Stress factors 3. Hormonal factors 4. Exposure to chemicals Actually, it is not possible to anticipate the pace at which the vitiligo would spread. In several patients with vitiligo, this skin ailment begins with a single white spot and the person might not even develop more spots for plenty of years or throughout his life. On the contrary, in some patients, vitiligo may spread quite rapidly, i.e. from one white spot to hundreds of spots, in just a few months. In some cases, vitiligo may spread intermittently. With rich experience, it is observed that individuals whose certain body areas, such as finger-tips, are affected by this unpleasant skin disease are at greater risk of experiencing an aggressive spread. However, it's not a rule. Some patients may develop grey hair, which indicates a loss of pigment in the hair root.

Medical Treatment: Depending on the severity and type of vitiligo along with the health, age, and preference of the affected individual, a particular type of treatment is chosen. One or more combinations of treatments are recommended to alleviate vitiligo. B\u00b7 Topical PUVA Therapy: Topical psoralen photochemotherapy is recommended to the vitiligo-affected individuals, who have only a few depigmented patches present on a specific or limited part of their body. It is recommended for kids of 2 years of age and older having localized spots or patches of vitiligo. C\u00b7 UVB Phototherapy: As a matter of fact, narrowband UVB therapy is known to be a more effective vitiligo treatment in promoting re-pigmentation than PUVA therapy. UVB phototherapy aims at certain small lesions in particular. Radiations are directed to distinct skin areas by using selective narrow-band UV-B (311 nm) along with the fiber optics technique. D\u00b7 Oral PUVA Therapy: People who have extensive vitiligo, i.e. vitiligo has affected over 20% of their body, are recommended to go for Oral PUVA Therapy. Also, affected individuals who fail to respond to topical PUVA therapy are given Oral PUVA therapy. Usually, oral psoralen is not suggested for kids who are below 10 years of age, as it can increase the risk of eye damage resulting due to the conditions, such as cataracts. E\u00b7 Excimer Laser: Vitiligo treatment given by using 308-nm xenon chloride excimer laser is known to be a quite effective, well-tolerated, and safe treatment when it comes to treating chronic stable vitiligo which is restricted to lesser than 30% of the area of the body. This treatment works via immunomodulation by impacting T cells. When going for this vitiligo treatment, you may need it for greater than 12 to achieve satisfactory outcomes. F\u00b7 Topical Therapy Also, vitiligo is treated by using topical therapy. Corticosteroids, methoxsalen, calcineurin inhibitors, and trioxsalen are some effective topical agents that are utilized to carry out this therapy. Even though this therapy treats vitiligo significantly, it has a few adverse effects. 2. Ayurvedic (Herbal) Treatment For Vitiligo: Ayurveda, which is a Sanskrit word with the meaning that 'science of life'. As per Ayurveda, the life of a human being is a union of mind, body, soul, and senses. A 2000-years-old outstanding Indian Ayurvedic literature well-known as 'Charaka Samhita' explains vitiligo as 'Kilasa' or 'Svitra' along with some incredible suggestions for its treatment. Some experts and learned Ayurvedic physicians suggest the technique of therapeutic bloodletting (which is called Raktamoksha). It can be performed either by applying leeches topically on the vitiligo-affected skin areas or by using a surgical knife or a syringe for the same from the affected regions of the skin as per the therapy. Excess of pitta dosha present in the 'rakta dhatu' is eliminated by this technique.

Usually, surgical treatment is recommended for treating stable and localized vitiligo. Often, body areas, such as ankles, hairline, dorsal fingers, and forehead, lack the tendency of re-pigmentation. Vitiligo-affected individuals who have just small skin areas affected by this condition with a stable activity are best suited for surgical transplants. Generally, surgical treatment and methods are quite time-consuming and costly. Also, surgical vitiligo treatments are not paid off by the insurance carriers. Surgical Modalities Comprises: A\u00b7 Autologous skin grafts: This surgical technique works by removing the skin from an area of the body of a patient and attaching it to some other area of his body. Patients who have small skin areas with vitiligo patches are recommended to go for skin grafting. However, it is important to note that skin grafting surgical treatment needs time and is quite expensive. So, many patients do not find it affordable or pleasant. B\u00b7 Skin Grafts Using Blisters: This surgical process works by developing blisters on the pigmented skin area of the affected individuals by utilizing heat, freezing cold, and suction. Thereafter, the tops of these created blisters are cut out as per the procedure and transplanted to the other skin area which is depigmented due to vitiligo. However, this surgical process comes with the risks of deprivation of re-pigmentation and scarring. But, as compared to other skin grafting types of procedures, the risk of scarring with this technique is quite less. C\u00b7 Punch Mini-Grafting: Punch mini-grafting is another vitiligo treatment carried out by using a surgical technique. It utilizes small grafts of the donor, which are implanted into recipient sites' incision, and then, by using a pressure dressing, they are properly held in the place. The grafts then happen to heal easily and, in the time span of 4 to 6 weeks, it shows re-pigmentation.

What should 'your' doctor know about homeopathy? By Dr Rajesh Shah, M.D. (Information for patients and conventional doctors) The doctors of conventional medicine have not been trained to have a pragmatic view of homeopathy. As a result, without their fault, many of the conventional doctors have a view on [homeopathy](homeopathy-brief.aspx) which may be far from what is being called for. This is true with the doctors in most countries. Why so? The conventional medical view on homeopathy is supported by one or more of the following reasons: - Lack of knowledge about homeopathy - Lack of experience with homeopathy - Unwillingness to review homeopathy The entire conventional medical training is centered on understanding more and more about the smallest units of the human body. There has been a greater success than ever before. However, in the process, the totalistic philosophy is jeopardized. The conventional doctors are not trained to look around and incorporate the wisdom of another system of medicine. Lack of knowledge about homeopathy: The conventional doctors (called allopathic doctors in some countries) end up having a lack of knowledge about the following aspects of homeopathy and homeopathic education: - They are often ignorant about the fact that when conventional medicine was unpolished and cruel (late 18th century). - That homeopathy took birth in Germany, introduced by the doctor of medicine at that time, who was frustrated by bloodletting and ill practice in medicine, which has now developed into conventional medicine. - Homeopathy is taught as a medical course, almost identical to conventional medicine, except the subject of conventional pharmacopeia (in many countries.) - In other words, homeopathic education is not different than conventional 'medical' education, except for the line of treatment. - That homeopathy is a different treatment modality, not a different understating about the human body! - Homeopathy works for chronic diseases, where conventional medicine has limitations. - That disease investigational parameters are the same for homeopathic science. - That homeopathy is a medical science! (How ironic that one stream of medical science has no introduction to the other stream.) - That all forms of medical systems are nothing but parts of science viewed and applied in different manners. This is true with conventional medicine and homeopathy. - That surgery is also a part of homeopathy. Homeopathy is just a specialized medicinal therapeutics, whereby medicines are administered with a different philosophy while all other treatment modalities remain the same, which include investigations, diagnostic procedures (biopsy, MRI), surgical measures, medical procedures (dialysis, intravenous supplements, ventilators), and other supplementary therapies. - Most conventional doctors do not study the fundamentals of homeopathy hence have no knowledge whatsoever about this faculty which has survived for over 210 years. As a result, they end up criticizing homeopathy without prior comprehension. - That homeopathy is a faculty with great therapeutic scope, which is not yet a fully developed science. Anyway, which science is fully developed? Lack of experience: Medical science per se is based on empirical know-how, to start with. Conventional doctors due to many reasons fail to gain experience using homeopathy. Any criticism without personal experience is bound to be groundless. Some of the conventional doctors who are either open-minded hence opt for having experience using homeopathic [ medicines](homeopathic-medicines.aspx), either for themselves or for their family members, end up having positive views. Those who do not manage to have the first-hand experience, end up missing out on the benefits for themselves, their families as well as their patients. One will have experience either out of knowledge or need. If you know, you will make use of it. Some of the conventional doctors, who would have opposed homeopathy all life due to a closed-minded attitude, might suddenly come across a situation, where someone dear and near would need alternative medicine for a disease not treatable using the conventional treatment. And the doors open forever. However, there are people, who keep the doors rigidly shut, and would never let them open! Unwillingness to try homeopathy: In the age of information technology, the most pitiable state is to get information but still not try, out of prejudice. This is true with many conventional medical professionals, as the mindset is so prejudiced that they are just not willing to try new science. This is largely due to lack of exposure to homeopathy at the medical schools So, how does it matter? The question is that does it really matter if the conventional doctors do not understand homeopathy? Well, it matters little if a few million doctors in this world turn their backs to homeopathy. What matters more is when: 1. They do not guide their patients who need help for chronic diseases, where the conventional treatment would not work well. 2. When, simply due to ignorance, they discourage those patients who have done better homework about homeopathy, and are willing to opt for it. It is absolutely unwise to let billions suffer due to the ignorance of a million. Patients suffering from many chronic diseases all over the world remain deprived of the benefits of homeopathy, simply because homeopathy was not taught at conventional medical schools. Misconceptions, ignorance, and bias about homeopathy can be detrimental to the patients who are treated by conventional doctors. What is the solution? The openness of mind is a solution. Conventional medical schools all over the world can easily integrate short courses (introductory and advanced) as a part of regular training. Those who are already in practice could be exposed to homeopathy as a part of CME, continued medical education. This will help the physician in particular and the suffering of humanity in general.

What your doctor won't tell you about homeopathy? By Dr Rajesh Shah, M.D. (For information of patients and conventional doctors.) The conventionally trained medical doctors have opinions about various medical issues based on the training for about seven years with conventional medicine. They are best trained to opine on the subject of their training, obviously. They may not have been trained to opine about alternative medicine such as [homeopathy](/homeopathy-brief.aspx). Your conventional doctors may have certain opinions about homeopathy based on their little knowledge about it or largely based on the ignorance about homeopathy; in both cases, the opinion is likely to be biased. Over the period of 28 years of my practice inclusive of learning in the medical college, adequate exposure to medical and surgical subjects; also, my experience based on training to medical doctors in many parts of the world, I have observed that hundreds of doctors have limited and biased ideas about homeopathy; which, unfortunately, they pass on to their patients. As a result, knowingly or unknowingly, they become instrumental in depriving patients of the benefits of homeopathy Some of the common comments made by conventional doctors: Homeopathy does not work... It is very easy for anyone to comment negatively on any science. However, it can be considered valid only if the opinion comes either from professional training or personal experience. Please ask your doctor, if the opinion is based on his or her personal training. Ask, if the doctor has evaluated clinical studies published in the homeopathic medical world. It is helpful to find out if such an opinion is an arising out of serious experience or a wishful assumption. Homeopathy is a placebo therapy... Well, please find out from your doctors if or not he is informed about a number of clinical trials and animal studies suggesting that homeopathy is not a placebo therapy, but it has proven efficacy in controlled studies. Homeopathy is slow acting.. This opinion is partly correct. Homeopathy is relatively slow as compared to antibiotics, painkillers, cortisone, bronchodilators, etc. However, in chronic cases, what we are looking at long-lasting recovery rather than just fast and short-term relief. In that context, the slower pace of homeopathy is not a big limitation. In most cases, we (patients and doctors) are more interested in the treatment that is more deep acting and long-lasting rather than just fast but short-acting, except in critical care. There is no research done in homeopathy... It is true that relatively there is less research in homeopathy, compared to mainstream medicine. There is ongoing research in homeopathy. Homeopathy is a very old system of medicine and it is not relevant today. Well, those who make such a comment may be suggested to make some research into the history of medicine. Homeopathy is amongst the newest of medical systems. It is 210 years old, introduced by a German scientist Dr Samuel Hahnemann (1755 to 1843), as compared to conventional medicine, which dates backs to Hippocrates (460 BC to 370 BC). Homeopathy is a young science. And, it has been evolving. Homeopathy works only for functional and emotional diseases. The experience of thousands of practitioners and millions of patients confirm that homeopathy also works in the cases of physical pathology such as intestinal ulcers, fissures, chronic inflammation, infections, skin lesions, arthritis, etc. There are tons of documented cases proving this fact. Homeopathy is not recognized by the FDA, WHO, Government, etc. The US FDA and similar agencies in most developed countries have approval for [homeopathic medicines](/homeopathic-medicines.aspx). The WHO has approved homeopathy and it has been accepted as an alternative system of medicine. Most of the developed courtiers have recognized homeopathic medical colleges including the United States, UK, Germany, India, Australia, and other 150 countries. Many scientists, medical doctors, prime ministers, and presidents of many countries, government officials, authors, film stars, teachers, etc. prefer to opt for homeopathy. Unfortunately, many patients are deprived of the benefits of homeopathy due to their doctor's ignorance. Let us see what the doctors WOULD NOT say about homeopathy: Homeopathy is good for chronic diseases... It is likely that your doctor would not tell you that [homeopathic treatment](/homeopathy-treatment.aspx) is very good for chronic diseases, in particular. This suggestion may not come due to ignorance, lack of experience, or fixed ideas. Conventional treatment is good for acute disease while homeopathy is more effective for chronic diseases. The conventional doctors are not likely to suggest it due to the reasons stated in the previous comment as above. For a particular range of diseases, homeopathy is strongly suggested. A wide range of chronic diseases such as migraine, psoriasis, arthritis, asthma, allergies, ulcerative colitis, warts, urticaria, etc. homeopathy is distinctly effective. But, it is possible that your doctor would not say it. I take homeopathy treatment for myself and for my family... Many conventional doctors opt for homeopathic treatment for themselves and for their own family members. Only a few would admit. My experience in treating a large number of conventional doctors suggest that the narrow opinion about homeopathy that most of them have is largely due to the educational system, which allows us (all doctors) to think with limited knowledge. We have been, actually, taught to think limited, think pond size, rather than think ocean size. As a result, we tend to form biased opinions. Experience says that many of the conventional doctors think of homeopathy only when their own family member needs it. If a doctor or his child suffers from a disease that is not treatable using conventional treatment; that makes the doctor think of alternatives such as homeopathy. It would be much desirable that the doctors learn to think of homeopathy when even a single patient fails to respond to conventional medication. \u00a9 This article is written by Dr Rajesh Shah, M.D., for the information of patients and conventional doctors.

India (Summary: Misconstruction has surrounded homeopathy ever since its inception. Even after 200 years, homeopathy has remained the most misunderstood or ill-understood medical science ever; unfortunately, within the homeopathic profession as well. The diversity of viewpoints on the scope of treatment in the profession may not be a healthy sign for the growth of science. Homeopathy is among the youngest of medical sciences calling for a modern approach and extensive research. Some points related to misinterpretation about various facets of homeopathy, by the homeopaths, are raised and discussed.) From dictionaries to the encyclopedia to websites and books, it is almost explicitly explained 'what is homeopathy'; however, it is equally important to discuss what homeopathy is not. Homeopathy is one of the most mysterious science streams, which is highly ill-understood, misunderstood, over-understood, and hence there exists confusion in the minds of not only the lay-people (patients) but also the homeopaths themselves. After having spent almost three decades in the study, learning, practicing, teaching, promotion, and research in the field of homeopathy, I will rightfully share my thoughts and concerns; explaining what actually is not homeopathy. Homeopathy is not a miracle medicine: Many people believe that homeopathy is a miracle science, it can make a magical cure for even the most incurable diseases such as cancer, comatose stages, paralysis, etc. Actually, it is not. Homeopathy is simply a science-based on certain laws (law of similars, comparable with that of vaccinations); with its own scope and limitations. There are rules, parameters, and methods of application, which determine the scope of treatment. Homeopathy is very effective but please do not expect magic or miracles. Homeopathy is not a panacea: One of the myths about homeopathy is that it is a cure for all, a panacea. It is not. Homeopathy enjoys all the joys of the scope of its application, as well as the limitations of the science. No medical science can be a panacea. Homeopathy can cure the early stages of Rheumatoid arthritis but not the deformities, which go with it, as an example. Homeopathy is not just mind-based medicine: One of the hardest concepts about homeopathy is that homeopathy is based largely on the understanding of the mind. The homeopathic fraternally is also not fully saved from this misbelief. The study of mental attitudes, emotions, and mindset are one of the important aspects of patient-study in homeopathy. However, it is not the sole determining factor. Many homeopaths, especially in the western world, have a delusion that homeopathy is almost identical to mind-medicine. Homeopathy study encompasses, actually, the disease, the nature of pathology, the kind of immunological or hormonal changes, the physical components (perspiration, thermal preference, sleep, etc), and the mental sphere; all or most of them put together, depending on the case. Homeopathy is more than psychosomatic: Many homeopaths tend to relate disease or pathology in patients to some emotional parameter, almost always as cause and effect phenomenon. For example, diabetes due to stress in a relationship or arthritis due to grief due to the death of a loved one, etc. Psychosomatic is profoundly comprehended and valued in homeopathy; however, not necessarily as a causal phenomenon, but more as a part of the totality. There is no need to forcibly connect major emotions as the cause for the development of every disease in all patients. Homeopathy is not spiritual: Since homeopathy is based on the potentized (incredibly minute) dose of the physical substance, which cannot be measured with the current scientific methods, many have theorized and connected homeopathy with spirituality. It seems interesting to read some correlation between the two; however, it may be detrimental to the growth of homeopathy if taken away from science and towards spirituality. Comparing 'vital force' with 'sole' and miasms with 'Buddhism' will take homeopathy away from scientific growth. Homeopathy is not-yet-fully-understood science, so, to some, it might look like some form of spirituality. Homeopathy is not placebo therapy: The skeptics have always criticized homeopathy as placebo therapy, due to a lack of adequate research as per modern medicine guidelines. Since the results using homeopathic medicines are fairly reproducible, measurable, and documentable, I would strongly say that homeopathy is far beyond placebo therapy. Homeopathy is not faith healing: The next label from skeptics is that homeopathy is nothing but faith healing. Homeopathy has worked a million times for those who did not believe in it. Also, babies, domestic and wild animals, respond to homeopathy; proving homeopathy to be more than placebo therapy. Cases of Hepatitis C, for example, where an objective parameter such as a drastic reduction in viral load after homeopathic medicines; is very hard to achieve with faith healing. The skeptics should try out homeopathy, I suggest. Homeopathy is not necessarily 'single remedy' magic: The homeopathic professionals have been taught to be dogmatic about the use of 'single remedy' at a time, for all patients, all the time. It is very hard to break this fixity and evolve from this rigid shell; which even the father of homeopathy, Dr Hahnemann, could not outgrow in his time. The homeopaths tend to be either emotional when it comes to talking about the use of more remedies in a given case or shy away from discussing it. The profession has yet to enter into a scientific discussion about so-called poly-pharmacy (multiple medicines). No complex case be cured using a single remedy forever, barring only a few exceptions. I deal with very severe pathologies such as Ulcerative colitis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Nephrotic Syndrome, etc. where it is not possible to administer a single remedy and wait. Every delay could be detrimental and not justified. Homeopathy is not just 'single dose' therapy: 'Single remedy, single dose' is the magic phrases found in homeopathic textbooks; no more relevant in today's medical practice. I have practiced the said phrases very religiously for over a decade and a half; and have evolved from dogmatism. Sticking to the idea of a single remedy and single-dose could even lead to criminal intransigence. Homeopathy is not dream-based treatment: Some teachings have led to creating a cloud of delusion amongst some homeopaths, which believe that the practice of homeopathy can be based on the understanding of patient's dreams. The study of dreams is one of the twenty-odd parameters in homeopathy; one of the most unreliable, indeed. Its importance should not be overemphasized. Most treatments do not lead to suppression: Over importance to the theory of suppression of diseases in homeopathy is misleading, very often. Yes, the use of immunosuppressive medicines such as corticosteroids, etc. leads to suppression of the immune system, eventually taking the disease to deeper levels. This is very well understood in homeopathic philosophy. However, an extension of the concept of suppression, whereby some believe that anti-fever (paracetamol, Tylenol), painkillers, antibiotics, always lead to suppression; and must always be avoided. This is not true, in my opinion. This calls for scientific debate. Homeopathy is not that slow: The proponents of homeopathy claim that homeopathy is not slow. Actually, this is partly true and partly not. Homeopathy is not slow in chronic diseases. It relatively slow in acute diseases and could be very slow in the treatment of critical diseases. Homeopathy is not a very fast-acting medicine: Homeopathy is not very fast, either. Let me be honest. Homeopathy is neither very fast nor very slow. We need research to make homeopathy faster, I would say. Homeopathy is not simply 'constitutional medicine': Any contradiction to the concept of constitutional medicine is a potential trigger for third world war, amongst homeopaths at least. After twenty-five years of intense homeopathic practice, I believe that the 'constitutional medicine' is a hype created in the profession. It calls for a review and re-evaluation. It is a huge topic, cannot be discussed at length here. In brief, I would say, all cases may not find a constitutional medicine and can still be treated with success. Homeopathy is not suitable for all acute and critical diseases: One school of thought is that homeopathy can cure each and every acute and critical disease such as cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, acute renal failure, severe pneumonia, acute myocardial infection (heart attack), and the like. I strongly opine that it is not true. Homeopathy is a science having a limitation whereby severe acute and critical disease situations cannot be consistently treated with success. Please read the word 'consistently' with emphasis. Success with some cases, on some occasions, may not be enough. The results have to be comparable with modern medicine; in order that we ethically claim the success of homeopathy in severe acute and critical illnesses. Every disease is not curable, even if the remedy is right Many people and some homeopaths believe that if symptoms of the patient match with some medicines, every disease becomes curable. In other words, if the medicine selection is perfect, the cure is certain; irrespective of the nature of the disease. This is not true. The curability of any disease depends on several factors such as 1. Nature of the disease. For example, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) may be curable; while cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver is not curable. 2. The extent of pathological change. For example, fewer patches of Alopecia Areata (hair loss patches) are curable; but total hair loss (Alopecia totalis) is not curable. 3. Reversibility of the disease process and outcome. Inflammatory arthritis can be helped but [Osteoarthritis (bony overgrowth)](https://www.askdrshah.com/osteoarthritis.aspx) cannot be reversed. 4. Selection of the correct homeopathic remedies. Homeopathy is not beyond modern medical science: The well-evolved medical knowledge acquired by medical science is very much required for the evolution of homeopathy. Homeopathy does not claim to be beyond modern medical science. In fact, it is high time to understand that homeopathy and medical science are not distinctly different as far as the 'medicine' is concerned. They are not contrary but complementary and collaborating; belonging to the same medical science. Homeopathy is not against modern medicine: Some may believe that 'modern medicine' and homeopathy against each other, contrary; kind of enemies! I have always wondered, how such concepts have grown in the minds of medicos, homeopaths, and lay-people. Homeopathy is just a science; a part of medical science. If we look at the evolution of engineering sciences, do we believe that computer engineering is contrary to electronics; mechanical engineering opposing to electrical or civil engineering? Not really. They all are complementing each other. Why don't we have maturity when it comes to medical sciences? Homeopathy is not against surgery: One of the myths among laypeople, modern medicos, as well as surgeons is that homeopathy is against surgery. Surgery is a part of homeopathy. Surgery is a science and art by itself. Surgery is neither a property of modern medicines nor of homeopathy. It has to be understood that homeopathy is a therapeutic method of treating diseases in a certain manner. Surgery is a method of treating diseases in a different manner, without medicines. Both are complementary to each other. Precisely, therefore, the homeopathic training in India trains every homeopath for basic surgery, at the undergraduate level, as much as it trains a modern medico. Every qualified homeopath in India is a physician and a surgeon. This is not a case in the western world, though. While evaluating what homeopathy is all about; it would be equally important to understand what homeopathy is not. I hope this piece of article will stimulate many. What is homeopathy and what does it have to offer? Note: This page has important information for the believers and skeptics of homeopathy. Many scientific references are given on this page. What is homeopathy? Simply put, homeopathy is a German system of medicine, which is based on the principle that any substance having a capacity to produce disease state (in the humans or animals), also has a built-in capability to remove or reduce the similar disease if administered in a very small dose. To simplify this further, if pollen or virus could produce colds or flu-like symptoms; it also means that, if pollen or virus are given to humans in a very small dose (called potentized dose), they could reduce or remove the symptoms of the disease caused by pollen or virus. Is it a vaccine? Homeopathy is like a vaccine but not a vaccine. Actually, it is different than a vaccine in many ways; however, the principle behind homeopathy and vaccine is very similar. Both are based on the Law of Similars, which is the fundamental principle of homeopathy. Very interestingly, homeopathy and the first vaccine, both were born in the same year 1796. Dr Shah always says that homeopathy is an advanced version of vaccination; with a wider therapeutic application. Simple logic based on Nature's principle: It has been observed in nature and proved in the laboratories by the scientists working on hormesis, that a low dose of toxic substances has anti-toxic effects. One of the examples if that of low dose radiation. Attenuated vaccines prepared from microorganisms are the best examples of the logic of the Law of Similars. Different than vaccine: Vaccines use 'attenuated' organisms; homeopathy uses potentized substances, including organisms. Vaccines are microbes, while homeopathic medicines are prepared from microbes, chemicals, minerals, toxins, animal products, and vegetable sources. Vaccines are used only for the specific infections that they are sourced from. For example, the Measles vaccine for Measles. Homeopathic medicines are used for a wider range of diseases. For example, homeopathic medicine prepared from Arsenic is proved efficacious not only for Arsenic toxicity but also for diseases such as common cold, gastritis, and Lichen Planus, since Arsenic has an inherent capacity to produce the above diseases. What does homeopathic medicine contain? For the time of its conception in 1796, it was believed that homeopathic medicines contain some energy; as it was not possible to detect it contains due to is micro-nature. However, the recent breakthrough research at IIT (B) (Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai) has proved that homeopathic medicines contain nanoparticles of the original drug substance. Now, we have started understanding homeopathy as nano-pharmacological medicine. Is it proved that homeopathy works? Besides the enormous clinical evidence created by thousands of homeopathic doctors in the last 200 years by treating millions of patients from across the world, the scientists in the fields of molecular biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and modern medicine, have proved a number of times the efficacy of homeopathy in cell line models, animal models, as well as human (in-vivo) models. Many authentic clinical trials have exhibited the therapeutic efficacy of homeopathy. What about the controversy surrounding homeopathy? Due to the very nature of ultra-dilute homeopathic medicine, it naturally received criticism for containing 'nothing' inside them! It is only recently that it is discovered that the medicines are in the form of nanoparticles, which was not comprehended until recently due to the lack of such technology. Also, due to its immeasurability of substance, homeopathy could not be tested using the traditional research models. However, the recent research using the conventional methods of research5 has proved the efficacy as well as the possible mechanism of action of high dilution homeopathic medicines. More rigorous research is required. Which diseases can homeopathy help? Homeopathy is a system of medicine with its own strengths and limitations. It can help a wide range of disease conditions at different stages. On this website, Dr Shah has extensively explained the scope of homeopathy. In brief, homeopathy can treat a large number of chronic diseases and some acute diseases. Please [ click here](https://www.askdrshah.com/disease-list.aspx) to see the extensive list of diseases homeopathy can treat. Please [click here](https://www.askdrshah.com/disease-list.aspx) for some common and uncommon diseases that homeopathy can treat. Homeopathic treatment does not go simply by the names of the diseases. Some of the factors which determine the curability of the disease are as follows. - Nature of pathology or tissue changes - The extent of the disease - Chronicity of the disease - The complexity of the disease - Genetic factors - Age, food habits, the lifestyle of the patient - Previous and current medicines used - Patients sensitivity, susceptibility, and overall health - Proficiency of the homeopathic doctor to apprehend the case of the patient Which diseases homeopathy cannot help? Homeopathy cannot treat diseases where there are irreversible tissue changes. For example, Cataract, hernia, large tumors, mechanical obstructions, severely prolapsed intervertebral discs, etc. Also, homeopathy is not the first choice of therapy for very acute or critical diseases such as septicemia, severe infections, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cerebral malaria, myocardial infarction (heart attack), etc. Homeopathy is also not indicated for most of the truly surgical diseases such as the ruptured appendix, heart blocks, cancerous tumors, fractures, lipomas, prolapsed piles, large fibroids, etc. Is it safe for children? Homeopathy is safe for everyone, even for newborn babies and pregnant mothers. They are essentially free from side effects when prescribed professionally.

If you face any difficulty, send a query to Dr Shah's team of doctors by [clicking here.](https://www.askdrshah.com/tests-tools.aspx) Homeopathy treatment can be taken with conventional (allopathic) medicines: Chronic and complex diseases need the integration of homeopathic medicines and conventional medicines. Depending on the nature and the extent of the disease, both the medicines could be taken simultaneously, for better results. For example, acute attacks of the following diseases are better-taken care of by conventional medicines, while the disease can be treated from roots to reduce the frequency of episodes: Frequent colds, asthma, reconstituted homeopathic remedy; a possible explanation for clinical efficacy and favorable gastrointestinal tolerability, Inflamm. res. 53 (2004) 150-157, 1023-3830/04/040150-08, E.

Seven Tests for Females: This small list of tests can save you from big problems. 1. Blood pressure: Regular blood pressure check by your family physician is helpful. After 30 years of age, make it once in six months. After 40 years, once in 3 months is recommended. 2. Cholesterol: Blood tests for cholesterol, once a year will be a good idea for all age groups after 25 years of age. If you are obese and have a family history of heart disease, you can have a check once in six months. 3. Thyroid profile: Once in a year of thyroid check is helpful. If you are putting on weight, if you have a family history of Underactive thyroid, you can get it checked once in six months. It is a simple and inexpensive blood test. 4. Breast examination: Self-examination of the breast to timely detect a lump helps in the early detection of cancer. 5. Blood Sugar: A simple blood test of fasting and post-food samples helps to detect diabetes. This test can be combined with cholesterol, thyroid hormone tests, once a year, after the age of 30. 6. Pap smear: It is a test for timely detection of cancer of the cervix; suggested once in two years after the age of 21 years. Your local gynecologist can do it at a small cost. 7. Bone density: Bone density test has now become available in most countries; suggested after the age of 40 years, once in three years. * These are important tests suggested by Life Force. The test and frequency may vary from patient to patient depending on individual history. Related conditions: - PCOD - Underactive Thyroid - Endometriosis "}
