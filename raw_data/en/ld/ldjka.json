Subjects of the study were asked who the opinion polls said would win the presidential election between Richard Nixon and John Kennedy and whom they voted for. The study showed. he said. \"that whatever these people thought the polls had said. they were equally as likely to vote for one candidate as they were for the other.

The optional fee plan, accor\u00ad ding to the senate's guidelines, would allow any recognized student organization with the necessary support to distribute computer cards to the student body at registration , These cards when signed by the student, would authorize the organization to charge an additional activities fee. The fee solicih.>d by the organization could not exceed $2. and the total amount of additional option fees one student could pay could not be in excess of $10. according to the guidelines , Also adopted in the Senate's guidelines was a 3O-day grace period in which a student could cancel his authorization If he signed the card by mistake or changed his mind. ISpmG V senate The guidelines came as the act in an on-going battle be\u00ad tween Iowa Student Public In\u00ad terest Group (lSPIRG) and cer\u00b7 tain members of the Senate. ISPIRG members have been attempting to arrange a fees plan to support their organlzation since March of last year, running into problems decidmg how they wanted to collect their fees. Graduate student, Michael Pill, member d the student body executive. said the organization just \"couldn't get it together.\" \"They gave us four memos in six months.\" Pili said, \"They just kept changing their mind, so we finally had to step in and organize things.\" The early drafts of various fee proposals, according to Pill. \"Would have lellSPIRG m and no one else. \" The new guidelines, accor\u00ad ding to Pill, protect other organizations as well. including the Senate Scholarship Fund. \"They are more comprehen\u00b7 sive.\" he added. Not tailored \"We are not suggesting policy just to concern ISPIRG,\" said Cooperative member Susan Ross. A3, \"1 don't want anyone to think this is being tailor-made to one organization . \" According to Pili, however. several of the sections of the guidelines were pulled directly from earlier proposals of ISPIRG. The 35 per cent figure was an amendment to the original sec\u00b7 tion which would have reqUired Although the ISPlRG situa\u00ad tion was used as an example at the meeting Tuesday night, var\u00ad ious senators stressed they were not \"tailormaklng\" the proposals /D {SPIRG. 50 per cent of student support to get in on the optiooa I fees plan. \"That 50 per cent was set by ISPIRG for themselves in everyone of their proposals.\" PIU said, That figure was changed Tuesday night after the enate adopted an amendment pre\u00ad pared by Alan Stowell, 1.3, a member of the ISPIRG organ\u00ad izing committee and submitted by senator Jerry North, Lt, a member of th committee last year. Pill cautioned th senate Tuesday night to adopt some sort of prevenli ve mea ure to hinder ISPIRG from using last year's petillon signed by almost 50 per cent of the student body to get 10 on the plan thi year. \"I would say If I PIRG tried to use it I last year's petition).\" Pi II said. ., It would be an outright misu e of that petition ... \"Those signatures were collected under the old 50 per cent proposal last March. \" Gary Sea, A3. member of th ISPIRG organiZing committee , says the organization initially proposed 40 per cent tudent support to the university adminlstraUon as the figur to alloll' an optional fee plan. .. A decentralized campus such as we have at Iowa makes it virtually impossible to get 50 per cent of the ludents,\" Sea said Wedn day. \"We only got 8,460 validated Ignalure on the pe~iUon after months of work.\" Minor wall damage and a destroyed mattress were the result of a fire in W214 Hillcrest, occupied by Thomas Lange. AI. City fireman said the fire late Wednesday afternoon resulted from \"careless smoking,\" when a cigarette was dropped on the bed. Photo by Tappy Phillips At that time they presented the State Board of Regents. with an optional fees plan. As explained by [SPIRG president, Garry J. DeLoss. the plan would have placed an optional $1.50 charge on every student'S U-Bill each semester. City counter-claim filed in ramp suit Object to handling of local crime unit A refund mechanism was also built into the proposal. The Regents turned it down on the basis that they did not wish \"to become 8 collection agency\" and scheduled ISPIRG to present a new proposal in April. City Attorney Jay H. Honohan filed a counter-claim Wed\u00ad nesday to a lawsuit against the city and city councilmen which seeks to bar a sale of revenue bonds to finance a proposed downtown Iowa City parking ramp. officlais have said, th SUIt'S allegations could be an attack on all r venu bonding in Iowa. The counter-clalm contends that \"the city council has acted legally\" and th bonds will be repaid \"solely from the revenue of the parking system of the City of Iowa City.\" Members of the Johnson County Regional Planning Com\u00ad mission are upset by lack of local input into the development of an area crime commission. At the planning commission 's meeting Wednesday night, a report from the group'S Justice and Human Relations Commit\u00ad tee stated objections to the ways the project is being handled by the Iowa Crime Commission. Of the seven counties involved. only Linn County has been directly involved in the project so far, the committee reported. Other counties in the Area 10 region include Johnson. Benton. Jones. Iowa, Washing\u00ad ton and Cedar counties. asking us what we think about it. .. Propo 01 In April, ISPIRG announced they were sponsoring a drive to change the system of man\u00ad datory activites fees into a check-Q(( system In which students would be given the choice of which organlzations they chose to support with the fee. rather than having it man\u00ad datorily divided by the univer\u00ad sity. That bond issue died Tuesday when the bond purchasers notified the city they are unwilling to accept a delay in delivery of bonds brought on by the suit. The suit against the city claims that tax funds have been and will be used to pay part of the ramp construction ts and revenue bond interest fee . Mort Koser, North Liberty commission member said, \"We were supposed to have input into this thing. along with the other counties. but we have not been asked or informed that we could have input. \"It sounds to me like someone up there is dictating what this thing should be. instead of The commission voted to meet with the other counties involved October 4. to see if the problem could be resolved on a local level. The commission approved a proposal by Iowa City member Pat White to grant the Justice Committee power to take the matter to the State Crime Com\u00ad mission and to the Governor's office if the problem cannot be resol ved on a local level. This plan was abandoned In July. The counter-claim filed Wed\u00ad nesday in Johnson County District Court asks that a declaratory judgement be issued to clear up the legal con\u00b7 troversy over the use of revenue bonds to finance the ramp. It was filed last week by the Johnston Law Offices on behalf of R. Thomas Douglass and John C. McLaughlin, both University of Iowa professors. and Warren Paris. a UI News Service photographer who headed the Citizens Against the Ramp in a bonding referendum battle last pring. Brandt BONN, Germany lAP) -Chancellor Willy Brandt set the stage Wednesday for a parlia\u00ad mentary maneuver to end prematurely the term of office which brought him the Nobel Peace Prize and clear the way for general elections he hopes will restore his majority. In the only device permitted by Bonn's rigid constitution to dissolve the Bundestag before the end of its four-year term, Brandt asked the lower house for a vote of confidence he knows he cannot win when it takes place on Fridav. Brandt told the 496 BWldestag lawmakers the self-contradictory move was forced on him by the loss o(his ruling majority four months ago, when defecting government legislators left the lower house split 248 to 248 in an unprecedented stalemate.

Page 2A-The Dally Iowan-Iowa City, Iowa-Thurs., Sept. 21, 1972 PAT pleased at new renter power Court ~._ g favors tenants ByALANGRUNDMEYER Staff Writer An Iowa Supreme Court ruling Tuesday will give home and apartment renters a strong new power to combat landlords who rent unsafe or unsanitary dwellings. The court ruling departed from the 'antiquated concept' of caveat emptor or 'let-the\u00ad buyer-beware' in favor of \"an implied warranty of habita\u00ad bility-at least to the extent of freedom from la tent defects and material violations of housing code requirements' in leases. Kenters now have a legal basis to sue landlords for damages if the property rented is unsafe, unsanitary, in violation of housing codes or conta ins other flaws which were not easily detectable when the lease was signed. Jim Ryan. coordinator of the Protective Association for Tenants (PAT) was extremely pleased with the surprise ruling of the Iowa High Court. . \"The Iowa Supreme Court made it quite clear.\" said Ryan. \"that renters will have the opportunity to make land-owners liable. It will mean people who rent older homes in Iowa City will have some oppor\u00ad tunity to keep their places in livable condition. \" Iowa City and Coralville have minimum housing requiremen\u00ad ts. Previously . the inspector. if the house wasn't in poor enough shape to be condemned. could only make recommendations to the landlord,\" Ryan explained. Now the inspector is the key figure,\" said Ryan.\" He is the one who will be able to testify in cases involving landlords and tenants. Inspectors will become more involved with the PAT.\" Iowa City's housing inspector is Omar Letts. He feels the Supreme Court ruling \"puts more teeth in existing codes.\" \"It will bring substandard homes into compliance with the housing code.\" Letts said. Letts said some old buildings in Iowa City are in quite bad shape. \"These houses hould be repaired or cease to be rented,\" he said. \"This decision is only the first step in tenant-landlord relations in Iowa City.\" said Ryan. \"Hopefully. the Iowa Legislature will regulate tenant-landlord relations or cities will consider ordinances aboutil.\" \"The key to success is going to be the record they (tenants) keep of the condilion of the place when they sign the lease.\" said Ryan. More than 50 per cent of the residents in Iowa City are ren\u00ad ters. In Coralville. the figure is 70 per cent.

By DE ANN WESS Staff Wriler New rules governing reasons for employe dismissal are on the drawing board at the University Personnel Service. according to Personnel Director Fred H, Doderer, The new rules will replace a controversial list of 43 rules mailed to university directors and department heads last June, The June list included excessive tardiness. failure to observe the dress code. profane language, etc. as reasons for dismissal. Rule 43 expanded this list to include additional regulations by university 'department s and \"Any other rule or action which in the opinion of the administration is detrimental to the University,\" Ruth Tomas, secretary \u00ad treasurer of tlle local employeS union 12, said the old rules were unjust because employes could be fired for just about anything. Tomas said union members sent a copy of the rules and a letter statin/( their complaints about the rules to University President Willard Boyd and the Board of Regents, University Vice President George Chambers said he scrapped the June list shortly after distribution because the Staff Council. representing more than 6000 university employes. had not been consulted in forming the rules and the legality of the rules was Questioned . Iloderer said the new rules NATIONAL SHOE WEE S~ed;,ZS;~,1 The \"Nina\" Loafer in Tan and Navy Reg. $19 NOW $13.90 lOS.

Chambers said the Personnel Office will probably draw up 10 or 15 general rules to replace the ear Iier 43. Doderer said the new rules will not be ready to submit to tlle staff council for at least a month, Until June. the university followed the dismissal rules in the university's operations manual. Chambers said a more deta iled I isling was nceden. The personnel department borrowed a list of rules used at two other maior universities to form the list mailed out in June. Ladd has written over 90 articles and several books on a wide variety of legal topics. His latest book, \"Ladd and Carlson Cases and Material on Eviden\u00ad ce, co-autllored by Ronald L.

Sept. 21, 1972 County sheriffs: a lot of power Attorney-general Richard TUrner gave an opinion on a provocative part of Iowa law a few days ago. It was in reference to some problems Polk County Sheriff Wilber Hildreth had been having with his county board of supervisors, For twelve years Hildreth had kept the names of a group of \"honorary deputies\" (325 to be precise) a secret. When his board of supervisors found out that this group existed, they got upset and last year made him reveal the names of these civic-minded men. Hildreth felt that this was an invasion of his territory, Turner agreed with Hildreth and wrote that in the future such deputies don't have to be identified. 10 I These special deputies do not wear uniforms. They have the power to arrest persons and carry guns. They work for their sheriff at no cost to the state (that is, for nothing) and therefore they do not need the approval of the board of county supervisors. Maybe it's silly to worry about the fine points of Iowa law but somehow, the fact that a sheriff can appoint as , . many of these deputies as he'd like to (no questions asked) sounds a little like a return to the era of the Wild, , .. Wild West. Such deputies don't have to have any trammg whatsoever, and are picked by a purely subjective method. Turner himself admitted that the way tl law stands in Iowa sheriffs could have \"veritable armies of deputies\". Our ~ttorney-general, however, sees nothing wr0!lg with having a lot of undercover agents. The position of county sheriff takes on a new importance to the community when one sees the inherent power of this office. Therefore one should think very carefully about the choice in candidates that is being offered. This year there is an opportunity to choose a Johnson\u00b7 County sheriff that may make one feel more secure rather than more paranoid. The candidates are Gary Hughes (Republican Party), Bill Kidwell (Democratic Party) and .... Timothy Kane (Progressive Party). Think about them. Study their platforms. And choose well. Your sense of well being may depend upon it. L.aroline Forell Li , lies and more lies 'THAT'S NICE, LEONID-HOW MANY DID HE SELL Y~U?'

It is now to be acted upon in the Senate. The bill ha~ a provision which would require courts or the federal government, upon application of local educational agencies. to reopen court orders and desegregation plans already in effect to consider modification to comply with this bill. Busing would only be allowed as a last resort, and then be limited to the school closest or next closest to the student's home. $500 million for compensatory education programs in schools with high proportions of low-income students has been earmarked, This money would come from the $1 billion authorized for the Emergency School Aid Act, thereby weakening that bill. ACTION: Urge Senators Miller and Hughes to defeat this legislation. Two free booklets, The Facts About Busing and What the Supreme Court has Said About School Desegregation, can be ordered from Project One Nation of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 2027 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, D,C. 20036, The Senate is now debating S.J, Res. 241. approval of the SALT Interim Agreement on Strategic Offensive Weapons.

Senator Fullbright has stated that its pur\u00ad pose is to keep up the arms race, ACTION: Ask Senators Miller and Hughes to vote down the Jackson Amendment. A strange development in_the bill to. raise the minimum wage (H.R. 7130): it has passed in both House and Senate, but remains stalled. Here's the story. Each house passed a different version, The Senate version sets the minimum wage at $2.20 an hour, and covers public employees , domestic workers, and farm\u00ad workers. The House sets the wage at $2.00 an hour. except that farm workers would get $1.70 and workers 18 or younger would get $1.60. It does not cover public employees or domestic household workers. The latter bill is backed by the Administration. This bill should go to a Senate-House con\u00b7 ference to work out a compromise . But, on August 1. the House voted 19().198 defeating The sky may fall and the earth may crumble, but the state will, it appears, never stop telling lies about Vietnam, BARTOW. FLORIDA: Just a few miles from the spires of Disney World's Tomorrowland is an Orwellian future that didn't wait until 1984 . In Polk Coun\u00ad ty, Florida, a flat and sleepy stretch of land, world renowned for frozen orange juice, the school board has begun installing a series oC special cameras which will monitor junior and senior hl~h scqool .stHdent~ '~:S.clJ<JIl~ 1 .f30ard of Polk County, plagued with the typical problems of drug dealing, student unrest, and van\u00ad dalism, became t~e first system in the nation to install I<!odak Analyst super 8 security cameras. The police, banks. and retail shops have been using similar cameras for over a year. Reed takes great pains to emphasize that the school board has no intention of snooping on the students. \"We're neither interested, nor do we have the time, to 'spy' on our students when they are conducting themselves in manners normal for their age level.\" he says. \"We process and look at film only when incidents have occurred that require establishing responsibility for \\hel\"!l,\" ~ )~ Sheriff Reily's, Kodak says, have school boards seeing the Analyst camera as a panacea for every type of diSCiplj~' ary problem and. } rotector of indlvl ual have\" , ) The most recent incident found no less than the Commander-in-Chief with foot in mouth with respect to his repeated and heavy emphasis on an alleged North Vietnamese bloodbath. That \"bloodbath\", a Cornell researcher now reveals, is a myth, Based on research he did himself in Vietnam and at Cornell, D. Gareth Porter reports that not only is the claim that the Communists murdered a half million citizens upon their ascenden~y in the North false, but says, \"This bloodbath myth is the result of a deliberate propaganda campaign by the South Vietnamese and U.S, governments to discredit\" the North. Meanwhile, it became clear that the source for the Nixon charge was none other than the CIA by way of two writers, the credentials of whom are at best questionable , The immediate issues coming out of this are rattling: Is this challenge to the government 's veracity well\u00ad founded? If so, did the government knowingly promulgate this lie to provide one of the most critical rationales for staying in Vietnam: to prevent a bloodbath should the Thieu regime fall? Whether it was a knowing lie or not, why does the American people allow lives to be spent on the basis of such a flimsy thread of contention? And if the Nixon rationale is pure bunk, as history and Porter suggest, what is the real reason for the continued killing and why is it such a secret? mail Tbe Daily Iowan welcomes your signed leiters and H.\"ever, you mUll Iype and double-space . and, I.

Reed, Superintendent of the Polk County School Board, says that the surveillance equipment , although in use only a short time, has had a psychological impact on the IO senior and 16 junior high schools where they are in use. \"They have had a definite effect on the total tenor at the schools,\" says Reed. The cameras, \"the latest super 8 advance,\" according to a Kodak com\u00ad pany release, cost around $240 apiece and are set to snap a picture every 30 seconds. Because they are encased in a sound-absorbent box, students never know when a picture is being taken. Tbe time-lapse camera can operate for days without changing film. Polk County officials have set up the Analyst super 8's in corridors, around the school grounds, problem classrooms, and cafeterias. The cameras are fitted into specially con\u00ad structed wall brackets and come equip\u00ad ped with a variety of lenses depending on the angle and depth of the subjects being photographed . Principals have also been supplied with hand-held Do you care? time, action,' . ' . Florence Wills, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of florida, feels the installation of the cameras constitutes \"a definite invasion of privacy.\" The ACLU, says Mrs. Wills, is \"actively searching for a plaintiff in a right-to-privacy case in Polk County involving the School Board.\" \"We feel the Polk County School Board has attempted to rewrite the Constitution of the United States.\" she continues. \"We feel this type of sur\u00ad veillance should be stopped before it spreads to other school boards around the country, We already have infor\u00ad mation that the Palm Beach county (Florida) Board is about to install a similar system by Kodak,\" In the meantime, the giant Rochester photographic firm is mounting a major effort to put its Analyst super 8 cameras in every school. retail store, government office, and warehouse in the country, \"The present crime emergency may be more important than almost any other environmental problem,\" states the narrator of Kodak's sales presentation for their security cameras. Kodak proudly trumpets Spokane, Washington's Sheriff William J. Reily's claim that one Analyst time-lapse camera smashed a drug ring working a local high school. \"We got a call from a To the Editor: A little thing fo the Editor: Although we share in the coo\u00ad cern over the safety (j the mJSeum's art~, we would like to correct S!m! ~ tioos in the letteqiliished Sep\u00ad tember 15, abrut the Fine Arts Night at the University of Iowa Art Museum, the program were the three groups (Black Genesis Troupe, Calter for New Music. and the Jazz Ensemble) who performed that night.

Penciled words Raising his ever-present pen\u00ad cil to accompany gesture with words, Buckley remarked. \"Richard Nixon. his glass raised high to Mao Tse Tung, toasts to the long march together. he and we. likening our two revolutions to each other's. \" \"We have embraced the doc\u00ad trines. will they take us closer to paradox?\" Buckley asked. \"We have with us only a tendency in this country to celebrate things that don't work. not merely old program s .... but even the special human policies that begot them.\" \"We have made a mess in Vietnam and we certainly made a mess of the Bay of Pigs. lncredible ! We find ourselves praising the restraint of President Johnson and President Kennedy. but it was ambiguit y. the father of restraint protracted in the case of Vietnam and abrupt and fatal in the case of Cuba that produced those running fiascoes.\" Mesmerized In conclusion Buckley remarked on Nixon's politiking. \"It does appear Nixon has increasingly acquired the pow\u00ad er to mesmerize his critics by the stunning expedient of prac\u00ad ticing their grIpes and paralyzing his friends by the sweetness of the music .... allowing us every now and then to hear surrounding the pacifiC prosperous republican valley. \"It is a very great political performance .

DaUy Iowan-Iowa City, Iowa-Thurs., Sept. 21, 1972 ~ Placement head with arts history By DIANE DRTlNA Associate Feature Editor Corinne Hamilton is a name to remember . She can do a lot for you, and is very eager to try. In July of 1972. Hamilton was named coordinator of placement services and direc\u00ad tor of the Office of Career Coun\u00ad seling and Placement. She replaces the previous director, Helen M. Barnes. now retired. \"Originally I was a music ~N~~\"~lIIJlHroi~l1on said. \"I came to the University of Iowa for a master's in music. then because of my teaching background , I was offered a job as assistant director of the Educational Placement office. And that is when my career began.\" Hamilton worked for three years in Educational Placement , then two years In Career Counseling and Placement as a counselor. She received her Master's in coun\u00ad seling in 1962 from the Univer\u00ad sity oflowa. \"I find that counseling offers me much more in the way of interpersonal relationships. which I enjoy. It keeps me in the front and looking forward,\" she said. Piano tuner Hamilton was counselor at the University of Oregon's placement service for three years. She initiated and direc\u00ad ted the placement program for graduates in arts, business and sciences at Western Washington State College. In 1967 she was placement manager and on-the-job-training director at the TongUe Point Job Corps Center for Women. and in 1968 she was assistant professor in Iona College's counseling cen\u00ad ter, later becoming lona's placement director. She has also been a piano tuner. She learned of the opening at Iowa through her contacts with Barnes, who suggesteil h~r for the position. \"Miss Barnes had built an outstanding counseling program here. She is nationally known, and highly regarded,\" Hamilton said. \"Because of her we have an adequate staff. which makes it possible to enlarge our scope to include more students in our program ... Hamilton especially wants to help more Ii~ral arts students. \"Our big concern is his or her lack of knowledge of what's open,\" she said. \"When this fun\u00ad ction was set up 22 or 23 years ago by Miss Barnes, at the end of the second World War there TRIVIA Okay sports fau, has a major lealue baseball team ever cballed mala,ers II mid lealOn and ,one on to wID the peDnut?

At that time there was a pri mary thrust for the business graduate. so it quite naturally developed that these were the most involved, and this is more or less still true. That is why we're reaching out for the liberal arts student.\" Resources to all The Placement Office now offers resources to students in liberal arts, business !!dmin~tra ion, jp, rna)ism, library \u00b7e\"ce. nur Ihg. law. recreati and the graduate college. Soon to be added to this list are social work and physical therapy. Although focusing on senior students, Hamilton wants to include more students in their first years of college. \"If a student comes in earlier and learns what's available, he or she can add a direction to their college work. \"It's an opportunity to see that maybe it would be wise to pick up a course that would enhance their qualifications when they go out for the job. When students are aware of what they want earlier. they can use their elective hours more effectively .\" The Career Counseling and Placement Office offers ser\u00ad vices and resources free of charge to students of all levels, ex cep t for seniors who are charged a small fee. A library in the office is filled with books, folders and pam\u00ad phlets to help the student find out what's available. Tapes of actual employment interviews can be checked out. The staff assists students with the writing of resumes and letters and has information on full-time jobs and summer jobs, and interviews can be set up bet- DUAL SALE at Woodburn Stereo Headquarters 218 E. College ween students and prospectIve err,tployers. Survey \"The staff is aggressively contacting various businesses. ,. Hamilton said. A survey was conducted with 800 different companies, and predicted a 2 per cent increase in jobs. \"The important thing is that you must deCide where your interest lies,\" Hamilton said. \"It's really a lot of work to approach this on a gu.~ level, to ~k Y Ijr self what you will be happy with. \"What do you like to do? Work with people individually, or in groups, or sell ideas? You have to start out with a personal interest. You just can't go by what someone tells you you ought to do because there are jobs in the field. Suddenly the jobs aren't there, as in teaching. And when people do find them\u00ad selves in the wrong place. many times they discover they're miserable. \" Suggest jobs That's what Hamilton and her staff hope to prevent. \"We try to objectively draw out what your backgound looks like, you interests. and then suggest job possibilities. .. Many times it just helps to talk, for ,sometimes a suggestion can turn on a light bulb in your head and you think, 'Hey! I never thought of that before!

Is', it easily accessible? NEW DELHI (AP)-The long-haired young Frenchman , his eyes glazed and his movements jerky. climbed the stairs to the reception desk of the Hotel Crown and pleaded for a room. \"He had no money and was on drugs, so I turned him away and told him to go to a hospital.\" said Bhagawan, the manager. \"They found his body this mor\u00ad ning in Connaught Place.\" the city's main shopping district. Every few months New Delhi newspapers carry the story of another young Westerner killed by addiction. Drugs are cheap. plentiful and potent here, and overdose are a hazard to an addict accustomed to diluted Western narcotics. \"\\ saw a girl in the Crown take enough morphine to kill a regiment,\" said a doctor who was called to the sleazy little hotel on a narrow street of Old Delhi to treat another over\u00ad dosed girl. In the world of the W este r n -ki d-seeki ng-truth-i n India, the Crown is the place to go. The rooms cost four to six rupees a night 55 to 80 cents. If the guest wants to take drugs, there is nothing to stop him. But the Crown has been lucky. \"We've had only one death so far. back in 1968 right after these people started coming.\" Bhagawan said. Now, he said. there are 50 to 60 hippie types in his hotel on a given day. even during the current off-season. when many are in other parts of India. \"I'm so accustomed to them. I can tell when they're fixing.\" Nobody accuses all young Westerners of drug addiction, but that and moral codes which are looser than India's stringent boy-girl rules are the bases for occasional parliamentary demands that they be banned. The latest was early this mon\u00ad th. after a local journalist wrote from Singapore that Southeast Asian countries were cracking down on \"long-haired hippies\" who were. in turn. heading in droves to India. A member demanded that the Home Ministry keep them out. but he got no reply. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government prides itself on its tolerance. Mrs. Gandhi tried to put the question to rest last April, when she defended hippies, especially those who reject society to avoid \"going to Vietnam and bombing the innoncent.\" So lax is Indian control of young pilgrims to this traditional land of metaphysics and spiritualism that there is no accurate record of their num\u00ad bers. The government regularly brings to book Western youth who stay with expired visas. but cases are filed after they apply for exit visas. The U.S. Embassy. which estimates that 20 per cent of India's hippie-style visitors are Americans , has a special lawyer to whom it refers over\u00ad staying youth. He claims that only one of his clients has been jailed for the infraction, and her case was heard by an inex\u00ad perienced judge. Usually the penalty is probation with a promise to leave. That question can be answered by trying to find it. All you have to do is go to the basement, turn left. jog back right. then take another left.

Cardenal, who later accused Montreal pitchers of throwing at him over the past few sea\u00ad sons, was charged with shouting an obscene name at Mauch during the Cubs' 6\u00b72 victory when the Cub player was deck\u00b7 ed by Expo pitcher Mike Tor\u00b7 rez. Backed by at least 15 of his players, Mauch summoned Cub Manager Whitey Lockman to the clubhouse door and report\u00b7 edly told Lockman: \"Cardenal called me a Ibleep-bleep) and nobody's going to walk away from me after he calls me that.

His record is 4\u00b71 as fresh\u00b7 man coach the past two seasons. losing only to the lIIini frosh a year ago in Champaign. 17\u00b77. \"The new reserve schedule is an excellent program.\" says Roberts. \"I'm very happy the Big Ten has increased the num\u00b7 ber of games to six. \"In the past, freshmen have\u00b7 experienced two and thref'-game schedules. The new increase allows freshmen, soph\u00b7 omores and juniors an oppor\u00ad t~nity to compete more often. \"In particular. our I sophomores and juniors. who may never have had a chance on the varsity level. now have something to work for.\" THe aall.Y IOltaR Roberts began his coaching career at the high schOOl level m Fenton.

Thereafter. he ear\u00b7 ned his grauate degree in physical education at Mankato State IMinn.l. where he likewise served as grad assistant for the freshman foot\u00b7 ball program. \"Whether it be eighth grade\u00b7level football. or the Green Bay Packers. my approach to the game remains the same.\" says Roberts. \"Here at Iowa. we want to get the most out of our people and have them enjoy themselves as well.\" Roberts noted that freshman playing on each of the two clubs I varsity and varsity reserve I have outstanding potential this fall. \"To be perfectly honest.\" says Roberts. \"there are athletes on both our units who are not a half\u00b7step behind the starters. But this early iI}, the season. we feel It better (0 go with our experienced players at the varsity level.\" Minnesota. whose varsity suf\u00ad fered a fourth-quarter Indiana surge. and ultimate 27\u00b723 loss last Saturday. sends its reserve talent to Iowa City for the Hawkeye debut. ORlf Cross country season to start Saturday By ALAN GRUNDMEYER Staff Writer Iowa track coach Francis Cretzmeyer is optimistic about the Ha wkeye cross country teaw's chances this fall. '/We've got soIne experienced guys that should do real well.\" Cretzmeyer said. Four lettermen: senior cap\u00b7 tain John Clark and juniors Tom Loechel. Morrison Reid and Steve Holland retUf.l this year. Clark finished 39th in the Big Ten meet last year. Loechel and Reid finished 17th and 18th. respectively . Under the direction of cross country coach Ted Wheeler. the Hawks ahve been working out since the beginning of school. running 10 to 18 miles a day. \"They are a good bunch of workers.\" Cretzmeyer said. ''They run hard and are doing a good job.\" \"We ~al'e three freshmen who are also looking real good.\" said the track coach. He was speaking of Greg Newell. Jay Sheldon. and Pat Thomas. \"I think they will adjust to the longer races run in college.\" Cretzmeyer said. The Hawks run a six mile track at South Finkbine. Rounding out the squad are Orin Ellwein. Jim Knoedel. Mark Peterson. Wayne Sauro Pete Bob Rock \"We've got a tough schedule.\" Cretzmeyer said. \"We meet all the better teams in the Big Ten. except Indiana.\" C retzmeyer favored Michigan State to win the Big Ten and called Illinois and Min\u00b7 nesota the closest contenders.

The reason wm; a sensational prep career at Blair High School in Pasadena. Calif., duro ing which he gained 4,380 yards and scored 52 touchdowns, plus a I70\u00b7yard output In UCLA's 1971 spring game. That. how\u00b7 ever. was the last time McAlister carried the ball until the Bruins opened practice last month.

But McAlister isn't satisfied. \"I've been afraid to do the things I know I can do ... he says. \"In some situations I could have put forth more effort. I feel good but mentally I'm not ready to play hardnosed football.\" McAlister can run inside or outside and was clocked at 4.4 seconds over 40 yards as a UCLA freshman. And he isn't concerned with what people write or expect from him. \"I don'! know if I can live up to being called the greatf$t run\u00b7 ning back,\" he says. \"There are too many great running backs. My teammate , Kennit Johnson, is one of the greatest, but he didn't get the publicity in high school that I did. \"If I tried to live to what people make me I'd be all bro\u00ad ken up by now. I only have to satisfy one person and that's me-and I'm not satisfied.\" 'According to Roberts, the Gophers wilt employ Head Coach Cal Stoll's patented 'Houston Veer\u00b7T\u00b7 offense. a formation he formerly used at Wake Forest.

When was the last time an Iowa football team was favored over an opponent? The answer is really unimpor\u00ad tant. The fact the Hawks are four point favorites over Oregon State is important! The Hawkeyes went through a 9O-minute workout yesterday, stressing all aspects of the passing game and short yar\u00ad dage situations. Head Coach Frank Lauterbur continued to be impressed with the play of freshman tight end Jeff Clayton. \"Clayton has come on strong the past few weeks,\" said FXL. \"He is really pushing Ike White and Ed Morrissey for the num\u00ad ber one tight end post. \" There was one discouraging note about the Iowa practice. Frosh offensive tackle Gary Ladick will be sidelined from six to eight weeks with a frac\u00ad tured leg. \"In many ways. thev're a typical Dee Andros team,\" said FXL. \"They're big and strong in both lines and they like to come right at you.\" \"If they differ from any of his previous teams, it's that they don't seem to have a big. strong fullback.\" veteran defense and Steve Brown is as good a linebacker as there is in the coun try. \"When you play an Andros coached team you're always in for a battle,\" said FXL. Uregon State has always been a slow starting team. They've lost their season opener six out of the eight seasons the \"Great Pumpkin\" has been at the helm. 0IS, U. has never lost its first three games. Steve Brown. the All-American candidate at linebacker has already par\u00ad ticipated in 42 tackles this year. The 6-3. 225 pound Brown is rated by pro scouts as the finest middle linebacker prospect in the country. ..... , . Lineman of the week \\' \\ lVanlefrosh Jackson 'Linenlan of week' By JEFF STEMPEL Staff Writer He surprises you. Walking slowly toward the paper cups of gatorade. Andre Jackson seems to stand apart from the loud frivolity of a foot\u00ad ball locker room. You expected to find a bigger man-it must have been a bil! man who made 13 solo tackles against Ohio State. But that also is a surprise. Jackson conceals his 210 poun\u00ad ds well and the shy looking linebacker doesn't initially strike you as the U.P.1. Big Ten \"Lineman of the Week.\" The slight limp also bewilders you. A closer look reveals a two and one-half inch scar, a remin\u00ad der of Jackson's two knee operations. \"Getting the award was a very pleasant surprise.\" said Jackson, \"but it's gOing to put a lot of pressure one me. \"In a way. 1 was happy with my performance at Ohio State, but I know I've got a lot to learn, too. \" Jackson added that he thought college football would be a lot tougher than it was. He said he was especially concer\u00ad ned about the 50 lb. weight advantage his OSU opponent had. development. \"Dave has helped a lot,\" said Andre. The two roomed toge~r the night of the OSU game and the linebacker 's respon\u00ad sibilities. Saturday's perfor\u00ad mance showed the results. However. for Andre it was only a first step. Rejected by some college teams because of his knee, deceived by others, Jackson says he has something to prove. \"I want to show them this year, in fact. I want to show them for four years.\" he said. Jackson eventually chose Iowa over other schools because of the possibility of financial aid. Kansas had shown strong interest in the Dixmoore. III. defensive star. At one time. Northwestern. Illinois and Michigan were after him. Yet in August. Andre Jackson came to VI as a walk-on. Two operations on his left knee due to a worn cartil age had cast doubt on his future, and that scared off some teams. .. I had my first operation in December 1970 and in April it was still swelling,\" said Jackson. He continued.\"The second operation in August 1971 straightened things out. I haven't had any trouble since.\" To keep his knee healthy. it'll be fine,\" said Andre. He also said tile Ul is \"pretty nice\" and that he's learning to adjust to campus life. A liberal arts student. Jackson's goal is to become a lawyer .. In football. his goal is steady improvement. \"I learn a little more each day, \" he said. Asked if he expected future Hawkeye opponents to do anything special against him. Jackson said. \"not now. but maybe if r have a lot of games like last week. \" Finally, as you're leaving the team room, another surprise occurs. Andre thanks you for the interview.

That was as near doctors could come Wednesday in try\u00ad ing to explain the apparent sui\u00ad cide of David Utroska. As a severe thunderstorm closed in, shifting winds caught the plane at the lake front air\u00ad port and it crashed about 100 yards off shore. Utroska eseaped. He said he could see his wife and children trapped in the sinking plane. Their bodies later were brought By NANCY TALCOTI' Assistant Managing Editor \"I've seen mistakes. in the Highway Patrol, the city police force, and in our sheriff's depar\u00b7 tment.\" said Gary Hughes. Republican candidate for John\u00b7 son County Sheriff. \"And I think I can benefit from those mistakes,\" One of those mistakes, he feels, happened at the spring demonstrations two years ago. Students, professors, highway patrolmen. even Frank Smiley, City manager then, were sitting on the Old Capitol steps, \"We were given orders to arrest everyone on the Capitol steps, II he explained. \"It just didn't make any sense to me for us to go in there and start trouble .. \"but, tlIose were our orders. \" \"I guess I will profit from what I've learned In the past. \" \"Instead of waiting for violen\u00ad ce. my duty as sheriff would be to sit on the Pentacrest and talk to the kids. I'd try and find out what the problem is,\" Hughes explained. \"A sheriff can't help by just sitting down here in his office. \" The sheriff's department has to be \"people-oriented,\" Hughes feels. \"It is easy for anyone to make charges and write summons,\" he said, \" I think our job is to try to help people.\" For instance. Hughes said that 90 per cent of the time he does not give speeders traffic tickets, but instead. he explains the consequences of what might happen. and then gives the speeder a warning ticket. \"Most of the time, when you write a ticket, the driver just gets mad at himself and mad at us. and five miles down the road he's driving twice as fast.\" he said, Hughes feels that his age-he turned 30 two days ag<r-gives him a \"better rapport with stu\u00ad dents, I think I could talk better with them than my opponent could, II His opponent is Bill Kidwell. \"No doubt about that,\" Hughes said. \"Tim Kane will pick up some of the student vote, but that will be all. The real race is between Kidwell and me.\" Being a Republican in a Democratic county makes Hughes candidacy quite dif\u00ad ficult. \"For years. people here have had the idea that Republicans are conservative and Democrats. liberal. I feel I am much more liberal than my Democratic opponent (Bill Kid\u00ad we)\\) although I'm not real liberal. \" The body of the 30-year-old pilot was found in his Eldridge. Iowa home Tuesday night. He had been shot. A small caliber pistol was near the body. Utroska's death brought a cli\u00ad mactic end to a tragedy that began Sunday night after a family outing in Chicago, In-between \"Tim Kane is very liberal and Kidwell is very conservative. I guess that puts me somewhere in between. \" he said. Running for sheriff Utroska, owner and manager of Midwest Aviation at Daven\u00ad port. Iowa, tried to take off from Meigs Airport in a light plane with his wife, Sandra. 30. and their children. Kimberly. 11. and Kenneth. 9. and Kandice. 6, According to Hughes. he has had a lot of support from Democrats. \"That had a lot to do with my running.\" he said. He feels Kidwell's plan of \"I want to emphasize that if I am elected.\" Hughes explained. \"Maynard Schneider or no one else will be sheriff. He has told me that he will be gone in January. returning to the town marshaJl \"In fact, I have asked him to system is \"archaic. \" stay on one or two months to He said he \"just can't see help me get organized, if 1 get taking a guy with no experien- the job.\" - ce, letting him put on a gun and Hughes took Kane, a student a red light on his pick-up, and running for the sheriff's office. letting him become the town on a tour of the department police force,\" Tuesday night. \"I think I \"Something serious could enlightened him Quite a bit. .. happen if someone with no Hughes said. experience would take over the No muscle cars enforcement of law,\" \"I agree that the high speed chase is a thing of the past,\" Hughes said. \"We just shut our lights off and let him $o.\"we don't want to let him get killed or us either.\" The idea of bicycle patrols sounds good, he agreed, but just isn't practical. \"I asked Tim if he knew how far it was from Lone Tree (in southeastern Johnson County) to Shueyvill (in the northwestern corner.) Why, it'd take us four days to travel that by bike!\" he added. To release \"One thing I am going to do if I am elected,\" Hughes said, \"is hire a full time juvenile deputy.

Other mailed devices were uncovered in Paris. Geneva. Brussels. Vienna and Tel Aviv, Like the one that killed an Is\u00ad raeli diplomat in London on Tuesday. they were mailed from Amsterdam in the Nether\u00ad lands. Police there launched an investigation in an effort to track down the senders. Police elsewhere said some letters that had been intercep\u00ad ted and disarmed contained leaflets of the Black September group of Palestinian guerrillas who were held responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics on Sept. 5. Israelis reacted angrily to the latest plot. which comes on the heels of the weekend raid by the Israeli army into south Lebanon to knock out Palestinian guerrillas. Israel's deputy premier said in Jerusalem that no Arab coun\u00ad try would be immune if Israel decided on reprisals to stamp out guerrillas. Yigal AlIon, a former general. proclaimed a \"systematic\" new phase in the antiguerrilla war and said no Arab country \"will enjoy immunity as far as our counterterrorist actions are concerned.\" One Israeli military commen\u00ad tator. writing in the Jerusalem Post, noted the vulnerability of the Arab oil fields.
