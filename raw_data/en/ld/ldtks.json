For much of the vaccinated population, though, questions linger as to what's suddenly okay: visits with also-vaccinated family members? Small indoor hangs with friends? And what about the vaccine's ability to prevent transmission? For answers to these questions and more, Vogue spoke to [Dharushana Muthulingam](https://www.vogue.com/article/covid-vaccine-questions-everything-you-need-to-know), M.D., M.S., a specialist in infectious disease and faculty member at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; read her answers below. How long after the second shot will the vaccine take full effect? For the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer), partial immunity will gradually start building after the first dose, but the second dose is what gets the greater-than-94% efficacy. (I cover some of this in a [previous story.](https://www.vogue.com/article/biden-to-release-all-available-vaccine-doses)) Pfizer measured this level of efficacy seven days after the second dose and Moderna 14 days after the second dose. It might be sooner, but that's when they looked. The second dose is also what ensures that the protection is long-lasting. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses another (safe) virus to deliver the genetic material for the same spike protein that will train the immune system (as does Oxford/AstraZeneca). This will have a similar gradual increase, though it appears to be slightly sooner than the mRNA vaccines (about four weeks versus five to six weeks). When they looked at 15 days after the vaccine, the vast majority of people (up to 83% of people, though only up to 67% of people over age 65) had evidence of a robust cellular immune response. By 29 days, more than 90% of all age groups showed that response. Can I still spread COVID-19 if I'm vaccinated? This is the million-dollar question! The previous clinical trials of the two mRNA vaccines focused on whether people got sick from COVID\u2014they did not measure whether people were still transmitting the virus. Since we were still figuring this out, the advice has been to continue masking and social distancing, even if vaccinated, until we get more data. More recently, there is promising early evidence that the vaccine reduces transmission. In the Moderna trial, they saw a much lower viral load in vaccinated people compared to those who were not\u2014meaning a lower likelihood of transmission. Preliminarily, they have found the same thing for the [Pfizer](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-viral-load-study--68439) vaccine\u2014much lower viral load than those without vaccines. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine study did look at transmission and found asymptomatic transmission is reduced by 74%. In [Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/vaccinated-people-less-likely-to-transmit-coronavirus-israeli-study-suggests/), research groups have been measuring viral load in vaccinated people who later turned positive for the COVID-19 virus. I think it is worth continuing with some caution until we know that the transmission risk is reduced with vaccination. We are still figuring out if it is reduced enough in real life, in the context of increased transmissibility of new variants and with the vast majority of people still being unvaccinated. But the new data is very hopeful for achieving herd immunity. If I'm vaccinated, can I start seeing vaccinated family members? What about small indoor hangs with friends? So, this depends on a few things. If you hang indoors with others and you are vaccinated, your chance of getting sick with COVID is very low. It's not 100% efficacy, but it is 95%, which is really good. Even if you did get sick, you would get a milder disease than if you were not vaccinated. However, can you still spread COVID to others? As discussed, this is not yet fully clear. You may have to make a judgment based on the context. If you have low exposure to others (e.g., you work at home) and will hang out with a few other people who are also vaccinated, that is very low risk. However, in my case\u2014I am vaccinated but have high exposure to COVID in a health care setting\u2014I would not want to risk giving someone else an infection until I felt confident that I wasn't contagious. If someone in that group is not vaccinated and at risk for getting severely ill (they are older or have other health conditions), then I would avoid hanging out indoors with them. You can always mitigate the risk with ventilation and masking. I wish it was a straightforward answer, but to navigate the risk, you have to try to think through the details. I think in the next few months we will have much more information and these decisions will become less complicated. What about higher-risk activities like indoor dining and [25% capacity movie theaters](https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/nyc-movie-theaters-can-reopen-at-25-capacity-on-march-15.html)? I would discourage this for a while, especially indoor dining, which necessitates going maskless. Again, even though the vaccine protects you from getting sick, we don't know if it reduces transmission to others enough to make them safe. I would hate to think I landed someone (or their family member) in a hospital. I think we are going to be able to do these things again, but we have to take things slowly for a little while longer. Do I still need to get regular COVID-19 tests after I'm vaccinated? Hm, interesting question. I think in most cases you do not. I can imagine certain situations where this is a good idea. For example, perhaps there is someone in your house who is unvaccinated but at high risk of getting sick and you are an essential worker with a lot of exposure. In that situation, or any situation where you are worried about getting someone else sick and we don't know the transmission risk yet, testing regularly is a helpful strategy. But probably in most people's situations, you do not need to get tested regularly after getting vaccinated. "}
