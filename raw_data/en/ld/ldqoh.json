He was convinced that the scientific, allopathic approach to medicine was superior to the traditional medical knowledge of his homeland. But over the years, Sharma, who is a professor of pathology and director of cancer prevention and natural products research at Ohio State University's College of Medicine, says he became increasingly aware of the \"limitations of the allopathic system of medicine, real limitations.\" \"It's very sophisticated at finding out exactly what is going wrong. We invent more and more technology, but as far as treatment goes there's not much improvement. For cancer, it's the same chemotherapy and radiation. \"Actually, there is no positive definition of health in allopathic medicine. `You're not sick, so you're healthy' is no definition of health.\" Sharma now is a proponent of Ayur-Veda, a system of natural medicine that originated in India more than 5,000 years ago. Unlike Western medicine, which focuses on disease, Ayur-Veda (the name is Sanskrit for \"the science of life\") stresses prevention, and treatments aim to enhance the body's natural healing potential. Patients are first evaluated through questioning, examination and pulse diagnosis and then classified as one of 10 mind-body types based on mental, physical and emotional characteristics. Maintaining health is a matter of balancing three doshas, or life forces. Symptoms result from imbalances of these doshas. They are brought into balance through individualized programs including meditation, dietary recommendations, herbal food supplements and exercise. The rebirth of Ayur-Veda was aided by the high profile of Dr. Deepak Chopra, an endocrinologist whose with his tapes, lectures and workshops-have done much to popularize the sometimes arcane medical alternative. Sharma reconnected with his heritage in the 1980s when he learned to practice transcendental meditation, a technique brought out of India in 1957 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a bearded physicist and teacher who probably is best known to many Westerners for his brief tenure as guru to the Beatles in 1968. Maharishi had frequently challenged scientists to research transcendental meditation, which has been shown by numerous studies to reduce stress and improve physical and mental health. Maharishi revived and updated Ayur-Veda, calling it Maharishi Ayur-Ved, and began challenging physicians to do research on it. Under the microscope Sharma, a pathologist well acquainted with research protocol, took up the gauntlet. He decided studies should focus on the effect of two herbal formulations known as Maharishi Amrit Kalash, or MAK, on heart disease and cancer, as well as the immune system in general, and he rallied colleagues around the country to conduct experiments. Most were Western-trained physicians with an interest in Ayur-Veda who had attended training programs or an international conference convened by Maharishi in 1987. Sharma says the results, which he discusses in depth in a new book, \"Freedom From Disease\" (Veda Publishing), indicated that MAK reduced risk factors for cardiac disease, alleviated certain cancer conditions and strengthened the immune system. When these results first were being published in the late 1980s and early '90s, Sharma, like many scientists, began taking the supplements himself. He also turned his attention to the rapidly growing research literature on \"free radicals.\" Free radicals are destructive molecular sharks, the byproducts of burning oxygen in our cells. They are generated to fight and kill invading bacteria and viruses. We could not exist without them, but when they are generated in large amounts they start destroying and damaging cells. Scientists are making strong connections between free radical damage and killers such as heart disease and cancer. Free radicals also have been implicated in arthritis, cataracts, emphysema, strokes and senility. Aging has been called the increasing accumulation of changes caused or contributed to by free radicals. Most free radicals generated by the body are neutralized by a protective system of anti-oxidants, which also are provided by vitamins A, C and E. But enough free radicals survive to cause cumulative damage, increasing susceptibility to disease and decreasing physical functioning. Sharma says that nearly 40 scientific studies have found that MAK-4 and MAK-5, the two ayurvedic \"master food supplements,\" are extremely powerful free radical scavengers. Herbs and meditation Jeremy Fields, a pharmacologist and professor of medicine at Loyola University Medical School, and his colleagues conducted one of the studies. \"We looked at the effects of the most important herbal compounds, MAK-4 and MAK-5, and we tested them against radicals that were produced chemically,\" Fields explains. \"And the herbs suppressed these radicals, rendered them harmless.\" Fields, who says he has been practicing transcendental meditation for 21 years, has been using some Maharishi Ayur-Ved herbs for about eight years. \"I have found the herbs very beneficial,\" Fields says. Kim Lannom, an arbitrage clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, stumbled upon Chopra's \"Perfect Health\" in a library one day last fall and quickly became so interested in Ayur-Veda that she went off to the Maharishi Ayur-Ved health Center in Lancaster, Mass., in October for Maharishi Panchakarma, an expensive, weeklong purifying treatment program that includes instruction in transcendental meditation. \"I could feel the difference from day to day and it was like, wow!\" Lannom says. \"I do a 27-minute meditation and yoga routine twice a day. I use the herbal tea every day when I come home from work. I use the aromatherapy and music therapy. I can't go without it because it makes such a difference. I don't take my job home with me anymore and I haven't had to apologize to anyone for taking things out on them since October.\" Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa, has an Ayur-Veda training program for physicians, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is busy establishing Ayur-Veda universities in other locations around the world. In the last nine years, about 300 U.S. physicians have trained in Fairfield and several hundred others have attended annual conferences on Ayur-Veda, according to John Revolinski, physician training coordinator. Ayurvedic counseling Dan Shain, a chiropractor and acupuncturist with offices in Chicago and Wilmette, is one of two physicians in Illinois who are trained ayurvedic consultants. (The other practices in Springfield.) Shain notes that the people who come to him for ayurvedic counseling have \"lots of different problems. Cancers, AIDS, autoimmune diseases, bad skin, falling-out hair, arthritis. Some patients come (for help in coping with) the everyday stresses of life. And some people come because they feel great and want to continue to feel great, but they're the minority.\" Consultants don't dispense the herbal supplements. They must be mail-ordered from Maharishi Ayur-Ved Products International in Lancaster (call 800-843-8332 for information), and they're fairly expensive. Prices range from $4.25 for 18 bags of Raja's Cup, an anti-oxidant coffee alternative, to $89.50 for a month's supply of the MAK supplements: a 21-oz. jar of nectar and 60 tablets of ambrosia. Doubting doctors Physicians tend to react with skepticism. After an article on Ayur-Veda written by Sharma, Chopra and Brihaspati Dev Triguna of the All India Ayur-Veda Congress in New Delhi was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in May 1991, readers were quick to criticize. While some letters were favorable, most were negative and irate. \"Although some of the results (of scientific studies) have been published, they have not been validated by independent observers,\" one physician wrote. \"They are inconsistent with scientific knowledge and method.\" He went on to call it \"trashy, pseudo-scientific blather.\" Another physician allowed that \"certainly medical science will be a long time finding out all that can be known about health and disease. It doesn't help to have promoters of unproven claims pushing them for profit while expecting others to look into their validity.\" Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, however, may eventually provide some independent data about Ayur-Veda. A center for alternative medicine and health care soon will begin evaluating the outcomes and effects of various alternative techniques, including the Ayur-Veda system. "}
