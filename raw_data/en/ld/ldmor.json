Article contents Racial, ethnic differences in complementary and integrative health use among adults with mental illness: Results from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey Published online by Cambridge University Press: 07 May 2021 Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the patterns of complementary and integrative health (CIH) use among adults with a racial/ethnic minority background and a mental illness. A secondary data analysis of 2017 National Health Interview Survey (N = 793) was conducted using chi-square, multivariate logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression. Overall, Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latinx groups remained the least proportional of CIH therapies utilization. Being a male, Black/African American or Latinx/Hispanic and had work experience were predictors of the least use of the CIH therapies. Research is needed to bridge the gaps on the CIH use among a racial/ethnic minority with mental illness and to enhance the equitable and collaborative mental health care in the community. - Type - Articles - Information [The Australian Journal of Copyright - \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
