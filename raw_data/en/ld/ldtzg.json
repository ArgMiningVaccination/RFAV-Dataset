None4 1 = Identity uncertain: \u00a9 Saltire Books LtdSarsaparilla As with many plants and common names, there is some confusion as to what is really what. In this case sarsaparilla is causing the confusion. It often recalls theimagery of the Wild West of the rugged ranch hand bellying up to the saloonbar and hailing the bartender for a foaming sarsaparilla. What actually is thatsarsaparilla? Is it from Aralia species or from Smilax species? In fact, it is fromneither. The United States Department of Agriculture, Food And Drug Adminis-tration, New and Revised Denitions and Standards for Food Products [1931]mandates that sarsaparilla flavour be made from oil of sassafras [ seeLaurales - Sassafras] and methyl salicylate or oil of wintergreen or oil of sweet birch. Thisseems to indicate that the botanical name sarsaparilla and the flavouring namedsarsaparilla are two entirely different things. Just to confound things even further,the flavour that was called sarsaparilla is not generally available any longer underthat name. It is simply not heard of anymore. There are exceptions, however.Australians can still drink sarsaparilla-flavoured soft drinks and in Taiwan it isnot all too difcult to nd HeySong Sarsaparilla soda. Though the name is a deadend, the same old-time sarsaparilla flavour is still very much alive, having rein-vented itself as Root Beer. Main Constituents /H18567Triterpene Activities Historically, the triterpene saponins in this family have been claimed to exert astrengthening effect and to raise physical and mental capacity for work. Theseproperties are dened with the term adaptogenic, involving a non-specicincrease in resistance to the noxious effects of physical, chemical, biological oremotional stress. A less scientic sounding term could be 'stress busters'. Herbs of this family are thought to help support adrenal gland function when the body is challenged by stress, helping it adapt to any situation that would alterits normal function. They are thought to help reduce the exhaustion phase ofthe stress response and return the adrenals to normal function faster. Triterpenesare also known to bind to steroid hormone receptors. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Pharmacologically, the centre of activity of Araliaceae appears to be the hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, called the HPA. The HPA is a complex set of directinfluences and feedback interactions among the hypothalamus, the pituitarygland and the adrenal glands. As a major part of the neuro-endocrine system, theHPA axis regulates many body processes, including digestion, the immunesystem, mood and emotions, sexuality and energy storage and expenditure.Furthermore, it is the common mechanism for interactions among glands,hormones and parts of the midbrain that mediate the general adaptationsyndrome. It is through the regulation of all these body systems that the HPA 486 F amily reactions to stress. The HPA axis response to stress is generally higher in women than in men. The key hormones of the HPA axis include vasopressin, known as antidiuretic or water conservation hormone, and corticotropin-releasing hormone, CRH.Vasopressin and CRH stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone,ACTH, which in turn acts on the adrenal cortices, which produce glucocorticoidhormones, mainly cortisol in humans, in response to stimulation by ACTH. Cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body, including the brain. In healthy individuals, cortisol rises rapidly before or rightafter wakening, reaching a peak within 30-45 minutes. About 80% of the day'scortisol is secreted in this early morning time, getting a person pepped up for theday. It then gradually falls over the day, rising again in late afternoon about4 p.m. Cortisol levels continue falling through the evening, reaching a troughduring the middle of the night, only to sharply rise again when a new day starts. If adrenaline is the short-term, immediate danger, flight or ght hormone, then cortisol is the hormone of long-term continuous danger or stress. It picks up afteradrenaline wears off. Cortisol deciency or an abnormally flattened circadian cortisol cycle has been linked with chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia and burnout. Increased produc-tion of cortisol results from long-term alarm reactions to stress where adaptingto the chronic on-going presence of stress is necessary for survival. The person isadapting to stress and the price for that adaptation is very high indeed. Manyimmune related conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, arteriosclerosis andeven cancer can be the result of living with elevated cortisol levels chronically. A spectrum of conditions may be associated with increased and prolonged acti- vation of the HPA axis, including melancholic depression, anorexia nervosa withor without malnutrition, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic anxiety, chronicactive alcoholism, alcohol and narcotic withdrawal, excessive exercising, poorlycontrolled diabetes mellitus, childhood sexual abuse and hyperthyroidism. Hypoactivation or depletion of the stress system, on the other hand, has been linked with post-traumatic stress disorder, atypical seasonal depression, chronicfatigue syndrome, bromyalgia, hypothyroidism, post stress conditions, post-partum, menopause and nicotine withdrawal. Neurasthenia Stress related syndromes are not at all new. In 1869 George Miller Beard rst usedthe term neurasthenia to denote a condition with symptoms of fatigue, anxiety,headache, impotence, neuralgia and depressed mood. Americans were supposedto be particularly prone to neurasthenia, which resulted in the nickname theGreat American Disease or 'Americanitis', popularised by William James. Just astoday with chronic fatigue syndrome, in the late 1800s neurasthenia became apopular diagnosis, expanding to include such symptoms as weakness, dizzinessand fainting. A common treatment was the rest cure, especially for women, whowere the gender primarily diagnosed with the condition at that time. It wasexplained as being a result of exhaustion of the central nervous system's energyreserves, which Beard attributed to civilisation. He might be credited with rst F amily ARALIACEAE idea that 'living was dangerous to your health.' Physicians in the Beard school of thought associated neurasthenia with the stresses of urbanisa-tion and the pressures placed on the intellectual class by the increasinglycompetitive business environment. Typically, it was associated with upper classindividuals in sedentary employment. The modern view holds that the main problem with the neurasthenia diag- nosis was that it attempted to group together a wide variety of cases. In recentyears, Richard M. Fogoros has posited that perhaps 'neurasthenia' was a wordthat included some psychiatric and psychological conditions, but more impor-tantly many physiological conditions that are marginally understood by themedical community, such as bromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritablebowel syndrome. [Extracted from Wikipedia] Today this syndrome, by whatever name it goes, is accepted as a psycho-patho- logical phenomenon. When rst used by Beard in 1869, the pioneer who eluci-dated the physiological component to physical medical problems, SigmundFreud, was only 13 years old. Understanding the interactions of mind and bodywere decades in the future. The homeopathic materia medica is chock-full with the term neurasthenia. It wouldn't make much sense to connect it with any plant family or remedy groupin particular. On the other hand, so little is known about the Araliaceae as a groupthat some broad generalisations will help get a preliminary idea. First of all,Ginseng features in the rubric, 'Neurasthenia after debilitating diseases', whileHedera helix has a key symptom of the condition, 'Constantly lives in a state ofanxiety and worry.' Secondly, on the authority of Louis Berman [1928], we notethe 'relations of neurasthenia to the glands secretion in general andto adrenal insufciency in particular.' Thirdly, the symptoms elicited in of American ginseng [Panax quinquefolius] were characterised by 'acondition of anxiety which is present in all sexual hypochondriacs. . . [making Panax] a curative remedy in such cases of sexual weakness thatespecially react upon the mind, causing lassitude, and uneasy mental conditioneven to fears of approaching impotence.' [ see below] Breaking Down from T oo Great Demands Berman claries by saying: 'The neurasthenic is to be recognised by the fact thatthe most painstaking objective examination of his organs reveals nothing thematter with them. Yet, according to his complaint, everything is the matter withhim. He cannot sleep when he lies down, he cannot keep awake when he standsup. He cannot concentrate, but still he is pitifully worried about his life. Theslightest irritant causes him to go off the handle. 'As he works himself up into his hysterical state as a reaction to a disagreeable person or problem, irregular blotches may appear on his face and neck. Gener-ally, his hands and feet are clammy and perspiring, his face is abnormally flushedor pallid, the eyes are worried or starey, unwonted wandering sensations involv-ing now this area of the body or now that obsess him. As the blood pressure istoo low for the age, the circulation is nearly always inadequate and palpitationof the heart is a frequent complaint. So frequent that attention is often centred 488 F amily Saltire Books Ltdupon the heart, a diagnosis of heart disease is made and the unfortunate is doomed for life - to brood over horrible possibilities. The brooding over them-selves and their troubles is one of the distinctive features of the whole complex.Neurasthenia may masquerade as any organic disease. An individual with a soilfor a neurasthenic reaction to life will become neurasthenic when confronted byany stone wall, including a serious ailment within himself.' Compare Berman's description with a symptom in Aralia racemosa. 'I have been annoyed all day by a dread that my right lung is seriously diseased. Couldnot shake off the fear.' Berman goes on to say: 'Neurasthenia, regarded as a reaction of people to the stress and strain of life, has without a doubt increased. The most casual ofobservers will tell you that the generation of the Great War is a neurasthenicgeneration. It takes its pleasures too intensely, its pains too seriously, its troublestoo flippantly. . . . Now one of the outstanding effects of disease of the adrenalglands is the feeling of muscular and mental inefciency. And as a matter of fact,a good number of observations conspire for the idea that a certain number ofneurasthenics are suffering from insufciency of the adrenal gland. The chronicstate of the acute phenomenon, known as the nervous breakdown, reallyrepresents in them a breakdown of the reserves of the adrenals and an elimina-tion of their factor of safety. In the light of that conception, the great Americandisease - dementia americana - is seen to be adrenal disease - and the Americanlife to be the adrenal life, often making too great demands upon that life and sobreaking down with it.' Reading Berman's depiction, it is easy to nd oneself thinking how accurately he was describing modern life and the sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome thathas been so prevalent in the last 20 years. Recalling that Beard blamed neuras-thenia on 'urbanisation and the pressures placed on the intellectual class by theincreasingly competitive business environment' it would appear that Bermanmust be referring to our modern world with its work pressures, fast-paceddemanding life style, whiz-bang advancing technology, globalisation and terror-ism threats. Settled with that image, it is something of a surprise to come uponhis reference to the 'Great War', meaning 1914-1918. He was not speaking aboutthe current era, but about one that is looked back upon with nostalgia for itssublime simplicity, slow-paced graciousness and bucolic peacefulness. How couldthey think they were stressed? The Tired Competition Beard and Berman have given us sterling descriptions of neurasthenia as fatigueor a breakdown resulting from the stress and strain of life. More recently BetsyBerne gave her unsurpassed observations of fatigue of our time, what could becalled the 'new neurasthenia'. Her article, The Tired Chronicles , contains scathingly accurate commentary. 'I've noticed recently that the main topic ofconversation among my friends is tiredness. Actually, there is an underlyingcontest over who is the more tired and who has truly earned his or her tired-ness. . . . According to the tired married people with kids, there is no contest.They are the royalty of the tired kingdom. They are smug with exhaustion. I F amily ARALIACEAE to the tired-single-people-who-work-at-home group and in the tired race I don't have a prayer. . . . By now it might be time to mention my brother, thejazz musician. He is bone tired. This is because he is a member of yet anothergroup, the international-jet-set tired people. My brother is always on the roadplaying gigs - from Istanbul to Helsinki to Houston Street. When he is on tourin Italy, for example, not only must he deal with adulation of fans, but he mustconsume sumptuous free meals and stay in Tuscan castles. And he must alwayshang out after a gig. \"Hang\" is jazz lingo for drinking all night with fans, whoare often female. You can imagine the tiredness this leads to. . . . Just last year,my big wheel writer friend joined the ranks of the international-jet-set tiredgroup. Now she, too, is always flying to exotic locales. . . . She, too, is forced toconsume sumptuous free meals and stay in Tuscan castles. And, if that weren'ttiring enough she is also searching for a mate . . . naturally leading to you knowwhat.' [The New Yorker; Aug 7, 1995] Courage Dr. James Lembke of Riga in former Russia, now Latvia, proved a large numberof remedies upon himself between 1845 and 1868. The Ginseng proving eliciteda unique feeling in him - courage. It is one of the rst sensations he notices sometwo hours after the rst dose. The word courage goes right back to the hypothal-amic-pituitary-adrenal axis, more particularly to Louis Berman and his view onthe adrenals. Berman writes: 'Courage is commonly thought of as the emotion that is the opposite of fear. It would follow that courage meant simply inhibition of theadrenal medulla. As a matter of fact, of course, the mechanism of courage mustbe more complex. One must distinguish animal courage and deliberate courage.Animal courage is literally the courage of the beast. Animals with large adrenalsare the pugnacious, aggressive, charging kings of the elds and forests. . . . Incourage, deliberate courage, there is more than instinct. There is an act ofvolition, a display of will. Admitting that without the adrenals such couragewould be impossible, the chief credit for courage must be ascribed to the prepi-tuitary. . . . The [to usethat term for lack of better]. By intellectuality is meant the capacity of the mindto control its environment by concept and abstract ideas. . . . Now the emotionthat is the precursor of intellectuality is curiosity, with wonder and its expressionin the various constructive and acquisitive tendencies. . . . The ability to protby experience and to make more and more accurate judgements as one growsolder implies at least a maximum efciency of the prepituitary.' The rubric 'Courageous' played a key role for Maud Nerman in nding Ginseng as the similimum in two cases. About the rst case, a woman with lumbar herni-ation and sciatica after a fall on the sacrum, she says: 'What do we mean bycourage? And what is the kind of courage particular to this remedy [Ginseng],rather than other remedies, in this rubric? To be courageous, one has to have arm conviction that the way one sees the world is good and valid. Otherwise,that person cannot move forward with condence and fortitude. In my unpub-lished novel, \"A Deep Sworn Vow,\" I address the issue of courage: In a limited 490 F amily Page 490 courage is about enduring the unendurable. On another level, courage is the ability to maintain important human values, kindness, tenderness, respect inthe face of the intolerable. The ultimate act of courage is not moving forwardwithout fear. Ultimately courage is the act of moving forward wisely, despite pain,fear or desire. 'Clearly, despite tremendous pain, this patient persevered. She worked to help others, she travelled and she even went into the pain with meditation. All of this,for someone suffering from tremendous pain, is an expression of her courageousnature. . . . As one of my friends suggested on hearing the case, perhaps Ginsengis the woman warrior remedy: erce, protective, enduring. . . . Did courage inthese Ginseng cases have a tinge of pathology? Possibly. In the rst case, she mayhave pushed herself too hard, too sure of her own vital, physical strength.Whereas some cultures demand a lot of emotional suppression, as we have seenin some of the English and some of the Asian cultures, perhaps America drivespeople of talent to \"burn out\" and pushes most of us to our limits. Aristotle saidthat core virtues are based on a balance between two extremes. Courage is thebalance between recklessness and cowardice on either side.' [Maud Homeopathy: Pacemaker of Ageing Ageing is a feature inherent to all multi-cellular organisms and is dened as aprogressive, generalised impairment of functions resulting in a loss of adaptableresponses to stress and a growing risk of functional loss, disease and disablement.No two individuals age in the same way. Genetics and adaptability are keypersonal factors that determine how well a person ages, while environment andbehaviour are major modiers of biological structures and processes. Longevity, in Berman's endocrinal view, is 'perhaps largely a matter of prevent- ing or postponing the wane of all of the glands of internal secretion, at least themost important - the thyroid, the pituitary and the adrenals - as well as thegonads.' This may well be a great idea, however, human biology does not supportit. Scientic data have conclusively shown that there is a natural decline in manyhormones with age, such as oestrogen, testosterone, growth hormone, mela-tonin, calcitonin and renin. The endocrine system with its variety of hormonesis called the 'pacemaker of ageing'. This process of endocrine decline is respon-sible for many manifestations of ageing. For instance, lean and fat masses, as wellas skin elasticity, immune functions, bone density, energy levels and moodswings closely correlate with levels of a number of hormones. Many women have found out the hard way what happens when attempting to give their bodies a hormone complement appropriate for an age at a time whenthey are a very different age. Providing post-menopausal women with oestrogenor oestrogen-containing combinations, called Hormone Replacement Therapy[HRT] is such an attempt. For decades this treatment approach was hailed as thepanacea for not only the symptoms but also for the ravages of ageing. It wasyouthfulness in a pill. Recent comprehensive studies, however, have unequivo-cally demonstrated that the dangers of this include increased risk of breast anduterine cancers, heart attacks as well as other serious diseases. F amily ARALIACEAE LtdFo r e v e r Yo u n g Tonic herbs have long been advocated as promoting immunity, longevity and rejuvenation. Invariably included are species of Aralia, Eleutherococcus, Ginsengand Panax. Used as flavouring in beverages, sarsaparilla was regarded as a detoxi-cation agent as well as a general pepping up tonic to invigorate and cleanse thebody. Like other ivy [Hedera eternal life and resurrec- tion. It also signies true love, faithfulness and undying affection both inmarriage and in friendship. Ivy itself is noted for its vigorous growth habit andlongevity. It is nearly indestructible. Famed American writer of the late 19thcentury, O. Henry, featured Ivy as the main character in his story The Last Leaf, which encompasses all of these themes. [see Hedera helix] Traditional Chinese medicine distinguishes a variety of herbs for realising 'deathlessness', among them ginseng. It is said that the continuous use of ginseng'leads one to longevity with light weight.' With this notion in mind, it is fasci-nating to look at Lembke's proving o f Ginseng. There are four entries recorded by all three provers. The time frame shows that it involves the primary action. After2 hours the 'feeling of weakness entirely disappears and gives place to an agree-able sensation of lightness and clearness of mind.' After the rst day, there wasa 'peculiar lightness and vigour in the limbs in spite of much walking.' Thesecond day produced a 'peculiar pervading joyous sensation of vigour andelasticity, especially in the upper extremities. There was a peculiar lightness andflexibility of the limbs in the morning, in spite of a bad night.' It can be safely assumed that a 'pervading joyous sensation of vigour and elasticity' equates a feeling of being young. 'Delusion she is young' is a leadingindication for Ginseng in a case by Dr. Prashant Shah. A brief synopsis of the caseinforms us that, 'She is a spinster aged 47. . . . She is very adventurous in naturein her life as well as in her profession. Signature of disease: Her temperament andadventures give us a feeling of a young and energetic person. That is the state ofbeing in which she likes to stay. So the body has also produced a similar phenom-enon. Her reproductive system was not ready to go into a state of menopause[i.e. grow old]. This was the reason for her physical ailment in the form of hotflushes. . . . Many of the following characteristics are not found in the repertoryso you may note the following rubrics with pencil in the repertory. I feel itrequires a few more experiences before it gets included. These characteristics Ihave derived from the doctrine of signatures of the remedy and the case. Del. sheis young. Energetic.

Second strong physical symptom was dryness ofmouth, to the extent, that she had to drink water every hour during AFFINITIES ARALIACEAE It has long been a human wish to be forever youthful in mind and body, full of the vitality, verve and enthusiasm that only the idealistic young appearto have. People now live longer, having almost twice the lifespan of 41 yearsthat males had at the turn of the 20th century. The desire is for those extrayears to be vigorous years, not ones of ageing incapacity. A universal age-defying stress-buster is needed to full one's wishes. To be youthful is to be energetic, fearless and flexible. One is able to adapt and bend with changing circumstances, handle the onslaught that lifedelivers and endure the unendurable. There is strength and courage enoughto push oneself to the absolute limit, roll with the punches and persevere inthe face of challenges. The fact remains that human beings age. The mere act of living is danger- ous to one's health. Stresses, the constant exposure to cares or worries and afast-paced, demanding lifestyle slowly erode vitality, causing a progressive,generalised impairment and chronic diminishment of facilities and capaci-ties, both mental and physical. Whatever the name - nervous exhaustion,neurasthenia, chronic fatigue syndrome or simply 'burn out' - the result isthe same: weakness, lassitude, prostration. Such are theravages of ageing. Araliaceae won't accept the natural decline wherein vigour and well-being are replaced by ageing debility. Aralia is noted for the 'constantdread of disease.' They seek indestructible, enduring, eternal, ever-lasting life.Clinging to the dream of longevity, all their energy goes to rejuvenation,where it is possible to postpone or prevent the natural wane of functions.There should be resistance to and protection from noxious effects andstresses so that physical and mental capacities are once again raised andrestored. Purication, cleansing and even supernatural or spiritual practicesare used to try to achieve these ends. Though equipped with fortied strength to live with high stress, this is not really the best strategy for living. One readily crosses the ne line betweenhelpful and harmful. This route to longevity achieves the opposite byburning out mind and body in the youthful spree of spending energy andvitality. The collapse, the sheer exhaustion, the weakness that follow arepractically unsupportable. A more measured pace, appropriate for each phase of life, allows for the dynamism of youth to yield gracefully and productively to the more settled,calm, contemplative pursuits as one ages. The dilemma for the Araliaceae ishow to stay flexible and youthful while embracing all stages of life withopen-minded enthusiasm and joy. The wisdom to do this is the true preserverof health and life. 1 Youthful, vitality, enthusiasm, fearless and flexible. Courage, vigour, verve. F the unendurable. Fighting against resistance.

[Moore 1989] Enlightening F ailures 'I happened to read Jones's proving in Hale New Remedies some six or seven yearsago and I was much struck with the character of the cough. I fancy the thingthat helped to impress it upon my mind was the fact that I had had just at thatperiod a lady under my care who was suffering from a cough that came on afterlying down at night. I had been tinkering away at this cough and could not cureit; so I blamed the damp house in which the lady resided and its proximity to abrook prettily hidden among the willows close by. Hyoscyamus, Digitalis and anumber of other remedies came into play, but the cough would not budge a bit. 'Need I tell the heart-rending tale that the patient lost faith in her doctor [the writer] and in his much-vaunted pathy, and set about healing herself with quackmedicines and orthodox sedative cough mixtures? Of course, I felt humiliatedand I therefore made up my mind to read my Materia Medica a little morediligently. It was quite evident that the cough was a curable one, for the mostcareful physical examination failed to detect anything besides a few moist ralesthat tallied with the moderate amount of expectoration. 'Failures are very instructive at times. Just after having received my cong\u00e9 from this lady, I was reading Hale's New Remedies and came across Dr. S. A. Jones'sproving of Aralia racemosa, where he says: \"At 3 p.m. I took ten drops of themother tincture in two ounces of water. An interesting book caused me to forgetmy 'dose'. The events of the night jogged my memory very effectually.\" He goeson to say that he retired to rest at midnight, feeling as well as ever, but he \"hadno sooner lain down than he was seized with a t of asthma.\" I put down thebook - Hale's New Remedies was not quite so thick then as it is now - and saidto myself, \"That's Mrs. N.'s cough, that is just how she goes. She lies down andforthwith begins to cough, to get laboured breathing and to make her poor hard-toiling husband wish he were a bachelor\"; at least he might have wished it, forought I know to the contrary. 'A little time elapsed and the writer was sent for to see one of this coughing lady's children with eczema. The bairn's common integument having beenprescribed for, I timidly inquired about the cough. \"Oh,\" said Mrs. N., \"it is asbad as ever; I have tried everything and do not know what to do.\" I sat downand wrote: [rapid,safe and pleasant] and that not because Aralia is good for coughs and has anafnity for the respiratory organs merely, but because it is capable of causing acough like the one that was to be cured.

The berriesin tincture have been found useful in lulling the pain from a decayed tooth; alsoin various painful affections of other parts. Physicians in Cincinnati made muchuse of this bark during the cholera of 1849-50, in cases where cathartics wererequired, but where the action of every purgative was difcult to control; thepreparation was composed of 1 dram of compound powder of jalap, 1 dram ofaralia spinosa and 2 drams of compound powder of rhubarb.

Medicinal Uses 'Ginseng is perhaps the most widely recognised plant used in traditionalmedicine and now plays a major role in the herbal health care market. For morethan 2,000 years, various forms have been used in medicine. The name Panaxderives from the Greek word for \"all healing\" and its properties have been man-shaped gure [shen-seng means \"man-root\"] ledproponents of the Doctrine of Signatures, an ancient philosophy, to believe thatthe root could strengthen any part of the body. Through the ages, the root hasbeen used in the treatment of asthenia [loss of strength], atherosclerosis, bloodand bleeding disorders, colitis and to relieve the symptoms of ageing, cancer andsenility. 'Ginseng is popularly CNS, been conrmed by clinical trials. . . . Note that the prole of particularginsenosides differs between American and Asian ginseng; however, totalginsenoside content is similar.' [www.drugs.com] Adverse Reactions 'The most common adverse reactions with ginseng are nervousness and excita-tion. However, there have been reports of diffuse mammary nodularity andvaginal bleeding. A hypoglycaemic effect has also been documented. Post-marketing surveillance of CVT-E002 [COLD-fX, a patented, proprietary extractcontaining mainly oligosaccharides and polysaccharides from North Americanginseng] in Canada from 1996 to 2006 led to 100 documented adverse reaction 500 F amily ARALIACEAE16.

Reactions included abdominal pain, confusion, diuresis, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia,joint pain, lowered blood pressure, nausea and vomiting.' [www.drugs.com] Chinese or American? Allen states that the American and Chinese species of ginseng are 'probablyidentical'. They are not, although they are in the same genus. Chemically theyare quite similar, both containing ginsenosides as the major biologically activeconstituents. Steven Foster, an authority on Chinese medicine, asserts that'American and Asian ginsengs contain some of the same as well as some differ-ent ginsenosides, which explains their different actions as expressed intraditional Chinese medicine. Mild American ginseng helps to reduce the heatof the respiratory and digestive systems, whereas the stronger Asian ginseng is aheat-raising tonic for the blood and circulatory systems.' American ginseng isPanax quinquefolius L. and Chinese ginseng is Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer. 'The naturalist Sheng Neng Pen-T'sao introduced around 100 AD an interest- ing technique to test the authenticity of the ginseng root: \"In order to test forthe true ginseng, two persons walk together, one with a piece of ginseng root inhis mouth and the other with his mouth empty. If at the end of three to ve li[about a mile and a quarter] the one with ginseng in his mouth does not feelhimself tired, while the other is out of breath, the ginseng is genuine root.\"Eastern herbalism met Western culture in 1709 AD when Father Petrus Jartoux[1668-1720], a Jesuit missionary, visited Northern China. He published a Westerndocumentation of Panax ginseng in 1713. He noted that ginseng could possiblygrow in the mountains and woods of Canada, since they mimic the environmentof the Chinese ginseng. 'This observation describes the North American ginseng and would later be dis- covered as the \"cooling\" ginseng, or the yin ginseng, completing the \"warming\"yang ginseng, native to China. Ginseng was an important part of NativeAmerican culture. Although there is no formal documentation of ginseng usagein Native American herbal remedies, there is evidence of its influence in theNortheast Culture Area tribes. These inhabitants covered the Atlantic coastal area,across the Appalachians to the Mississippi, from the Great Lakes to the Cumber-land River in Tennessee. The tribes of this area were not only hunters and sher-men, but also farmers and herb-gatherers. They utilised herbs for ritualisticceremonies and for practical purposes, such as prevention and cure of illnesses,wound dressing, treatment of female ailments, increase elderly strength, promotefertility, enhance mental activity, stomach upset and the treatment of ear andeye disorders.' [Gehr 2000] In 1715 Joseph Francois Latau [1681-1746], another Jesuit missionary who worked above Montreal in Canada from 1711-1717, read Jartoux's words, thenbegan a search for ginseng in Canada. In 1716 Latau, strolling in the woodsnear his cabin, found the red-berried plant. American ginseng [Panax quinque-folius] was discovered. According to traditional Chinese medicine, American ginseng is a Yin tonic and cool in nature. Asian ginseng, by contrast, is a Yang tonic and generally warm F amily ARALIACEAE Ltdor even hot in nature. Adopting the concept of cure by opposites, Ron Teeguarden proclaims that 'American Ginseng is thus useful for people who arehot. In other words, people who tend to have lots of energy, high metabolisms,are aggressive, have high blood pressure and have ruddy complexions can takeAmerican Ginseng for its adaptogenic benets without fear of overheating.' One of P. ginseng's most common side effects is the inability to sleep. Other adverse effects include dizziness, nausea, diarrhoea, euphoria, headaches, epis-taxis, altered blood pressure and breast tenderness. This is a reference to thecontroversial 'ginseng abuse syndrome'. T wo Edged Sword 'The presentation of the mild and benecial nature of ginseng was turned upsidedown about two centuries later [after its introduction to Europe in 1704]. Ginsenghad become exceedingly rare and costly, and, as a result, it had become an objectof abuse. Physicians and herb merchants would promise incredible results fromusing the rare root [which, at the time, was not cultivated and only obtainedfrom remote forests in Northeast China and Korea]. Desperate patients and theirfamilies would seek it out and then use as much as possible in an attempt toovercome an obviously debilitating or fatal condition. Ginseng was evendescribed as being able to bring back the dead [probably meaning that it wouldrestore health to someone who appeared to be imminently dying]. 'When some of the ailing patients died after taking ginseng, responsibility for the death might be attributed to the ginseng. Hence, ginseng became known asa potentially dangerous herb. Zhang Lu, a physician of the Qing Dynasty period,commented: \"Some people look upon ginseng as poison or a sword [two-edged,able to provide help, but also to destroy] and stubbornly refuse to use it.\" 'Still, its old reputation as a healer for serious conditions and as a preventer of ageing and death was retained. Ginseng eventually became known to the Westthrough the efforts of missionary doctors living in the East. The British doctorsSmith and Stuart, working in China at the end of the 19th century, wrote:\"Ginseng, with the Chinese, is the medicine par excellence, the dernier ressort[last resort] when all other drugs fail; reserved for the use of the Emperor and hishousehold and conferred by Imperial favour upon high and useful ofcialswhenever they have a serious breakdown that does not yield to ordinary treat-ment, and which threatens to put a period to their lives and usefulness. . . . Theordinary ginseng of the markets has been studied and has not been found topossess any important medicinal properties. But the Chinese describe cases inwhich the sick have been practically in articulo mortis, when upon the adminis-tration of ginseng they were sufciently restored to transact nal items ofbusiness. . . . It is prescribed in nearly every kind of disease of a severe character,with few exceptions, but with many reservations as to the stage of the disease inwhich it may be administered with the greatest benet and c. 2 females, 2 males]; no further details. [Proving conducted with the 'same combination of American and Korean ginseng as had been used in the previous studies.'] Identity The homeopathic materia medica is arranged under the name Ginseng, Panaxquinquefolius, American ginseng. However, it is doubtful whether Americanginseng was the source of the remedy used for the provings, which were done inEurope in the 1830-40s. Dr. M. Jouv\u00e9, of Lyon, France, introduced the remedyinto homeopathy under the name Gins-eng, made from the roots of plants imported from China. Roth, who arranged the symptoms, called it 'Ginseng-chinense'! That Dr. James Lembke, of Riga in what was Russia at the time,probably also used Chinese ginseng can be no more than a likely yet unsubstan-tiated presumption. In prominent usage in ancient China, Manchuria and otherparts of eastern Asia for centuries, Chinese ginseng was introduced into Europe[Paris] in 1704. The remedy nonetheless received its name after the Americanspecies, the reason for which must have been T.F. Allen's understandable yetincorrect claim in his Encyclopedia: 'American and Chinese species [are] probablyidentical.'

Worn Down by Worries 'We nd that the drug [Panax quinquefolius, American ginseng] produces a marked physical depression, also a more marked mental depression. Especiallydoes it seem to cause a hypochondriacal state, as is shown by the symptoms oflassitude, restless and unrefreshing sleep; by the irritability and indisposition tomental or physical labour. These, coupled with the marked effect it produced onthe sexual organs, stimulating them primarily, weakening them secondarily,should make ginseng a valuable remedy in treating a large class of sexual hypo-chondriacs. Four out of the nine provers retained, had amorous dreams and sixhad continual nocturnal emissions. This was so marked a symptom that some ofthose who commenced the proving become frightened and refused to continue,which in itself shows that it tended to produce a condition of anxiety which isconstantly present in all sexual hypochondriacs. This temporary sexual stimu-lation has been an old use of the drug, and this fact, in connection with the fore-going, should make it a truly homoeopathic and therefore curative remedy insuch cases of sexual weakness which especially react upon the mind, causinglassitude, and uneasy mental condition even to fears of approaching impotence. The digestive symptoms were few and these were of a depressing nature such as loss of appetite, bad taste, foul breath. There seemed to be a desire for some-thing stimulating yet little or no thirst. Three provers, tobacco users, had no F Ltddesire for tobacco during the time they were under influence of the drug.' [W.A.

Pharmacological Activities The leaves and berries of English ivy could cause toxicosis if ingested. pupils, muscular weakness and lack of coordina-tion. Contact with cell sap may result in severe skin irritation with redness,itching and blisters. Eating the berries may cause burning in the throat. Medicinal Uses The German Commission E reported that skin and mucosa are sensitive to ivyleaf and it performs correspondingly expectorant and spasmolytic activity. Theconstituent falcarinol has been conrmed as having antibacterial, analgesic andsedative effects. The Commission commends ivy leaf as for catarrhs 506 Saltire Books Ltdof the respiratory passages and for symptoms of chronic inflammatory bronchial conditions. Ivy is suggested as an expectorant, secretolytic and antispasmodic inresponse to, specifically, whooping cough, spastic bronchitis and chroniccatarrh. Ivy has possible effects as an astringent, micro-vessel protector, anti-oedema and antiseptic. Ivy extracts are major constituents in slimming products, especi-ally those that combat cellulitis. They are found in most of the compositionsoffered by well-established cosmetic houses. It has vasoconstrictor and anti-exudative properties, and reduces capillary permeability, an action attributed toits rutin and other flavonoids. It is also reported to be an effective moderator ofperipheral sensitivity and can improve tolerance to skin massage. It is likewisenoted that Ivy extracts activate the circulation, allow drainage of inltrated tissueand thereby reduce local inflammation, exerting an anti-oedematous effect andlowering tissue sensitivity. Mezger's claim of ivy containing high iodine concentrations could not be conrmed in the literature. Stephenson, however, observed plenty of thyroidsymptoms in Mezger's proving [ seebelow]. Endocrine System 'Among non-marine plants Hedera has one of the highest concentrations ofiodine. From this follows its relationship to the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.Indeed, as a keynote one might call Hedera 'vegetable iodine.' There is markedanxiety particularly about the heart, exophthalmos, sensations of constipation, constrictions andneedle like pains in the heart, palpitations, insomnia, profuse perspiration, adesire for the open air and extreme tiredness. 'Although, from its iodine content one might expect a similarity of symptoms to Iodum, there appears rather to be a contrast. For instance, unlike the coryzaof Iodum, which is < open air, Hedera is > open air. There is throat pain onswallowing [Iodum has pain when not swallowing]. Iodum has suppressed wellas increased increased. Hedera has leftovarian pain; Iodum, right. It is primarily in the cardiac sphere that Hedera andIodum have a similar action. Both have constriction of the heart with piercing,needle-like pains. 'Hedera has been of great service in myocardial infarction and should be considered along with our other great heart remedies. Hedera also has the organichypertrophies of Iodum [prostatic as well thyroid]. Therefore Hedera shareswith Iodum many of the pathological signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidismbut contrasts with Iodum in the expansion of these into the subtle sphere ofsubjective, physiological response. In this manner Hedera gives us one moreeffective agent for the individualisation of the treatment of hyperthyroidism. 'The outstanding symptom not shared either with the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism or the symptoms of Iodum is a generalised tingling of the joints,muscles and nerves. Clinically, in homeopathic dilutions, Hedera has been ofparticular value in hyperthyroidism, gallstones and cholecystitis, and chroniccirrhosis. In gross dilutions it has been used to cure drunkenness, for worms, late F amily ARALIACEAE menses.' [Stephenson, of Mezger's proving] Clinging to a Strong Support 'The symbolism of the ivy rests on three facts which are that it clings, it thrivesin the shade and it is an evergreen. Its clinging has made the ivy a symbol of thetraditional, albeit now unpopular, image of the helpless female clinging to herman for protection. It also signies true love, faithfulness and undying affectionboth in marriage and in friendship. Christian symbolists consider the ivy's needto cling to a support emblematic of frail humanity's need for divine support. 'Like other evergreens, the ivy symbolises eternal life and resurrection. It has been associated with the Egyptian god Osiris and the Greco-Roman god Attis;both of whom were resurrected from the dead. Medieval Christians, noticing thativy thrived on dead trees used it to symbolise the immortal soul, which livedeven though the body [represented by the dead tree] decayed. 'In spite of its use as a symbol of immortality, ivy's association with the grave caused it to be strongly emblematic of mortality. According to Crippen, atChristmas time, ivy, which represents mortality, should be used only on theoutside of buildings because this holiday celebrates Jesus, the giver of everlastinglife and destroyer of death. 'Because it thrives in the shade, ivy represents debauchery, carousing, merry- making, sensuality, the flourishing of hidden desires and the enjoyment of secretor forbidden pleasures. Some even believed this plant to have demonic associ-ations. Dionysus [Bacchus] the Greco-Roman god of wine, satyrs and Sileni areoften wreathed in ivy. Crowns of ivy were believed to prevent intoxication andthought to aid inspirational thinking. Therefore, the Greeks crowned their poetswith wreaths of this plant. Although generally considered poisonous, the ivy'sblack berries were used to treat plague.' [Tucker 1997] Clinging to Life As a vigorous, long-lived evergreen plant, ivy is used to symbolise 'ever-life' oreternal life and resurrection. Also associated with the indestructible ivy are otherundying qualities, such as true love, faithfulness and everlasting affection bothin marriage and in friendship. American writer O. Henry [1862-1910] featuredivy as the main character in his short story The Last Leaf, which encompassessuch themes as courage, faithfulness, undying affection, enduring friendship andthe indestructible quality of the gift of love. Set during a blistery east-coast winter, two young female would-be bohemian artists live in a squatty, old tenement building. Barely scratching a living withtheir sketches and drawings, they are hit hard when serious cold takes hold ofthe city. The more delicate of the two contracts pneumonia. As she lies in bed,sinking each day further towards death, she watches through her window an oldivy vine climbing half way up a brick wall. Each day the winter winds take a fewmore of the leaves from their mooring on the stalk. She knows her life will flyaway with the falling of the last leaf. 508 F amily ARALIACEAE16.

He has befriended the girls, witnessing their youthful optimism from his perch of disillusioned old age. His mantra of years holds that one day he wouldpaint his masterpiece. The days sweep by, bringing no relief to either the weather or the sick girl. The leaves continue to fall, until there comes the day when only one ivy leaf is left.Both girls are sure the end is near. Stubbornly, the last leaf clings to its stalk, justas the young woman clings to life. A few more days pass and, miraculously, theleaf still hangs on. The enduring persistence and indestructible vigour of the ivyleaf nally melt the young woman's pessimism and embolden her with thecourage to get well. And she does, the outcome being a happy ending to the story. Anyone familiar with O. Henry's style will know that this is not the end of the story. One day, as the young woman is well on the road to recovery, her friendcomes to tell her the news. Their neighbour, the old, would-be masterpiecepainter, has died the night before of pneumonia.

Among all of the traditional medicinal uses of devil's club, its most wide- spread is for the treatment of external and internal infections, including tuber-culosis. The efcacy of many of the treatments is undoubtedly related to devil'sclub's signicant antibacterial, anti-mycobacterial being active against bacteria inthe antifungal and antiviral properties. Devil's club is alsocommonly used by many cultural groups to treat arthritis, rheumatism, respira-tory ailments and as an emetic and purgative. It is also used as an aid in child-birth, post-partum, for internal haemorrhaging, as an analgesic, to treat stomachand digestive tract ailments, broken bones, fever, dandruff, lice, headaches andas a treatment for cancer. Several parts of the shrub, including inner bark, innerbark ash, whole stems, roots, berries and leaves, are used in a variety of ways toeffect these treatments.

Since devil's club is still widely and increasingly, used as a treatment forlate onset type II diabetes and is listed in a recent review of anti-diabetic plants,additional research and more rigorous clinical trials are required to validate andcharacterise or to disprove hypoglycaemic properties in devil's club.' [Lantz 2004] Spiritual Uses 'In addition to ethnographic accounts of medicinal uses, there are also numeroussources that describe spiritual applications of devil's club. These include puri-cation and cleansing; protection against supernatural entities, epidemics and evilinfluences; acquisition of luck; to combat witchcraft; as ceremonial and protec-tive face paint; and in rituals by shamans and others to attain supernaturalpowers.
