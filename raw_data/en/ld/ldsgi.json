Printed by: Unigraphic, Maastricht The studies presented in this dissertation were conducted under the auspices of the Maastricht Health Research Institute for Prevention and Care (HEALTH) at Maastricht University, The Netherlands. HEALTH is pan of the Netherlands School of Primary Care Research (CaRe), which has been formally acknowl- edged since 1995 by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). Financing for the studies presented in this dissertation was generously provided by the Health Research Council of The Netherlands (Het Praeventiefonds/ZON; Project Number 2826380).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many individuals helped me complete this dissertation successfully. Those who have leant professional assistance comprise a good portion - but not all - of those who have promoted my health and happiness along the way. Hence, an acknowledgement for professional assistance can in virtually all cases be under- stood as a simultaneous recognition for personal camaraderie. Regardless, acknowledgement signifies my heartfelt gratitude for the contributions made. Evelyne de Leeuw secured the grant which brought me to The Netherlands and recruited me for the position. Evelyne's intelligence, vitality, and work have been an enormous source of inspiration both professionally and personally. Jurrit Bergsma, through his continuous gifts of wisdom and expertise, was a rock in the sea for me throughout the doctoral process. Jurrit has opened countless doors for me both intellectual and praciical and has thereby facilitated my growth and enhanced the quality of my work. Gerjo Kok demonstrated an essential, unerring commitment to my success as a graduate student and health professional. Math Candel programmed the LISREL analyses presented in Chapter 6, and Geo Visser helped extensively with the data gathering and analy- sis detailed in Chapter 5. Harm Hospers and Rob Ruiter furnished critical strate- gic advice early on in the dissertation process regarding the design of the stud- ies in Chapters 3 and 6, respectively. Of course, the efforts of myself and these others would have come to nothing without the participants in the studies sum- marized by Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 7. Many provided support in less direct - though no less valued - ways. Since I cannot enumerate their many contributions in the space available, I resort to merely identifying these persons by name. They are: Ellis Abbema, Gea Bergsma, Mildred Blaxter, Diane, Joe, Andy, and Jon Commers have provided indispensible support and inspiration. Finally, Ester Delhoofen - my wine and rose - has consistently acted to \"identify and positively condition\" the determinants of my health.THIS DISSERTATION IS DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NETHERLANDS, WHO, IN SO MANY WAYS, MADE IT POSSIBLE.CONTENTS Introduction 11 Chapter 1 Toward a Seamless Salutology: Reconciling Subjectivity and Health Professionalism 17 Chapter 2 A Natural Scientific Foundation for Participation and Empowerment: Implications of A Far-From-Equilibrium Thermodynamic Understanding of Health and Health Etiology 45 Chapter 3 Understandings of the Preconditions for and Determinants of Health among Residents of Maastricht, The Netherlands 69 Chapter 4 Indications of Social Variation in Understandings of the Determinants of Health among Residents of Maastricht, The Netherlands 91 Chapter 5 Representations of Preconditions for and Determinants of Health in the Dutch Press 11S Chapter 6 What Do The Dutch Believe Determines Their Health? 131 Chapter 7 Theoretical and Practical Legitimacy of Public Participation in Dutch Health-Related Policy Formulation 157 Chapter 8 Reflections on the Findings: The Dutch Context and Its Relevance 205 References 239 Summary 253 Samenvatting 257 Curriculum Vitae 261INTRODUCTION Determinants of Health:Theory, Understanding, Portrayal, Policy This dissertation concerns the theory, understanding, and portrayal of determi- nants of health and the relevance of these to health-related public policies. In terms of \"theory\" I have sought to reflect upon the interpretation of the notion of \"determinants of health\" as well as the implications of how \"health\" itself is defined for that interpretation. As regards \"understanding\" I have been con- cerned to assess the ideas held by the Dutch public and policy actors in regards to what determines health (i.e. the \"health etiologies\" of these heterogeneous groups). In relation to \"portrayal\" I have intended to provide some insight into the way in which determinants of health are portrayed within the Dutch media and governmental documents. By using the Dutch context as a case study, my ultimate goal in this dissertation is a meditation on the general relevance of the public's (i.e. the layman's) understanding of health and health etiology to health professionalism'. Public policy is the domain in which health professionalism (from the time and train- ing a doctor can offer a patient to a nation's position on international labor standards) is given the overwhelming majority of its form. Therefore, since my hope is ultimately to reflect upon how the public's understandings of health and health etiology is relevant to the structuring of health professionalism, I am first \u2014 and even foremost \u2014 necessarily concerned with the relevance of those understandings for public policy. Why study the theory, understanding, and portrayal of determinants of health? Anthropological sources teach us that every human society holds a set of values similar - in greater or lesser measure - to those encompassed by the English word \"health.\" Modern Dutch society is no exception to this rule. Since surveys began on the matter, \"gezondheid,\" the Dutch equivalent of \"health,\" has been perceived as the most important commodity in life by a substantial percentage of the population of The Netherlands (SCP, 1996). Since 1985, this percentage has averaged around 55% (SCP, 1996, 2000). I For lack of a suitable alternative, I use the expression \"health professionalism\" in this dissertation to mean all professional actions intended to have a positive impact on the frequency or intensity of the phenomena which a society calls \"health.\" As such, health professionalism includes much more than medical and public health practice and research. As I employ it, the term also includes professional advocacy of health objectives within both explicitly and non-explicitly health-related national and international policies. IIThough it constitutes a broadly accepted social value, however, health \u2014 like freedom or equality \u2014 remains an abstraction. We cannot see, hear, taste, smell, or feel the unifying notion represented by the word \"health\" (or its many lin- guistic equivalents). We must settle for witnessing phenomena (i.e. things we can sense) which for one reason or another embody that notion for us. As is the case with any other abstract end, therefore, the pursuit of health is in the most fundamental terms a striving toward those phenomena which we label as health. The \"health sciences\" are grounded in the belief that the phenomena which we label \"health\" display more or less predictable associations with other phenom- ena (which may or may not themselves be labeled \"health\"*). Kant asserted that when we observe such associations, we are led by a priori intuitions - mostly of time, but also of space - to establish cause and effect. Those phenomena bear- ing an observable relation to the phenomena which we label \"health\" are labeled, \"determinants of health.\" The health sciences are dedicated to the detection, characterization, documentation, and - if possible - the influencing of such determinants. Ancient sources of wisdom as well as insights from modern physics remind us that our understanding of cause and effect is largely illusory. Every \"cause\" is in some sense also an \"effect,\" and every effect is in fact the outcome of an infi- nite and unpredictable set of causes. It is almost paradoxical, therefore, that our lived experience of the world is in many ways dependent upon the identifica- tion of associations among phenomena. For such associations, despite the fact that they mask an ever-present uncertainty in underlying dynamics, are often predictable enough at macro \u2014 sometimes statistical \u2014 levels to be of great prac- tical use in applied terms. When we act to improve determinants of health, our assumptions of cause and effect are translated into means and ends. \"Determinants of health\" are used directly as - or subjected to secondary - means of increasing the relative pres- ence of phenomena labeled \"health.\" Consider the detection of the statistical association between absence of tobacco smoke in the lungs and lower incidence of lung cancer. In this case \"absence of tobacco smoke in the lungs\" is trans- lated directly into a behavioral means (i.e. \"not smoking tobacco\") for achiev- ing a lower populational incidence (or individual likelihood) of lung cancer. Further, secondary means, such as policy-based or behavioral interventions, are employed to achieve the same ends. In practice, scarce resources must be allocated to the achievement of health- related ends. This implies that not all possible health-related ends can be pur- 2 As I discuss in greater depth in Chapter I, phenomena labeled \"health\" may sometimes be considered determinants of other phenomena labeled \"health.\" 12sued and that not all possible means can be employed. Choices have to be made about which health-related ends are most worthy and which means are most suitable. The pursuit of ends which large percentages of the population do not value or which are infeasible would in most cases be an unethical waste of available resources. Ideally, therefore, the health ends selected by professional and public health institutions would be maximally democratically-supported and responsible (i.e. both feasible and valued). Similarly, allocating resources to means which do not achieve valued ends or are incompatible with public values would mean those resources might have been put to use in better ways. Therefore, the means employed in the interest of desired health ends would preferably be both maximally democratically-supported and efficient. Maximizing democratic support for health-related ends and means implies the need for ongoing dialogue and negotiation between professionals empowered to make decisions about those ends and means and the general public. Democratic support among the public for health ends depends on whether the public associates those ends with health, the extent it sees them as associated, and the relative intrinsic value it ascribes to those ends regardless of their asso- ciation with the encompassing health value. Democratic support among the public for the means employed in the pursuit of health ends is rooted in the public's understanding of the scientific, normative, and aesthetic legitimacy of those means. Because it relies on creating consensus between professionals and the public, optimizing democratic support for the health ends pursued by pro- fessionals and the means employed in pursuit of them demands dialogue and negotiation with the public. Guaranteeing that health ends are responsible and that the means chosen to pursue them are efficient also entails ongoing dialogue and negotiation between professionals and the general public. Part of the traditional social contract of the health professional is to promote longevity and minimize measurable disease. At times professionals empowered to make decisions about which health ends should be pursued do and must use their privileged position to assure that those ends are achievable, measurable, or ethical. Yet the public may in fact exert pressure on those professionals to redefine what is considered unachiev- able, immeasurable, or unethical. Ensuring that the means employed to achieve health-related ends are efficient is also a two-way street. Professionals, at times, do and must influence the choice of health-related means to make certain that those means are effective and are employed with a minimum of investment of scarce resources. Yet the causal reasoning behind means selection must be shared with the public. On the one hand, the public must certify that the means chosen by professionals are both normatively and aesthetically acceptable. On the other hand, the public often must itself act in collaboration with or independent of professionals to promote health when the means in concern are those to which they have partial or exclusive access. 13Dialogue and negotiation between professionals and the general public regarding health-related ends and means requires the mutual exchange of understandings and positions. The understandings and positions of professionals in regards to the most appropriate health-related ends and means are hardly homogeneous, yet the whole assortment is easy to find in scientific journals, government publications, medical texts, as well as in the media and public domain. However, far less is known about the understandings or positions which the public holds about what constitutes and determines health or what these understandings imply for the public's views of the appropriateness of various health-related ends and means. Much good research has been done previously on \"lay beliefs\" about what con- stitutes and determines Bakker and De Vries, 1997; Petrie and Weinman, 1997). Yet each of these existing studies has possessed at least one (and often more than one) of the following traits: - a qualitative design implemented among a small sample of respondents; - a focus on lay beliefs as they relate to specific - often pathogenic - themes within health etiology (e.g. documentation of lay beliefs of the benefits of smoking cessation); \u2014 no focus on social variation in lay beliefs; \u2014 no integration or coupling of the study results with corresponding policy contexts. Though irreplaceable, qualitative designs alone cannot provide the generalizabil- ity requisite to action at the aggregate level of public policy. Focus on specific themes within health etiology leads to a loss of the wider, overall perspective of understandings which may be at work among the public. For instance, assessing the public's awareness of the harms of smoking tells us nothing about whether that same public would support steps to promote health through better housing standards or traffic safety regulations. A lack of insight into social variation in public understandings precludes the possibility of policies for health which con- nect with the values of the populations affected by them. Finally, the absence of integration of study results with corresponding policy contexts creates a simple but significant analytical gap in the application of such results in policy con- texts. By missing one or more of these four elements, therefore, previous stud- ies on lay beliefs are limited - to a greater or lesser extent - in their ability to establish the relevance of the lay beliefs they assess for the structuring of health professionalism through public policies. 14The goal of this dissertation, therefore, is to make a strategic contribution to existing research by examining the relevance of public understandings of what constitutes and determines health for the structuring of health professionalism through public policies. Hence its central research question is taken to be: What are the Dutch public's understandings of what constitutes and determines health, what do those understandings mean for the structuring of health profes- sionalism through public policy within the status quo, and what could they imply for the future structuring of health professionalism through public policy? More specifically, this means addressing the following six specific research questions: 1 How can we conceptualize a role for the public in defining the ends pursued in the name of health and in evaluating or employing independently the means to achieve those ends? 2 What is the context of understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public? 3 Are understandings of health etiology a function of one's conceptualization of health itself? 4 How do the public's health etiological understandings compare with those portrayed by the media and public policy? 5 To what extent and how are, should, and could the public's understandings of health and health etiology (be) incorporated within health-related public policies? 6 Given the whole picture, what is the relevance of understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public for the structuring of health professionalism through public policy in The Netherlands? In order to make it possible to answer the research questions, the research pre- sented in this dissertation attempts to surmount the barriers found in previous studies by possessing four corresponding characteristics: \u2014 both qualitative and quantitative methods; - a maximally-broad, salutogenic focus on lay beliefs (e.g. documentation of the full spectrum of lay beliefs of what determines health); - focus on social variation in lay beliefs; \u2014 integration or coupling of the study results with corresponding policy contexts. Structure of the dissertation The structure of the dissertation follows the general lines of scientific inquiry in relation to the specific research questions and characteristics discussed above. First, with two theoretical arguments (Chapters 1 and 2), I hypothesize the rel- 15evance of public understandings of health and health etiology to the structuring of health professionalism. Second, I document and characterize the Dutch public's understandings of health and health etiology by means of both a quali- tative (Chapters 3 and 4) and quantitative (Chapter 6) study. Third, I analyze what the Dutch press portrays as determining health (Chapter 5). Fourth, the results among the Dutch public are compared to policy content and their rele- vance to public policy development analyzed (Chapter 7). Finally, I end the dis- sertation with a general reflection on the findings and their theoretical implica- tions (Chapter 8). Throughout the empirical chapters (Chapters 3-7), I employ the first person plural form \"we.\" This is to acknowledge Geo Visser for help with coding (Chapter 5), Math Candel for statistical contributions (Chapter 6), and Evelyne de Leeuw and Jurrit Bergsma for the inspiration and guidance they brought to the empirical work as a whole. However, with the exception of parts of the Methods section in Chapter 6 (written in collaboration with Math Candel), all text is mine and, as such, my responsibility alone. 16CHAPTER I TOWARD A SEAMLESS SALUTOLOGY Reconciling Subjectivity and Health Professionalism \"...recipes for a healthier society must be clear about what they mean by 'health', and what aspect of health they are directed at.\" (Mildred Bla.vter, 1990) INTRODUCTION \"Health\" is a word which represents different things to different people at dif- ferent times and in different situations. This empirically well-documented fact contrasts dramatically with the professional desire to standardize health among all people, across time, and in any situation. Perhaps for this very reason, little has been done to provide for the explicit accommodation of diverse conceptual- izations of health and health etiology within theories of health professionalism. This paper attempts to address this gap by providing a model for classifying varying levels of subjectivity in health goals and die means employed to pursue them. Since subjectivity is a theme of importance to any field seeking to enhance health, the model is illustrated in relation to three archetypal profes- sional health fields. 17In the first section of the paper, I present insights from empirical science, theory, and practice which have revealed important limitations to the positivist tradition in health professionalism and the resulting need for the accommodation of sub- jectivity in health theory. In the second section, I attempt to develop a working vocabulary for the discussion of subjectivity in relation to health and health professionalism. This vocabulary is then employed to further specify the nature of the challenges which subjectivity poses for health professionalism. In the third section, I build on the work of Aaron Antonovsky and Rene Dubos to construct a model for grounding the abstract conceptualization of \"health\" in the more concrete currency of health etiological resources. Finally, in the fourth section of the paper, I suggest how Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action might be used as a means of theorizing the ongoing negotiation between health professionals and the public regarding health goals and means. This is then car- ried into a discussion of the meaning and dynamics of \"salutology.\" / THE CHALLENGE OF Si/\u00df/ECT/wry FOR HEALTH PROFESS/ONAL/SM The positivist tradition in health professionalism The so-called \"biomedical paradigm,\" today constitutes the dominant tradition within health professionalism. Though clinical medicine and epidemiology are quite distinct disciplines, they share key epistemological assumptions which have led to their mutual classification as \"biomedical.\" The epidemiologist's concern, by definition, with the incidence and prevalence of disease in popula- tions leads to the operationalization of health in practice as lower morbidity and mortality in a population. Implicit, therefore, is an epidemiological definition of health as freedom from measurable disease and longevity. Such a definition coincides nicely with the world view of clinical medicine, which as a field seeks to cure disease and extend life in individuals. By defining health as the absence of measurable morbidity and premature mortality, both clinical medi- cine and epidemiology limit health to an empirically observable \u2014 and therefore highly reliable - epistemological realm. It is the relatively high reliability of knowledge produced within such narrow epistemological confines which has earned for medicine and epidemiology a dominant status within health profes- sionalism. This dominant status, then, presupposes the privilege of defining which health goals are encompassed by the label \"health\" and the best means for pur- suing these. Despite its widespread employment, we should perhaps question the wisdom of using the expression \"biomedical paradigm.\" The word \"biomedical\" has come 18in some health professional circles to be synonymous with curative medical care. Yet one finds at least some examples of other types of care even within medicine itself, such as palliative care for the terminal ill. Inversely, one finds a great deal of epidemiology even in fields such as health education and policy- based health promotion, which have sought explicitly to distance themselves from \"biomedical\" disciplines. Thus \"biomedical\" seems a less adequate term than \"positivist.\" \"Paradigm,\" on the other hand, is a term developed by Kuhn (1968:1 1) to describe \"models from which spring particular coherent traditions of scientific research.\" The expression \"biomedical paradigm\" has often been employed to call attention to the hegemonic manner in which, as Starr (1988) has documented, medicine has endeavored to undermine the legitimacy of all other types of health professionalism, especially those which portend to cure. However, the term \"paradigm\" implies very strongly, in Kuhn's original sense, that the essence of a dominant paradigm must be discredited before the ascen- dance of a new paradigm can begin (1968:77). Most professional health fields which would not identify themselves as \"biomedical\" would also not, however, wish to claim a falsification of biomedical epistemology; they would assert the incompleteness rather than the inaccuracy of that model. Therefore, in this paper, 1 will refer to the \"positivist tradition\" within health professionalism. This expres- sion, accommodates the fact that empirical sci- ence is employed quite universally within professional health disciplines. It also allows for the possibility that such employment might coexist, rather than be replaced by, professional actions for health which fall outside the boundaries of the epistemology or practice of positivism. Limitations to the positivist tradition in health professionalism Over the past quarter century, limitations inherent to the positivist tradition in health professionalism have become apparent at empirical, theoretical, and applied levels. Researchers, theoreticians, and practitioners have asserted thai notions of \"health\" held by individuals and social groups extend well beyond the realm of empirically observable phenomena. Such voices have further described individual and social values as critical factors in determining which goals should be pursued in the name of \"health\" and which means should be used to do so. This implies, of course, that individual and group understandings of health may conflict with the notions of health embodied by empirical opera- tionalizations of health within the positivist tradition. At least three areas in the health literature reveal an empirical confirmation of social and individual diversity in understandings of health. Exhaustive studies have concluded, for instance, that conceptions of health or the origins of health differ markedly by socioeconomic status (Herzlich, 1973; age (Van der Heuvel, 1989; Blaxter, 1990), status as a smoker (Dijkstra, Bakker and De Vries, 1997) or patient (Tsevat, Cook, Green, Matchar et al., 1995), (Dubos and Taket, 1996; Bergsma and Commers, 1997), and this remains a partial list. The work of Stainton Rogers (Stainton Rogers, 1991) deserves special mention, because it describes at both detailed and more abstracted levels the myriad concepts which individuals identify as \"health\". Second, though longevity (i.e. relatively lower mortality) is the world's number one measure of population health, there is evidence which questions whether populations agree with this operationalization of \"health\". Joosten (1989) found that among a sample of 764 Dutch respondents, \"long life\" ranked 17th on a list of 21 possible completions to the leader, \"Health is...\" D'Houtaud and Field (1984) found that only 0.4% of 4000 respondents spontaneously mentioned the theme \"long life\" as an answer to the question, \"What is, according to you, the best definition of health?\" Donald \"Dax\" Cowart became an emblem of patients' autonomy discourse in bioethics when he consciously and coherently asserted his right to refuse life-saving medical care after being burned severely in the early 1970's (Cavalier, Covey, and Anderson, 1999; McGee, 1997). In Dax's case, the patient fell that health was death, whereas the law compelled doctors to preserve his life. This pitting of legal versus personal health goals is mimicked, of course, when the issue of \"active\" euthanasia is at hand. Finally, Tseval, et al. (1995) found that seriously ill patients have radically different desires from one another in regards to their wishes for medical treatment to extend life or relieve pain. In addition to empirical studies, a number of influential theoreticians have chal- lenged the moral legitimacy of the positivist tradition in health professionalism. Parsons' (1964:274) defined health as \"the state of optimum capacity of an individual for the effective performance of the roles and tasks for which he has been socialized.\" This functionalist approach to health opened the way for a tra- dition of analysis which emphasized that what is called \"health\" is a product of social structure and therefore of power relations. Illich (1976) asserted that the reduction of the human being to a \"machine\" (and even to the notion of a system) resulted in multiple forms of \"iatrogenesis,\" a term he employs for bio- medically-induced health loss. For Illich, the positivism of biomedicine was irreconcilable with the ideal of allowing health to be constructed on democratic (1976:128) or individual (1976:273) grounds. Navarro (1981) asserted that biomedicine is designed merely to support the conditions which facilitate the extraction of capital. Navarro understands positivism within medicine and epi- demiology to be a powerful tool for the legitimization of existing power rela- 20tions. He decries the portrayal of science within the positivist tradition as neu- tral, as well as the corresponding necessity of professional expertise for inter- preting all aspects of reality which have a bearing on health. In protest of bio- medicine, Navarro expresses the need for the massive democratic participation of workers in decisions relating to social structure and hence to health. Practice, rather than health research or theory, has also shown the necessity of respect for \"lay\" opinions on health goals and the means employed to achieve them. The ubiquitous call for \"participation,\" from clinical medicine to policy- based health promotion, has emerged more from the failure of top-down pro- gramming than empirical or moral insight. In medicine, doctors have conceded a steadily larger \u2014 albeit still subordinate \u2014 role for the patient in medical deci- sionmaking due to demands for such among patients and ethicists. Concern with informed consent and living wills is a symptom of this shift. Patient par- ticipation has also been shown to harbor potential benefits for the coping (and thus survival) ability of persons with chronic conditions (Bergsma and Commers, 1997). Still being debated in most of the world are the issues of whether patients should have the right to refuse live-saving care (McGee, 1997) or to receive assistance in dying (Houtepen, 1998). In health education, recom- mended practice presupposes the participation of those whose health is in ques- tion. Green and Kreuter's (1991) Precede-Proceed Model, perhaps the most widely employed planning schema in Western health education interventions, emphasizes community participation. The authors contend that if a community is not involved in goal-setting, it is unlikely to trust, support, or internalize the goals of an initiative. Finally, experience has shown the necessity and advantage of involving populations in the development and implementation of policy- based or \"structural\" health promotion efforts. This insight has been institution- alized in the Ottawa Charter for and Jakarta Declaration of health promotion (WHO, 1986, 1997). The empirical, theoretical, and applied insights described above all emphasize either the reality or necessity of lay participation in the defining of health goals and the choosing of appropriate means for pursuing them. Such emphases thereby reveal the inherent limitations of the positivist tradition within health professionalism. The positivist tradition, as we have seen, presupposes profes- sionals' ability to operationalize health in universally applicable and empirically observable terms, and to scientifically identify appropriate means for the pro- motion of those operationalizations. The acknowledgement of a lay role in these processes overwhelms the capacities of the dominant positivist tradition in health professionalism. This is demonstrated by that fact that none of the insights referred to in this section (empirical, theoretical, applied) are widely integrated into health professionalism. Diversity in notions of health, ideological skepticism of biomedicine, and participation are all themes which, while they are increasingly demanding attention, remain at the fringe of health profession- 21alism. One reason for this marginalization is the lack of overarching theory which acknowledges both the \"objectivity\" suggested by the narrow yet reliable epistemological standards of the positivist tradition, while at the same time ascribes a legitimate place to the \"subjectivity\" implied by lay evaluation of health goals and the means employed in pursuit of them. // A VOCA\u00dfUMRy OF RELA77VE Sl/BJECT/WTY FOR HEALTH GOALS AND DE7ER/V1/NANTS Much ambiguity exists in the way words are used to deal with subjectivity in professional health literature. Perhaps the best example of this problem is the expression \"subjective health\" itself. In health-related literature, \"subjective health\" has most often been employed as one \"subjective\" variable among a number of \"objective\" variables in studies seeking to document the \"overall\" health status of a population or the effects of risk factors upon that status (e.g. Mackenbach, Van den Bos, Joung, Van de Mheen, and Stronks, 1994). However, such employment of \"subjective health\" leaves no room for the kind of subjectivity involved in a terminally-ill cancer patient's decision about whether \"fighting it out in the hospital\" or \"dying at home with my family\" constitutes health. As I hope to make clear, the kind of \"subjectivity\" I am addressing in this paper encompasses both of these examples, since both involve the lay evaluation of health goals and the means to them. Nonetheless, to prevent confusion, I will try in this section to briefly develop an operational vocabulary for dealing with the issues of subjectivity and health professionalism I address in the final two sections. Phenomena-labeled-as-healch As the actions of any health professional confirm, any action in the interest of health demands an operationalization of health. For example, when a physician sets a cast on a broken leg, health is operationalized as an intact leg bone. When a health educator distributes materials urging people not to eat excessive fat, health is implicitly depicted as a life free of disease induced by excessive dietary fat (and perhaps a longer life because of it). When a psychologist speaks with a patient, health may be represented as greater self-esteem, or less experi- enced anger. In other words, it is only through the embodiments which are labeled as \"health\" in situ that we can \"see the ideal\" in its incarnate form. It is in fact this labeling, conducted at individual and social levels, which constitutes the locus of relative subjectivity within health discourse. I will therefore employ the expression \"phenomena-labeled-as-health\" to acknowledge both the variety of phenomena encompassed by the label \"health\" as well as the labeling process 22itself, as it is negotiated by individuals and social groups. To pick up on the point made in the previous paragraph, \"phenomena-labeled-as-health\" is an expression broad enough to accommodate both experiential (i.e. the self- assessed feeling of wellbeing) and discretionary (i.e. \"1 want to die at home even it is means less time\") subjectivity. Definitional and etiological dimensions It is virtually impossible to theoretically distinguish phenomena-labeled-as- health from the \"preconditions\" or \"determinants\" of these phenomena. Any phenomenon-labeled-as-health, after all, can itself be seen as a \"determinant\" of the mental experience it induces, which may in turn also be labeled as \"health.\" For example, is health an intact leg-bone, or the absence-of-pain which accom- panies it? Alternatively, is health this absence-of-pain, or the decreased-sense-of- vulnerability which emerges over time in its absence? Phenomena-labeled-as- health and their \"determinants\", then, are links in a never-ending chain. Nonetheless, it is possible to distinguish phenomena-labeled-as-health from what might be called \"determinants-of-phenomena-labeled-as-health\" if we con- ceive a split between a \"definitional-\" and \"etiological dimension\" in health dis- course. In this conceptualization, a \"definitional dimension\" would concern all phenomena in regards to the question of whether they are, or should be, labeled as \"health\". An \"etiological dimension\", in contrast, would concern only the fac- tors asserted to be relevant (i.e. \"causally\" related) to the relative presence or absence of phenomena which have already been labeled-as-health. Objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity In this paper, the terms \"objectivity\", \"intersubjectivity\", and \"subjectivity\" will be used to identify distinct referential contexts, each specifying a set of unique epistemological sources, processes and products. In adopting this rather tradi- tional terminology, I in no way wish to enter the centuries-old debate about whether \"objectivity\" exists. I am merely in need of a vocabulary which can both accommodate and articulate the epistemological controversies at work within health professionalism. Further, these terms will allow for a more com- prehensible coupling of these controversies with Habermas' (1984, 1987) work. In developing definitions for these terms below, I use quotes from Webster's Dictionary (1988) to sketch the broad lines of each referential con- text, and supplement these by paraphrasing the more specific meanings which Habermas ascribes to it. \"Objectivity\", then, will henceforth be understood as a referential context in which knowledge is asserted or believed to concern \"phe- nomenon[/a] or condition[s] in the realm of sensible experience independent of individual thought and perceptible by all observers.\" As such, objectivity is understood to encompass, but not be limited to, Habermas' conceptualization of the \"objective\" as concerning only knowledge which can be discussed as true or false. \"Intersubjectivity\" will be understood as a referential context in which knowledge is asserted or believed to be both \"accessible to or capable of being 23established for two or more subjects\" and produced through a process \"involv- ing or occurring between [multiple] separate conscious minds.\" This context includes, but transcends, Habermas' idea of the \"intersubjective\" level as con- cerning topics which can only be discussed in terms of their goodness or moral Tightness. \"Subjectivity\", lastly, will be understood as a referential context in which knowledge is asserted or believed to refer to objects \"characteristic of or belonging to reality as perceived rather than as independent of mind.\" Subjectivity, because it refers to the world as perceived, includes the domain in which we express personal choice, opinion, and taste. This is closely analogous to Habermas' understanding of the \"subjective\" as relating to aesthetic tastes and preferences which emerge from a world to which only individual commu- nicating actors have exclusive and privileged access. Table 1.1 provides a visual interpretation of the three referential contexts across both the definitional and etiological dimensions. Intersubjectivity and subjectivity in the definitional dimension The definitional dimension concerns application of the label \"health\" to phe- nomena. There are two ways in which a phenomenon can be said to be \"labeled-as-health.\" The first case is represented by a situation in which two or more persons, both (or all) of whom have perceptual access to a phenomenon, come to agreement that it properly deserves the label, \"health.\" This case belongs to the referential context we have called intersubjectivity, because it involves knowledge (the labeling of a phenomenon) developed through inter- personal perception and communication. On the basis of this reasoning, phe- nomena-labeled-as-health can be said to enjoy varying levels of intersubjective consensus. For instance, almost all people would perceive an intact leg bone to be in a greater stale of \"health\" than the same bone when it is broken and causing its owner significant anguish and functional limitation. Far fewer would agree that physical fitness (Stainton Rogers, 1991) or equilibrium (Herzlich, 1973) constitute health. The second case is represented by a situation in which an individual decides that a given phenomenon constitutes health for him- or her- self. This case belongs to the referential context we have called subjectivity, because it refers to knowledge which has its origin in personal taste and is pro- duced through individual expression. Phenomena-labeled-as-health can thus be said to enjoy varying levels of subjective conviction. An individual may firmly believe that being physically fit is health, and she may also associate equilib- rium with that label, though to a lesser extent. The health sciences today pursue many phenomena-labeled-as-health. As we have seen, these phenomena (as well as many others) engender varying levels of consensus and conviction regarding the notion that they indeed constitute \"health\". However, to assert that some phenomena constitute \"health\" to only few people \u2014 or even one individual \u2014 at a given time is not to question the legitimacy of their labeling as \"health\". On the contrary, the first section of this 24Table I.I Criteria for the identification of phenonema-labelled-as-health and determi- SubjectivityPhenomena-labelled-as-health (Definitional - , Socially negotiated consensus Individually evaluated convictionDeterminants-of Phenomena-labelled-as-health (Ecological Dimension) Scientific predictability of exposure to causal factors or their conditioning by professional actions Moral acceptability of exposure to causal factors or their conditioning by professional actions Aesthetic desirability of exposure to causal factors or their conditioning by professional actions paper was intended to detail the necessity of accommodating such phenomena within an overarching theory of health and health etiology. The central point is that the labeling of phenomena as \"health\" is a process which occurs within the referential contexts of intersubjectivity and subjectivity. The implicit point is that that labeling takes place within these referential contexts only. This is to assert that knowledge within die referential context of objectivity, of which sci- entific knowledge (knowledge capable of being validated through empirical observation) is a part, has no legitimate bearing on which phenomena \"health\" should encompass for social groups or individuals. This is not to say that health scientists have not in the past either been granted, or inappropriately seized, opportunities to unilaterally assign the label \"health\" to the phenomena they choose. Rather, it is to assert that, from a theoretical perspective, a scientist or health professional has a right to no more power than the \"layman\" when it comes to deciding which phenomena are labeled \"health\" and which are not. Objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity in the etiological dimension Sometimes, the presence or absence of phenomena-labeled-as-health is influ- enced by one or more etiological factors. To label such factors as \"determi- nants-of-phenomena-labeled-as-health\" is, of course, to make assertions about 25the causal relationships between those factors and phenomena-labeled-as-health. Because we generally understand \"causality\" to be something independent of individual perception, this theme penetrates the referential context of objectiv- ity. Where scientific knowledge is irrelevant within the definitional dimension, therefore, it can play an important role in the eliological dimension. This is the case insofar as questions of causality concern the truth of the assertion that a given factor influences the presence or absence of phenomena-labeled-as-health. However, though it is quite important to keep in mind the limitations of scien- tific knowledge within the definitional dimension, it is crucial to acknowledge the significance of intersubjectivity and subjectivity within the etiological dimension. First, the question of causality is and should be considered within the referential context of intersubjectivity. This is not said simply to imply that people come to consensus about what factors influence phenomena-labeled-as- health, though that is indeed part of the message. Rather, the question of causality within intersubjectivity includes questions of the goodness, Tightness, or moral acceptability of exposure to causal factors or their conditioning by health professionals. Second, causality is and should also be considered within the referential context of subjectivity. Focusing on the perceived nature of a causal relationship has implications for the extent to which that relationship has value to the perceiver. Thus, the aesthetic desirability of causal factors and of their conditioning by health professionals becomes thematized. fa situations where the presence or absence of a determining factor is itself under human control, both intersubjectivity and subjectivity become critical factors in the dis- cussion and evaluation of causality when questions of action are considered. Rephrasing the problem The central problem which this paper seeks to address can now be restated in more exact terms. In short, we lack an overarching theory of all professional activities conducted in the interest of health which accounts for intersubjectivity and subjectivity in both the definitional and etiological dimensions. Empirical, theoretical, and practical insights have revealed the limitations to the positivist tradition within health professionalism. Within the definitional dimension, studies on diversity in notions of health reveal that the phenomena which people label as \"health\" can be both abstract and diverse. Positivism, however, demands that such phenomena be both measurable and standardizable. As such, the positivist tradition inherently disowns and delegitimizes a portion of the phenomena which people label \"health.\" Within the etiological dimension, the positivist tradition is limited to assessments of the \"truth\" of causal relation- ships; and, at that, is also limited to the study of relationships between measur- able phenomena only. As such, the positivist tradition is incapable of accommo- dating questions relating to the moral or aesthetic considerations of exposure to a causal factor or to professional conditioning of that factor. In practice, these 26limitations have led to the additional problem that the etiological domain of a health profession (biochemical \u2014 medicine, ideological - health education, envi- ronmental - policy-based health promotion') has been confused with the refer- ential context (objectivity, intersubjectivity, subjectivity) in which it operates. That has damaged all the fields concerned. Medicine has felt threatened by lay participation, fearing it would undermine aspects of the discipline which are and should remain \"objective\". Health promotion has been unable to own up to its own positivist, epidemiological tradition for fear of being perceived as having abandoned its concern with participation and empowerment. This implies the need for a transdisciplinary model of health etiology which describes the role of health enhancing fields within all three referential contexts. /// GROUND/NG \"HEALTH\" and Rene Dubos (1901-1982) damental contributions to the etiology' of health. Antonovsky was a sociologist by training and has become best known for posing the question of \"salutogene- sis,\" or how people move toward the \"ease\" end of the \"health ease-disease continuum.\" Dubos was a career microbiologist and appears in most ency- clopaedias on the exclusive basis of his contributions to the development of antibiotics. In a sense, therefore, it would seem at first that Antonovsky was the health philosopher and Dubos the empiricist. In this section, however, I argue that - though it may seem somewhat ironic - it was Antonovsky who most contributes to our ability to theorize etiological objectivity and Dubos who most facilitates our understanding of etiological intersubjectivity and subjectiv- ity. Taken together, they thus provide the transdisciplinary model of health eti- ology of which we are in need. 1 Especially health promotion initiatives concerned with providing environments supportive of phenomena- labeled-as-health which have traditionally been associated with quality rather than quantity of life (e.g. greening of cities, anti-liner campaigns, decreased noise pollution). 2 Though most dictionaries acknowledge that the word 'etiology' has specific connotations with the origins of disease, it should be clear by now that I am using this term in a more broad - and more literal - sense. Once again, to borrow from Webster's (1988). etiology is here taken to mean.'a branch of knowledge [italics added] concerned with the causes of particular phenomena.' In this case, of course, we are as concerned with the study of factors causally related to phenomena-labeled-as-health as with those related to phenomena-labeled-as-'not (e.g. disease). \"*\u00ab- 27Antonovsky and etiological innovative etiological theorist. Within the definitional dimension, Antonovsky was concerned with both intersubjective and subjective phenom- ena-labeled-as-health. Further, he reconceptualized health etiology into the three-part schema I have already referred to and will employ throughout the rest of this paper comprised of biochemical, ideological, and environmental resources. However, because Antonovsky's central aim was to force the expan- sion of epidemiological approaches to health etiology, he confined himself epis- temologically to empirical health constructs and the discussion of etiological truth. As such, Antonovsky provides a theory of etiology which applies across the full breadth of the definitional dimension, but a theory largely limited within the etiological dimension to the referential context of objectivity. In his seminal first book on the salutogenic approach, Antonovsky asserts, \"It seemed to me that one could most usefully conceptualize breakdown [i.e. the relative absence of health] by selecting four crucial facets: pain, functional limita- tion, prognostic implication, and action implication\" (1979:57). When these terms are subsequently explained, Antonovsky makes clear that he is operational- izing health with two subjective variables: absence of pain and functional limita- tion. \"It seems to me to be preferable to be guided, in [the functional limitation] facet no less than the pain facet, by an explicitly subjective criterion.\" (1979:61). On the other hand, health is defined by two variables assessed by professionals. The first, \"prognostic implication,\" as well as the second, the \"action implica- tion\" of that prognosis, are \"defined by the professional health authorities\" (1979:65) based on the \"set of signs and symptoms\" in \"any given culture\" (1979:61). Thus this half of Antonovsky's four-part operationalization of health are identified by professionals, but on the basis of knowledge which Antonovsky admits is culture-specific and thus intersubjective. Antonovsky, then, explicitly seeks a theory of health etiology which applies to phenomena which have been labeled-as-health upon both subjective and intersubjective grounds. The essence of Antonovsky's salutogenic question is, \"given that the human condition is stressful...how any of us manage to stay healthy.\" (1990:231). By framing the question of etiology in salutogenic terms, Antonovsky opened the door to the consideration of health-producing resources in contrast to the tradi- tional epidemiological focus on health threats. He labeled these health-producing resources \"Generalized Resistance Resources\" (GRRs). GRRs were initially said to 3 All citations within this sub-section refer exclusively to Aaron Antonovsky unless otherwise stated. 28be the means available to people to avoid or combat the ubiquitous Stressors of living which \"can be defined as a demand made by the internal or external environment of an organism that upsets its homeostasis.\" (1979:72). In his second book, however, Antonovsky (1987) streamlined his theory and relheo- rized GRRs and Stressors as a Resistance Resources/Resistance Deficits\" (GRR/RDs). This continuum accounts theoretically for the relative possession of or access to the requisite resources for health by individuals and social groups (1987:28). GRR/RDs are to be found in the internal (Antonovsky identifies physical, biochemical, cognitive, emotional, valuative-attitudinal resources) and external (artifactual-material, interpersonal- relational, macrosociocultural) environments of an individual. Central to die mechanics of Antonovsky's theory of salutogenesis is the \"Sense of Coherence\" (SOC) construct. \"One can speak of the SOC as a dispositional orien- tation\" (1987:19) which \"distills the core of specific coping or resistance resources...and expresses what they have in common: they enhance one's sense of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. In this way, the SOC offers an explanation of how these resources may contribute to health [The SOC] is most emphatically not a coping style or a substantive resource...\" (Sagy and Antonovsky, 1998:8). Antonovsky wished to assert the latter distinction between the SOC and a \"substantive resource\" in order to allow for conceptualization of the SOC as an orientation which enables die flexible employment of resources appro- priate to meeting the challenges of the moment. Yet, as such, the SOC undoubt- edly constitutes some form of psychosocial characteristic within the individual. Antonovsky remains deliberately vague on this point but in fact is very hard pressed to distinguish between cognitive, emotional, and value-attitudinal \"resources\" (i.e. psychosocial characteristics) and the SOC as an orientation. Here I wish to consciously abstain from this distinction, while still keeping in mind Antonovsky's useful and important heuristic purpose in asserting it. If we describe the SOC as a \"global\" rather than \"specifically-employable\" psychosocial resource, we stay quite within the spirit if not the letter of Antonovsky's theory. In doing so, we can then reconceptualize his approach to health-producing resources as comprising three realms: the biochemical (Antonovsky's terms are physical and biochemical), the ideological\"* (cognitive, emotional, value-attitudinal, SOC), and the environmental (artifactual, interpersonal-relational, macrosociocultural). While he considered the etiology of phenomena which have been labeled-as- health upon both subjective and intersubjective grounds, Antonovsky explicitly eschewed connecting the word \"health\" with phenomena which are not empiri- cally observable. One need not look much further, as I did earlier in this sec- 4 Pertaining to 'a manner or the content of thinking characteristic of an individual, group, or culture.' (Websters. 1988) 29tion, than Antonovsky's four-point operationalization of health \"Pain\", \"functional limitation\", \"prognostic implication\", and \"action implication\", though identified by individuals and professionals, are relatively unambiguous and fall clearly within the realm of that which can be standard- ized and measured from one individual to the next. Antonovsky went to lengths to separate himself from phenomena-labeled-as-health which are not capable of such standardization and measurement. \"As I hope I make clear in the following pages, the resemblance between the focus on positive health and the problem of salutogenesis is quite superficial....My point is that by defining health as coextensive with the many other dimensions of well-being, one makes the con- cept of health meaningless and impossible to study [italics added] Health well being must be measured [italics added] separately, whether in the way I have pro- posed or in some other way. Only then can we clarify the forces that shape the individual's or group's location on the health ease/dis-ease continuum\" (1979:52-69). We have seen that Antonovsky provides a theoretical schema for health etiology which comprises three realms: the biochemical, ideological, and environmental. I have also tried to make clear that the phenomena-labeled-as-health addressed by Antonovsky's theory of health etiology include both intersubjective and sub- jective notions. However, whether labeled on intersubjective or subjective grounds, these phenomena-labeled-as-health are only sanctioned by Antonovsky to the extent that they are measurable, and thus by definition operationalizable and standardizable. Combining these insights, it is clear, then, that Antonovsky is a theorist from whom we inherit the ability to conceptualize causal relation- ships between 1) empirically observable phenomena which are labeled-as-health upon either intersubjective or subjective grounds and 2) a comprehensive assortment of health producing resources. As such, it can be said more con- cisely that Antonovsky allows us to conceptualize the objective region of the eliological dimension in terms accessible to a comprehensive range of profes- sional health disciplines. The structure of Table 1.2 provides a way of visualizing this. The labels at the top of the table, on the horizontal axis, correspond to the biochemical, ideolog- ical, and environmental realms of health producing resources distilled from Antonovsky. To show the connection between these resources and health pro- fessionalism, I have given examples of disciplines whose primary concern it is to interact with the respective types of etiological resources. This is not at all to assert that these fields deal exclusively with only one of the three types of resources. In practice, there is significant overlap: doctors and policy-based health promotion professionals both attempt to influence ideological resources as well as biochemical and environmental resources. The labels running down the left side of the table show the referential contexts of objectivity, intersubjec- tivity, and subjectivity. types within referential Referential Content of Objectivity Referential Context of Intersubjectivity Referential Context of SubjectivityBiochemical (Realm of Mediane) Empirical confirmation of the effectiveness of antibiotics in killing streptococci bacteria Moral consensus about abortion, euthanasia, ovum donation, and (eventually) gene therapies Patient conviction about life-prolonging treatments, plastic surgery, or medication with negative side effectsEtiological Resource Type Ideological (Realm of Health Educ.)

That Dubos was a major source of inspiration for Antonovsky is reflected in the similarities between certain core aspects of the two theorists' work. Like Antonovsky, Dubos wrote within the definitional dimension about phenomena which were labeled-as-health on both intersubjective and subjective grounds. Also in step with Antonovsky, Dubos asserted within the etiological dimension the preeminence of biochemical, ideological, and environmental resources as central to the attainment of health. However, by focusing on the limitations rather than the importance of the empirical operationalization of health, Dubos ventured where his protege feared to tread. As Antonovsky him- S All citations within this sub-section refer exclusively to Rene J. Dubos unless otherwise stated. 31self noted, \"Dubos...opens the way for a radical reconsideration of the problem [because he] raises the question of our capacities for adaptation and the social determinants of these capacities [italics added]\" (Antonovsky, 1979:226). It was pre- cisely in asserting the importance of the social evaluation of health etiology that the ideas of Dubos extend beyond the referential context of objectivity which lies at the center of the work of Antonovsky. Dubos believed that \"the precise meanings of the words health and disease differ from one social group to another or even from person to person\" (1965:348). He asserted, \"Even the words health and disease...are meaningful only in the light of social criteria, which in turn are determined by beliefs and mores that differ from one group to another and even from one person to another\" (1965:420). Like Antonovsky, Dubos thus conceived of a definitional dimension operative within both the referential contexts of intersubjectivity and subjectivity. However, Dubos sensed that the subjective and intersubjective defining of health sometimes implies a necessary departure from empirical stan- dardization. \"The kind of health that men desire most is not necessarily a state in which they experience physical vigor and a sense of well-being, not even one giving them a long life. It is, instead, the condition best suited to reach goals that each individual formulates for himself (1959:278). I intend to deepen this point in a moment; for now, however, it is enough to witness that Dubos believed that the dependence of the labeling of phenomena as health upon personal and social goals points to the impossibility of confining the defi- nitional dimension to the empirically observable. The only things which Dubos conceptualized as capable of standardization are health producing resources. In fact, for Dubos, health was merely \"the expression of the extent to which the individual and the social body maintain in readiness the resources required to meet the exigencies of the future\" (1962:102-3). For Dubos, the units of analysis were the individual's \"internal-\" and the \"exter- nal environment\" (1959:110-24), and the interaction between these was the core theme of concern to his theory of health etiology. \"In man the provocative cause of microbial disease may be a disturbance in any of the factors of his external or internal environment \u2014 be it weather conditions, availability of food, working habits, economic status, or emotional stress\" (1959:93). If we under- stand what Dubos calls a \"disturbance\" (in the above quote) and a \"factor that upsets\" (in the next quote) within the helpful nomenclature of Antonovsky, we can see both terms as GRR/RDS, or generalized-resistance resources/resistance deficits. Dubos' internal environment represents primarily biochemical (emo- tional stress) resources/deficits, and his external environment encompasses environmental (weather conditions, availability of food, economic status) resources/deficits. In analyzing the interaction between the internal and external environments, Dubos asserts that, \"Any factor that upsets the equilibrium of either one of these two ecological systems \u2014 the internal and external environ- 32ments - can become a determinant of disease\" (1959:1 1 1). Like Antonovsky, therefore, Dubos pictured the relative presence or absence of biochemical or environmental resources to be the nexus at which health is won or lost for the individual and social group. However, also like Antonovsky, Dubos believed that this nexus was subject to the overriding importance of ideological resources. He stated late in his life, \"The most important statement I could make or that anybody could make [is] that whatever happens to us depends on deliberate choices based on anticipa- tion of the future, based on what we want our future life to be\" (1990:142). Dubos often discussed ideology as a health related resource by pointing to the influence of both experienced past and anticipated future upon the extent to which internal resources are sufficient to meet the challenges imposed by the external environment. \"Thus, the internal environment is constantly responding to the external environment, and history [italics added] - racial, social, as well as individual - conditions the manner of response just as much as does the intrin- sic nature of the stimulus\" (1959:128). Further, \"The more human he is, the more intensely do his anticipations of the future [italics added] affect the character of his responses to the forces of the present\" (1965:7). It is quite natural, consid- ering Dubos' focus on ideological resources, that he was ultimately led to per- ceive health (which he equated with successful adaptation) to be a function of an individual or group's ability to learn. \"The view that adaptation is a creative endeavor which demands continuous effort clearly applies to the process of learning\" (1965:425). As 1 hinted at earlier and will now elaborate upon, the first sign of a significant difference between the two theorists involves the necessity of remaining con- fined to empirically observable phenomena within the definitional dimension. Unlike Antonovsky, who was committed to measurable phenomena-labeled-as- health, Dubos was willing to accept the notion that health may often not be standardizable, and thus also remain impossible to measure. Dubos asserted, \"The evaluation of health and disease varies from person to person because it is conditioned by highly individual requirements and subjective reactions. In con- sequence, the words health and disease cannot be defined universally or stati- cally\" (1965:349). Dubos acknowledged that this reasoning, as Antonovsky put it, \"makes the concept of health meaningless and impossible to study\" (Antonovsky, 1979:52). For Dubos, however, the ability to standardize health for science was less important than to understand and pursue the whole mean- ing of that value to individuals and social groups. \"The scientific definition [of health] is not really meaningful for the many persons who are more concerned with doing what they want to do and becoming what they want to become than they are with the condition of their bodies. For them, disease is any condition 33that deprives them of the freedom to act as they want: health is the possession of this free- dom, even if that means the presence of disease. (1965:463-4)\" This difference between the two theorists in the definitional dimension leads to a much deeper divergence within the etiological dimension, however. Dubos' acceptance of phenomena-labeled-as-health which are not capable of standard- ization meant per se that he would be unable to merely discuss questions of the validity of determinants of those phenomena. In other words, that acceptance precluded remaining within the epistemological confines of the referential con- text of objectivity within the etiological dimension. In discussing both abstrac- tion and diversity in phenomena-labeled-as-health, therefore, Dubos was led to consider normative and aesthetic considerations regarding exposure to or pro- fessional conditioning of causal factors. The intersubjective - and specifically normative - consideration of determinants of phenomena-labeled-as-health was expressed by Dubos using a language of how the \"social\" relates to the \"scientific.\" He asserted the subordination of sci- ence to social decisionmaking. \"Medical science can provide some approximate solution for almost all problems of disease. However, it is up to society to decide on the threats to be avoided....In the final analysis it is the collective social mind that formulates the ethics...of medical science and practice\" (1958:20). Further, Dubos pointed often to the danger that scientific knowl- edge posed to the pursuit of health goals which are incapable of standardiza- tion. \"Scientific civilization threatens to ruin or even to destroy life and creates much unhappiness whenever it ignores or fails to respect the ethical and emo- tional values that men prize above life itself (1959:25). According to Dubos, this danger has its origins in the strict epistemological standards of science. \"Many [medical] scientists...fear that the uniqueness of each individual person makes the kind of generalizations on which science thrives all but impossible, and for this reason they deal by preference with questions pertaining to lifeless fragments of the body machine\" (1965:333). Focus on various aspects of health etiology therefore should be - and to a large extent is \u2014 determined by social attention dedicated to those aspects. \"The change in emphasis from microbio- logic to chemical, physiologic, genetic, and then to behavioral sciences has a logic which is not inherent in science itself, but is derived from social con- cerns\" (1970:139). The subjective - and specifically aesthetic - consideration of determinants of phenomena-labeled-as-health refers to the role of individual taste in evaluating causal factors or their professional conditioning. Though this process may ulti- mately become expressed at the social level, it is different from normative con- sideration in that its epistemological product is preference rather than morally- binding consensus. When, for example, Dubos asserts that \"Health...demandsthat the personality be able to express itself creatively\" (1965:xviii), he is claim- ing that a precondition of phenomena-labeled-as-health is creative personal expression. Yet no individual can decide for another what the nature of that creative expression should be. Dubos further states, \"A Wall Street executive, a lumberjack in the Canadian Rockies, a newspaper boy at a crowded street corner, a steeple chase jockey, a cloistered monk rising during the night to pray and chant, and the pilot of a supersonic combat plane have very different physi- cal and mental needs. The various imperfections and limitations of the flesh and mind do not have equal importance for them [italics added]\" (1965:349). Again, as a result of the inability to standardize the labeling-as-health of phenomena from one person to another, the determinants of those phenomena are also thematized as a matter of taste and preference. Habermas regularly describes the subjective world as \"the world to which the individual has privileged access\" (Habermas, 1984). Dubos comes quite close in saying, \"Mental health requires...the freedom to achieve some form of independence in a world of one's own\" (1969b:78). Ultimately, this leads Dubos to assert the subordination of the referential con- text of objectivity to that of subjectivity within the etiological dimension by discussing risk taking. \"Skeptics have good reasons to claim, of course, that knowledge of consequences does not necessarily modify human behavior...publication of the dangers associated with cigarette smoking or high-speed automobile driving has not significantly modified the behavior of intel- ligent and well-informed people. Such disregard of evidence simply means that most persons are willing to take calculated risks - as everyone constantly does in daily life (1970:243).\" Dubos was led by his acceptance of unobservable phenomena-labeled-as-health to decry a monopolistic role for science and thus the referential context of objectivity within the etiological dimension. Dubos asserted that science, as a way of identifying means to health, must be tempered by or even subordinated to normative and aesthetic consideration of the means to achieving health which science proposes. In doing so, Dubos staked an important and powerful claim for the referential contexts of intersubjectivity and subjectivity within the etiological dimension. He therefore allows us to conceptualize the intersubjec- tive and subjective regions of the etiological dimension. The second and third rows of Table 1.2 correspond to the referential contexts of intersubjectivity and subjectivity. As we have seen, Dubos pointed to resources in the biochemical, environmental, and ideological resource realms. Therefore both the intersubjec- tive and subjective referential contexts can be said to apply across the three health etiological resource category columns. Dubos' consideration of resources in all three realms means that his theory of etiology is theoretically applicable across a corresponding range of professional health disciplines. 35/V SALUTOLOGy: P/CTUR/NG DEIER/U/NANTS OF HEALTH AS VAUD/Ty CLAi/VIS The first and second sections of this paper document and describe the limita- tions of the positivist tradition within health professionalism and the challenge of incorporating intersubjectivity and subjectivity in health theory. In the third section, the work of Antonovsky and Dubos was used to develop a multidisci- plinary model of health etiology which accommodates objectivity, and subjectivity in and Dubos' unique commitment to these referential contexts within the etiological dimension. Intersubjectivity and subjectivity, as we saw in the second section, encompass referential contexts whose epistemological base is defined on the basis of social consensus or individual conviction. This implies that health pro- fessionals can no longer be satisfied with a model of health and health etiology which only incorporates conceptualizations of health based on professional values and etiological insights based on positivist research. The development of a model of health and health etiology which ascribes a legitimate role to both lay persons and health professionals means that we are in need of a theory of communication. By mentioning J\u00fcrgen Habermas' (1984, 1987) Theory of Communicative Action in the second section, I intended to foreshadow why and how this theory of communication is particu- larly appropriate to the accommodation of subjectivity within health profession- alism. Habermas' theory explicitly considers the distinct but inseparable nature of communication at the levels of the cognitive/objective, normative/intersub- jective, and evaluative/subjective. Furthermore, Habermas' theory is concerned with the development of consensus for uction through reasoned, egalitarian dia- logue among communicating parties. In the discussion which follows, I do not hope to explicate all the ways in which Habermas' ideas are relevant for communication in health professional- ism. Important work has already been done on integrating Habermas' ideas within nursing (Reeder, 1993; promotion (Kelly, 1996; Milewa and De Leeuw, 1996), and occupational medicine (Dejours, 1995). However, these works have all focused on specific, intradisciplinary issues of lay-professional communication. To date, Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action has not been discussed for its crossdisciplinary, or overarching, relevance to health professionalism. My intention in the ensuing discussion is to take the latter course, since the goal of this paper is to facilitate the accommodation of intersubjectivity and subjectivity within health professionalism as a whole. To that end, only aspects of Habermas' theory which are of particular relevance to this broader goal will be discussed here. 36Habermas asserts that communicating actors reach consensus for action through the positing what he calls \"criticizable validity claims\" within the referential contexts of objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity. Each act of communi- cation includes a set of at least three validity claims, one within each referential context. According to Habermas, a speaker always implicitly asserts that what he or she says is true, morally acceptable, and sincere. The acceptance of the valid- ity of a speaker's claims at these three levels by the hearer is what creates the binding force, or motivation, in the hearer to cooperate with the speaker. As Habermas points out, the making of a contention by a speaker implies exposing the three implicit validity claims to the open-handed criticism of all other par- ties involved in the communication. Habermas' model thus presupposes reciprocal and non-manipulative communication based upon the simultaneous exchange of knowledge from the referential contexts of objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity. It therefore allows us to theorize scientific, social, and personal knowledge, and to do so in a way which legitimizes the participation of all communicators in discussing contentions at all three levels. Habermas also makes quite clear that he is not only interested in a theory of communication which allows actors to achieve understanding. He is interested in a theory which describes communication oriented toward the achievement of consensus for coordinated action. Consensus, for Habermas, is achieved through the open exchange and criticism of validity claims which both allows and requires actors to ground their beliefs in logically defendable contentions. Coordinated action can only take place when actors have come to consensus through rea- soned dialogue. The theory, therefore, is appropriate to communication between professionals and public in regards to action for health. However, it presumes the participation of both professionals and public in expressing claims which allow the consensus necessary for action. Equally important, it presup- poses the end result to be coordinated action, and therefore assumes the involve- ment of both public and professionals at the level of goal formulation (i.e. defi- nitional dimension) and goal-oriented action (i.e. etiological dimension) as well. Following Habermas' notion of communicative action, we can conceptualize communication between health professionals and lay persons/populations as a reciprocal process involving the positing and criticizing of validity claims about the etiological factors of phenomena-labeled-as-health. Health professionals and lay persons, then, by communicating about the etiology of phenomena-labeled- as-health displayed by the nine cells of Table 1.2, establish a rational grounds for action in the interest of health. Though Habermas emphasized that all com- munication contains validity claims at the objective, intersubjective, and subjec- tive referential contexts, I wish here to follow his example by separating these contexts for the purposes of discussion. The challenge before us is to show how communicative action works within each of the three referential contexts. 37Health etiology within the referential context of objectivity There is little point in distinguishing between \"factors\" and \"professional actions\" for our purposes. This is because both factors and professional actions can be said to have a beneficial or detrimental effect on phenomena-labeled-as- health\u00ab'. Etiological factors are, in fact, all factors or professional actions which benefit or threaten empirically-operationalizable phenomena-labeled-as-health (EO-PLAH) and/or non-empirically-operationalizable phenomena-labeled-as- health (NEO-PLAH?). Table 1.3 combines these insights by showing the four types of etiologicaJ factors produced by this logic. Communication within the referential context of objectivity relates to the dis- cussion of the validity of relationships between a health etiological factor or professional action and phenomena-labeled-as-health. As the analysis of Antonovsky revealed, establishment of such relationships presupposes that EO- PLAH are related to measurable factors or professional actions. This strict episte- mological standard of the referential context of objectivity means that \"objec- tive\" etiological relationships are often valid cross-culturally and interpersonally. In the referential context of objectivity, scientists across a broad spectrum of health professional disciplines confirm the validity of determinants, risks, the effectiveness of professional actions, etc. Lay persons are most often considered unqualified to participate in this process of etiological identification. Health professionals generally seek to protect the perception that objectivity is the only appropriate referential context for health etiology. Partially, this represents a desire to protect populations from empirically invalid ideas about factors linked to EO-PLAH. It may also be true that the hegemonic nature of \"objective\" etiol- ogy in health results from the desire of professionals to protect their status and value as experts. As I asserted earlier, there exists a positivist tradition within every professional health discipline**. Communication within the referential context of objectivity therefore extends to all fields which address biochemical, ideological, and envi- ronmental health resources. As Table 1.2 shows, medicine, a discipline focused on the biochemical requisites for health, might affirm the effectiveness of an 6 latrogenesis is the label which has traditionally been employed to describe professional actions which hindered, rather than facilitated, the achievement of phenomena-labeled-as-health. 7 Because we are now focused on communicative mechanics rather than the deconstruction of the health concept. I take the liberty of abbreviating these expressions to facilitate the flow of the discussion. 8 As also pointed out earlier, though the fight has often been interpreted as one between biomedical and non- biomedical' professions, the conflict is better seen as existing within rather than between health disciplines. 38Table 1.3 Type of Etiological Resources by Type of Phenomena-Labeled-as-Health Types of Ecological Resource Beneficial e.g. 'Saluiogenic* e.g. \"GMs' Detrimental e.g.'Pathogenic' e.g.'GRDs'Type action which enhances EO-PWH Factor/professional action which threatens EO-PIAHlinked via social consensus or individual conviction to Non- Empirically-Operationalizable Phenomena-Labelled-As-Health (NEO-PUH) Factor/professional action which enhances which threatens NEO-PIAH antibiotic in killing streptococci bacteria. Health education, primarily concerned with providing ideological resources, might publicize an empirical connection between self-efficacy and success at smoking cessation. Policy-based health pro- motion, concerned with macrosociostructural health resources, might assert the impact of air pollution on asthma. Thus biochemical, ideological, and environ- mental resources (both factors and professional actions) can be discussed on the basis of scientific or \"objective\" validity in terms of the strength of their predic- tive relationship to EO-PLAH. Oftentimes, in practice, it is the goal of health professionals to convince the public of the validity of the relationship between health etiological resources and professionally-sanctioned phenomena-labeled- as-health (i.e. \"raise awareness\"). Then an attempt is often made to influence the public to adopt behaviors which condition those etiological resources so as to bring out (or raise the probability of) the desired phenomena. However, though it is not often acknowledged as such, lay communication is also impor- tant within the referential context of objectivity. By listening to lay sources, professionals can establish strengths and gaps in lay knowledge of objective health etiology; this process may generate insights which are operationalizable for scientific study. As Antonovsky noted, most GRR/RDs are familiar to the individuals confronted with them, though they may not be so to the health professional. This is one of the central concepts which underlies the principle of conducting needs assessments with the help of local populations and employing collaborative goal setting in community health programming. 39Health etiology within the referential context of intersubjectivity Communication within the referential context of intersubjectivity relates to the discussion of the moral Tightness of exposure to a health etiological factor or professional action. The specific topics of discussion within this referential con- text between professionals and lay persons relate to one of two central themes. First, assuming that a factor has been shown empirically to be etiologically valid with respect to an EO-PLAH, what are the moral implications of exposure to that factor or to a professional action which attempts to condition it? Second, assuming that social consensus has established that a factor has an etiological connection to a NEO-PLAH, what are the moral implications of exposure to that factor or to a professional action which attempts to condition it? Because it con- cerns moral consensus, communication within the referential context of inter- subjectivity will tend to vary from culture to culture and age to age. Within the referential context of intersubjectivity scientists and scientific knowl- edge carry no more weight than lay persons and lay knowledge. Because the focal point is morality and normative consensus, the values of all participants must be equally regarded. Ethicists, of course, may play a role in giving struc- ture and informing public debate. However, establishment of the moral accept- ability or unacceptability of exposure to a given etiological factor or profes- sional action is a consensual, egalitarian, and democratic process. Communication between health professionals and the public within the referen- tial context of intersubjectivity also applies to the consideration of biochemical, ideological, and environmental resources'*. As Table 1.2 shows, intersubjective communication within the medical realm would include the moral considera- tion of access to abortion and other reproductive health care services, euthana- sia, and \u2014 eventually - gene therapies. In health education, intersubjective com- munication might focus on the ethicality of professional actions which use fear to influence group or individual behavior or on counseling on genetic risks (e.g. for likelihood of breast cancer). In policy-based health promotion, inter- subjective communication could consider the ethicality of unequal access to health care and socioeconomic health inequity. Though ethicists may be helpful in structuring public dialogue, consideration of all of these questions necessarily involves lay persons as much as health professionals. As Dubos pointed out, ethical evaluation of exposure to determinants of phenomena-labeled-as-health necessarily involves social participation and decisionmaking. 9 Not all intersubjective or subjective communication regarding health etiology will involve health professionals. When it does, however, the focus is likely to be on biochemical, ideological, or environmental resources.Health etiology within the referential context of subjectivity Communication within the referential context of subjectivity relates to the dis- cussion of the desirability of exposure to a health etiological factor or profes- sional action. Just as within the referential context of intersubjectivity, the spe- cific topics of discussion within the referential context of subjectivity between professionals and lay persons relate to one of two central themes. First, assum- ing that a factor has been shown empirically to be etiologically valid with respect to an EO-PLAH, what is the desirability of exposure to that factor or to a professional action which attempts to enhance it? Second, assuming that indi- vidual conviction has established that a factor has an etiological connection to a NEO-PLAH, what is the desirability of exposure to that factor or to a profes- sional action which attempts to enhance it? Because it concerns the level of per- sonal taste, communication with the referential context of subjectivity will tend to vary from individual to individual and even moment to moment. Within the referential context of intersubjectivity those being served by profes- sional actions have a privileged position. Each individual is the sole authority on his or her preferences, tastes, and aesthetic values. In communication, profes- sionals cannot offer opinions on people's preferences, for these are beyond rebuke. Professionals can, however, analyze the authenticity or consistency in the way preferences are expressed. Professionals therefore do have a role at the subjective level, albeit a subordinate and supplementary one. Communication with the referential context of subjectivity can also be carried out in relation to biochemical, ideological, and environmental resources. As Table 1.2 shows, in medicine, subjective communication might relate to whether or not a patient elects to die in the hospital or at home, get plastic surgery, or consume a pharmaceutical with strong negative side effects. At the level of health education, subjective communication may relate to a person or group's estimation of the impact upon NEO-PLAH of the anxiety induced by an awareness of behavioral or genetic risks. With policy-based health promotion, a community may decide that the most desirable means to health are a new park and better housing, or that litter cleanup and noise control are the first priori- ties. Though professionals may question the motives behind these preferences, consideration of these questions is almost exclusively the terrain of lay persons. Dubos, in speaking of the individual relevance of etiological resources, also opened the way to preferentiul evaluation in choosing between alternative means to the achievement of NEO-PLAH and EO-PLAH. 41A seamless salutology If we lived in a world in which there were certain answers to the questions, \"what is health?\" and \"what determines health?\" there would be little need for communication between health professionals and those they serve. However, as we have seen, neither question can ever be answered clearly or definitively, and cannot be answered even vaguely or temporarily without the participation of lay persons in an evolving dialogue with health professionals. This implies that health professionals are engaged with lay persons in an ongoing study of which phenomena should be labeled \"health,\" and the scientific, moral, and aesthetic considerations surrounding the etiology of those phenomena. Charlton (1996) has used the word \"salutology\" at least once previously. However, Charlton's \"salutology\" remains confined to the salutogenic production of exclusively those phenomena-labeled-as-health which are both standardizable (EO-PLAH) and which are deemed worthy of pursuit by health professionals. The fact that \"health\" means many things to people, however, implies that the term \"salutol- ogy\" rightfully belongs to the professional act of studying and pursuing health in and with individuals and populations. This means professional consideration of phe- nomena which are widely (intersubjectively) labeled-as-health, as well as those phenomena which are individually (subjectively) labeled-as-health. It also implies consideration of both types of phenomena regardless of their ability to be empirically observed, operationalized, and standardized. The pursuit of \"health,\" even when that label is limited to phenomena which are both empirically operationalizable and widely labeled-as-health, demands the simultaneous efforts of many distinct professional fields. Chemotherapy, the absence of asbestos particles in work environments, and the knowledge that both of these can be important for the avoidance of cancer, for instance, are all important etiological resources which lead to \"absence of tumors,\" a phenome- non widely labeled-as-health. The provision of these diverse resources, all of great value, is by necessity a complementary endeavor among disciplines. From this perspective, it is unfortunate when professional health disciplines insist that they are in \"competition\" with one another, or represent \"competing para- digms.\" Those phenomena-labeled-as-health which are not operationalizable, like equilibrium (Herzlich, 1973), may also be closely related to biochemical, environmental, and ideological resources. Such phenomena-labeled-as-health may thus also be dependent upon the simultaneous efforts of diverse profes- sional health disciplines. \"Salutology,\" then, is rightfully employed to encom- pass something far broader than mere salutogenic mechanics. \"Salutology\" should encompass all professional disciplines oriented toward the study and pursuit of all phenomena-labeled-as-health. 42CONCLUSION In this paper I have attempted to provide a model for the explicit theoretical accommodation of subjectivity in the defining of health and the evaluation of health etiology. The positivist tradition, which spans professional health disci- plines oriented towards the provision of all types of acknowledged requisite resources for health, has delegitimized and marginalized subjectivity in the past. The limitations resulting from this delegitimization have been documented and highlighted in the last quarter century by social scientists, theoreticians, and health practitioners. The work of Aaron Antonovsky and Rene Dubos provides a framework which allows the theorization of health etiology across disciplinary boundaries and within the referential contexts of objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity. Further, this framework applies to the etiology of phenomena which are labeled-as-health on both intersubjective and subjective grounds. The Theory of Communicative Action of J\u00fcrgen Habermas supplies the dynamics to the framework distilled from Antonovsky and Dubos necessary to conceive of how intersubjectivity and subjectivity can be accommodated in professional health practice. As such, the model set forth here, if employed, would integrate professional and epistemological diversity within health professionalism. It would thus comprise a \"seamless salutology.\" 4344CHAPTER 2 A NATURAL SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION FOR PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT Implications of A Far-From-Equilibrium Thermodynamic Understanding of Health and Health Etiology \"All our lives long, every day and every hour we are engaged in the process of accommodating our changed and unchanged selves to changed and unchanged surroundings; living, in fact, is nothing less than this process of accommodation...\" (Samuel Butler, The Way of All Flesh, 1904) INTRODUCTION More than fifty years ago, under the determined leadership of Andrija Stampar (Seipp, 1998), the World Health Organization ratified the Preamble to its Constitution which asserts that \"informed opinion and active cooperation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people\" (WHO, 1947). Since that time, the notion that people's participation is requisite to the attainment of health has received wide-accep- tance as demonstrated by its inclusion in the Alma Ata Declaration (WHO/UNICEF, 1978), Ottawa Charter (WHO, 1986) and Jakarta Declaration (WHO, 1997) for Health Promotion. 45Participation has most often been advocated on the grounds that it is requisite to both practical and ethical aspects of professional initiatives to enhance health. Practically, it has been argued, participation is necessary to secure both the suc- cess and sustainability of professional interventions within local communities (Green, Kreuter and Marshall, 1991), at larger populational levels (Labonte and Edwards, 1995), and in clinical contexts (Bergsma and Commers, 1997; Guadognoli and Ward, 1998). Ethically, participation has been identified as a means of minimizing paternalism associated with professional health promoting activities. Arnstein (1969) provided an influential clarification of this point by asserting that participation minimizes paternalism to the extent that it is based on citizen control rather than citizen manipulation. Loewy (1989) has refined the point even more by arguing that the taking or receiving of such control is not only about increased individual and community autonomy, but implies cor- respondingly greater levels of responsibility at both levels as well. However, though the practical and ethical foundations of participation are rela- tively well developed, far less attention has been given to the natural scientific foundation for the claim that participation can make an important contribution to health. In this paper, therefore, I attempt to weave insights from thennody- namic theory and disparate aspects of research on salutogenesis to provide a plausible natural scientific foundation for the contention that participation is a critical tool for health promotion. Further, I argue that helping people to have an \"informed opinion\" on health etiology implies a mandate for research into lay understandings of salutogenic health etiology and for communication between professionals and non-profes- sionals on that basis. Helping people to \"actively cooperate,\" in turn, suggests the relevance of empowerment for health. If participation is to be effective, people must not simply be aware of the factors which determine health. They must have sufficient jurisdiction over those determining factors as well as the ability to influence how those factors are conditioned by professionals. ; A THERMODYNAAI/C UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH AND SALUTOGENES/S In this section, I begin with a discussion of how life is understood within the theoretical framework of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics and complexity theory. This discussion is used to distill a \"complexity model\" of health etiology which emphasizes the health etiological significance of two processes: energy dissipation within the human body as well as the body's exchange of energy with its environment. I then show how the complexity model reveals omissionsin Antonovsky's (1979, 1987) empirical - if not theoretical - conceptualization of salutogenesis. Defining a fundamental model of health etiology Thermodynamics is a branch of physics which deals with energy and its trans- formation. Energy and the exchange of energy comprise the basis of life. From the perspective of understanding living systems, the most critical insights from thermodynamics are embodied by the field's first and second laws, both of which arose out of the intensive study of combustion processes which took place in the 19'h Century. In describing these laws, I paraphrase the more technical description of Toissant and Schneider (1998). The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed and that the total energy within a closed system will always remain constant. However, though the total quantity of energy within such a system may remain the same, the quality of that energy can change. The second law of thermodynamics relates to such changes in quality. If energy is transformed within a system, the second law says that the quality of the total energy involved will be lower after that transforma- tion than before it began. The process by which energy is transformed from a higher to lower state of quality (or \"orderliness\") is known as entropy. The end of the 20''' Century brought a new understanding of entropy and its implications. Specifically, scientists in many disparate fields became concerned with the phenomena which occur in systems which have open exchange of energy with their environments (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Gleick, 1987; Waldrop, 1992). These systems, due to constant influxes of energy from \u2014 and losses of energy to \u2014 their surroundings are constantly challenged in their abil- ity to maintain internal order, have been called \"unstable\" or \"far-from-equilib- rium.\" Applied to the universe as a whole, the second law of thermodynamics postulates that though the total quantity of existing energy may remain con- stant, its orderliness steadily and inexorably decreases with time. Yet the inter- esting thing about \"far-from-equilibrium\" systems is that they sometimes manage to maintain and even increase their internal order by building upon, rather than capitulating to, the constant challenges from their environments. Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogine (1980; Prigogine and Stengers, 1984, 1997) has dedicated much of his career to the study of far-from-equilibrium systems which display negentropic transformation, or self-organization. He has employed the label \"dissipative structures\" to describe far-from-equilibrium sys- tems which are successful at maintaining and enhancing their internal order at the expense of their environment. The work of Prigogine and other early pioneers in far-from-equilibrium ther- modynamics and self-organization provided a foundation for the rise of so- 47called \"complexity theory.\" Since the mid-1980s, complexity theory has been dedicated to understanding theoretically how dissipative structures might origi- nate and persist (Waldrop, 1992). In the complexity tradition, a dissipative structure is modeled as an \"emergent system\" defined by a set of internal rela- tionships among constituent elements (i.e. a network). When the elements of such a system or the relationships among them are perturbed by outside energy, the system may be unaffected, altered, or even transformed. Bale and Chen (1991) demonstrated this in a fascinating experiment using a sandpile. One grain of sand was dropped every fifteen seconds onto a round mass scale, and the total mass of the pile was measured after each grain was dropped. Predictably, in the beginning many of the sand grains remained on the scale after being dropped and a pile formed. As the pile grew, however, so too did its slope become steeper and the resulting sensitivity of the pile as a whole to each grain dropped. When the pile reached a \"critical state\" (i.e. a steep enough slope), the influence of each grain of sand became highly unpredictable, caus- ing avalanches (i.e. great mass loss) in some cases and little or no change in the pile's mass in other cases. The point that Bak and Chen's experiment makes so eloquently is that, depending on the history of a system, dramatically different outcomes can be the result of an identical perturbation. This being the case, however, Kauffman (1991) has described how outcomes within a system are also a function of the types of perturbations to which a system is subjected. He has distinguished between two types of perturbations. The first type is called a minimal perturbation, which simply implies a sudden change in the status quo of a system. This would the equivalent, for instance, of dropping a large stone onto the sandpile. The sandpile would probably dis- play a large avalanche as a result of the impact of the stone; assuming the stone fell off the mass scale, however, the pile would eventually return to its critical state and display the same behavior as before the minimal perturbation occurred. The second type is called a structural perturbation, which corresponds to a fundamental change in the relationships within a system (and thus of the system itself). One might induce a structural perturbation into the sandpile by vibrating the mass scale continuously or, alternatively, pouring glue onto the pile. Either of these actions would fundamentally alter the way the pile would be influenced by the falling grains. Perturbations, then, are the flip side of the systemic coin. Whether temporarily or permanently, they have the capacity to influence the internal workings of a system. As Bak, Chen, Kauffman and their colleagues would agree, it is the intimate interplay between the initial conditions of a system and the nature of the pertur- bations to which the system is exposed which gives rise to processes of self- organization. Further, self-organization has come to be understood as the innate requisite force which underlies adaptation and evolution of systems. The ques- tion, then, is which initial conditions and what types of perturbations generally 48optimize the adaptive and evolutionary potential of a system. It has been sug- gested that systems may be most successful at adaptation when their initial con- ditions are \"liquid\" (i.e. quasi-stable). This means that a system must be far enough from equilibrium (i.e. vulnerable enough) to experience some change as a result of outside perturbations, but simultaneously have enough structure such that the system is not destroyed by those perturbations (see discussion of C. Langton in Waldrop, 1992). Correspondingly, outside perturbations need to be sufficient to challenge (perhaps significantly) but not to overwhelm the fun- damental system structure. In short, in order to adapt most successfully, any system (and hence any dissipative structure) must find a balance between inter- nal organization and instability as well as sources of appropriate energy exchange with the environment. All dissipative structures are at least partially successful at achieving the two processes, and are therefore capable of maintaining and enhancing internal order at the expense of their environment. Nevertheless, even in this situation, the second law of thermodynamics requires that the quality of the total energy involved (i.e. the sum of the quality of the energy within and outside of the dissipative structure) must be degraded in the process. Building on earlier work, Toissant and Schneider (1998) show that the entropy relationships of dissipative structures can be described by the equation dS=dSi+dSe, where dS stands for the total entropy change in a dissipative structure, dSi stands for the entropy produced within the dissipative structure, and dSe stands for the entropy exchange between the dissipative structure and its environment. In order for the dissipative structure to maintain itself, dS must be less than or equal to zero (i.e. internal order must be maintained or enhanced). As we have seen, how- ever, the second law requires that since energy is transformed, entropy must increase. This means that dSi must be positive. Therefore, the equation shows elegantly that in order for a dissipative structure to maintain or enhance its own internal order, the total entropy produced within the dissipative structure must be less than that exported by the dissipative structure in its exchange with the environment (i.e. dSe must be negative and dSi< I dSe I). Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (1944) asserted many years ago that life itself can be seen as a thermodynamic structure whose organization is maintained at the expense of its environment. Since then, this contention has become widely accepted among biophysicists, and the pathways by which energy at the molecular level stimu- lates cell organization (Waliszewski, Molski, sion of the genotype (Kauffman, 1991) have become more clear. This implies, of course, that living systems are subject to the thermodynamic constraints described above, since these apply to all dissipative structures. We can thus reinterpret the points made in the previous paragraphs about the factors which promote the maintenance of dissipative structures (or emergent systems) as fac- tors which are by definition relevant to living systems as well. In order for a living system to maintain itself: 491 the balance of internal organization and instability (i.e. system vulnerability) must result in an efficient processing of energy input so as to maximize the usefulness of a given level of entropy production within that living system (i.e. maximize the usefulness of dSi). 2 sources of high-quality energy input and repositories for low-quality energy output in the environment must be sufficient to guarantee that the total entropy exchange between a living system and its environment (dSe) comes at the expense of the environment rather than the living system itself. When applied to living systems and especially to human beings, the word \"health\" has many connotations. In public policy, research, and clinical con- texts, however, health is most often operationalized as longevity and the absence of measurable disease. We have seen that the ability of a living system to maintain itself, and thus to attain longevity, is dependent on the efficiency with which it produces entropy internally and its exchange of energy with its environment. Azzone (1996) has further argued that most diseased states can be seen as corresponding to an inhibition of an organism's ability to produce entropy in a way which promotes that organism's capacity for survival. Thus we can assert that the ability of a living system to maintain itself through the dissipation of energy drawn from its environment is a proxy for health. This is in fact to say that far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics and the com- plexity theory which arose out of that tradition provide a fundamental model of health etiology. As points 1 and 2 above instruct, albeit at a general level, any factor which impacts the extent or manner of energy dissipation within a living system, or the exchange of energy between that living system and its environ- ment, will also constitute a determinant of health status. Because these two main precepts represent a specific application of insights from far-from-equilib- rium thermodynamics and complexity theory, I will henceforth refer to them as comprising a \"complexity model\" of health etiology. Thermodynamics and salutogenesis Antonovsky was well aware of both the understanding of life in the thermody- namic tradition and the ideas from complexity theory which had been used to clarify it. It is not surprising, therefore, that his proposal of the salutogenic model upon the grounds that \"Given that the human condition is stressful, the question is how any of us manage to stay healthy\" (Antonovsky, 1990) is consistent with those ideas. Antonovsky defined a stressor as \"a demand made by the internal or external environment of an organism that upsets its homeostasis\" (1979: 72) and premised his ideas upon the belief that Stressors are ubiquitous in human exis- tence. His theory of salutogenesis asserted that health was the product of the suc- cessful overcoming of Stressors by the human being due to flexible and appropri- 50ate employment of what he termed generalized resistance resources (GRRs). In conceptualizing both Stressors and GRRs, Antonovsky (1979:120) explicitly built upon a thermodynamic understanding of health etiology. \"In these terms, is it not appropriate to see Stressors, originating in either the internal or external environment, as entropic, increasing the level of disorder of the system? And to see GRRs...as negatively entropic, decreasing the level of disorder of the system?\" As this quote makes dear, Antonovsky was very much aware of the importance of energy exchange between human being (i.e. system) and environment (i.e. Stressors originating in the external environment). However, even at the outset, the complexity model of health etiology provided in the previous sub-section reveals an important omission in Antonovsky's understanding of the environment. As we have seen, the external environment acts as a repository for exported entropy, but it simultaneously is a source of useful energy. Antonovsky, by assuming the primarily stressful nature of human beings' direct interface' with their external environments, ironically neglected the salu- togenic possibilities ofthat interface. Zeyer (1997:382) has previously stated, \"Interestingly, Antonovsky himself portrays the environment as threatening....[however,] an organism is not healthy despite its environment, rather due [italics added] to its intensive, non-equilibrious exchange of energy and matter with its environment [my translation].\" Antonovsky remedied this gap somewhat by reconceptualizing in his second book resources and Stressors as part of a single continuum (i.e. GRR/RDS). However, in the early days of salutogenic theory, there was a strong need to maintain the clarity of the con- trast between the salutogenic and pathogenic approaches. It is perhaps for this reason that Antonovsky rarely stepped away from the fundamental premise that salutogenesis is concerned with how people survive despite Stressors. Though he did make sporadic references to the issue, he never focused sufficiently on the other side of the coin he himself minted: namely, how can people's direct interface with the environment be salutogenic (even before the meaning of that interface is mediated psychologically)? Of course, Antonovsky gave even more credence to the influence of the internal context of the individual human being upon health than he did to the environ- ment. Picking up on the point made above, Antonovsky was concerned more I By \"direct interface\" I mean to imply the energy exchange between person and environment before it is psychically mediated (e.g. before it is mediated by a strong or weak SOC). 51than anything with how people mediate the impact of their surroundings (i.e. Stressors) psychologically. In fact, this is the main philosophical tenet of his well-known construct, the \"sense of coherence\" or \"SOC,\" defined as \"a global orientation of the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that one's internal and external environments are predictable and that things will work out as well as can reasonably be expected\" (Antonovsky, 1979:123). Antonovsky reasoned (and subsequently showed as we shall see in the second section of this paper) that the SOC, an ingrained ori- entation, correlated with a person's ability to mitigate the negative impact of Stressors. A strong SOC, he hypothesized, allows die flexible and therefore most appropriate mobilization of resources to resolve the tension imposed by Stres- sors. As such, the SOC represents a psychological characteristic which indicates a given level of efficiency in processing incoming energy. However, here the slightly broader complexity model again reveals an omission in Antonovsky's work. The complexity model would assert the importance of any factor which has an impact on the efficiency with which incoming energy is processed. Yet Antonovsky focused almost exclusively on predisposing psychologi- cal characteristics that affect a person's mediation of stress. At least explicitly, he concerned himself very little with the potential impact of physiological characteris- tics which influence the body's ability to mediate the impact of Stressors. I extend this point empirically in the following section. The complexity model of health etiology does reveal some omissions in Antonovsky's theoretical and empirical work. However, the complexity model I have described merely compliments - and never contradicts - Antonovsky's original salutogenic model. Also, it is clear that Antonovsky's intention in concep- tualizing salutogenesis was sufficiently broad to encompass the complexity model in its entirety. Antonovsky (1998:5) asserted, \"[Salutogenesis] directs us to study the mystery of health in the face of a microbiological and psychosocial entropic reality....Put at a higher level of sophistication. I posited that open systems, no less than closed systems, were characterized by immanent forces of entropy...except (hot the former were open to negentropic forces as well [italics added]. \" The first fragment of this quote affirms the omissions in Antonovsky's concep- tualization of the external environment (i.e. as merely entropic). The latter, ital- icized fragment, however, clearly demonstrates Antonovsky's broad intentions with posing the question of salutogenesis, though he may never have fully operationalized these intentions in his empirical work. Therefore, it would be disingenuous to claim that the complexity model represents more than an important adjunct to Antonovsky's core salutogenic model. For this reason, I 52will continue to employ Antonovsky's tenn \"salutogenesis\" to describe the process by which health is created. However, in order to clearly acknowledge the expanded etiological terrain implied by the \"complexity model,\" I will use this latter tenn when referring to the sum of factors which influence (positively or negatively) salutogenesis (i.e. when I refer to detenninants of health). // L/NK/NG THE COMPLEX/TY MODEL, SALU70GEN/C RESEARCH, AND PART/C/PAT/ON In the previous section, I used thermodynamic insights into the nature of dissi- pative structures, and thus of life, to define a very broad \"complexity model\" of health etiology. Further, I built on the work of Aaron Antonovsky to show that his salutogenic model, despite its limitations as originally researched, was con- ceived in a manner sufficiently broad that it can accommodate the complemen- tary insights of the complexity model. In this section, I argue that salutogenic research demonstrates the link between the complexity model of health etiology and the need for participation. The complexity model implies that many - if not most \u2014 of the factors relevant to health status are factors to which people have partial or exclusive access in daily life. I build upon evidence from three different traditions of research on susceptibility (i.e. salutogenic research) to support this contention. The three traditions, respectively, include research on physiological susceptibility, psychological mediation, and environmental influ- ence. An interesting by-product of the discussion is that it reveals how the complexity model integrates these disparate research traditions on a meta-theo- retical level. Salutogenic research: a frontier My discussion of the thermodynamic basis of health led to the conclusion that health is theoretically the product of two things: first, the relative effectiveness with which a person dissipates free energy and thus generates entropy (i.e. the efficiency with which a person puts incoming energy to constructive use); and second, the nature and extent of energy exchange between person and environ- ment (i.e. the amount of high-quality energy available within - and opportu- nity to export entropy to - the environment) *. 2 (Please see page 54 for footnote 2.) 53Research on salutogenic processes has been conducted at both levels. At die first level, which I will call the energy processing level, salutogenic research has demon- strated the significance of both a) physiological and b) psychological predispo- sition in terms of the way energy is processed once it reaches the individual. At the second level, which I will call the energy exchange level, salutogenic research has demonstrated the significance of both a) the supply of and b) demand for high quality energy in the environment and opportunities to export entropy. Here, I focus only on research in these areas which relates to determinants of health at both levels which are partially or exclusively accessible to people themselves. In relation to this point, two disclaimers are warranted. First, because my discussion concerns participation, its relevance is largely confined to populations for whom some range of choice exists in the allocation of resources for health which exceed the basic staples of existence. More than one billion persons in the world live in a state of absolute poverty. For most of these persons most of the time, little choice exists in regards to which resources are available for the maintenance of health or how they are employed^. Second, with respect to each of the four themes discussed below, I begin with one example of research which is relatively well-developed. Subsequently, I explore what the complexity model would imply for other areas of health etiological research which are as yet, in most cases, far less developed. As such, the links between example and theory, and the extension of theory to the frontier of salutogenic health research, by necessity remains speculative. 2 One tension underlying all health sciences is the simultaneous faith in biological determinism and in the free will associated with behavioral choice.The health professional, when encouraging the adoption of healthy behaviors, employs traditional models of epidemiological causality which rely on the deterministic presumption that exposure to A will have the (negative or positive) effect B on health. Yet faith in the validity of traditional notions of determinism at the biological level is in face logically incompatible with the simultaneous belief that people are able to exercise free will in adopting or not adopting healthy behaviors. Additionally, the belief in free will is not only requisite to the rational defensibility of behavior change intervention. Virtually all meaning (Dubos. 1970) and morality (Berlin. 1969) in human existence depend upon the belief that human beings are endowed with the ability to make choices which are not predetermined.The self-organizing properties which are the foundation of the complexity model presume not only deterministic but nondeterministic (e.g. Markov chains, Poincare's resonances) chaos. As Prigogine (in Steels, 1994) has pointed out, the discovery of true nondeterministic randomness in systems at the edge of chaos holds the potential of bridging the age-old gap between determinism and free will. 3 Nonetheless, though I do not discuss the relevance of basic necessities to health, they demonstrate most clearly-indeed obviously-the validity of a thermodynamic understanding of health etiology. Not enough food, for instance, means not enough input of useful energy, questions of quality aside. 54I Energy processing: making entropy production more efficient a Physiological predisposition The physiological status of our bodies determines in part whether we are bene- fited or diminished by the energy we take in. As Dubos (1965:33) put it, \"Response patterns are so profoundly influenced by the prior conditioning of the body... that it is often more useful to study the phenomena of disease by regarding them as inadequate responses of the organism to a given situation than as direct effects of a noxious agent.\" Undoubtedly, genetic makeup plays an important role in the makeup of the body and the way it processes energy (Sorensen, Nielsen, Andersen and Teasdale, 1988). However, experiences, whether consciously or unconsciously perceived, also leave a footprint upon the body's physiology which conditions the way in which it processes input energy. To the extent that it is possible to restrict ourselves in such a way, I am here concerned with non-genetically induced physiological disposition, rather than psychological predisposition. Research has shown that physical activity is correlated with, among other bene- fits, better gastroenterological function and reduction of circulated \"stress\" hor- mones. Other benefits include reduced blood pressure and low-density choles- terol levels (see Omish, 1990, for a broad list of citations on the benefits of physical activity). All four of these empirically-documented benefits are indica- tions that physical activity enhances the body's ability to process the energy it takes in. This is true whether or not that input comes in the positive form of nutrition or the negative form of daily Stressors which induce the \"fight or flight\" hormonal response. The benefits of regular, moderate physical activity constitute the best empirically- documented example of the tradition of salutogenic research which has focused on physiological susceptibility. However, the complexity model of health etiol- ogy asserts that theoretically any factor which impacts the ability of the body to efficiently process energy will also impact health status. Though the links with energy processing are less clear, other examples of such factors have emerged. Avoidance of tobacco use prevents damage to coronary arteries (Omish, 1991) and thus promotes the heart's ability to minimize the damage of high cholesterol levels or frequent activation of the fight or flight stress response. Progressive relaxation techniques predispose the body to become less agitated when con- fronted with a stressor than it would without such training. Smoking cessation or abstinence may increase the body's physiological capacity to process endoge- nous or exogenous stress in ways which are minimally damaging to the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. Yet exercise, smoking cessation, sufficient nutritional intake, and meditation are either partially or wholly in the hands of the individual whose physiology is 55affected by them. There is no way in which a health professional can exercise, quit smoking, or meditate for another. Thus, in this case (as with the others I discuss in the remainder of this section), the complexity model asserts the rele- vance of health determining factors which are partially or exclusively amenable to conditioning by those whose health is in question. Acting to improve such factors requires that those who do so have both an awareness of the relevance of those factors for health and at least a modest level of control over them. In other words, the complexity model of health etiology leads us to a recognition of the need for an \"informed\", \"actively cooperating\", and \"empowered\" public, the essence of participation. b Psychological predisposition and its conditioning It is likely that our psychological predisposition has an even more profound impact upon our ability to efficiently process incoming energy than our physi- ology. Antonovsky, of course, dedicated the bulk of his empirical work in health to showing that the way we mediate the world mentally determines its effect upon our health. Antonovsky hypothesized that individuals with a high SOC see the world as more comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. Their perception of the world as such enables those individuals to make the most constructive use of incoming energy. Antonovsky's (Sagy 2000) research linking a higher SOC to better health status has tentatively estab- lished that mental mediation does correlate with health status. Also, consistent with other research on immune system and stress (Cohen, Tyrrell and Smith, 1991; Maier, Watkins and Fleshlier, 1994), some research supports the notion that the SOC is a mediating variable which positively correlates with immune function (Lutgendorf, Vitaliano, Tripp-Reimer, Harvey and Lubaroff, 1999). This provides some support for the conceptualization wrought by the complex- ity model, which would suggest that psychosocial characteristics, such as the SOC, HARDiness (Kobasa and Maddi, 1977), or self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986) are predictive of the extent to which input of energy from one's environment is mentally directed or processed in a manner which is health producing or degrading. Antonovsky (1991) asserted that the SOC, as well as similar constructs such as Kobasa's HARDiness or Bandura's self-efficacy, are largely dependent upon structural sources. He acknowledged, however, that people are capable of improving their SOC through psychotherapy, growth experiences, or other means. Antonovsky (1991) also pointed out that HARDiness and self-efficacy were also perceived by their creators as capable of being influenced through consciously-determined actions or experiences. Development of such qualities as the SOC, HARDiness, or self-efficacy, as well as steps such as participation in 56religious activities (Levin, 1996), may be ways of increasing the individual psy- chological capacity to make the most adaptive use of available energy. Yet, as with the physiological factors mentioned above, all of these factors can only be conditioned with the concerted effort of those whose health is in ques- tion. At the risk of sounding redundant, no health professional can undergo intensive psychotherapy, internalize the empowering force of overcoming a challenge independently, or participate in spiritually or socially meaningful exchange for another. As such, the growing evidence of the importance of these factors for health, as with factors concerning physiological predisposition, implies the necessity of participation for the preservation and optimization of health. 2 Energy exchange: making higher-quality energy available As the complexity model of health etiology developed in the first section showed, health is theoretically not only the product of how the body processes energy, but of the body's exchange of energy with its environment. Within most health sciences, and especially within health promotion, a tension exists between the ascription of etiological importance to behavioral and structural forces. A focus on the former leads one to the conclusion that individuals and social groups determine their own health through the ways they seek out energy exchange with their environments (e.g. food intake, physical activity, social contact). Interventions for health, then, focus on conditioning the demand among individuals or social groups for constructive energy exchange with the environment. A focus on the latter, structural forces, leads one to the conclusion that the health of individuals and social groups is largely determined by the availability of high-quality energy in the environment. Coming from this perspective, interventions for health must focus on conditioning the supply of high-quality energy in the environment such that the chances for constructive exchange between people and environment are maximized. Therefore, I discuss the second tenet of the complexity model (i.e. energy exchange of the organ- ism with its environment) below from both the demand and supply perspec- tives. a The demand for free energy and for opportunities for entropy export The ancient words \"Ask and ye shall receive\" may have particular relevance for health related behavior. Of course, as Antonovsky has argued so persuasively, each one of us is exposed throughout the life course to countless Stressors, many of which are not chosen nor even welcome. Nonetheless, individuals and social groups do have a substantial margin of control over the factors in their environments with which they interact. These factors represent both sources of incoming energy (whether high quality or not) and receptacles of outgoing 57energy (whether high quality or not). The complexity model asserts that the key for any organism is to maximize its input of high-quality energy as well as its output of low-quality energy. The need to \"maximize\" these quantities implies that the demand for exposure to those factors which produce these two favorable types of energy exchange with the environment is a critical factor in an organism's ability to maintain and promote its health. Nutritional science has delivered both timeless and trendy prescriptions for what we should eat in order to remain or become healthy. However, with the exception of the notion that too much dietary fat increases one's chances of car- diovascular disease because it increases the chances of arterial blockage forma- tion, nutritional science communicates little about why (i.e. the pathways by which) its prescriptions are appropriate for the body. Though nutritional sci- ence has focused on the average appropriate ratios of food components (i.e. fats to carbohydrates to proteins, etc.), for instance, there is little discussion of the reasons underlying the empirically documented fact that combinations of these components (or certain combinations of foods, for that matter) seem to render individuals less susceptible to disease. For instance, intake of sufficient fruits and vegetables is known to be associated with a lower incidence of many types of cancer. Thus, health education specialists have focused on encouraging people to eat sufficient quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables. However, in truth, the natural scientific pathways by which the empirically documented cor- relation between fruit and vegetable intake and lower incidence of cancer remain largely unclear. The connection, however, is in fact highly consistent with the central logic of a complexity model of health etiology. Zeyer (1997) has pointed out that foods closer to the original free energy of the sun, such as fruits and vegetables, contain more free energy (i.e. higher quality energy) than foods whose energy has already been degraded once by an intermediary organ- ism, such as meat or cheese. It is possible, therefore, that in nutrition education we see an example of professionals positively conditioning (i.e. reinforcing) people's demand for sources of higher quality energy in their environments. Yet facilitating the demand for high quality energy may be no more important than facilitating the demand for opportunities to export the energy we cannot use productively. A number of important studies, for instance, have shown the significance of social support for survival rates of terminally ill cancer patients (Levy, Lee, Bagley and Lippman, 1988; Spiegel, Bloom, Kraemer and Gottheil, 1989; Bergsma, 1994a, 1994b). Support, of course, not only constitutes the energy one receives in the form of love and compassion. A large part of social support is the chance to share one's story, to air one's grievances in an atmos- phere of caring, to \"get it off my chest.\" As such, it may constitute one example of entropy export. Other work has focused on the content of tears, and has shown that tears may carry toxic substances out of the body (Frey, DeSota- Johnson, Hoffman and McCall, 1981). Finally, many schools of preventive medi- 58cine focus on the importance of the effective purging of bowel waste (Airola, 1995). The research on the importance of tears and bowel waste is far less developed than that on social support. However, all three areas are consistent with the notion, clearly implied by the complexity model, that the export of low quality energy to the environment may be critical for the maintenance of health. From the standpoint of a complexity model of health etiology, many profes- sional health strategies can be seen as oriented toward enhancing the demand for high free-energy contacts with the environment. Helping people see the potential importance of eating lower on the food chain and then perform that action is one important example. Group, family, and individual therapy is an important way in which professionals facilitate people's realization of the kinds of social interaction which is health producing and how they can lower barriers to those types of interaction (i.e. energy input or export). By improving the demand for sources of high-quality energy or repositories of low-quality energy, health professionals therefore play an important role in helping people to maintain and improve their health. However, the demand itself for these things, as well as the impetus necessary to seek them out, is largely in the hands of those whose health is in question. As such, maintaining and improv- ing health by improving the demand for positive energy exchange with the environment also requires people's participation. b The supply of free energy and of opportunities for entropy export Dubos often quoted Winston Churchill (1943), who remarked in a speech before the House of Commons, \"We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\" As we have seen, the complexity model of health etiology implies thai health is dependent upon the maximization of high-quality energy input and upon sufficient opportunities for low-quality energy output. As men- tioned in the introduction to the section on energy exchange, finding such exchange with our environments is not only a question of whether and how we search for it (i.e. demand), but of its availability to us. In mentioning availabil- ity, I am of course concerned with die supply of available free energy and oppor- tunities to export entropy. Yet the cyclical nature of this interaction must not be neglected. As Churchill pointed out so poetically, over the long term, popula- tions also shape the context of energy available to their members. The way we impact the physical and social environments around us molds the capacity of those environments to supply the energy we need or allow us to export the energy we do not need. Below I attempt to integrate both sides of this issue into the discussion. The most obvious - and perhaps compelling - example of energy supply is rel- ative access to material resources. Many different models exist for how material resources are distributed within and among social groups. Nonetheless, as the medium of exchange in most cultures of the world, money now represents for 59most human beings relative access to many types of energy supply and oppor- tunities for low-energy export. Extensive research over the past 25 years has shown quite clearly that inequity in the distribution of material resources is strongly correlated with inequity in morbidity and mortality rates (Davey- Smith, Shipley and Stamler, 1996). In fact, with the somewhat obvious excep- tion of age, income is arguably the strongest known predictor of health status in populations. (This, of course, is the reason that socioeconomic status, in large part correlated with income, would whitewash the results of most epi- demiological studies if it were not regressed out of the analysis.) Further, a fas- cinating body of research has emerged which supports the hypothesis that though absolute wealth may correlate strongly with health, the level of relative inequity in access to material resources also has an appreciable influence. Wilkinson (1992a, 1992b; 1997) has provided a substantial body of evidence supporting the contention that, in two cultures with equal average incomes, that society with the lowest income disparity (i.e. difference between rich and poor) will have the longer life expectancy. Thus it may not only be the absolute measure of the supply of high-quality energy or opportunities to export low- quality energy which is important, but the relative distribution of that supply within social groups which is important for health status. Though far more difficult to document empirically than the impact of access to material resources, an appropriate supply (i.e. levels and types) of aesthetic energy may play a role in biological health status as surely as it plays a role in our quality of life. One important illustration of this issue emerges out of con- sideration of the impact of the process of urbanization, which is now occurring at a rate of little less than one percent of the total population of all developing nations per year (United Nations Department of Economic and Local Affairs - Population Division, 1993:49). To be sure, urban residence is nowhere defini- tively linked on average to better or worse health status when compared to rural residence. For many, the city offers access to a rich variety of health-producing resources; for others, of course, urban existence proves a detrimental trap (WHO, 1993). Yet, as people move into cities, they clearly do become further removed from the natural environments within which human beings evolved. The question which arises is not whether human health is benefited by certain aspects of urban existence; surely, for many, it is. Rather, the issue is whether human health can be optimal (i.e. as good as possible), on average, in settings relatively devoid of the kinds of aesthetic energy unique to natural settings. Employing traditional biomedical models, it is difficult to theorize explicitly the pathways by which contact with natural environments may be a powerful boon to health. However, from the perspective of the complexity model, it is plausi- ble that the aesthetic (and perhaps other types of) energy supply in natural environments is requisite to optimal health because it more closely approxi- mates the conditions under which most human beings evolved than do modern, fabricated environments. As Dubos (1970: 190) so eloquently noted, 60\"In the modern, industrial city human beings hardly ever have the chance to see the Milky Way or a night radiant with stars or even a truly blue sky. They never experience the subtle fragrances peculiar to each season, the exhilaration of early spring and the poetic melan- choly of autumn. The loss of these experiences may be more than an esthetic deprivation; certain emotional needs were woven in man's fabric during his evolutionary past, and their satisfaction may well be required for complete biological and mental sanity.\" Many aspects of energy supply and opportunities for energy export are out of individuals' direct control. Undoubtedly, therefore, professionals can and must support people in molding environments such that they supply the kinds of energy exchange which are most health producing. Yet again, at least in demo- cratic societies, populations at large have at least some say in how the many facets of their environment are shaped and therefore in what kinds of energy exchange those environments can afford individuals. Research on the signifi- cance for health of income distribution and relative equity means that voters make important health-related decisions when they elect representatives and participate in referendums. Patients have been encouraged to retreat to natural settings for centuries (Steiner, 1905; Meuwese, 1995) in order to benefit from the - if still poorly understood - potentially significant healing power of the aesthetic and other types of energy they provide. Hence all people, everywhere, are impacted by the relative supply of high-quality energy in their environment and the opportunities available for the export of low-quality energy. However, at least as voters and patients, people themselves can and do value, create, and access such supplies of high-quality energy and repositories of low-energy in their environments. Putting it in Churchill's terms, shaping the environments which shape us - if we hope for optimal health - demands participation. /// PROFESS/ONAL SUPPORT OF EFFECT/VE PART/C/PAT/ON In the first section, I developed a model of health based on insights from far- from equilibrium thermodynamics to show that both the way in which energy is processed within the human being and the way in which that individual exchanges energy with the external environment impacts salutogenesis. In the second section, I built on various traditions in salutogenic research which are consistent with - and therefore to a certain extent affirm - the core of the com- plexity model of health etiology. This discussion revealed that the complexity model implies the health etiological significance of many factors which are either partially or exclusively amenable to conditioning by the persons whose health is influenced by them. Both well developed salutogenic research as well 61as inferences made on the basis of a complexity model of health etiological, it was asserted, therefore imply the significance of participation for the mainte- nance and optimization of health. Yet if people are to play a role in conditioning the factors which influence their health, they must possess at least two key commodities. First, people need to be aware of the scope and relative importance of the many factors which impact health (i.e. the determinants of health) as well as how these factors can best be conditioned in the interest of health (i.e. the influencing of determinants of health). As I assert below, the need for accurate - but also for holistic* - knowledge among the public implies a mandate for health professionals to facil- itate people's understanding of salutogenic health etiology. Second, in order to participate in the interest of health, people need at least some jurisdiction over the factors which impact their health, and over the means to influence those factors. This implies a mandate for health professionals to facilitate people's ability to establish power over and to influence both direct determinants of health as well as determinants of the determinants of health (e.g. the effects which health professionals and other societal forces have on more direct deter- minants). In this section I consider the nature of these mandates for research and lay-professional communication regarding health etiology, as well as for educational and policy-based strategies for empowerment. Researching and informing public understandings of salutogenic health etiology There has been a good deal of research done on how people conceive health (Herzlich, 1973; D'Houtaud and Field, 1984; Blaxter, 1990; Stainton-Rogers, 1991), and the explanations they have for the occurrence of disease (Skelton and Croyle, 1991; Petrie and Weinman, 1997) and - to a lesser extent \u2014 recovery. 4 Many spiritual traditions have long taught us that all things - and thus all determinants and determinants of determinants of health - are intimately intertwined.The work of Prigogine and many others which has led to complexity theory builds substantially upon an older tradition in physics, dating to Einstein and later the quantum mechanics theorists, which confronted Newtonian. Cartesian notions of causality, reversibility, and determinism with observable nonlinearity, uncertainty, and relativism in physical systems (Zukav, 1980). Science has begun to unlearn its addiction to certainty, and this has brought it far more in line with the holism embodied by most of our most ancient knowledge, which - perhaps even due to its potentially phylogeneoc origins - has been consciously preserved through the centuries because of continued perceptions of its validity and relevance. Undoubtedly, people need accurate knowledge of salutogenic factors (e.g. not smoking tobacco is strongly statistically correlated to longevity) in the probabilistic sense. However, the complexity model indicates that people can best serve their own health goals when they also share at least a sense of the holism (i.e. nonlinear determinism) of the intimate interplay among determinants of health, the determinants of those determinants, etc.Also, as was revealed by the discussion in the second section of this paper, a rea- sonable amount has been published documenting the professional understanding of salutogenic health etiology. However, very little research \u2014 if any at all - has been conducted on people's own understandings of salutogenic health etiology. Salutogenic research has made it dear that health is the product of such factors as physical activity, a strong sense-of-coherence, and access to high quality nutrition and income. As we have seen, the complexity model extends these empirical insights to imply that even a far broader variety of things impacts our health due to their influence upon our ability to process energy internally or exchange energy with our environment. The pressing question, however, is whether people on the whole \u2014 rather than merely health professionals \u2014 are aware of the extent and ways in which these factors contribute to health status. The answer to this question holds at least three potential implications, all of which relate to the way in which professionals both learn from and influence \"informed opinion\" among the public in regards to health etiology. First, research on people's understandings of health etiology can allow profes- sionals to efficiently supplement those understandings where they are deficient from a scientific perspective. Rene Dubos (1959) once noted that people are far more fascinated by \"bugs\" than by the complex network of factors (i.e. saluto- genic factors) which keep them healthy. Illich (1976) suggested somewhat later that the enormous expansion of the role of medicine in the 20'h Century had encouraged people to understand health as the product of pathogenic factors. Since these factors were amenable to medical intervention, their portrayal as the most important determinants of health was compatible with the rising and pre- vailing power of the medical profession. If these contentions are accurate, people may have a fairly narrow, pathogenic view of health etiology. Research into the nature and extent of people's understanding of salutogenic health etiol- ogy can clarify whether people understand health etiology in pathogenic (i.e. factors which can cause symptoms (in some cases only if allowed to do so by the immune system), such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites) or salutogenic (i.e. factors which condition susceptibility, including the unmediated influence of the environment and physiological predisposition, such as physical activity, a strong SOC, income and social support) factors. To the extent that people hold conceptualizations of health etiology which are not sufficiently broad (i.e. not at all or only partially salutogenic), opportunities arise for raising awareness through health education. Yet health education can only be conducted effi- ciently if professionals are aware of the most pressing gaps in public under- standings of health etiology. A knowledge of those gaps demands research which assesses the full spectrum of such understandings. Second, research on people's understandings of health etiology can alert health professionals to knowledge which competes on the cognitive level with health 63education messages. Health educators have often complained that information does not lead directly to behavior change. This has led to a growing focus in many health education models on the influence of affective characteristics upon behavior and behavior change. Yet, while more focus on affective personal and social characteristics may be quite justified, the belief that this single step will comprise a panacea for health educators' difficulties with changing behavior may be rather naive for at least two reasons. On one hand, it disregards the possibility that when people choose not to adopt behaviors which lead to longevity and the absence of (future) morbidity, they may be acting in the interest of other notions of \"health\" which, in professional terms, would fall under the rubrics \"quality of life\" or \"positive health.\" On the other hand - and perhaps more importantly \u2014 it disregards the possibility that people consciously secure some health etiological factors (e.g. the securing of income) at the expense of giving attention to others (e.g. physical activity). An intervention constitutes a very small part of any individual's total information base; the health etiological messages transmitted in an intervention must compete both with the vast quantity of information gleaned from lived experience (i.e. onto- genesis) as well as inherited, instinctual knowledge (i.e. phylogenesis) (see Azzone, 1997). If designed with both questions in mind, research on people's understandings of health etiology can offer important insight on both of these levels. Third and finally, research on people's understandings of health etiology holds the potential of revealing whether different types of resources are relevant to the maintenance and optimization of the health of distinct social units. Both individuals and groups (e.g. economic, cultural, racial, professional groups) have different goals and functions which lead them to put different demands upon their bodies and minds. As Dubos (1965:349) pointed out. \"The evaluation of health and disease varies from person to person because it is conditioned by highly individual requirements and subjective reactions. In consequence, the words health and disease cannot be defined universally or statically. A Wall Street executive, a lumberjack in the Canadian Rockies, a newspaper boy at a crowded street corner, a steeple chase jockey, a cloistered monk rising during the night to pray and chant, and the pilot of a supersonic combat plane have very different physical and mental needs. The various imperfections and limitations of the flesh and mind do not have equal importance for them.\" This implies thai, at least to a certain extent, unique configurations of saluto- genic health etiology may be relevant to individuals and distinct groups. Yet how could a health professional be expected to guess what these unique configu- rations may be and whether they have importance for health interventions at the level of education or policy? Antonovsky (1991:72) asserted that health 64determining factors^ \"are omnipresent in life, and most of these are 'familiar', in that they arise from our familiar life situation.\" Research on people's under- standings of salutogenic health etiology would build on this familiarity to inform professional actions of the unique contexts of health etiological under- standings within distinct social groups and the corresponding opportunities and barriers they present. Structurally empowering people to participate A complexity model of health etiology reveals that many \u2014 if not most \u2014 deter- minants of health are partially or exclusively under the control of those whose health is affected by them. I have argued that this implies the need for participa- tion if health is to be optimized, and that this need in turn requires a public well-informed with respect to health etiological knowledge. However, there are numerous psychological and structural barriers both to becoming belter informed and to acting on that knowledge in the interest of one's health or the health of one's social group. Such barriers imply that though working for \"informed opinion\" among the public may be an important step, health profes- sionals have a corresponding mandate to help people surmount psychological and structural barriers which prevent them from asserting control over the deter- minants of their health. The field of health promotion has been defined as \"the process of enabling individuals and communities to increase control over the determinants of health, and thereby improve their health\" (WHO/EURO, 1986). Yet this is hardly an adequate definition, since it in fact describes at least part of the central goal of many health-related professional fields. Here, therefore, I will refer to the mandate described above with die interdisciplinary word \"empower- ment.\" The social, economic, and political barriers to genuine empowerment are so formidable that even to meditate on how they may be surmounted may seem naive. Social factors such as racism and educational inequity; economic dispari- ties in wealth and development; political deficiencies like instability and unrep- resentative government: all of these issues have long been part of the human experience, and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. However, that point takes nothing away from the imperative of working to ameliorate such ills, nor from the discussion of the strategies currently underway to do so. Here, I will limit the discussion to two strategies for empowerment: human 5 Antonovsky used the phrase \"stressors\" in place of \"health determining factors.\" I have replaced the former term with the latter consistent with the supplementary insights offered by a complexity model of health etiology, as discussed in the first section of this paper. 65resource improvement and structural transformation. Human resource improvement involves boosting individual and group capaci- ties. By doing so, health professionals can help individuals and groups take con- trol of health determining factors which were previously inaccessible. As has been mentioned earlier in this paper, a number of authors have pointed to the potential for improving through intensive psychotherapy or therapeutic encoun- ters the affective capacities which are the foundation of people's faith that their actions will make a difference, perseverance, and ability to cope with and draw meaning from experience (Kobasa and Maddi, 1977; Antonovsky, 1979; Bandura, 1986). Bergsma (2000) has noted the significance of this process for patients with chronic illness. However, development of human resources has also constituted the focus of a tradition at the community level (Freire, 1972; Minkler, 1997; Minkler and Wallerstein, 1997). Building human resources in communities comprises one of the key components of the Healthy Cities (Hancock and Duhl, 1986) and WHO Health Promotion (WHO, 1986, 1997) strategies. Structural transformation, in contrast to human resource development, focuses on the transformation of social, economic, and political institutions. By expand- ing access to health determinants through institutional change, health profes- sionals can allow people to more easily influence those determinants through participation. Duhl (1990) has pointed out that such systemic change demands \"social entrepreneurship,\" a process which can be initiated by any person or group, health professionals included. Milewa and De Leeuw (1996) have pro- vided observations of the implications of social entrepreneurship for research on the evolution of public policy and De Leeuw (1999) has given examples of how social entrepreneurship functions within the context of the European Healthy Cities Project. Further, Milio (1981), Blum (1983), Labonte and Edwards (1995) and De Leeuw (1989a), among many others, have discussed the importance of public policy for health and how such policy might be redesigned to allow people to participate more effectively in maintaining and improving their health status. Whether the focus is on improving human resources or structural transforma- tion, the ideas at the heart of the complexity model remind us that change must be achieved holistically, and that the focus must remain on an iterative process of choicemaking and learning. By emphasizing the inter-relatedness of all factors related to life and thus to health, the complexity model asserts the need for minimally fragmented approaches to health professionalism (Albrecht, Freeman, and Higginbotham, 1998). Additionally, the complexity model reveals the unpredictability of the process of living and thus the need for continued choicemaking, assessment of the impact of those choices, and then choicemak- ing once again on the basis ofthat assessment. Labonte (1991) has defined empowerment itself as \"making choices available.\" Further, the presence of 66options has been cited as a critical prerequisite to the successful evolution of complex systems (Koch and Laurent, 1999). In a society, itself a complex system, making choices available to people in order to improve their health may be one of the most powerful ways that professionals can act responsibly in the interest of the optimization of health status in populations. This implies a continual process of individual and social learning. As Dubos noted, \"The view that adaptation is a creative endeavor which demands continuous effort clearly applies to the process of learning\" (1965: 425). CONCLUSION Samuel Butler's words, some hundred years old, show that people have long known that health is ultimately the product of our ability to adapt our changed and unchanged being to its changing and unchanging environments. In this paper, I have built on recent insights from the natural sciences to develop three themes which support the wisdom of Butler's remarks and the intuition which gave rise to them. First, I attempted to show that insights from far-from-equi- librium thermodynamics, and a complexity model of health etiology derived from them, reveals that health is very likely the product of many factors which are partially or almost exclusively accessible to the people whose health they affect. Second, I noted that this likelihood constitutes a natural scientific founda- tion for the contention that participation is important for the optimization of human health. Third and finally, I argued that if participation is necessary to positively condition the myriad factors which determine health, then health professionals have a mandate to interact with the public's understanding of health etiological factors and to support its ability to influence those factors. Prigogine (in Steels, 1994) believes that far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics will enable science to study the basis for the dynamics described by Butler. In any case, Prigogine's work, and that of many others in the tradition of chaos and complexity, seems already to have borne out what Thera (1996) has noted: \"life is not an identity, it is a becoming.\" 6768CHAPTER 3 UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE PRECONDITIONS FOR AND DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AMONG RESIDENTS OF MAASTRICHT, THE NETHERLANDS A modified version of this chapter was published as: Commers, M.J. and De Leeuw, E. (2001). Health is a diverse ends People's notions of health, including those of so-called \"positive\" health, are known to be quite diverse. Studies in Western Europe have shown that concep- tions of health differ by socioeconomic der Heuvel, 1989; Blaxter, 1990), and ethnicity (Anderson, Blue, and Lau, 1991). Other studies have shown that the meaning of health is also mediated by one's status as a patient (Tsevat, Cook, Green, Matchar et dl., 1995), status as a smoker (Dijkstra, Bakker, and De Vries, 1997) Stainton Rogers (Stainton Rogers, 1991) describes at both detailed and more abstracted levels the myriad concepts which individuals iden- tify as \"health\". At least among Western populations, \"health\" is a label ascribed to a variety of feelings, states, and measurements. 69The determinants of and preconditions for health are a diverse means Evidence of health's many meanings makes it reasonable to assume that a vari- ety also exists in what people understand as the determinants of, or precondi- tions for, health. The Dutch, for example, display clear faith in both medical care and directed personal behavior as distinct means to health. Roughly on par with the rest of Western Europe, The Netherlands will devote 9.6% of its national product in 1998 to medical care (Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal, 1997), revealing that the Dutch not only see medical care as a means to health, but as a quite valuable means at that. On the other hand, a large-scale study carried out by the Dutch Institute for Public Opinion Research [NIPO] in 1990 revealed that at least 70% of 1,172 Dutch residents sampled claimed to eat less fat, get regular exercise, and drink less alcohol in the interest of promoting per- sonal health (NIPO, 1990). The same research revealed that at least 50% of those sampled did not smoke and ate more fiber also in the interest of promot- ing personal health. Faith in medical care and directed behavior as distinct ingredients to health may hint at a much richer underlying diversity in people's understandings of what determines health. It is not hard to imagine, for instance, that a diabetic might be especially concerned with access to insulin and medical monitoring, a trav- eler with water quality or personal safety, an otherwise healthy person with the onset of Huntington's Disease latent in his or her genes, or an aging person with avoiding falls. Unfortunately, though common sense testifies to the enor- mous role which cultural and personal contexts play in defining the factors of greatest relevance to any given individual's health, there has been little research which documents what people understand as the determinants of their personal health. Etiological knowledge and health There are at least three ways in which empirical insight into public understand- ings of the determinants of health (i.e. \"health etiological\" knowledge) can be of value to health researchers and professionals in applied fields. All of these relate to the promise of better communication between professionals and the public in regards to initiatives to promote health and prevent disease and pre- mature death. First, empirical investigation of health etiological knowledge among the public can perhaps help to explain problems hitherto experienced with the generation of participation in the interest of health among the public. Professionals in the health sciences acknowledge in ever greater measure that public, or \"lay\" partic- ipation is critical for the maintenance and optimization of health among those 70individuals and populations whose health is in question. The two most widely employed models in health promotion, that of Green and Kreuter (Green and Kreuter, 1991) and the Ottawa Charter (WHO, 1986), both explicitly mention community participation as fundamental to health promotion. More specifically, where structural rather than behavior-based health promotion is concerned, it has been argued that the participation of communities and the multisectoral col- laboration of important community stakeholders are requisite to the develop- ment and popular endorsement of public policy directed toward enhancing health (De Leeuw, 1989b; De Leeuw, 1993; Labonte and Edwards, 1995). In the past five years, however, many reports on participatory initiatives have not only focused on the promising potential of participatory initiatives, but as well on the difficulties of implementing such strategies effectively. A 1994 survey of community initiatives in the United States conducted by Eisen testifies to the importance of community participation in such efforts, but also docu- ments many inherent and practical difficulties with achieving it (Eisen, 1994). Also at municipal and provincial levels, community participation in health pro- motion campaigns has proven difficult to generate and sustain (Goumans, 1997). Epidemiological public health initiatives have experienced problems with participation in large-scale \"community-based\" screening and prevention pro- grams, such as the Minnesota Heart Health Program, which advocated behavior change in the interest of coronary heart disease reduction (Luepker, Murray, Jacobs Jr., Mittelmark et d., 1994). The question is why the programs described by Eisen, Goumans, and Luepker et al. were unable to generate satisfactory levels of public participation. One hypothesis is that these campaigns did not connect sufficiently with the health etiological understandings of the respective publics they sought to involve. Second, to the extent that health professionals are aware of the public's preex- isting assumptions about what determines health, they are in a position to influence this knowledge more efficiently. This has implications at the level of health education, for example. In cases where the health etiological understand- ings of the public are inconsistent with prevailing epidemiological insights, the epidemiological validity of public knowledge can be more efficiently improved if the gaps in that knowledge are clear. For instance, if investigation of health etiological knowledge among the public revealed that people are unaware of the epidemiological significance of seat-belt use for health, this message may get higher priority in health education campaign funding. Alternatively, if people seem to be highly aware of the significance of diet and smoking for personal health, the general awareness messages in these domains can be left behind in favor of messages which are tailored more specifically to issues such as how to eat better or quit smoking. Similarly, empirical investigation into the health eti- ological knowledge of the public can improve the strategic position of profes- sionals advocating that health be placed higher on public policy agendas. The 71amount of importance which the public ascribes to social rather than individual determinants of health, for instance, can logically be assumed to correlate at least in part with the public's concurrence with the idea that public policy is an appropriate means for promoting health. For instance, those who see air, ground, and water pollution as significant potential determinants of health would presumably be more likely to support policies to address such pollution in the name of health than those who ascribe little importance to these factors and more to individual factors, such as diet, exercise, and family contact. Thus, at both the levels of health education and health policy, empirical investigation into health etiological knowledge among the public holds the potential of making professional efforts more effective and efficient. Finally, documenting what the public believes to determine its health offers the possibility of the discovery of determinants of health which are as yet unbe- knownst to health professionals. Aaron Antonovsky (1979), one of the foremost theorists of health etiology, believed that most of the Stressors which threaten the health of individuals and populations are well known to the individuals and populations they affect. It is quite possible that some of these factors, due to the fact that they are difficult to operationalize in research or are only valid for sub- groups within populations (i.e. gender, age, ethnic group), have not yet received serious or sufficient epidemiological attention. Such factors, to the extent that they seem theoretically plausible, would deserve further research if significant portions of the public identify them as having a significant influence on health. Nonetheless, this process can only occur on the basis of a broad inventory of the factors which the public identifies as influencing its health. Research objective Knowing more about what people understand as leading to health may help explain documented problems with the generation of public participation in the implementation of interventions or of public support for health policies directed at socially-operative determinants of health. Such insight would also enable health professionals to influence the health etiological understandings of the public more effectively and efficiently. Finally, knowing more about what people understand as leading to health may generate discovery of determinants of health as yet unrecognized by health professionals. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to provide a broad inventory of understandings among residents of Maastricht, The Netherlands, in regards to what allows or determines health. The objectives in generating such an inven- tory were threefold. First, we hoped to provide a first glimpse of the full scale of popular understandings of the determinants of health within which health professionals build programs and conduct interventions. Second, we sought to 72generate a small-sample inventory which would provide a basis for the genera- tion and subsequent testing of social variation hypotheses in larger-scale survey research. Third and finally, in light of the relative dearth of standardized survey questionnaires within the domain of this research, we sought also to lest methodologically the question of whether responses to an open, minimally- directed question in regards to health's determinants and conditions would differ from those to structured, semi-directed questions on the same subject. METHODS Development of the interview questions Due to the lack of standardized and validated questionnaires in regards to the broad spectrum of perceived determinants of health, it was necessary to con- struct the interview questions independently. Manderbacka (1998) shows how diversity in the ways respondents understand questions relating to health or its origins can undermine the validity of studies which seek to shed light on these areas. In order to maximize the validity of interview data, question develop- ment was based on a pretest. The pretest was carried out among 34 health-sci- ences students of Maastricht University and 1 5 households in a low-income neighborhood of Maastricht. These groups were chosen because they were pre- sumed to represent the most relevant extremes in the sociodemographic (i.e. in terms of age and socioeconomic status) and health-related knowledge distribu- tion of our sample population. Questions were developed in raw form based upon Blum's comprehensive model of factors impacting health, which distinguishes quite broadly among environ- mental, behavioral, genetic, and care-related determinants (Blum, 1983). These raw questions were refined to vary along three important dimensions in prevail- ing theories of health etiology. First, questions differed in whether or not they inquired about determinants of good health or ill health (Antonovsky, 1979). Second, since both the Dutch language and Dutch care professions distinguish between mental (\"geestelijk\") and physical (\"lichamelijk\") health, questions varied in their focus on determinants of \"mental and physical health\" or merely \"health\". Third and finally, since etiological discussion displays a deep-rooted split between focuses on specific \"determinants\" and general \"preconditions\" (Macdonald, 1998), questions were designed along the lines of both models. The pretest was carried out among the students and low-income households using the raw questions which varied along the three dimensions described 73above. The criteria used to select the final set of interview questions from the raw questions were respondents' own estimation of the extent to which: 1) questions were immediately understandable and unambiguous, 2) their views on the etiology of health had been broadly surveyed; 3) their thinking on etiol- ogy had referred to notions of good and ill health as opposed to merely ill health; 4) their beliefs would not vary with changes of time or place. Results of the pretesting showed that the most successful questions contained a positive health focus, explicitly specified \"mental and physical health\" when (but only when) a question was not further structured with aspects of etiologi- cal theory, and used a \"preconditions\" as opposed to \"determinants\" focus. The final set of interview questions, therefore, incorporated these three aspects. Also, phrases like \"according to you\" and \"your health\" were inserted to assure that respondents understood it was their own personal etiological opinions and individual health which were of interest (D'Houtaud and Field, 1984). Interview format Because we were interested in exploring differences in response to open and structured questions, a two-part interview was constructed. Part One consisted of a single open and minimally-directed question which confined the intervie- wee only by explicitly asking for those things which could be of positive influ- ence upon the interviewee's mental and physical health (see Table 3.1). Part Two comprised seven subsequent questions which asked interviewees to iden- tify preconditions for and determinants of \"good health\" relating to their living, occupational, and natural environments, social contact, behavior, genetic inheri- tance, and medical care, respectively (see Table 3.2). Sample selection and contact A random sample of 300 addresses in Maastricht was selected from the Maastricht Telephone Directory. An initial contact letter was mailed to each of the 300 addresses requesting an interview with the person in the household whose birthday fell on the day closest to the date of receipt of the letter. This \"last-birthday method\" was intended to maximize participation across age, gender, and occupational lines. In subsequent weeks, an attempt was made to contact all 300 households by telephone. If a household could not be reached, two more attempts were made. To further insure against selection bias, households were only classified as unreachable after they have been called three times, once each during a week- day, weeknight, and weekend day. In many cases, potential participants did not 74Table 3.1 Open Interview Component: I Open, Minimally-Directed Question What ire for you the most important things which arc good for your physical and mental health?

Therefore, as the requirement was not seen as critical to the attainment or subsequent analy- sis of a broad sample of respondents, we chose to treat this requirement as merely a guideline for those who inquired about it. 75Interviews ... All interviews were carried out within respondents' homes by a single inter- viewer (Commers). Though interviewees had been told that the interview would last approximately 20 minutes, each interview was carried through to completion. This meant that interviews sometimes lasted only 15 minutes, most often were between 30-40 minutes, and in a few cases lasted an hour or more. Data recording Most of the interviewees' responses comprised 3-50 word descriptions of one particular type of precondition or determinant of health. Responses were there- fore written down verbatim as they were said. Nonetheless, a cassette tape was also used to record the interviews. In cases in which interviewees spoke too quickly or unclearly for their responses to be accurately written down during the interview, the cassette recording was used to fill in the missing details after the interview. At the end of the interview, respondents were asked for their age, employment status and smoking status. These variables, in addition to gender and socioeconomic status, were chosen as subject variables for the study because: 1 Gender, age, and SES have been shown to correlate with differing conceptu- alizations of health (see introduction) and with use of and access to health services (Lewin Epstein, 1991; Green and Pope, 1999). It is therefore reason- able to assume that these would also be correlated with differing conceptual- izations of what determines health. 2 Gender, age, and SES are well-documented in Dutch census data and are therefore accessible to policy or mass educational intervention. 3 Smoking status is the most important behavioral cause of morbidity and pre- mature mortality in The Netherlands as elsewhere. Smokers are therefore reg- ularly targeted by health education campaigns and even health policy as a group at elevated risk. Information about differences in the etiological under- standings of smokers and non-smokers is therefore potentially very relevant for the design of anti-smoking messages and the structural influencing (i.e. higher taxation) of smoking behavior. 4 Each category within each variable comprises a significant percentage of the Dutch population and is thus relevant from a structural health policy perspec- tive. These variables were subsequently used to pose social variation hypotheses (see Chapter 4) which could be tested in a much larger scale, quantitative study (see Chapter 6). Employment status was recorded in order to allow tests of sample representativeness. 76Data analysis Interviews were transcribed into a spreadsheet by the interviewer. As the deter- minants were transcribed, a cumulative list of preliminary groupings was main- tained as these arose from the data. The groupings were highly specific and unambiguous, and were only formed to combine determinants when there was indistinguishable repetition among them. For instance, many respondents men- tioned refraining from drinking too much alcohol as a determinant of their health. Though articulations of this determinant varied sometimes by a word or a few words (or their order), their meaning was clearly identical. Therefore, \"Not drinking too much alcohol\" became one of the specific, preliminary groupings. In all, this process reduced the 3101 determinants and preconditions to approximately 660 specific groupings. The 660 specific groupings were then analyzed to find thematic similarities among them. This process resulted in the identification of 141 \"clusters\", each encompassing at least one but sometimes a number of specific groupings. Unlike the specific groupings, clusters were not held to the standard that they represent indistinguishable elements; rather, clusters represented a set of specific groupings whose themes were comparable enough that they could feasibly be combined under an easily understandable and logical rubric. For example, con- tinuing with the example above, both of the specific groupings \"Not drinking too much alcohol\" and \"Drink a little alcohol each day\" were subsequently combined within a cluster labeled \"Use and abuse of alcohol\". Due to the fact that clusters represent determinants and preconditions having similar themes, they were by necessity non-directional. Responses which ultimately fell into the cluster \"nutrition\" included both \"I eat too much fat\" (i.e. health threatening) and \"I eat lots of fruit and vegetables\" (i.e. health promotive). Finally, this clus- tering process was reiterated with the clusters themselves. This final and third grouping procedure resulted in 10 macro-clusters which represented still larger summary categories of the clusters themselves. \"Use and abuse of alcohol\" was placed within the macro-cluster \"Behavior\". Each of the transcribed determinants and preconditions was then coded by the original interviewer as belonging to one and only one of the clusters. Our methods dictated that one interviewer spend time with respondents, making the interviewer the only person who truly understood the context and sentiment with which each of the determinants was identified. This made the use of mul- tiple coders or a subsequent inter-coder reliability analysis inappropriate. The data in the spreadsheet were imported into SPSS 8.0, and frequencies and crosstabulations were calculated to summarize the distributions of determinants and preconditions themes. 77Table 3.3 Reasons Given for Non-Participation Number No Interest No Time Howl food Too 7.7% o.4% 5.1% 7.7% RESULTS Response Of the 300 contact letters, 6 were returned as undeliverable. Of households which did receive the letter, 189 (64.3%) were subsequently reached by tele- phone. Because no action was requested in the contact letter, it is impossible to determine whether households which could not be reached would have partici- pated if they had been able to be contacted. Our net sample therefore included 189 households. Of these, 1 11 households made appointments to be inter- viewed. Due to 8 irretrievable no-shows on the part of respondents, 103 inter- views (54.5% of net sample) were ultimately carried out. Considering that people were asked to participate in interviews for 20 minutes of time in their own homes, a final response rate of 54.5% of those reached by telephone can be considered reasonable. Reasons for non-response The reasons for non-participation given by the 78 persons who were reached by telephone but chose not to be interviewed are listed in Table 3.3. Response distribution Since the last-birthday method request in the initial contact letter was treated as a guideline rather than a requirement, there was a risk that certain demographic groupings, such as the unemployed or elderly, would be over-represented in our sample. This risk was compounded by our inability to obtain response-rate data or conduct non-response analyses among the 35.7% of the sample pool 78Table 3.4 Response distribution by gender, age, smoking and employment status, and average neighborhood income Category Women Men 15-39 years 40-64 years 65+ years Smokers Non-Smokers Employed Not employed Student (Univ. or School) Av.

Sample distribution was therefore assessed post hoc through comparison with municipal and national population data. Table 3.4 shows the relative breakdown of respondents by gender, age, smok- ing and employment status, and average neighborhood income. When com- pared with municipal and national data, no statistically significant selection bias was found in the interview pool with respect to these sociodemographic group- ings. In 1997, 98% of Dutch households had a telephone connection (KPN-PTT Telecom, 1998). Due to privacy and proprietary issues in The Netherlands, no 79official data is available on the percentages of households with unlisted tele- phone numbers or their social distribution. As Table 3.4 shows, however, we did obtain a representative sample with regards to gender, age, and household income, all known to correlate with unique conceptions of health itself. This implies that the absence of unlisted households from the sample did not result in significant selection bias relevant to the present study. Clusters Respondents mentioned a total of 3 101 determinants of and preconditions for health, and these could be classified into 141 thematically similar clusters. In both the open and structured components of the interviews, nutrition (8.8% of total response, 12.4% of open component response [open], 7.9% of structured component response [structured]) and physical exercise (6.6% total, 8.7% open, 6.0% structured) were found to be the most frequently mentioned deter- minants of health. Thereafter, however, the components differed significantly. In the open component, rest and relaxation (4.3% open), activities and pastimes (4.0% open), and personal sense of balance and pacing (4.0% open) occupied the next three most frequently mentioned determinants. In the structured com- ponent, these were general environmental pollution (5.9% structured), relations with colleagues and clients (3.4% structured), and good communication with physician (3.3% structured). Macro-clusters The 141 clusters could be grouped into 10 macro-clusters. Seven of the macro- clusters closely mimicked the themes derived from professional health determi- nants theory which comprised the basis for the seven questions in the struc- tured component of the interview. This may be due to the fact that health- related theory is ultimately based upon social consensus regarding what health means and thus what determines it. Conversely, that respondents' answers to the structured interview component were given to questions which specifically related to these themes is also likely to have been influential in this regard. Three macro-clusters, however, had to be developed independently to accom- modate our data. The first was labeled \"intrinsic mental and physical\" and encompasses personal mental and physical characteristics which respondents felt were requisite to the experience of health. Two examples of these are \"I've always had reasonable expectations about what I can do at my age\" and \"to have good luck.\" A second macro-cluster labeled \"macro-environmental\" proved necessary to encapsulate the meta-environmental factors which respondents con- sidered relevant to their health. Two examples of responses falling into this 80macro-cluster are \"political stability in the Netherlands,\" and \"greater availability and accessibility of health information these days.\" Finally, a tenth macro-clus- ter, \"Irrelevant,\" encompassed those responses judged as not having pertained to the question at hand. Response themes and rankings Table 3.5 shows the complete response of all 103 interviews broken down by macro-cluster and cluster. Clusters are presented within their respective macro- cluster groupings, and then ranked according to the combined number of men- tions within both the open and structured interview components (Table 3.5, columns 1 and 2). In order to illuminate the differences in response to the open and structured interview components, rankings are also given for each cluster based on response frequency within each component (Table 3.5, columns 3 and 4). Differences in open and structured component response by macro-cluster Figure 3.1 graphically represents the percentages of response in each component (open and structured) which fell into each of the ten macro-clusters after sub- tracting all responses, such as \"genetic factors not influential\" which explicitly denied the influence of a macro-cluster's domain on personal health. Each com- ponent's response percentage is delineated by the two bars above each of the macro-clusters on the horizontal axis, each of which is annotated with the appropriate percentage of component response. Figure 3.1 orders the macroclus- ters by the average of the open and structured component percentage responses, and these averages are noted aside the macro-cluster labels on the horizontal axis. Such an arrangement is the most accurate portrayal of the interview data because it lends equivalent weight to the open and structured interview compo- nents. The fact that there was a greater absolute number of responses to the structured component than to the open component was produced solely by the fact that there were 7 questions in the structured component and only 1 ques- tion in the open component. An equal weighting of the distributions represented by the two components requires taking the averages of their macro-cluster per- centages. This reasoning also forms the basis for the testing of differences between the two components per macro-duster (see also Figure 3.1). Above each pair of staffs devoted to each macro-cluster are the results of sign tests for independent samples applied to the response percentages per macro-cluster per interview component per respondent for the 103 respondents. In order to prevent chance capitalization 0.05/10 macro-clusters = 0.005 (in accordance with of Open and Structured Component Response %) Figure 3.1 Percent Component Response by Macro-Cluster Bonferroni correction) was taken as the level of significance. All macro-clusters showed significant differences (p<0.05) between the open and structured com- ponents except the irrelevant response (p= 1.000). 82Table 3.5 Response to Open, Structured, And Combined Components by Macro-Cluster and Cluster MaciWCIuster S Internal Rank Behavior Nutrition Physical Exercise Adopted Attitude or Specific Personal Strategy Activities and Pastimes Smoking Rest and Relaxation Alcohol Use and Abuse Personal Care/Hygiene Go to the Doctor on Time live for Quality Not Quantity Stay Up to Date Behavior (not further specified) Avoid Making Enemies Intrinsic Mental or Physical Personal Sense of Balance and Pacing Physical Funcbon Health of Family and Community Feel Good Mentally or Physically Natural Attitude or Disposition Stress (not further specified) Ingrained Expectations of Self or life Natural Dispostion to Do What 1 Want/Like Independence.

Response to the open interview component, repre- sented in Figure 3.1, focused primarily on individually-based determinant themes, such as behavior (40.8% of open component response) and intrinsic mental and physical characteristics (30.7%), providing strong evidence that the individuals in our sample attribute their personal health more to individually- based than to socially-based determinants. However, though in lesser measure, respondents spontaneously mentioned (in the open component), concurred with, and specified (structured component) socially-based determinants as influencing their personal health. This is revealed by the modest percentages of response falling into the macro-clusters living-, occupational-, natural-, and social environments, as well as professional care and macro-environments. Respondents' ability to specify determinants within these socially-based macro- clusters implies that, though these areas may not come to mind as immediately as behavior or intrinsic characteristics, they are domains which people readily and articulately describe as determining of, or allowing for, health. This sug- gests that health professionals hoping to involve the public in action for health or glean support among the public for public policies directed at social determi- nants of health can count on \u2014 but need to stimulate \u2014 a latent public concur- rence with the notion that health is the product of social as well as individual factors. This point is further supported by analysis of the data at the cluster level. For instance, though the clusters \"prevalence of crime and unprovoked violence\", \"positive action for the environment\", and \"national/local policy, regulations, and engineering\" were not mentioned at all in the open interview component. 87these themes were referred to 18, 40, and 17 times, respectively, in the struc- tured component. Structured questions, then, evoked significantly more men- tion among respondents of the structural determinants of health amenable to public policy solutions. Endorsement among communities or electorates of causal relationships between such areas and health is an important part of build- ing community health interventions and healthy public policy. These findings imply that such endorsement may depend upon the active stimulation by pro- fessionals or political stakeholders of a community's or electorate's latent causal beliefs regarding socially-based determinants of health. Are the structural and behavioral sides of health promotion in competition for the public's attention? Attention should be given to the fact that, though in the open component respondents placed far greater emphasis on individually-based determinants than on socially-based determinants, they referred even less frequently to care (2.0%) and genetic (0.0%) factors. The low rate of spontaneous response falling into these areas challenges the notion that exaggerated public faith in biomedi- cine or genetic fatalism inhibit support for public health activities. Among public health fields, policy-based health promotion in particular has often assumed that biomedicine is its most direct competitor. Interview data from both the open and structured components, however, show that though socially- based determinants do not occupy the center of the lay etiological stage, it is behavior, much more than care, in which people do place their faith. This would seem to indicate that health education which targets behavior, and not biomedicine, is the area of health activity most in competition with structural-, or policy-based health promotion. What are \"intrinsic mental and physical characteristics\"? As mentioned above, no explicit mention at all was made of genetic determi- nants in the open component. This finding was startlingly validated by respon- dents' explicit denial of the relevance of genetic factors in the structured com- ponent, represented by 39 mentions falling into the cluster \"genetic factors not influential\". Certainly, this begs the question of whether the intrinsic mental or physical factors, which technically excluded all explicit references to \"genes\" or genetics but comprised 30.7% of the open component, perhaps constitute a lay vocabulary for the influence of genetics on health. However, the clusters \"born healthy (no mention of genetic strength)\" and \"luck/fortune\" were the only two intrinsic mental and physical characteristics clusters which even approach the professional notion of genetic influence on health. The findings therefore seem to indicate that the public distinguishes conceptually between inherited 88\"genetic\" factors and slowly ingrained characteristics which we have labeled \"intrinsic mental and physical characteristics\". One of the potential implications of this finding is that the rising tide of professional information over genetic factors and their influence upon health will not connect with preexisting beliefs among the public. This could be detrimental to future health education efforts to tailor risk information to people on the basis of a genetic profile. On the other side of the same coin, the strong belief people showed in intrinsic mental and physical characteristics, as a set of factors absent from most prevailing pro- fessional theories of health etiology, could be driving behavior (e.g. inhibiting behavior change) in ways unknown to health professionals. If a person believes that ingrained characteristics determine health to a great extent, would this belief not generally be had at the cost of placing faith in behavioral or socially- based (i.e. structural policy-based) strategies for health? Even further, people could be right: these factors could even have some scientific validity in terms of their connection with health status. Intrinsic mental and physical characteristics, therefore, deserve more investigation in order to assess their nature, influence, and perhaps even their scientific validity. Basis for social variation analysis The chi-square values in Table 3.4 indicate that we were successful in reaching representative proportions of the Maastricht population with respect to sociode- mographic variation by gender, age, smoking, employment, and neighborhood income. Such representative distributions in the sample make the results of this study valid grounds on which to base hypotheses regarding variations in beliefs about determinants and preconditions of health across similarly delineated seg- ments of the Dutch population. These analyses of social variation will be pre- sented in Chapter 4. CONCLUSION Engaging the public in pursuit of its own health requires learning from, build- ing upon and, at times, influencing what people understand as influencing their health. Analysis of the perceived determinants of and preconditions for health inventory presented in this paper implies that respondents were prone to over- look their own well-developed understandings of ways in which socially-based factors influence their personal health until outside stimulus was provided in this regard. The departure of respondents' unique articulation of intrinsic mental and physical determinants from all widely-acknowledged professional models of 89health etiology, combined with their clear endorsement of good communica- tion with health professionals, also reveals the need for tailoring professional messages to lay etiological understandings. Analysis of the rich diversity in response to the 103 interviews conducted in this study thus arguably constitutes an ethical and professional mandate for the further integration of research on public understandings of health etiology into professional theory and practice. 90CHAPTER 4 INDICATIONS OF SOCIAL VARIATION IN UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE PRECONDITIONS FOR AND DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AMONG RESIDENTS OF MAASTRICHT,THE NETHERLANDS INTRODUCTION \"Health\" is considered by most Western populations to be a high personal and public priority. In the Netherlands, a majority of people identifies \"gezondheid\" (health) as the highest priority in life (NIPO, 1995; SCP, 1996), ranking it squarely above partner, family, or faith. Yet, while \"health\" as a value may meet with widespread social consensus, the specific goals which various social groups associate with health appear to be quite diverse. Studies in Western Europe, for instance, have shown that concep- tions of health differ by age (Van der Heuvel, 1989; Blaxter, 1990; Williams, 1990). Rene Dubos (1959) suggested some time ago that health is better understood as an elusive individual and social goal dependent on the presence of the resources requisite for its experience. In the same work, (1959: 110-24), Dubos catego- rized such health-requisite resources into those of the milieu interne, or capacities of an individual or group, and those of the milieu externe, or all other resources relevant to the meeting of challenges, including the political, economic, and physical environments in which individuals and populations live. It comes as 91little surprise to any social scientist concerned with health that die distribution of both internal health-related resources, such as a well-functioning heart or a smoking habit, as well as external resources, such as social capital or income level, varies greatly among social groups. Much existing health-related literature rather imperialistically uses the phrase \"determinants of health\" when what is actually being referred to are the deter- minants of (measurable aspects of) morbidity or mortality. This is an expedient substitution for the health professional, to whom it provides an excuse to dis- cuss \"the determinants of health\" as though these were scientifically validated facts. Though some determinants of morbidity and mortality may have a strong scientific basis, however, the determinants of health are not facts. In accordance with Dubos' vision, the determinants of health are those resources whose pres- ence or absence impacts the capacity for achieving the health-related goals which are valued by an individual or group. It is increasingly clear that both the health-related goals which social groups value and the resources which they possess to achieve them are quite diverse. Such diversity suggests that health professionals have a methodological and ethical duty to recognize that the determinants of health, as the product of two variable entities, may be corre- spondingly socially diverse. The two-way nature of the dialectical process which takes place between health professionals and the public implies that, at times, it is necessary for profession- als to leum from a population's understandings about its unique resources and goals. The idea of \"positive health\" has been compelling to health professionals for millen- nia (Dubos, 1959). However, it continues to suffer from an inability to be debated or pursued in operational or standardized terms (Seipp, 1987). Positive health may range from living without illness (Radley, 1994), to the presence of such experiences as existential integrity, life as a promise of good (Mordacci and Sobel, 1998), as well as reserve of strength or balance (Herzlich, 1973). As such, positive health may be more subject to social mediation than clinical health, which essentially implies the absence of disease and the postponement of death. Knowing more about what groups understand as the determinants of their clearly diverse positive notions of health can help make those concepts operational by identifying concrete resources (i.e. resources which can be stan- dardized, measured, and provided) requisite to their attainment. Health professionals have recognized for some time the need to build upon u popu- lation's understandings about its unique resources and goals. Participatory and empowerment initiatives which connect with pre-existing public knowledge in this regard have been shown to generate more effective and widespread partici- pation (Kisen, 1994; Sellers, Crawford, Bullock and McKinlay, 1997). The liter- ature on participation and empowerment has in some cases focused on how to better achieve the more traditional health-related goals of lower mortality and 92morbidity within a given population by identifying and building upon its unique social and environmental capital. Other times, the focus has been on working toward the specific health-related objectives of the population in con- cern, rather than those objectives which professionals might first recommend. In either case, however, knowledge of the population's resources and goals pro- vides a critical link to the construction of initiatives which communities per- ceive as sensible and trustworthy. Finally, building on a population's unique health resources and goals stands to enhance the ability of professionals to strategically engender public participation in developing and carrying out healthy public policy (De Leeuw, 1989b; Labonte and Edwards, 1995). At times and in situations where a clear ethical mandate exists, health profes- sionals need to influence a population's understandings about its health-related resources and goals. This area of professional activity is also enhanced by accurate infor- mation in regards to the health etiological understandings held by target popu- lations. Dijkstra (1998), in operationalizing the stages of change model created by Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross (1992), showed the importance of tai- loring messages to the unique etiological beliefs of \"preconiemplating\" smokers in the Netherlands. Green and Kreuter (1991), in their broadly cited text on health promotion planning, point to the need for professionals to gather infor- mation from a target population in regards to its unique human and material resources at the outset of initiatives which attempt to achieve behavioral or environmental change in the interest of health. Research objective Despite a compelling history of sociological attention devoted to the definition of health itself (Herzlich, 1973; D'Houtaud and Field, 1984), very little is known about whether and how understandings of the origias of health differ among those social groups most commonly addressed by public health research and practice. By talking to people about their health-etiological understandings, we sought to provide a preliminary impression of whether and how such under- standings may correlate with gender, age, smoking- and socio-economic status. Due to the lack of previous research in this area, we employed a combined open- and structured interview method supported by content analysis to obtain an inventory of health etiological understandings. This method mandated a sample size which precludes the necessary statistical power to account for potential confounding among the four subject variables used in this study. With an internally balanced and representative sample, however, such indications would form both a valuable qualitative contribution on their own and a scien- tifically responsible basis for further research in this area among larger samples. 93There were four reasons for selecting gender, age, smoking status, and average neighborhood income (ANI) as subject variables: 1 Gender, age, and SES have been shown to correlate with differing conceptu- alizations of health (see introduction) and with use of and access to health services (Lewin Epstein, 1991; Green and Pope, 1999). It is therefore reason- able to assume that these would also be correlated with differing conceptual- izations of what determines health. 2 Gender, age, and SES are well documented in Dutch census data and are therefore accessible to policy or mass educational intervention. 3 Smoking status is the most important behavioral cause of morbidity and pre- mature mortality in The Netherlands as elsewhere. Smokers are therefore reg- ularly targeted by health education campaigns and even health policy as a group at elevated risk. Information about differences in the etiological under- standings of smokers and non-smokers is therefore potentially very relevant for the design of anti-smoking messages and the structural influencing (i.e. higher taxation) of smoking behavior. 4 Each category within each variable comprises a significant percentage of the Dutch population and is thus relevant from a structural health policy perspec- tive. METHODS Development of the interview questions Due to the lack of standardized and validated questionnaires in regards to the broad spectrum of perceived determinants of health, it was necessary to con- struct the interview questions independently. Manderbacka (1998) shows how diversity in the ways respondents understand questions relating to health or its origins can undermine the validity of studies which seek to shed light on these areas. In order to maximize the validity of interview data, question develop- ment was based on a pretest. The pretest was carried out among 34 health-sci- ences students of Maastricht University and 15 households in a low-income neighborhood of Maastricht. These groups were chosen because they were pre- sumed lo represent the most relevant extremes in the sociodemographic (i.e. in terms of age and socioeconomic status) and health-related knowledge distribu- tion of our sample population. Questions were developed in raw form based upon Blum's comprehensive model of factors impacting health, which distinguishes quite broadly among environmental, behavioral, genetic, and care-related determinants (Blum, 1983). 94These raw questions were refined lo vary along three important dimensions in prevailing theories of health etiology. First, questions differed in whether or not they inquired about determinants of good health or ill health (Antonovsky, 1979). Second, since both the Dutch language and Dutch care professions dis- tinguish between mental (\"geestelijk\") and physical (\"lichamelijk\") health, questions varied in their focus on determinants of \"mental and physical health\" or merely \"health\". Third and finally, since etiological discussion displays a deep-rooted split between focuses on specific \"determinants\" and general \"pre- conditions\" (Macdonald, 1998), questions were designed along the lines of both models. The pretest was carried out among the students and low-income households using the raw questions which varied along the three dimensions described above. The criteria used to select the final set of interview questions from the raw questions were respondents' own estimation of the extent to which: 1) questions were immediately understandable and unambiguous, 2) their views on the etiology of health had been broadly surveyed; 3) their thinking on etiol- ogy had referred to notions of good and ill health as opposed to merely ill health; 4) their beliefs would not vary with changes of time or place. Results of the pretesting showed that the most successful questions contained a positive health focus, explicitly specified \"mental and physical health\" when (but only when) a question was not further structured with aspects of etiologi- cal theory, and used a \"preconditions\" as opposed to \"determinants\" focus. The final set of interview questions, therefore, incorporated these three aspects. Also, phrases like \"according to you\" and \"your health\" were inserted to assure that respondents understood it was their own personal etiological opinions and individual health which were of interest (D'Houtaud and Field, 1984). Interview format Because we were interested in exploring differences in response to open and structured questions, a two-part interview was constructed. Part One consisted of a single open and minimally-directed question which confined the intervie- wee only by explicitly asking for those things which could be of positive influ- ence upon the interviewee's mental and physical health (see Table 4.1). Part Two comprised seven subsequent questions which asked interviewees to iden- tify preconditions for and determinants of \"good health\" relating to their living, occupational, and natural environments, social contact, behavior, genetic inheri- tance, and medical care, respectively (see Table 4.2). 95Table 4.1 One Open, Minimally-Directed Question What are for you the most Important things which are good for your physical and mental health? coor Table 4.2 Structured Interview Component: 7 Structured, Semi-Directed Questions Are there things in your living environment which for you are important in order to have good health?

Zo ya, Are there things in the environment which for you are important in order to have good health?* If so, Is contact with other people important for you in order to have good health?

Is medical care (contact with you family physician, with specialists, or with the hospital) important for you in order to have good health? l( yes, asked \"rht tnviroimtni\", die interviewer the newspaper.\" 96Sample selection and contact A random sample of 300 addresses in Maastricht was selected from the Maastricht Telephone Directory. An initial contact letter was mailed to each of the 300 addresses requesting an interview with the person in the household whose birthday fell on the day closest to the date of receipt of the letter. This \"last-birthday method\" was intended to maximize participation across age, gender, and occupational lines. In subsequent weeks, an attempt was made to contact all 300 households by telephone. If a household could not be reached, two more attempts were made. To further insure against selection bias, households were only classified as unreachable after they have been called three times, once each during a week- day, weeknight, and weekend day. In many cases, potential participants did not recognize or comprehend the last-birthday method requirement. Therefore, as the requirement was not seen as critical to the attainment or subsequent analy- sis of a broad sample of respondents, we chose to treat this requirement as merely a guideline for those who inquired about it. Interviews All interviews were carried out within respondents' homes by a single inter- viewer (Commers). Though interviewees had been told that the interview would last approximately 20 minutes, each interview was carried through to completion. This meant that interviews sometimes lasted only 1 5 minutes, most often were between 30-40 minutes, and in a few cases lasted an hour or more. Data recording Most of the interviewees' responses comprised 3-50 word descriptions of one particular type of precondition or determinant of health. Responses were there- fore written down verbatim as they were said. Nonetheless, a cassette tape was also used to record the interviews. In cases in which interviewees spoke too quickly or unclearly for their responses to be accurately written down during the interview, the cassette recording was used to fill in the missing details after the interview. At the end of the interview, respondents were asked for their age, employment status and smoking status. 97Data analysis Interviews were transcribed into a spreadsheet. Each determinant was then coded according to interview-, question-, and determinant-number, as well as the age, gender, average neighborhood income, employment status, and smok- ing status of the respondent. Average neighborhood income was assessed ex post facto on the basis of municipal data. As the determinants were transcribed, a cumulative list of preliminary group- ings was maintained to accommodate previously unmentioned responses as they emerged from the data. The groupings were highly specific, and were only per- mitted to represent multiple determinants when those were indistinguishable. For instance, many respondents mentioned refraining from drinking too much alcohol as a determinant of their health. Though articulation of this determinant varied sometimes by a word or a few words (or their order), their meaning was clearly identical. Therefore, \"Not drinking too much alcohol\" became one of the preliminary, specific groupings. The 660 groupings were then analyzed to find thematic similarities. This process resulted in the identification of 141 \"clusters\", each encompassing at least one but sometimes a number of specific groupings. Unlike the specific groupings, clusters were not held to the standard that they represent indistin- guishable elements; rather, clusters represented a set of groupings whose themes were comparable enough that they could feasibly be combined under one understandable rubric. For example, both of the specific groupings \"Not drinking too much alcohol\" and \"Drink a little alcohol each day\" were subse- quently combined within a cluster labeled \"Use and abuse of alcohol\". Because clusters represent determinants and preconditions having similar themes, they were by necessity non-directional. Responses which ultimately fell into the clus- ter \"nutrition\" included both \"I eat too much fat\" (i.e. health threatening) and \"1 eat lots of fruit and vegetables\" (i.e. health promotive). Finally, this cluster- ing process was reiterated with the clusters themselves. This final and third grouping procedure resulted in 10 macro-clusters which represented still larger summary categories of the clusters themselves. Each of the transcribed determinants and preconditions was then coded by the original interviewer as belonging to one and only one of the clusters. Our methods dictated that one interviewer spend time with respondents, making the interviewer the only person who truly understood the context and sentiment with which each of the determinants was identified. This made the use of mul- tiple coders or a subsequent inter-coder reliability analysis inappropriate. The data in the spreadsheet were imported into SPSS 8.0, and frequencies and crosstabulations were calculated by each subject variable to summarize the dis- tributions of determinants and preconditions themes. 98Social variation at the macro-cluster level was analyzed using t-tests for the sub- ject variables with two categories (i.e. gender and smoking status) and one-way ANOVAs for the subject variables with more than two categories (i.e. age and average neighborhood income). Since response frequency at the cluster level was by necessity relatively low, social variation at the cluster level was not ana- lyzed using tests of statistical significance. Rather, the percentage of respondents within each category mentioning a cluster at least once (e.g. what percentage of women mentioned the etiological theme smoking at least once?) was calculated. The differences in the categorical percentages between all categories of each subject variable were then calculated (and summed in the case of age and aver- age neighborhood income, which had three and four categories, respectively, and thus three and six' comparisons, respectively) to determine which clusters displayed the most variation with respect to each subject variable. RESULTS Response Of the 300 contact letters, 6 were returned as undeliverable. Of households which received the letter, 189 (64.3%) were reached by telephone. Because no action was requested in the contact letter, it is impossible to determine whether households which could not be reached would have participated if they had been contacted. Our net sample therefore included 189 households. Of these, 111 households made appointments to be interviewed. Due to 8 no-shows on the part of respondents, 103 interviews (54.5% of net sample) were carried out. Considering that people were asked for 20 minutes of time in their own homes, a final response rate of 54.5% of those reached by telephone was con- sidered reasonable. Reasons for non-response The reasons for non-participation given by the 78 persons who were reached by telephone but chose not to be interviewed are listed in Table 4.3.

There therefore remained a risk that certain demographic groupings, such as the unemployed or elderly, would be overrepresented in our sample. This risk was compounded by our inability to obtain a response rate or conduct non-response analyses among the 35.7% of the contact pool that did not receive the initial letter or could not by reached by telephone. Sample distribution was therefore assessed ex post facto through comparison with municipal and national population data. Table 4.4 shows the sample breakdown by gender, age, smoking and employ- ment status, and average neighborhood income. In 1997, 98% of Dutch house- holds had a telephone connection (KPN-PTT Telecom, 1998). Due to privacy and proprietary concerns, no official data is available in The Netherlands on the percentages of households with unlisted telephone numbers or their social dis- tribution. However, when compared with municipal and national data, no sta- tistically significant selection bias was found in the interview pool with respect to gender, age, smoking status or average neighborhood income. Table 4.5 shows the internal distribution of the sample. Chi-square tests revealed two significant deviations from expected values based on municipal and national data. Smokers were overrepresented among respondents from the lowest average neighbourhood income quartile. Also, men were overrepresented among respondents 65 years and older. 100Table 4.4 Response distribution by gender, age, smoking and employment status, and average neighborhood income Category Women Hen 15-39 years 40-64 years 65+ years Smokers Non-Smokers Employed Not employed Student (Univ. or School) Av.

The 141 clusters mandated 10 encompassing macro-clusters. Seven of the macro-clusters closely mirrored the questions themes: behavior, living-, occupational-, and natural environ- ments, social contact, genetic and care factors. Three macro-clusters, however, had to be developed to accommodate our data. The first, \"intrinsic mental and physical,\" encompasses inborn or inbred personal characteristics. Two examples of these are \"to be educated\" and \"to have good luck.\" A second macro-cluster labeled \"macro-environmental\" proved necessary to encapsulate meta-environ- mental factors. Examples are \"political stability in the Netherlands,\" and \"greater availability of health information these days.\" Finally, a tenth macro-cluster, \"Irrelevant,\" encompassed those responses not pertaining to the question at hand. Differences in inter-categorical response by macro-cluster Figures 4.1 -4.4 graphically represent the mean number of responses by category and corresponding p-values for the sociodemographic variables gender, age, smoking status, and average neighborhood income after response was adjusted to account for slight differences in categorical response frequency. Mean response calculations were based on all interview data except clusters which specifically denied the importance of a macro-cluster, such as \"Behavior Not Influential.\" Differences in inter-categorical response by cluster Table 4.6 shows the clusters displaying an average inter-categorical variation within each subject variable of greater than 10% per categorical comparison. Therefore, the table displays all clusters displaying more than 10% intercategori- cal variation for gender and smoking status, all clusters displaying more than 30% combined intercategorical variation for age, and all clusters displaying more than 60% combined intercategorical variation for average neighborhood income. Variation by gender Women in our sample mentioned determinants falling into the social contact macro-cluster significantly more frequently than men (p=.030).

Such themes include contact with nuclear family, with extended family, and with friends. Men focused on contact which implies less intimacy. Men were more likely than women to mention welcome iso- lation or time alone, contact with many different or non-specific type people, and relations with colleagues and clients. The latter cluster, though classified as occupational, arguably comprises social contact within a more public setting. In contrast, men identified aspects of the occupational environment more fre- quently than women (p=.269). Also, men were more likely than women to mention physical conditioas at work, occupational environment (not further specified), relations with colleagues and clients, type of work, safety at work, and work stress. The only occupa- tional theme mentioned more frequently by women than men was planning and organization of the occupational environment, a cluster which primarily encompassed responses relating to employers' allowances for flex-time and childcare. Thus, though the men in our sample focused more on etiological aspects of the occu- pational environment as whole, women's occupational response centered around the quality of the intersection between work and domestic environments. 106Frequency of response relating to the natural physical environment was virtually identical between men and women (p=.94O). Women in our sample, however, understood themselves as more responsible for the quality of the environment and thus for its impact on health than did men. Striking was the fact that women mentioned positive action for the natural environment more than three times as frequently as men. Male respondents concurred that the natural environment has important implications for health, but tended to see the maintenance of that environment as a product of civic regulation. Men mentioned the theme national and local policy, regulations, and engineering approximately three times as often as women. In summary, women in our sample ascribed more importance to determinants of health in the domestic and personal spheres, whereas men focused more on those in the civic and professional spheres. Women emphasized (more inti- mate) social contact, the domestic implications of occupational determinants, and personal responsibility for the natural environment. Men gave more atten- tion to the occupational environment, and located responsibility for environ- mental protection in the civic sector. Variation by age Age was significantly positively correlated with frequency of response related to professional care (p=.O15), and this trend was linear (15-39/40-64 p=.O69; 40-64/65+ p=.O36). At the cluster level, being older was positively correlated with mention of clusters emphasizing the importance of professional care for health, including care for prevention or risk management, at least minimal medical care very important, quality of physician's technical skill or knowledge, actively-selected physician, medication other than insulin, Green Cross--Friends of the Elderly, and assistance with or prescription of insulin. Interestingly, this pattern was inverted on all clusters which de-empha- sized the importance of medical care for health. Being younger was linearly associated with more frequent mention of never go to medical doctor for prevention, avoid doctors and/or medication, medical care not influential. In contrast to care-related response, being younger was significantly correlated with more frequent response relating to the natural physical environment (p=.033). Being younger was positively associated across all age categories with mention of positive action for the natural environment, general environmental pollution, general access to nature (no mention of home), natural environmental risks or threats, and local fauna or flora. Young and middle-aged respondents also mentioned natural physical environ- ment not influential less frequently than seniors, though this pattern was not linear. The only noticeable anomaly was senior respondents' higher likelihood of men- tioning national/local policy, regulations and engineering than the young or middle-aged. These results therefore strongly imply that, within our sample, youth was posi- 107tively correlated with ascribing more importance to aspects of the natural physi- cal environment as influential for personal health. Similarly, youth was significantly associated with more frequent mention of determinants in the occupational environment (p=.O32), with this trend also displaying linearity (15-39/40-64 p=.O73; 40-64/65+ p=.O48). Being younger was positively associated across all age categories with mention of relations with colleagues and clients, work stress, and aspects of school or university environments. Exceptional was financial compensation, which senior respondents were more likely to mention ihan middle-aged or younger respondents. This might have resulted from the fact that, due to widespread retirement by the age of 65 in The Netherlands, such compensation is likely to be the only tangible link which senior respon- dents maintain to their occupational environments, and is therefore more likely to be singled out as an occupational determinant of health. Lastly, being older was correlated with more frequent mention of intrinsic mental and physical characteristics as influencing personal health (p=.274). At the cluster level, age was positively correlated with mention of themes relating to physiological function and its interpretation, including physical function, feel good mentally or physically, natural disposition to do what I want or like, and ingrained expectations of self or life. In contrast, younger respondents focused little on physical function, and more on reactions to aspects of external daily life, including stress (not further specified), personal sense of balance and pacing, and sense of a meaningful life or higher goal. Interestingly, a second, more subtle difference emerged. Where respondents of all ages acknowledged the health etiological importance of inborn ways of reacting to physical reality, older respondents extended this, stressing the health etiological significance of habitually inbred psychic skills which allow one to not simply react to physical reality, but to do it effectively. Variation by smoking status Non-smokers mentioned determinants falling into the macro-cluster \"behavior\" more frequently than smokers (p=.238), and analysis at the cluster level revealed a consistent, supporting pattern. Non-smokers were more likely to mention 3 of 3 behavior-related clusters which displayed combined intercategorical variation of greater than 10%. These included rest and relaxation, physical exercise, nutrition. Non- smokers were also more likely than smokers to mention the behavioral themes personal care and hygiene, behavior (not further specified), and stay up to date. The single exception to non-smokers' greater response on behavioral clusters was that smokers were significantly more likely to mention smoking than non-smokers. In contrast, smokers named determinants relating to social contact more fre- quently than non-smokers (p=.276). At the cluster level, smokers were more 108likely to mention intellectual exchange, welcome isolation or time alone, and contact associated with non-professional caring for others. Three non-smokers, in contrast, mentioned social contact not influential, whereas none of the smokers did so. Though non-smokers were more likely to mention contact to maintain or enhance relations than smokers, this seems an exception to the general finding that smokers ascribe more health etiological importance to social contact than do non-smokers. When combined with other findings, the behavioral and social contact response indicates that smokers may understand their health to be dependent upon fac- tors less capable of being personally influenced than non-smokers. In addition to their higher social contact response, smokers mentioned intrinsic characteris- tics and macro-environmental factors more frequently than non-smokers; both of the latter macro-clusters are arguably even further from individual control than social contact. Non-smokers, in addition to attributing more importance to behavioral factors (with the notable exception of smoking), also mentioned aspects of care more frequently than smokers. Except in emergencies, profes- sional care is almost always initiated voluntarily; as such, it might be considered an etiological domain more subject to individual conscious influence than intrinsic or macro-environmental factors. Variation by average neighborhood income (ANI) In the natural environmental macro-cluster, the lower two ANI quartiles had a higher combined response percentage on the two clusters which emphasized public space: national/local policy, regulatioas, and engineering and general access to nature (no mention of home). The higher two ANI quartiles had a higher combined percentage on the clusters emphasizing private space: local fauna or flora and pollution in or near the living environment. This public-private dichotomy was repeated in the cluster response falling into the living environment macro-cluster. The lower ANI quar- tiles had a higher combined response percentage on only one cluster of the four relating to the living environment: pollution in or near the living environment. Perhaps not coincidenially, this was the only living environmental cluster with a combined intercategorical variation of greater than 60% which inherently focused on the potentially negative influence of the living environment. In contrast, the higher ANI quartiles had higher combined response on the three other living environ- mental clusters displaying a combined intercategorical variation greater than 60%, all of which could be construed as positive as well as negative. All of these, addi- tionally, reinforced die finding on the greater focus on private space among the higher ANI quartiles in the sense that they focused specifically on the home: qual- ity or size of shelter structure, access to nature from home, presence of basic necessities in home. Average combined response percentage was higher among the higher two ANI quartiles on those clusters which implied that genes and intrinsic characteristics 109benefit an individual: inherited predisposition for longevity, bom healthy (no mention of genetic strength), predisposed to give attention to health, and quality and extent of personal medical history. In contrast, combined response percentage was higher among the lower two ANI quartiles on those clusters which implied that genes and intrinsic characteristics place the individual at risk: other inherited diseases and risks, inherited risk of diabetes. This pattern is surprising and ironic, implying that the economically privileged may attribute their clearly-documented enhanced longevity and lower morbidity to their genes rather than to their better circumstances. Conversely, our evidence suggests that those with fewer material means may understand their genes as merely linked to risks and diseases: a inherited liability, rather than credit. The noticeably parabolic patterns displayed within the occupational environ- mental and intrinsic macro-clusters motivated us to test for variation between the middle two and extreme (highest and lowest) ANI quartiles. The middle ANI quartiles mentioned occupational determinants significantly more fre- quently than the highest and lowest ANI quartiles (p=.O42). At the cluster level, the combined percentage response among the middle ANI quartiles was higher on 3 of 3 occupational environmental clusters showing combined inter- categorical variation of at least 60%, including work stress, relations with colleagues and clients, and hours and shifts. This trend continued in occupational environmental clusters showing less variation, including to have an occupation or be employed, and mergers and reorganizations. The single exception was non-financial compensation. These findings support the hypothesis that middle-class respondents may be more concerned with employment and its connections to material determinants than are respondents coming from the highest and lowest ANI quartiles. DISCUSSION: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE Diverse ends of and means to health We found strong indications that women and smokers ascribe more importance to social contact, respectively, than men and non-smokers. Do these findings indicate that these social groups consider different resources to be requisite to ihe same notions of health? Or are notions of health themselves diverse, and thus dependent on different requisite resources? Perhaps the positive health experiences of women and smokers are more dependent upon social contact than those of men and non-smokers. More research is necessary which seeks to link health etiological understandings with operational health goals. The finding that health goals can be correlated with health etiological understandings would have two important implications. 110First, were correlations found to be predictable among diverse health-relevant groups, health professionals could tailor efforts to the most desired goals and agreeable means within those groups. This may in fact be the closest profes- sionals could come to promoting socially diverse, positive notions of health. Second, where different resources were correlated with the same definitions of health, new avenues of research would open up. In this study, respondents from the lower two ANI quartiles understood genetics as more pathogenic than those of the higher two ANI quartiles. If different understandings of how genes influence morbidity and mortality indeed exist, researchers might investigate whether socio-economic health gradients could in part be due to self-fulfilling prophesy. Perhaps poverty reinforces negative thinking about one's chances for longevity, resulting in small but chronic perturbations of the neuro-endocrine or -immune systems. Both biological pathways have been explored as potential links to the high morbidity and mortality associated with social class gradients (Dantzer and Kelley, 1989). Views of social determinants Our findings indicate that age, socio-economic status, and gender may be cor- related with the extent and kinds of influence which people attribute to social determinants of health. Being young was correlated with an etiological focus on the natural- and occupational- environments (both inherently social determi- nants themes), and being older with a similar focus on care and intrinsic char- acteristics (which are individually-operative). Also, the lower two ANI quartiles in our sample focused more on etiological factors in public space, whereas the higher two quartiles stressed aspects of private space. Are the young and less economically privileged more aware of- because perhaps more subject to - social determinants of health? If so, would they then be more open to health promotion activities which seek to influence these? Finally, though both gen- ders gave attention to social determinants of health men focused more on health etiological aspects of the civic and professional spheres, and women on those of the domestic and personal spheres. As such, would men be more open to policy and regulations as means to health, and women to community initia- tives and workplace support of families? Further research which explores links between health etiological understandings and relative faith in various health promoting activities could answer these questions. Such research might also stimulate consideration of a second poten- tial pathway by which socio-economic health gradients originate. Were it con- firmed that less economically privileged people are more aware of social deter- minants and supportive of their conditioning, this might justify investigating whether such persons are more exposed to aspects of public milieux, and that IIIthese are the cause of their poorer health. It is certainly clear that behavioral differences do not explain this gradient (Lantz, House, Lepkowski, Williams, Mero and Chen, 1998). In the Netherlands, similar to other Western societies, earners under the age of 25 have the lowest average income (SCP, 1998). If poverty is indeed associated with exposure to social determinants, it makes sense that we found that both youth and lower ANI respondents were more aware of such determinants. These findings would be consistent with the idea that long-term exposure to social determinants contributes to the well-docu- mented emergence of enhanced morbidity and mortality in early adulthood (Mackenbach and Verkleij, 1997) among those who remain poor despite get- ting older, and thus unable to shield themselves from such exposure with pri- vate resources. Tangibility, mediation and coping Our findings indicate that age and socio-economic background may be corre- lated with the extent to which one understands health to be more the product of tangible factors or of the active mental integration of those tangible factors. In our sample, being older was associated with greater focus on intrinsic deter- minants emphasizing the potential of psychic skills in mediating how one reacts to physical reality. Also, the two middle ANI quartiles displayed a greater focus on occupational determinants, which are relatively tangible, and less focus on intrinsic characteristics, which comprised a number of statements relating to the active mental integration of such tangible factors. These findings raise the ques- tion of the extent to which people understand health as originating in tangible or mentally-mediated factors (i.e. physical function or its interpretation, reality or one's attitude to it). Further research on social variation in such understand- ings could document relative public concurrence with what the WHO identifies as a central tenet of initiatives aimed at improving social dimensions of mental health: namely, that \"mental life is what makes people's lives valuable\" (WHO, 1981). On another level, such research could inform the discussion on how best to pursue the experience of health for the swelling percentages of Western populations now living with chronic disease. After all, chronic diseases are tan- gible; the experiences of illness (Radley, 1994), disability, and effective coping are not. The question is what proportion of the two etiological sides should define professional objectives. Influencing smokers' understandings The models of behavior change most broadly applied in anti-smoking initiatives have until now focused on enhancing knowledge of the risks of tobacco use, strengthening self-efficacy, and creating social environments supportive of ces- 112sation. Though our findings are not applicable to the full breadth of such inter- ventions, they do have potential implications for the ways in which smokers' knowledge can be enhanced. The smokers in our sample expressed more faith than non-smokers in the etiological influence of factors outside direct personal control, such as social contact, intrinsic characteristics, and macro-environmen- tal and less in behavior, the one factor exclusively within it. Interestingly, this finding is unlikely to reflect mere denial among smokers of the relevance of behavioral determinants: the smokers in our sample identified smoking as a determinant of health 25% more frequently than did non-smokers, and con- curred (20/22 smokers) that smoking had a negative effect on health. More research should be directed at the question of whether smokers, though aware of the risks of smoking, understand their health (positive or epidemio- logical) to be far more dependent upon things like intrinsic personal character- istics and social- and macro-environmental factors. Were this confirmed, profes- sionals would be able to target smokers' etiological understandings in a much more specific and efficient manner; epidemiological insights could be used to bring smokers' health etiological understandings into proportion with objective risks. If it is found that smokers stress intrinsic and environmental factors because these are requisite to smokers' unique notions (or valuing) of positive health, they can be encouraged to weigh this value against the effects of smok- ing to epidemiological health, which both scientific insights and smokers them- selves clearly identify as detrimental. CONCLUSION Though not statistically conclusive, our findings imply that gender, age, smok- ing status, and socio-economic status are each correlated with a tendency to ascribe greater importance to certain types of preconditions for and determi- nants of health. Many factors are involved in people's decisions to seek health information or medical care, change their behavior at home or work, partici- pate in community health initiatives, or support the development of health policy. Public understandings of what determines or allows for health represent the resources which people believe to be desirable, sensible, and efficient means to their own notions of health. As such, these understandings cannot fail to influence the public's desire to engage in, solicit, or support health promoting activities. Variation in such health etiological understandings would imply that when professionals attempt to learn from, build upon, or influence the public's health etiological understandings, they need to sensitize their efforts to the ways in which these understandings are unique within a given social context. 113114CHAPTER 5 REPRESENTATIONS OF PRECONDITIONS FOR AND DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE DUTCH PRESS This chapter was published as: Commers, MJ, Visser, G, De Leeuw, E (2000). Representations of preconditions for and determinants of health in the Dutch press. Health Promotion International 15(4), 321-332. INTRODUCTION Western newspapers have only in the last century filled a social mandate broad enough to include health and its origins (Hemels, 1990). Nonetheless, the Western press has become an influential provider of health information to the public. Daily newspapers devote substantial attention to health-related informa- tion (Atkin and Arkin, 1990), and clearly influence public beliefs about the eti- ology of health (Freimuth, Greenberg, DeWitt and Rose, Vreese, 1999). As purveyors of health information to mass audiences, newspapers both reflect and influence social consensus about health etiology. Newspaper content is therefore an important object of study for health promotion, which seeks an evolution of consensus toward more ecological notions of health and its origins. As spelled out by the Ottawa Charier (WHO, 1986) and Jakarta Declaration (WHO, 1997), the central tenets of health promotion include a focus on socio- structural determinants, equity, health behaviors, reduced medicalization, com- munity participation and empowerment, and professional mediation and advo- cacy for health. It seems logical, therefore, that the press could comprise a nat- ural ally to the moral and strategic vision of health promotion. Unfortunately, existing literature suggests that health information in the press may in fact be largely incongruent with the central tenets of health promotion. 115Media researchers now generally accept that \"the press does not tell people what to think, but does tell them what to think about\" (McCombs and Shaw, 1977). In this sense, the rise in media attention for health would seem to hail a growing demand among democratic electorates for putting health higher on public policy agendas, a process requisite to the success of policy-based health promotion (De Leeuw, 1993). Unfortunately, the press generally neglects social context in its health-related reporting (Karpf, 1988), particularly socioeconomic determinants of health (Kristiansen and Harding, 1984). To the extent it tells people what to think about, therefore, the press is unlikely to stimulate public support for greater socioeconomic equity in the interest of health. Though the press gives little general attention to health inequities, it also may implicitly reinforce them for at-risk groups through selective reporting and uneven circulation. For years, the American press considered HIV/AIDS unmar- ketable among heterosexuals and thus avoided the topic (Shuts, 1987; Kinsella, 1989). Though HIV/AIDS was later embraced, focus remained at first on \"deviant\" behaviors associated with HIV contraction (Albert, 1986), rather than on the biological pathways of transmission. Further, the press seems to neglect elderly women's health (Amos, 1986), contain content less accessible to people of lower socioeconomic status (Freimuth, 1990), and to be less in circulation among both groups (Karpf, 1988). Existing reports indicate that press involvement with behavioral determinants of health is little better. News gatekeepers have been shown to avoid taboo themes such as condom use (Atkin and Arkin, 1990). In the case of the \"pill scare,\" the risks of oral contraceptives were exaggerated by both professionals and the press, leading to unnecessary concern among the public (Wellings, 1986). Sadly, health-related themes such as suicide, substance abuse, and sociopathic mental illness in the news, as well as unrealistic images of youth or weight loss in advertising, are represented most widely in the print media. Neuendorf (1990) has pointed out that the ubiquitous presence of such themes over- whelms information in the media which supports healthy behaviors. Unlike health behaviors, medicine occupies a privileged position in the press (Karpf, 1988; Westwood and Westwood, 1999). Medicines are perceived as offer- ing hope (Van Trigt, 1995), and doctors as credible sources (Entwistle, 1995). Nonetheless, doctors have expressed dismay at frequent inaccuracies in reporting on medical topics (Elie and Schuyt, 1995). Also, media coverage of medicine seems to place disproportionate emphasis on medical technologies, including phar- maceuticals (Sneader, 1986). In the press, diis may be because technological inno- vation, which generally fits easily into one article and is always new to the reader, also makes good news (Kaiser, 1990). The representation of medicine in the press, in light of its inaccuracies and emphasis on technology, seems not to coincide with the health promotion focus on participatory primary care (WHO, 1978). 116Participation and empowerment also receive little support from the press. Generally, an issue is most newsworthy before consensus develops around it. The press, therefore, has a strong inherent incentive to relate conflicting infor- mation in regards to a particular health issue. Beharrell (1983) has pointed out that such conflicting messages can create apathy among readers rather than empower them to examine an issue in greater depth. Newspapers also make little mention of mobilizing information (e.g. community resources, prevention advice) which would allow readers to take action to improve the health-related factors discussed (Freimuth et al., 1984; Kristiansen and Harding, 1984). This may be particularly true of mobilizing information relevant at the community \u2014 rather than national or individual - level (Milio, 1986). Lastly, though not a question of content, mediation and advocacy by profes- sionals in the press has a potentially important impact on the extent to which the press reflects health promotion tenets. Mediation and advocacy for health in the press requires effective communication between journalists and health pro- fessionals (Freimuth et al., 1984; Ferwerda, 1991). Yet a number of barriers exist to such communication. Journalists are generally not trained to understand medical and scientific reports (Entwislle, 1995). Scientists are unschooled in media relations (Cameron, 1991; El-Qadari, 1997) and often reluctant to release information due to ethics (Winnubst, 1990) or publishing (Meyer, 1990) protocols. Finally, though journalists solicit topics and information among health scientists and practitioners, they focus disproportionately on find- ings which show positive rather than inconclusive results (Koren and Klein, 1991). Such evidence implies that health professionals and their ideas may be radically underrepresented in press content. Research objective Much existing literature suggests that health etiological information in the press may be incongruent with the central tenets of health promotion. We sought to investigate this question using the Dutch press as a case study. Some investiga- tors have published content-related research on the Dutch press and Valkenburg, 2000). To our knowledge, however, no comprehensive con- tent analysis has yet been published on representations of health etiology in the Dutch press. Such an analysis therefore comprises a unique stepping stone for health professionals seeking to interact with etiological assumptions among the public, or with their portrayal in the press. Additionally, we sought to investigate differences among the Dutch papers in their presentation of health etiological information. Such an objective may ini- tially seem superfluous. All but one of the largest five newspapers in The 117Netherlands are owned by one publisher, Pers Combinatie Nederland (PCM) (Metze, 1996). This could imply the lack of a financial motive among the papers to distinguish themselves from one another. Also, the Dutch press relies heavily on the Algemeen Nederlands Persburo (ANP), its main wire service (Kaiser, 1990), which may mean that most health articles come from the same sources. Nonetheless, Dutch newspapers have a strong history of diverse social and religious affiliation (Hemels, 1990). Also, Kaiser (1990) has asserted that the \"mass papers\" (Het Algemeen Dagblad and De Telegraaf) contain more edi- torial content and less policy-relevant content - and are read by a wider cross- section of the population - than the \"audience-targeted\" (kader) papers (Het NRC Handelsblad, de Volkskrant, and Trouw). METHODS Newspapers selected for analysis were the five Dutch newspapers with the largest daily circulation with no professed geographical affiliation. These include De Telegraaf (average daily circulation 816,000), Het Algemeen Dagblad In accordance with the \"constructed week method\" (Ryan, 1976), two readers perused all 48 editions of the five newspapers from May 1 1 through July 4, 1998. All articles assessed by both readers as fitting the selec- tion criteria listed in Table 5.1 were extracted. Article selection criteria were based on Blum's (1983) comprehensive model of health etiology because the intent was to include all articles relating to the real or potential preservation, improvement, or loss of human health. A codebook was developed containing a description of each variable, as well as its coding categories (for content variables) or measurement methods (continu- ous variables). Table 5.2 shows each variable, its underlying question, and related WHO health promotion tenets. The variable Determinant Theme of Article established sociopolitical-, physical- and personal environments, intrinsic factors (i.e. genetics), behavior, or health care delivery as the chief etiological theme of concern in an article (Blum, 1983). Only one code per article was assigned because pretesting indicated that articles' raison d'etre virtually always gave rise to or focused upon one central etiological theme. Etiological sub-messages within articles were not coded because to remove these from the defining con- text of the article often severely distorted their meaning (e.g. a determinant whose validity was critiqued in the article). Authority Identifying Determinant Theme assessed levels of professionalization and medicalization among sources claiming that a determinant theme was health-related. Since this variable concerned the motives of sources more than their responsibilities, representatives of for-profit 118Table 5.1 Criteria for Article Selection All articles and corresponding photographs were selected which met at least one of the following criteria: 1 The word \"health\" appeared in the article tide. 2 The word \"sickness\" or word \"disease\" or the specific name of a disease appeared in the article or article tide. 3 The article made explicit reference to activities consciously directed toward healing processes, including references to medical and alternative care activities, to hospitals, surgery, or similar. 4 The word \"medicine\" or word \"drug\" or the specific name of a therapeutic drug appeared in the article or article tide. 5 The theme of the article was clearly concerned with notions of healing, health, or restoration of personal mental or physical integri- ty, though the word health did not appear in the article or article tide. 6 The article concerned genetic counseling, manipulation, or conditions which are related to the length or quality of the lifecyde. 7 The ar\u00fcde contained explicit references to basic notions of hygiene with relation to persons, consumer products. 8 The article contained explicit references to issues of human safety or its preservation, including the preservation or promotion of environmental safety. Further, articles were excluded from selection which met at least one of die following criteria: 1 The health, healing, or sickness in concern referred to that of animals, plants, or social, economic, or political conditions rather than the health of human beings. 2 The article concerned an accident resulting in death, unless mention was made of medial or similar attempts to preserve life. 3 Obituaries. 4 Commercially sponsored information (including all advertisements). and non-profit (govemment/NGO) were coded separately. Agent- and Means of Determinant Conditioning recorded how and by whom, respectively, health-determin- ing factors were (or could be) positively conditioned to enhance health. These variables reveal whether individuals (via behavior), health- (via care) and non- health care professionals (via population-based projects or interventions), or the public- (via policy) or organizational (via company or NGO policy) sectors were portrayed as responsible for maintaining and improving health. Since these vari- ables focused on responsibility instead of motive, government and organizations (NGO/company) were coded separately. Breadth of population affected and Mediating populational attributes documented the size and attributes of populations whose health was identified as affected. These variables tested the extent to which an article's determinant theme was portrayed as socially operative and, respectively, which attributes conditioned exposure or impact. Story type established an article as news, editorial/reader opinion, or professional column. Text area and Graphic area, respectively, allowed comparisons in articles' form as well as their content. 119Table 5.2 Content Analysis Variables and Their Purpose Variable Underlying Question Related WHO Tenets' Determinant Theme of Article What dots th< article portray as determining health?

Sample size was estimated at 120 articles per newspaper where N=Ng=(Z,./2+Z, \u00ab)* (2O^)/([I-HQ)2, and where a=0.01, \u00df=0.10, assuming a=2(n-Hg) (Kirkwood, 1988). Each of the 600 sample articles was coded on all content variables by two inde- pendent raters. Cohen's (1960) kappa coefficient was then calculated for con- tent variables and Story type. The kappas ranged from .389 (54.3% agreement) to .546 (72.5% agreement), which was considered unacceptably low. Analysis revealed that two factors reduced agreement levels: 1) coders' tendency to \"read between the lines\" due to the causal logic under study, and 2) dependence of some variables on the coding of others (e.g. Agent often depended on Means). Therefore, coding categories were condensed to minimize potential ambiguity and all 600 articles were reread by the same raters together after two weeks. During recoding, the two raters were required to agree that any code assigned was accounted for by explicit references in article text. Though a consensual recoding method sacrifices evidence of reliability offered by initial inter-coder kappas, we believe it enhanced the validity of our findings by greatly reducing the tendency to \"read between the lines.\" Further, when the recoded consensual data were compared with initial coding data from both raters, the 14 (2 x 7 variables) kappas averaged 0.700. This indicates an acceptable level of agree- ment between the recoded and initial data and thus constitutes some evidence of both temporal and inter-rater reliability. All findings in this article are based on the recoded database. To test for content differences among the newspapers, chi-square analyses were performed on all content variables. To investigate inter-categorical variation among the content variables, adjusted standardized residuals were calculated; those with an absolute value greater than 2.0 were considered significant at the p=.05 level. Along with all data relevant to the content variables in our study, the results of these analyses are displayed in Table 5.3. Post hoc analyses were also conducted to characterize determinant themes encompassing large percent- ages of the sample articles (i.e. sociopolitical, intrinsic, health care delivery). Rank-order tests of significance for non-normally distributed data were carried out on the continuous form variables. Text- and Graphic Area (Cramer, 1998).

Sociopolitical factors comprised the determinant themes of almost half (49.2%) of the sample articles. The post hoc analyses revealed that such factors included policy and law (20.0%)', market availability of products and medicines (5.8%), medical or other health-related research (4.3%), and medical care organization or financing (3.0%)^. The latter three sociopolitical-environmental determinant types, combined with the 14.8% of all articles with determinant themes relating to health care deliv- ery, show that substantial attention was given to medically-related determinant themes within the sample. Post hoc analysis showed that 10% of all articles con- tained determinant themes related to the market-availability or development of medical products, techniques, instruments, or medicines. Thus, where the sample articles displayed medicalization, they also focused on the technological aspects of care. Of articles having determinant themes which impacted strictly individuals, far more of these related to fatalistic than behavioral factors. 18.0% of articles depicted intrinsic factors. Post hoc analyses indicated intrinsic factors included the presence of- or recover)' from - sickness, illness, disease, infection (7.0%) and injuries (4.3%). Notably, only 8.3% of all 600 sample articles contained behav- ioral factors as determinant themes, of which only 8 (1.3%) of these related to diet and nutrition, and another 14 (2.0%) to non-nutritional lifestyle factors, including exercise and smoking. Authority identifying determinant theme All articles cited at least one authority as linking a determinant theme to health, and 37.8% cited two. In general, sources with established authority were far more likely than those without it to identify an article's theme as influencing health. In 1 Due to the fact that only one value for each article was recorded for Determinant Theme of Article and Story Type, categories are quantified as percentages of all articles for these two variables. 2 Though the latter three categories may at first appear to be medical in nature, these were coded as sociopolitical determinant themes due to the fact that I) they are overwhelmingly activities funded by the public sector in The Netherlands and 2) do not constitute health care delivery procedures or methods. 124almost a third (32.4%)^ of all mentions, health professionals or scientific evidence (i.e. scientists) served this identifying function. Another 30.0% of authorities were governmental and non-profit representatives, as well as laws, policies, and regula- tions. Both findings imply that professionals have considerable news framing power and ample exposure within the Dutch press. Representatives of for-profit companies were cited in only 3.9% of cases, indicating that the authority to iden- tify health issues in the press is mostly located outside of the private sector. Means and agent of determinant conditioning A means and agent of improving health-impacting factors were provided at least once in 59.3% and 59.2% of articles, respectively, and twice in 21.5% and 21.7%. As with identifying authorities, the public and professional sectors took precedence in the means by which determining factors were portrayed as capa- ble of being conditioned so as to improve health. Policy and regulation were portrayed most frequently (24.7%) in this regard. National (22.3%) - rather than local or provincial (4.3%) \u2014 government was the agent portrayed as responsible for taking such measures in 74.2% of cases. Health professionals and researchers (25.6%), however, were the agents represented most fre- quently. Interestingly, medical care (18.8%) and research (10.1%) vastly out- weighed mentions of professionally-initiated health interventions (5.0%). Also, in contrast to these three means, which all emphasize the role of professional involvement in improving health, community-initiated health interventions were virtually absent (0.4%). Individual behaviors (17.1%), portrayed in 95.2% of cases as being adopted by individuals (19.6%), were attributed a less promi- nent place, as were non-governmental organizational policies (14.2%) and the organizations (18.1%) depicted as adopting them in 91.3% of cases. Breadth of population affected and mediating populational attributes All but two articles (99.7%) mentioned the breadth of at least one population affected by health-impacting factors, and 8.0% mentioned two. In contrast, 55.3% of articles identified at least one mediating attribute, and 19.0% con- tained two. Determinant themes were depicted as concerning individuals (46.4%) and populations (45.6%) in almost equal measure. This balance 3 For all content variables except Determinant Theme of Article and Storytype, up to two values for each article were recorded.Therefore, percentages for these variables represent the proportion of mentions rather than of total articles which are devoted to a particular variable category. 125between groups and individuals subject to an article's health-impacting factors approximates the proportion (52.2%) of articles with \"social determinant\" themes (i.e. sociopolitical or natural environments, which both inherently impact populations), and those (48.8%) containing \"individual determinant\" themes (i.e. intrinsic characteristics, health care delivery, behavior, and the pri- vate environment). However, articles were consistent in this regard only 65.0% of the time, indicating that \"social determinants\" were often not portrayed as operating at a social level; likewise, \"individual determinants\" were frequently portrayed as impacting populations. A final point of interest is that super- national populations represented over 10% of the populations identified. The most frequently-occurring populational attributes portrayed as mediating the influence of health determining factors were unassociated with structural inequity. Epidemiological and medical risk groups (30.9%) were most fre- quently mentioned, followed by age (21.7%) and gender (17.9%). Noticeably, all three of these factors coexist comfortably with a biomedical and clinical vision of health in which risks associated with these attributes (e.g. hyperten- sion, elderly, female) lead to medical conditions which can only be treated at the individual level through professional means. Attributes with health connota- tions exclusively subject to influence by individuals themselves or policy, how- ever, received far less representation. These included personal behavior (9.4%), socioeconomic status (6.1%) and ethnicity or race (1.8%). Story type The vast majority (90.5%) of sample articles were straight news. Editorials and staff reviews (4.7%), health columns (3.0%) and letters to the editor (1.8%) contributed the remainder. Differences among papers Though both Kaiser (1990) and Van Trigt (1995) distinguished between the content of mass and audience-targeted newspapers in The Netherlands, we found only marginal evidence to support their findings. As shown in Table 5.3, chi-square analyses indicated no significant differences in distribution among the five newspapers across any of the seven content variables. Though some of the adjusted standardized residuals indicated significant departures from variable means, there were far more similarities among the papers than differences. We believe, therefore, that our data do not indicate the presence of systematic dif- ferences in either the general focus of health-related articles between mass and audience-targeted newspapers or in the extent to which articles in both types of newspapers coincide with the central tenets of health promotion. 126A similar balance exists regarding quantity. As Table 5.4 shows, de Volkskrant and Het NRC Handelsblad had far fewer articles on health and therefore dedi- cated less average surface area per day to health than mass newspapers, though they published longer articles than did the mass newspapers and Trouw. This finding is accounted for by the fact that de Volkskrant and NRC Handelsblad, though they published fewer articles on and devoted less space to health daily, packed more information into each article they did publish. Modified Sheffe's tests (Marascuilo and McSweeney, 1977) established that de Volkskrant and NRC Handelsblad articles in our sample contained significantly (p<.05) more references per article to means and agents of determinant conditioning than did those published in De Telegraaf and Algemeen Dagblad. Also, de Volkskrant provided significantly (p<.05) more information per article on mediating pop- ulational attributes than did any other paper. DISCUSSION Policy and socio-structural determinants of health It is encouraging from a health promotion standpoint thai the newspapers in our sample devoted consistent attention to socially-operative determinant themes and to policy and government as a means and agent of positively condi- tioning etiological factors. However, it is surprising that \"social\" or \"individual\" determinant themes were frequently portrayed as concerning individuals and populations, respectively. This finding suggests that the press' portrayal of health etiology does not reflect the unambiguous logic implied by the dichoto- mous professional conceptualization of \"social-\" and \"individual determinants.\" Post hoc analysis indicated that readers are often presented with health care deliv- ery as a social determinant, and sociopolitical etiology as an individual experi- ence. It has been pointed out that findings such as these may help professionals anticipate public perception of policymaking efforts (McCombs, 1977; Pfund, 1981; Canel, 1997) and can therefore assist them in advocating for healthy public policy (Haslam, 1986). Over 10% of articles applied to super-national populations. This finding indi- cates that the press may stimulate thinking among the Dutch public in regards to important etiological themes such as climate change (Epstein, 1999; McMichael, Bolin, Costanza, Daily et al., 1999). The press may indeed be a nat- ural ally at least to what Kickbusch and De Leeuw (1999) have distinguished as transnational and global health promotion. 127Equity ..,. It is nonetheless striking that despite the focus on socio-structural determinants, the mediation of vulnerability by socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity was mentioned in very few articles. This is unfortunate, since discussion of struc- tural inequity is requisite to an understanding of what might be called chronic social determinants of health (e.g. income disparity -- see Wilkinson, 1997). We use \"chronic\" to mean those social determinants of health which are sys- temic and persist over time. Though the Dutch press does cover social determi- nants, post hoc analysis of determinant themes showed that the focus remained on acute (e.g. pollution of Dutch beaches, dangers of nuclear transport contain- ers) rather than on chronic social determinants. This may account for the absence of information we found on those populational attributes which medi- ate vulnerability to chronic social determinants of health, though this cannot be empirically demonstrated. Amelioration of the neglect of equity issues in the press is far from an easy task. Klaidman (1990), however, has argued that health professionals can make progress by convincing influential people to raise awareness of neglected health issues and supporting the trend among Western newspapers toward employing health editors. Primary care and reduced medicalization We found that the Dutch press is indeed quite medicalized. Health care delivery was a frequently occurring determinant theme, and depicted as an important means and agent of improving health determining factors. Further, epidemio- logically and medically-assessed risk made up almost a third of all mentions of mediating populational attributes. While medicalization may be generally unde- sirable from a health promotion standpoint, it is particularly the focus within the Dutch press on technological aspects of care identified in the post hoc analy- ses which seems ill-supportive of the health promotion objective of reorienting health services toward primary care. Behavioral determinants of health and public participation Articles' strong focus on established governmental and medical means of improving health contrasted strongly with the sparse extent to which behavior and participation were represented. Diet, exercise, and smoking constituted the etiological focus of only a tiny fraction of articles in our sample. Though behavior was cited as a way of positively conditioning health determining fac- tors, this primarily regarded curative rather than preventive action. There was very little mention of professionally-initiated interventions requiring individuals to change health-related behaviors, or of community- or publicly- initiated 128health activities. In short, we found that the essence of behavioral and commu- nity-based health promotion goes largely unrepresented in the Dutch press. Combs (1979) has pointed out that health education interventions can be useful where they fill gaps in press coverage. Our findings would imply the impor- tance of such interventions to promote the etiological relevance of behavior and skills development, since the press clearly does not. Mediation and advocacy by professionals Our findings affirm that health professionals, especially physicians and scien- tists, receive substantial attention in the Dutch press. Health professionals are often the source connecting an article's theme with health, and are often repre- sented as the agent responsible for the improvement of health. However, the means which professionals are depicted as employing to improve etiological factors are far more often medically- than informationally or environmentally based. The copious attention given to epidemiological and medical risk groups, though not particularly desirable from a health promotion standpoint, is nonetheless a sign of the extensive exposure given to health-scientific knowl- edge. Taken together, our results imply that health practitioners have ample opportunity to mediate and advocate for health in the press. Cameron (1991) has asserted that health promoters must make use of ihe opportunities they clearly have for influencing the framing and content of health-related news. This might include getting to know journalists and learning how to reduce health promotion messages to \"the equivalent of a bumper sticker\" (Meyer, 1990). It also means that health professionals need to build on their established credentials as authorities (Van Trigt, 1995) and create news- worthy events (Haslam, 1986), especially those which could provide adaptive role-modeling examples for the public (McAlister, 1995). Our findings would support Kaiser's (1990) argument that it is possible to reach and influence newspapers or wire-services directly. CONCLUSION Our findings support the conclusion that newspaper coverage of health etiology in The Netherlands is incongruent in many important ways with the central tenets of health promotion. The findings therefore support media advocates' contention that engagement of the press remains a necessity in order to allow health promoters to take advantage of opportunities - and effectively address 129gaps - in the medium. If the Dutch press proves to be representative, health promotion clearly has little to lose and much to gain by advocating a broader representation of its philosophy in the news material people read and rely upon daily. 130CHAPTER 6 WHAT DO THE DUTCH BELIEVE DETERMINES THEIR HEALTH? INTRODUCTION Health: a varied priority The Dutch are similar to most other Western populations in that they hold health to be a very high priority (NIPO, 1995). Research in Europe over the past 30 years has shown clearly, however, that though health is a widely accepted personal and public value, the meaning of health is understood differ- ently by various sociodemographic groups. In her seminal study, Herzlich (1973) showed that the way a person defines health is partly a function of socioeconomic status (SES). Subsequent work has confirmed the relationship of SES with conceptualizations of health (Cornwell, 1984; D'Houtaud and Field, 1984, Calnan, 1990), and other work has been done showing that how one sees health is also partially a function of gender (Blaxter, 1990) and age (Van der Heuvel, 1989; Williams, 1990). Though health is clearly a diverse priority, at least one overarching insight has emerged from qualitative work on varying conceptualizations of health. Health seems to be a notion which encompasses both \"positive\" aspects, such as equi- librium, Wellness, and integrity, as well as \"clinical\" aspects, such as the absence of pain, functional limitation, and disease. In this paper, we will refer to these two dimensions as \"positive health\" and \"clinical health.\" 131Salutogenesis and health etiology Aaron Antonovsky (1979, 1987) coined the term \"salutogenesis\" to describe the process by which health is created and sustained. He contrasted this notion with pathogenesis, the primary focus of public health and medicine during the 20'^ Century, which is the process by which health is threatened or destroyed. The \"pathogenic model,\" Antonovsky observed, assumes that health (i.e. homeostasis) is the normal state of the human being; its epistemological focus is therefore upon how health is damaged by disease and injury or threatened by related risk factors. Building on insights from thermodynamics, Antonovsky proposed an alternative \"salutogenic model.\" He asserted that a thermodynamic understanding of living systems sooner indicates that decay and death (i.e. entropy) \u2014 rather than health - are the states to which organisms most naturally proceed in the absence of countermeasures. Clinical health, he asserted, is in fact a precarious, fragile quality which is possessed only to the extent to which an individual (or in some cases a social group) has access to a very wide variety of requisite, health-producing resources. Much subsequent empirical research focusing on the factors which can impact susceptibility, such as exercise (Leon, Connett, Jacobs and Rauramaa, 1987), coping (Sagy and Antonovsky, 1990; Cohen, Tyrrell and Smith, 1991; Maier, Watkins and Fleshner, 1994), and income (Davey Smith, Neaton and Stamler, 1996), has testified to the validity of Antonovsky's broad conceptualization of health etiology. Theoretical 1995; Charhon, 1996; Zeyer, 1997; Toissaint and Schneider, 1998) has also shown that the latest thermodynamic insights (e.g. the application of complexity theory) are consistent with Antonovsky's original salutogenic model. In explicating the salutogenic model, Antonovsky implied that the etiology of clinical health encompasses a far broader range of factors than was ever fully acknowledged within the earlier pathogenic paradigm. Because Antonovsky stressed the emergent, disequilibrious way in which it emerged from those fac- tors, his understanding of health has sometimes been labeled \"positive health\" (Charlton and White, 1995). However, it is important to keep in mind that Antonovsky's notion of health bears little if no relation to positive health in the tradition of Herzlich. Antonovsky (1979:52) himself eschewed notions of health which go beyond the empirically operationalizable, and even took pains to distance himself from the expression, \"positive health.\" Therefore, though his salutogenic model has much to say about the etiology of clinical health, it would seem to offer little assistance regarding the etiology of positive health. Nonetheless, when one looks closely at notions of positive health described in the literature, it is rare to find an example of positive health which does not pre- suppose the presence of the main phenomena (e.g. absence of unwanted pain and progressive somatic disease) associated with clinical health. Equilibrium, happi- ness, reserve of strength, the ability to cope or fulfill one's social position: for 132most people most of the time, all of these examples of positive health are at least partially dependent upon the absence of pain and progressive biological disease. Clearly, at least one part of the etiology of positive health is clinical health. As such, theories of etiology which have a bearing on clinical health, such as Antonovsky's salutogenic model, also have some significance for posi- tive health. This implies that the etiology of positive health is at least as broad as that of clinical health, if not far broader. The significance of Antonovsky's expansion of our understanding of health eti- ology for the present study now becomes clear. By expanding the professional understanding of health etiology, Antonovsky also implicitly showed that many of the things which determine health are factors to which \"lay\" individuals or groups have either partial or exclusive access. As such, the salutogenic model implies the indispensable role of lay participation for the protection and promo- tion of both clinical and positive health. Participation theory has a long tradition extending at least as far back as the Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO). In that document, a testament to the ideals and influence of Andrija Stampar (Seipp, 1987), the WHO made its first reference to participation as, \"informed opinion and active cooperation on the part of the public,\" and claimed that these two tenets \"are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people\" (WHO, 1947). In this paper, we will employ the WHO's concise and elegant phrasing in the former quote as our definition of participation. People's understandings of health etiology Unfortunately, professionals thusfar possess little or no empirical information about the extent to which people's understandings of the determinants of health represent the full spectrum implied by Antonovsky's salutogenic model. Illich (1976) is one of many authors who have pointed to the influence of patho- genic biomedical reasoning upon public etiological assumptions. There have been important efforts to assess people's accounts of disease (and even recov- ery) causation (Currer Stacey, 1986; Skelton and Croyle, 1991; Petrie and Weinman, 1997). These efforts, however, have almost exclusively retained a pathogenic perspective because they focused either on the perceived etiology of specific (types of) morbidity or recovery from it. Other efforts have been at least partially focused on lay perceptions of salutogenic factors, but have remained limited to specific issues, such as health inequalities (Blaxter, 1997). An important step toward facilitating participation in the interest of health is to fill the gap in research directed at assessing the full breadth and texture of people's understandings of salutogenic factors. There are at least three areas in which such research would comprise a valuable contribution. 133It is widely accepted among health professionals that provision of health etio- logical information (i.e. raising of risk awareness at the cognitive level) is most often not enough to influence health related behavior. In recent years, much attention has therefore been devoted to affective (Bandura, 1986) and structural (WHO, 1997) influences upon behavior in the belief that support at these levels is requisite to the adoption of healthy behaviors. However, the justifiable, current trend toward devoting ever greater attention to affective and structural influences upon behavior may neglect at least two important factors at the cognitive level which potentially confound the impact of health-related messages directed at effecting behavior change. 1 a Little scientific attention has been given to the potential influence of the vast quantities of preexisting health etiological information which people possess either through experience (ontogenesis) and instinct (phylogene- sis) (see Azzone, 1997, for a discussion of ontogenetic and phylogenetic learning). It is given little credence that such preexisting health etiological information may compete with (by contrast) relatively weak exposure to health education messages, most of which are transmitted intermittently and over a mere fraction of the life span. Consider, for instance, the potential for competition between two health promotive factors: income and physical activity. Throughout human history, the securing of the material resources necessary for survival on a daily basis has been the most immediate and thus most pressing determinant of health. In devel- oped nations, where many individuals have access to far more material resources than are necessary for physical survival, it is easy to forget how profoundly an awareness of the relevance of material resources for health may be woven into the fabric of our psychology. It is, however, not hard to imagine that people may choose quite rationally to neglect any factor relevant to health largely in the long-term, such as physical activity, diet, or smoking, in the interest of attending to factors relevant on both an immediate and long-term basis, such as the securing of income. At multi- ple levels, people may in fact be well aware of what science has docu- mented in the last forty years: income is on average an even more pow- erful predictor of longevity than physical activity. Ii may therefore be quite understandable that people overcompensate, and choose the rewards of working long hours at sedentary jobs to the virtual exclusion of the rewards gleaned through regular physical activity. As this example illustrates, a broad awareness of health etiology has the potential to inter- fere with the conviction that \"healthy\" behaviors should have top priority in daily life. Research on people's understandings of salutogenic health etiology can contribute to professional knowledge by identifying cogni- tive assumptions, whether of phylogenetic or ontogenetic origin, which may compete with the messages we transmit to people in hopes of changing behavior. However, the assessment of such potential competi- 134tion implies that such research should not only focus on the breadth of those understandings, but also on the relative importance which people ascribe to them. 1 b The assertion that the provision of etiological information is not enough to influence behavior also presumes that people would not take conscious risks with their clinical health for the sake of their positive health. It is quite imaginable that, especially among those who possess clinical health in the here and now, some would choose to adopt behaviors in the inter- est of their immediate positive health which may come at the expense of their long-term clinical health. One potential example is a conscious choice to smoke tobacco in the interest of the ability to feel one is coping, which some people say they do (McCormick, Brooks-Gunn, Shorter, Holmes, Wallace and Heagarty, 1990). Another is the choice of a terminal cancer patient to refuse a prolonged and painful fight in the hospital in favor of a more peaceful \u2014 albeit more rapid \u2014 death at home. The question in both instances is whether a choice in the interest of posi- tive health may imply the validity of behaviors which are not enhancing of clinical health (i.e. ascribing importance to etiological factors associ- ated with positive rather than clinical health). Thus any research on people's health etiological understandings should attempt to link the nature of those understandings to notions of positive or clinical health. 2 Professionals in public health, environmental health, health promotion and related fields have increasingly acknowledged the importance of social deter- minants of health. This has led to a focus on the potential for influencing such social determinants with such instruments as policy or multisectoral col- laboration. Professionals, however, need support for their efforts to condition such broad etiological factors and expand people's control over them. Formulating and implementing public and organizational policy in the inter- est of health requires at a minimum the involvement of both government and the non-governmental sector. In democratic countries, however, public policy requires broad public support before it is proposed, adopted, and enforced. Multisectoral action requires that non-health professionals working in a broad range of organizations place health high on the agenda. Thus there is the necessity of participation among both the voting public and orga- nizational decisionmakers for the influencing of structural factors. This neces- sity, however, raises the question of whether the public acknowledges or ascribes much importance to broad etiological factors as determining of their health. For example, do people ascribe as much importance to the factors they can influence through direct participation (i.e. diet, social contact) as they do to factors they can only hope to influence through democratic partic- ipation (i.e. air pollution, genetic policy)? 1353 To the extent that empirical results demonstrate that people's understandings of health etiology are less broad than the range of factors implied by the salutogenic model, such research would allow professionals to more effi- ciently expand people's etiological awareness. Professionals could empower people with information by supplementing preexisting etiological under- standings where they are lacking (i.e. filling the gaps). For example, if people believe that health is the product of fate, this belief can be supple- mented with an understanding of the importance of behavioral and social determinants. The raising of awareness in this way promises to result in an improved foundation for direct and democratic participation. Also, if such research were coupled to sociodemographic characteristics, it would allow professionals to target efforts toward ameliorating specific awareness deficits within different sociodemographic groups. Research objectives We conducted the present study with five objectives in mind. Figure 6.1 shows the research model developed on the basis of these study objectives and shows specifically by means of a corresponding numeral how each objective is repre- sented in the model. The objectives of the present study were: 1 to quantitatively test previous qualitative findings that the Dutch public has a breadth of health etiological understandings consistent with Antonovsky's salutogenic model; 2 to investigate whether the Dutch ascribe significantly differing levels of importance to various types of health etiological factors; 3 to document whether agreement with positive and clinical dimensions of health correlate with the ascribing of importance to unique sets of health eti- ological factors; 4 to assess whether ascribing importance to certain types of health etiological factors is predictive of the level of faith placed in the general strategies most commonly employed by professionals to promote health; and 5 to measure whether or not variables (four sociodemographic and one behav- ioral) are predictive of the level of importance ascribed to various types of etiological factors, the amount of agreement with various definitions of health, and the level of faith placed in the general strategies employed by professionals to promote health. 136Sotiodemo graphic/ Behavioral Variables Gender SES Domestic Status Smoking Status(5)Etio logical Understandings (3) (5) (5)Behavior Social Contact Household Work-Related PUWK Intrinsic (1.2)Faith in Professional Strategies for Health Curative Medical Care Structural Health Policy Prevention and Health Education Community-Based Initiatives Figure 6.1 Research Model METHODS The development of a survey instrument for this study required operationalizing health definitions, health etiological factors, and professionally implemented health promoting activities. The seminal work of Herzlich (1973) and oilier more recent research (Stainton-Rogers, 1991) has revealed a rough dichotomy between positive and clinical definitions of health. We therefore built upon this research to develop indices of both types of definitions. The positive health index contained items such as equilibrium (Herzlich, 1973), a reserve of strength (Herzlich, 1973; Stainton-Rogers, 1991), and being able to do what one wants to do (Dubos, 1965:463-4). Clinical health focused on the absence of morbidity such as pain, disease, physical limitation, and the need for medical attention. Despite a broad search of the literature, we were unable to identify any exten- sive qualitative work or validated survey instruments pertaining to the full breadth of people's health etiological understandings. We therefore conducted an exten- sive round of preparatory qualitative research (Commers and De Leeuw, 2001) comprised of 103 in-depth individual interviews. Respondents identified 141 137distinct factors as influencing their health, indicating that their understandings of health etiology were consistent with the full breadth of Antonovsky's saluto- genic model. These 141 factors could be reduced to six general etiological themes. Six indices of health etiological understandings were therefore included in items used to operationalize these six indices in the present study were taken directly from the 141 factors identified in the preparatory qualitative research. This was done to maximize the chance that respondents would find these items both understandable and sensible. Finally, to operationalize professionally implemented health promoting activi- ties, we built upon the long-standing distinction between curative and preven- tive services (MacDonald, 1998), but supplemented this with insights from health education and promotion, which have emphasized the importance of \"bottom-up\" community-based organizing for health (Minkler and Wallerstein, 1997) as well as structural health policy (Milio, 1986; WHO, 1997). Thus, we included four indices in regard: \"curative\", \"preventive\", \"community- based\", and \"structural\" (i.e. policy-based). As Figure 6.1 also shows, the final survey instrument therefore included 12 indices: 2 types of health definitions, 6 types of health etiological factors, and 4 types of professional strategies for pro- tecting and promoting health. Each index was measured using five items, result- ing in 60 survey questions. All indices and corresponding items are shown in Appendix 6.A. Index score was defined as the sum of a respondent's answers to the five items comprised by that index. Hypotheses Our study was explorative due to the fact that there is little literature which describes relationships among people's sociodemographic and behavioral char- acteristics, health definitions, etiological understandings, and faith in profes- sional health promotive strategies. However, aside from the more general hypothesis that these characteristics and perceptions would be predictive of one another, we hypothesized three specific relationships: 1 We reasoned that a) to the extent that respondents agreed with a clinical def- inition of health, they would also ascribe importance to those etiological fac- tors which have received the most epidemiological attention: behavior, public environmental factors, and intrinsic factors; and that b) the association between agreement with a clinical definition of health and behavioral, public environmental, and intrinsic factors would be stronger than the association between agreement with a clinical definition of health and ascription of importance to etiological factors which have received relatively less epidemi- ological attention: social contact, household factors, and work-related factors. 1382 Conversely, we hypothesized that a) to the extent that respondents agreed with a positive definition of health, they would also ascribe importance to those etiological factors which have received the least epidemiological atten- tion: social contact, household factors, and work-related factors; and that b) the association between agreement with a positive definition of health and social contact, household factors, and work-related factors would be stronger than the association between agreement with a positive definition of health and ascription of importance to etiological factors which have received rela- tively more epidemiological attention: behavioral, public environmental, and intrinsic factors. 3 We reasoned that to the extent that respondents ascribed importance to those etiological factors which have received the most epidemiological attention as being related to the risk of disease or death (i.e. behavior, public environ- mental factors, and intrinsic factors), they would also ascribe importance to those professional health promotive strategies most focused on curing or pre- venting disease or prolonging life: curative care and prevention. Conversely, we hypothesized that to the extent that respondents ascribed importance to those etiological factors which have received the least epidemiological atten- tion as being related in specific ways to the risk of disease or death (i.e. social contact, household factors, and work-related factors), they would also ascribe importance to those professional health promotive strategies con- cerned with lowering group susceptibility and enhancing quality of life through populational - rather than individual - intervention: structural health policy and community-based activities. In addition to the 60 items relating to respondents' perceptions, we measured four sociodemographic background characteristics (gender, age, SES, domestic status) and one behavioral characteristic (smoking status) of each respondent. We measured these background variables because 1) all variables were linked to different understandings of health etiology in the preparatory qualitative research; 2) all variables except smoking status are well-documented in Dutch census data and are therefore accessible to policy or mass educational interven- tion; 3) each category within each variable comprises a significant percentage of the Dutch population and is thus relevant from a structural health policy per- spective. Beyond these three general criteria, there were additional factors sup- porting selection of each of these background characteristics. Gender, age, and SES have been shown to correlate with differing conceptualizations of health (see Introduction) and with use of and access to health services (Lewin Epstein, 1991; Green and Pope, 1999). It is thus reasonable to assume that these charac- teristics might influence what people believe determines health and how much faith they place in various types of professionally implemented health promo- tive activities. Domestic status (RIVM, 1997) is known to correlate strongly with health status, especially among men. We hypothesized that this may be due to a different awareness of health producing resources, especially those in 139the household or relating to social contact. Smoking status is the most impor- tant behavioral cause of morbidity and premature mortality in The Netherlands as elsewhere. Smokers are therefore regularly targeted by health education cam- paigns and even health policy as a group at elevated risk. Information about dif- ferences in the etiological understandings of smokers and non-smokers is there- fore potentially very relevant for the design of anti-smoking messages and the structural influencing (i.e. higher taxation) of smoking behavior. Since we were interested in obtaining results relevant for the development of national health policy in The Netherlands, our intended study population was the entire Dutch public (N = approx. 15.8 million). The contact pool was obtained by securing a database of 1779 residential telephone numbers from KPN Telecom, the Dutch national telephone company. 98% of Dutch residents have access to a non-cellular residential telephone (KPN Telecom, 1998). Our sample did not include cellular telephone numbers or \"unlisted\" telephone numbers. Each of the 1779 households was sent a personalized letter explaining the general nature of the study and requesting participation by any member of that household 1 5 years or older. A first round of telephone interviews at time t^ was conducted subsequent to the summer vacation period, from late August through the end of September, 1999. Total response in the first round was 50.8% (903 interviews/1 779 households receiving a contact letter). Reasons given for non-participation were: no interest (60.6%), self-perception of being too old (1 1.9%), no time (8.2%), other reasons (19.3%). Our intended method of analysis was the iden- tification of a structural equation model to describe relationships between and among the sociodemographic variables and indices. Since this requires dealing with measurement error through the estimation of a measurement model, it was necessary to conduct a second round of interviews among a significant por- tion of the sample. A second round of interviews was therefore conducted at least six weeks later, at time t, among 592 individuals randomly selected from those who had participated at t(, and had agreed to be interviewed at t,. The second round was ended prematurely because sufficient data had been obtained, with 95.1% of those contacted during the second round participating. As Table 6.1 shows, the sample we obtained did deviate significantly in some regards from the Dutch population as a whole when compared on the basis of the five sociodemographic variables under study. Our sample included disproportion- ately high numbers of respondents of middle-age (40-64 years), of higher SES, and of smokers. In contrast, the sample included disproportionately low numbers of respondents of younger age (15-39 years). The sample was statistically repre- sentative of the Dutch population in terms of gender and domestic status. 140Table 6.1 Sample Sociodemographic Characteristics Lives = ** = p<0.00l 2 Expected values based on dara from the Centrul B\u00fcro voor de Suosoek (CBS, 1 3 Expected values based on daa from die Central B\u00fcro voor de Starjsbek (CBS, 1999c) 4 Expected values based on expectation of SO'i above and below median SES measure 5 Expected values based on data from die Foundation for Public Health and Smoking (Strvoro, 1999) 6 Expected values bastd on data from the Centraal B\u00fcro voor de Stamrjek (CBS, 1999c) Data were first screened for completeness of response and normality. Interview responses at either t^ or t, with more than one missing value within any of the 1 2 indices were not included in the analysis. In cases where there was one missing value per index, the missing value was replaced by a value obtained through regression-based imputation, with the remainder of item responses in the index as predictors. Normality of response was assessed using a standard test of multivariate kurtosis. Since this test was significant, the x^-statistic as well as tests of parameters of the LISREL have to be subjected to further com- parisons. It is suggested that parameters may be considered significant at the 5% level whenever the I t-statisticl >2.0. The x^-statistic can be corrected by divid- 141ing it by the coefficient of relative multivariate kurtosis (Browne, 1984). Since the latter led to very similar conclusions to the uncorrected X* statistic, only the uncorrected x* will be reported upon here. After all incomplete data were removed, 384 complete responses (91.6%) remained from the 419 respondents interviewed at both t^ and t,. Among those only interviewed at t^ only, 388 responses (74.8%) of the 519 interviews were complete. In total, therefore, estimation of the structural equation model was based on complete responses obtained from 772 respondents. Because only a portion of the respondents interviewed at t^ were also inter- viewed at tj, our data gathering procedures resulted in two values per item for the persons interviewed at both tg and t,, and only one value per item for those interviewed at t^ only. The data were analyzed by performing a multisample analysis, with a covariance matrix for the sample with both measurements and a quasi-covariance matrix for the sample with single measurements (Bollen, 1989). In the quasi-covariance matrix, variances and covariances involving the second measurement were set to 1 and 0 respectively. The structural equation model corresponding with the research model in Figure 6.1 was then estimated on those data using LISREL 8.30 (J\u00f6reskog and S\u00f6rbom, 1993). LISREL 8.30 provides a number of statistics to evaluate the fit of the structural equation model. The primary statistic is the x~; in this case x~\u2014996.18 (df=697, p<0.001). Adjusting the degrees of freedom to account for the use of a quasi covariance matrix (Bollen, 1989; J\u00f6reskog and S\u00f6rbom, 1988), we obtain 415 degrees of freedom and p<0.001. Although this result is significant, the ratio X\"/df ~ 2-4 indicates a reasonable fit. This is supported by a number of alternative goodness-of-fit statistics that are not sensitive to sample size. It is generally recommended that the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) be below 0.05, the Tucher-Lewis Index (TLI) be above 0.90, and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) also be above 0.90 (Hair, Anderson, Tatham and Black, 1995; Homburg and Baumgartner, 1995). For the structural equation model, we obtained RMSEA=0.04, TLI=0.91, and CFI=0.93, supporting the model's fit. (RMSEA, TLI, and CFI have also been adjusted to account for the use of the quasi covariance matrix following the example of Bollen (1989)). 142Table 6.2 Mean Scores on Health Definitions, Health Determinant Types, and Health Promotive Strategies Variable Health Definitions Positive Clinical Health Determinant Types Behavior Social Contact Household Work Public Intrinsic Health Promotive Strategies Curative Health Definition.

RESULTS Mean results Table 6.2 shows the average response values on all sociodemographic and index variables included in the structural equation model. Respondents agreed signifi- cantly (p<0.05) more with the positive definition of health (x =21.34; range 0-30 where 20=\"much agreement\" and 25=\"very much agreement\") than with the clinical definition of health (x =20.57). This finding suggests that health is a concept which for the Dutch public clearly encompasses positive as well as clinical phenomena, with slightly more emphasis given to the positive aspects. 143Interestingly, respondents seemed to ascribe more importance to health etiolog- ical factor types in direct proportion to the extent to which those etiological factors are subject to personal control. Respondents ascribed the most etiological importance to behavior (x = 19.64; range 0-30 where 20=\"much importance\" and 15=\"some importance\"), followed by social contact (x = 17.73), household (x = 17.21), work (x = 16.59), public (x = 15.30), and intrinsic (x = 15.28) fac- tors. All differences among the health etiological factor types were significant (p<0.05) with the exception of public and intrinsic factors, which respondents found virtually equally important. Finally, of the four types of health promotive efforts, respondents ascribed most faith in curative care (x =20.33; range 0-30 where 20=\"much (x = 17.93) and traditional prevention (x = 16.60), in which they placed moderate faith. Respondents placed least faith in community-based ini- tiatives (x = 13.65). All differences in the levels of faith respondents placed in the four health promotive efforts were significant (p<0.05). Structural equation model The estimates of the path coefficients of the complete structural equation model are presented in Table 6.3. The model constitutes the foundation for the remainder of the results section. The path coefficients are considered signifi- cantly different from zero when the t value is greater than 1.96 (i.e. p<0.05). I Sociodemographic differences The largest sociodemographic differences identified in the study were based on gender. Women agreed significantly more than men with both positive and clin- ical definitions of health and ascribed significantly more importance to all six health etiological types and all four health promotive efforts than did men. Such a consistent pattern suggests that women devote more attention to health and its etiology than do men. This is consistent with other findings which have asserted that health is a terrain of traditional interest to women, as reflected for instance by the extensive coverage of health issues in women's magazines (Amos, 1986). Smokers in our sample ascribed significantly less importance to behavior as a health determinant than smokers. This finding is consistent with some earlier work showing that smokers estimate the positive impact of cessation on health as less profound than do non-smokers (Dijkstra, Bakker and De Vries, 1997). Smokers, in contrast, found work significantly more important than non-smok- ers. Finally, smokers agreed significantly more than non-smokers with a clinical definition of health, whereas there was no difference among the two groups in regards to agreement with the positive definition of health. 144Table 6.3 Total Effect Path Estimates and ' Clinical Positive Household Work Public Intrinsic Behavior Social Contact fa/rt m AtaA* ftw\u00bb Estimate Path Estimate t-value Path Estimate t-value Path Estimate t-value Path Estimate t-value Path Estimate t-value WK f ft>m Path Estimate t-value -0.07 0.02 1.32 0.01 0.07Corresponding t-values 0.29 2.77Age was significantly positively related to greater agreement with a positive def- inition of health, with no difference for clinical health. Age was also signifi- cantly positively associated with ascribing more importance to household and social contact determinants. These latter two relationships are consistent with other literature asserting the same (Brearley, 1978). In contrast, age was signifi- cantly inversely associated with ascribing more importance to work-related and intrinsic determinants. We found no significant relationship between socioeconomic status and agree- ment with the two health definitions. This finding is at odds with the signifi- cant body of earlier qualitative work which has found SES predictive of how one defines health (Herzlich, 1973; Calnan, 1987). SES also was found to have no significant influence upon the health etiological factor types. However, in terms of health promotive efforts, lower SES was significantly associated with higher faith in both traditional prevention and community-based efforts. Domestic status was not significantly associated with either health definition nor with any of the six health etiological factor types. However, domestic status was highly explanatory for the level of faith which respondents placed in health promotive efforts. People living with partner and/or other family members placed significantly more faith in structural, community-based, and especially in preventive efforts than did those living without a partner and/or other family members. 2 Health definitions and determinant types The relationships between the health definitions and the health determinant types form a pattern which is consistent with our first and second hypotheses: that how one defines health influences what one perceives to determine it. We had hypothesized (hypothesis la) that agreement with a clinical definition of health would be positively related to ascribing importance to behavioral (e.g. diet and exercise), public environmental (e.g. pollution), and intrinsic (e.g. genes and age) etiological factors. As Table 6.4 shows, all of these relationships were found to be both positive and statistically significant. We had further hypothesized (hypothesis 1 b) that agreement with a clinical definition of health would be more positively related to ascribing importance to behavior, public environmental and intrinsic factors than it would to ascribing importance to household (e.g. humidity and ventilation), work-related (e.g. income and work conditions), and social contact (e.g. with partner and family) factors. As Table 6.4 shows, of the nine comparisons among structural paths, seven were statisti- cally significant at 5% and consistent with this hypothesis and two were consis- tent with the hypothesis but not significant. Conversely, we had hypothesized (hypothesis 2a) that agreement with a posi- tive definition of health would be positively related to ascribing importance to 146Table 6.4 Relations Between Agreement with Health Definitions and Ascribed Importance to Health Determinant Types ' ' , .

As Table 6.4 shows, all of these relationships were found to be both positive and statistically significant. We had further hypothesized (hypothesis 2b) that agreement with a positive definition of health would be more positively related to ascribing importance to social contact, household, and work-related factors than it would to ascribing importance to behavior, public environmental, and intrinsic factors. As Table 6.4 shows, of the nine comparisons among structural paths, seven dif- fered significantly at 5% and were consistent with this hypothesis, and one was consistent with the hypothesis but did not differ significantly. The single excep- tion was that agreement with a positive definition of health was significantly more positively associated with ascription of importance to behavioral factors than with ascription of importance to work-related factors. - . 3 Determinant types and health promotive efforts The relationships between health determinant types and faith in health promo- tive efforts were only partially consistent with our hypothesis (hypothesis 3) that ascribing importance to etiological types commonly researched by epidemi- ologists as related to the risk of disease and death, including behavioral, public environmental, and intrinsic factors, would be positively associated with ascrib- ing faith in curative medical care and prevention (e.g. vaccinations). Ascribing importance to public environmental and intrinsic factors was significantly posi- 147lively associated with faith in curative medical care and prevention, though ascribing importance to behavior was not significantly related to either type of health promotive strategy. Our hypothesis that ascribing importance to etiologi- cal types which have received far less epidemiological attention as related to the risk of disease and death (i.e. social contact, household factors, and work- related factors) would be positively related to ascribing faith in suuctural health policy and community-based activities was also only partially confirmed. Ascribing importance to work-related factors was significantly positively associ- ated with faith in both structural health policy and community-based activities. Ascribing importance to social contact was positively associated with placing faith in community-based strategies, but negatively associated with placing faith in structural health policy. Finally, ascribing importance to household factors was not significantly related in either direction to faith in either structural health policy or community-based strategies. Viewed more generally, the relationships between health determinants and health promotive efforts do seem to comprise a clear pattern understandable within the theoretical framework of locus-of-control theory (Rotter, 1966). Earlier in this section, we noted that respondents ascribed the most importance to behavioral health determinants, followed by social contact, household, work public, and intrinsic characteristics. We suggested that this order may simply reflect the perceived influenceability of the health determinant types. Building on this reasoning, it was fascinating to find that ascription of importance to those determinant types which are least influenceable by people themselves cor- related positively with the amount of faith respondents expressed in all types of health promotive efforts we measured. As Table 6.5 shows, in 11 of 1 2 cases, we found significant positive associa- tions among the least influenceable determinant types and faith in the four health promotive efforts. In contrast, in 10 of 12 cases, we found either nega- tive or no significant associations between ascribing importance to most influ- enceable determinant types and faith in the four health promotive efforts. One of the two cases not fitting the pattern was a significant positive association between the perceived importance of social contact determinants and faith in community-based efforts, which seems quite a logical connection considering the highly interactive, social nature of community initiatives. The bulk of the results therefore implies a locus-of-control notion: respondents who ascribed importance to less influenceable determinants also placed generally greater faith in health promotive efforts initiated and facilitated by professionals. 148Table 6.5 Relations between Ascribed Importance of Determinant Types and Faith in Health Promotive Efforts Health Determinants Groups' More Individually Influenceable Less Individually InfluenceableIndices Behavior Social Contact Household Work Public Intrinsicfaith in Health Promotive Efforts' Curative Preventive CommunityBased Structural 1 Structural path estimates: + = positive (p<0.05); ~ = zero; - = negative (p<0.05) 2 Groupings of health determinant indices DISCUSSION Do the Dutch concur with one of the central insights of Antonovsky's salutogenic model: namely, that health is the product of many types of health-producing resources? Our results indicate that they do. Though there were differences in the amount of importance ascribed to the six health etiological factors, respondents said on average that all of these had \"some\" or \"much\" influence on health. Might this broad etiological awareness make people less sensitive to messages on behavioral risk? We found that behavior was ascribed the most etiological importance of any of the six factors. Clearly, this implies that an awareness of other health etiological factors does not preclude awareness of the influence of behavior. However, our findings also plainly indicate that professional attempts to convince people that risk avoidant behaviors are important for health are interpreted within a broad context of preexisting health etiological understand- ings. As noted earlier, some of these preexisting etiological understandings may be phylogenetic in origin and thus have substantial intrinsic authority. Though people may recognize the significance of behavior for health, their clear aware- ness of the broader context may nonetheless help to explain why risk avoidance information often seems inadequate to stimulate behavior change. Considering the potential implications, more research seems warranted on the basis of our results into whether and what kinds of specific preexisting health etiological beliefs compete with health education messages focused on the importance of behaviors such as exercise, diet, and not smoking. \u00ab49Is it possible that people continue to perform behaviors risky to clinical health because they see these as enhancing of positive health? Our results show that there clearly are differences in the things which people see as leading to posi- tive and clinical health. Respondents' ascription of importance to social contact as an etiological factor was associated far more significantly with their agree- ment with a positive than clinical definition of health. We interpret this as evi- dence that social contact is understood by the respondents in our sample as more requisite to the attainment of positive than clinical health goals. In con- trast, ascription of importance to intrinsic determinants was very significantly positively associated with agreement with a clinical definition of health and not at all with agreement with the positive definition of health. It seems quite plau- sible, therefore, that intrinsic determinants are seen as relevant to clinical but not positive health status. Nonetheless, we found that the same five behavioral factors (i.e. the behavior index) were understood as etiologically significant for both the positive and clinical dimensions of health. In other words, eating a high fruit and vegetable diet, not smoking, and getting enough exercise (three items in our behavior index) are considered to be as requisite to positive health as they are to clinical health. Considering that our definitions of health were based on extensive qualitative work, our results indicate that when people adopt risky behaviors, they do not consider their risky actions to be in the interest of any goal which falls within the clinical or positive health concepts as we have measured them. As noted above, respondents seemed to ascribe importance to etiological factors in the measure to which we would estimate these factors as influenceable by individuals themselves. Behavior, social contact, and household determinants (in that order) were seen as most relevant. In contrast, work-related, public, and intrinsic determinants (in that order) were ascribed less etiological significance. These last three (examples of which are income, transportation safety, and genetics) are, of course, seen by professionals as highly relevant to health status. Though we cannot confirm that respondents indeed perceive behavior to be more subject to personal influence than intrinsic determinants, the pattern is quite consistent from an analytical perspective. Can professionals rely upon public support when they try to improve the fac- tors which are least under people's direct control (i.e. work, public, and intrin- sic)? People who placed more importance on work, public, and intrinsic deter- minants also placed more faith in all types of professional health promotive strategies. This indicates that informing people about these less individually- influenceable determinants may increase the mandate and support for profes- sional interventions to improve them. However, at the same time, the finding supports the notion that people may not currently believe that they themselves have much control over such factors. Actions to raise awareness of less individ- ually-influenceable factors, while they may enhance the professional mandate 150mentioned above, may therefore also work against people's sense of empower- ment in regards to possibilities to participate in the improvement of such fac- tors. One example of this notion relates to the impact of the rapidly expanding professional understanding of genetically-correlated health risks, and the poten- tial disempowering effects of communicating such risks to the public. Considering that ascribing importance to less-individually-influenceable factors was positively associated with placing faith in almost all types of professional strategies, our results indicate that merely expanding awareness of less-individually- influenceable factors may lead above all to greater learned helplessness. This would be unfortunate, because even less individually-influenceable factors are also things which participation (albeit in a democratic rather than direct sense) is partially capable of influencing. If professionals hope to empower people to take more control over less individually-influenceable factors, our results indi- cate the importance of demonstrating pathways for participation as well as merely rais- ing awareness of the determinants themselves. Are sociodemographic characteristics and/or smoking behavior relevant to the pre- sent study? Yes, our results indicate that such characteristics do play a role in how people define health, picture its etiology, and perceive efforts to improve health. Our findings would support the hypothesis that health is a theme of more con- cern to women than to men. This suggests that women may, in a general sense, be far more \"aware\" of health and health etiology and raises the question of whether women do or could participate in the interest of their own health or the health of family members more than men. The broadly consistent nature of our findings on the relevance of gender clearly indicates the need for more com- parative research on the impact of gender upon health etiological beliefs. Smokers in our study ascribed significantly less importance to behavioral deter- minants than non-smokers. However, this association is made more difficult to explain by two other findings in the study. First, smokers in the study agreed significantly more than non-smokers with a clinical definition of health, and agreement with that definition was positively associated with ascription of importance to behavior. Second, smoking status had no statistically significant association with agreement with the positive health definition. When taken together, therefore, the three findings imply that the significantly lower impor- tance ascribed by smokers to behavior cannot be explained by the idea that smokers value either 1) their clinical health less, or 2) their positive health more, than non-smokers. Our results therefore indicate that some factor not included in our research model is behind smokers' ascription of less importance to the etiological signif- icance of behavior than non-smokers. Of course, one explanation is that smok- ers are simply less aware than non-smokers of the importance of behavior for 151health and that this lack of awareness not surprisingly correlates with a higher prevalence of smoking. This seems unlikely, however, considering that due to anti-smoking campaigns and warning labels on tobacco products, at least a rudimentary awareness of the ill effects of smoking tobacco upon clinical health is almost universal in The Netherlands, as elsewhere. However, cognitive disso- nance theory (Festinger, 1957), which describes the well-documented tendency of individuals to explain circumstances in ways which reflect most favorably upon themselves, may offer a more promising explanation for the seemingly contradictory findings. Smokers, quite simply, may place less importance on behavior in order to avoid the feelings of fear and guilt which would likely be associated with admitting that a factor they know to be health threatening also has a significant influence on health. Non-smokers, on the other hand, may be responding to a psychological incentive to perceive behavior as etiologically sig- nificant because that etiological significance is directly proportional to the bene- fit they could expect to reap from their non-smoking behavior. If an explana- tion based on cognitive dissonance theory is accurate, therefore, our results may in fact demonstrate cognitive dissonance as one of the pathways by which smokers bolster themselves psychologically against anti-smoking messages. Further, our findings arguably provide some ethical justification for finding ways to help smokers surmount the psychological barriers to cessation. In our study, smokers themselves said they agreed with a clinical definition of health even more than did non-smokers. Therefore, our findings would be consistent with the notion that professionals do have an ethical mandate to influence smokers psychologically toward smoking cessation, since such cessation is clearly epidemiologically linked with the goals smokers themselves associate with health. It seems clear, nonetheless, that the use of fear messages regarding the negative consequences of smoking is far from a sufficient strategy to fill this mandate (Leventhal, 1970; Witte, 1992). Though the difference was not significant, age was positively associated with placing importance on clinical health. In contrast, age was negatively related to ascribing importance to intrinsic etiological factors. Yet we also found that agreement with a clinical definition of health was strongly positively associated with ascribing importance to intrinsic factors. How could this be the case? We believe that our model may have excluded an important etiological factor type which older people understand to be important for clinical health. In our preparatory qualitative research, older people referred to ingrained (slowly learned and practiced) psychological coping abilities for mediating somatic limi- tations. Such coping abilities, however, in contrast to raw intrinsic factors like age or genetic inheritance, fit easily into both the behavioral and in some cases the social contact indices. Therefore, due to the need to create a valid model with highly distinguishable indices, we did not include such coping abilities in our operationalization of \"intrinsic\" factors within this study. On the basis of 152our previous work, we believe that older age may be associated with the belief that coping mentally with one's biological givens, rather than the biological givens themselves, is what counts in the long run. If this hypothesis were cor- rect, it would explain our seemingly paradoxical findings. Also, evidence sup- porting this hypothesis would affirm Antonovsky's contention that the life-long development of the sense-of-coherence is what predicts one's ability to cope with ubiquitous Stressors and thus to be healthy. Despite its lower income disparity and better social welfare system than coun- tries such as the UK or USA, much evidence shows the clear and persistent presence of a strong social gradient in health status in The Netherlands (Mackenbach and Verkleij, 1997). Yet no one has yet provided a definitive answer to why the social gradient persists worldwide (Syme, 1998). Our results do not provide any insights which can shed light on the causes of the social gradient in a positive sense. However, our results do imply that the social gra- dient in The Netherlands is most likely not the result of differences in how people of above- or below-median SES conceptualize health or ascribe impor- tance to general aspects of health etiology. We did find that people of below- median SES placed more faith in preventive and community-based health pro- motive efforts. However, during an intensive 20-year effort to address socioeco- nomic inequities in health status, special attention has been given to lower SES groups in The Netherlands. These efforts have primarily consisted of prevention and community-based efforts. Thus, our findings may merely mirror the expo- sure of these efforts among people of lower SES. What is the generalizability of this study? In light of the absence of other stud- ies of this nature internationally, it is difficult to estimate the generalizability of our findings outside The Netherlands. Within The Netherlands, we believe that our results are representative of opinions among the native-born majority Dutch population. However, we would question whether our findings are representa- tive of the opinions of people of non-Western origin (1 st or 2nd generation) who, while they constitute only 5.6% of the national Dutch population (CBS, 1999a), comprise more than 20% of the population in some Dutch cities. Due to the fact that the national Dutch population includes such a small percentage of persons of foreign origin, including land-of-origin or ethnic variables in our research model would have required significant oversampling among such minorities. We therefore chose not to include racial or ethnic status among the sociodemographic variables in this study. However, we did show that sociode- mographic characteristics are important predictors for how people conceptualize health, ascribe importance to determinants, and perceive the relevance of health promotive strategies. In doing so, we hope that this study can be a stimulus to further research on the potentially important influence of other sociodemo- graphic characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, upon conceptualizations of health, health etiology, and the value of health promotive strategies. 153CONCLUSION The salutogenic model of health etiology developed by Aaron Antonovsky implies that a very broad range of factors is relevant to clinical health status. This would suggest that positive health, being partially dependent in many cases upon clinical health, is theoretically the product of an equally if not more complex array of etiological factors. Many of the etiological factors identified by the salu- togenic model are under the partial control of individuals themselves. Thus health professionals have a mandate to work toward a public with an \"informed opinion\" which can \"actively cooperate\" in the interest of its own health. In this study, we have attempted to support professionals' ability to communicate with the public and thereby work toward a more informed and active public by assessing the nature and extent of the Dutch public's understandings of health etiological factors. To maximize the usefulness of the results, we have attempted to couple these understandings to sociodemographic and behavioral characteris- tics, definitions of health itself, and the faith people place in the strategies most commonly employed by professionals to promote health. The study revealed that the Dutch do have a broad understanding of health etiology. Further, the Dutch seem to ascribe importance to determinants to the extent that those determinants are perceived to be under individual rather than social or public control. Consistent with Rotter's aging but hardly passe notion of Locus of Control, we found evidence that the ascription of importance to health determinants less amenable to individual control is strongly correlated with the extent to which professional health promotive strategies are seen as valuable. Finally, we showed thai sociodemographic variables have an important bearing on perceptions of health determinants and professional health promotive strategies. 154Appendix 6.A: Categories, Indices, and Items Category Index Health Definitions Positive Clinical Edological UnderstandingsBehavior Social Contact Household Factors Work-Rel.

Antonovsky argued that over the course of the 20''' Century, health etiological theory became intensely focused on pathogens (i.e. viruses, bacteria, parasites, accidents, etc.) at the expense of devoting attention to what makes people susceptible to those pathogens. On both social and natural scientific grounds, Antonovsky argued the importance of reintegrating within modern health etiological theory a concern with human susceptibility and the factors which influence that susceptibility. By rediscovering the theme of sus- ceptibility, Antonovsky's work - and a wide body of empirical evidence sup- porting it \u2014 gave modem credibility to the age-old notion that a vast array of socially- and individually-operative factors determines human health. In doing so, Antonovsky's ideas provided an important theoretical footing for the field of health promotion (Kickbusch, 1996). This is especially true for one of health promotion's central tenets: that public policy is an important determi- nant of health (WHO, 1986; Milio, 1986; Walt, 1994). By revealing that a wide range of factors influences health, Antonovsky's salutogenic model showed the relevance of any intervention strategy which could condition those factors and thereby produce desired health outcomes. For instance, by theorizing the importance of socially-operative determinants such as gender discrimination. 157economic inequities, and exposure to pollutants, the salutogenic model showed the relevance of social, economic, and environmental policy. Similarly, by depicting the impact of individually-operative determinants such as age and behavior, the model also reaffirmed the relevance of health care and health edu- cation policy. Winston Churchill (1943) once poignantly noted, \"We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\" Public policy, as much a social institu- tion as the buildings in which it is adopted, is ultimately a product of the soci- ety from which it emerges. It then reshapes that society, and the cycle contin- ues. Though public policy may be far from \"democratic\" or representative at times, history testifies to the notion that the general public can and often does influence its direction, success, and sustainability. As much as Antonovsky's salutogenic model reveals a broad array of immediate determinants and the sec- ondary influence of policy, therefore, it also asserts the potential relevance of the general public itself to the nature and success with which health is pursued by society as a whole. To assert the relevance of the general public to public policy, however, is not to define an ideal role for the citizenry in that regard. In practice, public policy must be conceived, adopted, implemented, and evaluated by policy actors in some relation to the general public. In Western democracies, policies must at a minimum be perceived as relatively effective and democratic in order to main- tain their legitimacy among the voting public. In situations where the effective- ness and democratic support of policies are non-conflictual or complementary, this remains unproblematic. However, situations do arise in which effectiveness and democratic support are - at least temporarily - at odds. In this case, ques- tions of \"leadership\" or \"unrepresentativeness\" \u2014 depending on one's view \u2014 come to the fore. Due to their personal and professional backgrounds, policy actors perceive conflict and complementarity between the effectiveness and democratic support of policies differently. Therefore, they develop different ideas about the ideal role of the general public with respect to public policy formulation. Some of these ideas form part of an overarching philosophy of the role of the state in relation to the public; others are situation or issue specific. This paper presents a study designed to examine prevailing ideas among policy actors regarding the ideal role for the general public in the formulation of health-related public policy in The Netherlands. In order to place the discussion in context, we first consider two visions of policy fonnulation. The first is that of John Kingdon, who conceives a minimal role for the general public in the fonnulation of public policy. Since Kingdon's model emerges from empirical research, we use his vision as a theoretical baseline (i.e. a description presumed to be largely accurate). Against this baseline we contrast a second, more idealis- tic vision of public policy fonnulation based on the tenets of health promotion 158and the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. This second vision is more idealistic in the sense that it asserts the value of public participation in policy formulation regardless of the empirical status quo. The presentation of the two visions culmi- nates in our research objective. Namely, against the backdrop of Kingdom's vision, we sought to assess the legitimacy of the health promotion vision for the formulation of health-related public policy in The Netherlands. An empirical perspective on policy formulation In his work on the formulation of national health care and transportation policy in the United States, John Kingdon (1995) set out to identify the factors which contribute to the formulation of public policy. By talking to hundreds of people central or tangential to the policy development processes surrounding trans- portation and health care in the United States, Kingdon came to the conclusion that two predecision processes, \"agenda-setting\" and \"alternative specification,\" define the content of public policy. Agenda-setting, the first predecision process, is the process by which those issues which can or will be addressed by public policy are identified (i.e. by which the \"governmental agenda\" is set). Alternative specification, the second predecision process, is the process by which the specific content of policy is conceived and selected. Kingdon asserted that the agenda-setting and alternative specification processes are dependent upon three \"families of expectations for high or low agenda prominence\" or \"streams.\" In Kingdon's view, agenda-setting is the product of developments within what he labels the \"problems\" and \"politics\" streams. Alternative specification, on the other hand, is performed within what Kingdon calls the \"policies\" stream. By characterizing the internal dynamics of each stream, Kingdon portrays a world in which involvement of the general public in the policy development process is marginal at best, and negligible at worst. Kingdon's \"problems\" stream relates to the harms which are the potential or actual targets of new or renewed policies. Within this stream, Kingdon first makes a distinction between \"conditions\" and \"problems.\" \"Conditions\" are undesirable phenomena, but those which are not perceived as appropriate or possible objects of policy intervention. \"Problems,\" on the other hand, are unde- sirable phenomena which have come to be perceived as both possible and legiti- mate objects of policy intervention. The process by which conditions come to be seen as problems, which Kingdon calls \"problem recognition,\" is subject to many influences. Some of the influences which Kingdon cites as relevant to problem recognition are changing indicators, focusing events, budgets, and both formal and informal feedback on existing programs. Noticeably, these influences are largely independent of the sentiment of the general public. It is only in terms of informal feedback on existing policies in which Kingdon sees a limited - and 159exclusively reactive rather than proactive - role for the general public. As such, Kingdon's description of the problems stream portrays a very limited role for the general public in setting the governmental agenda under normal conditions. Kingdon's \"politics\" stream relates primarily to groups of people and their rela- tive importance for policy. Three groups are portrayed as particularly relevant to the agenda setting process. First, Kingdon stresses the importance of the \"national mood.\" Though the \"national mood\" sounds quite populist, the term is far from synonymous with mass opinion (as represented by polls, for exam- ple). Rather, the national mood refers much more to the direction which the most active interest groups in society would like to take at a given moment. Second, Kingdon points to government officials. Elected officials, among other \"visible participants\", have enormous influence over agenda setting. However, civil servants and other largely \"hidden participants\" also wield considerable power over the problems selected for policy intervention and the policy alterna- tives considered for adoption. Finally, after the national mood and government officials, organized political forces and interests play a role, though these are portrayed as largely reactive rather than proactive. Within the political stream, therefore, many actors \u2014 including harbingers of the national mood, hidden participants, and special interests - preempt the general public's influence over the governmental agenda. Though the public is portrayed by Kingdon as having some influence politically by means of the vote and its - albeit rather ambigu- ous - role in shaping the national mood, both mechanisms are largely reactive. Within the political stream, then, Kingdon also conceives a marginal level of public influence over the governmental agenda. Kingdon's \"policy\" stream primarily relates to the origin, distillation, and advo- cacy of ideas for alternative policy solutions to existing problems. A ready supply of such potential policy solutions is requisite to policy innovation. When an opportunity for policy formulation occurs, only the ideas which have already gained informal acceptance within relevant circles will be included in formal policy proposals. Ideas for potential policy solutions to problems emerge out of a \"primordial soup\" of discussions among academics, consultants, policymakers, and others. These ideas survive on the basis of both their merits and how and to what extent they are promoted by interest groups. Though the feasibility of a potential policy solution is judged at least partly on whether it will be accept- able to the public, a number of other factors play a role. Kingdon asserts that the expertise, status, power, and financial backing of advocates for a potential policy solution are relevant. Further, the compatibility of a potential policy solution with existing budgetary resources and the prevailing political forces (however in tune with the public these forces may be) influence the chances for adoption of a given potential policy solution. Therefore, Kingdon's descrip- tion of the policies stream, and thus of the process of alternative specification, is one which allocates merely a minimal and reactive role to the general public. 160A health promotion perspective on policy formulation A central tenet of health promotion theory is that policy formulation will lead to more democratically-supported and effective policy when it constitutes a process of consensus building involving not only various policy actors but also the general public (WHO, 1986, 1997). Kingdon's model fits comfortably into the traditional belief that policy formulation involves merely a range of policy actors, including politicians, health professionals, and civil servants. In the health promotion conceptualization, however, policy for health is seen within the context of the field's central goal of \"enabling individuals and communities to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health.\" (WHO/EURO, 1986). Also, to the extent that the public agrees with the basic ends and means of health policy, some voices within the health pro- motion tradition have asserted, that policy will enjoy more democratic support and will therefore be more effective, efficient, and sustainable (De Leeuw, 1989b; Labonte and Edwards, 1995). Thus, from both the normative standpoint that democratic support for policy should be as broad as possible and the tech- nical position that policy can be most effective if it connects with the aspira- tions and values of the general public, health promotion theory has supported public participation in policy formulation. In The Theory of Communicative Action, J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1984) presents a framework for the achieving of consensus which is highly applicable to the health promotion vision of policy formulation. The health promotion vision would demand consensus building between policy actors and the general public in the formulation of public policy. Habermas' theory constitutes an attempt to detail an ideal communicative basis for reaching consensus. Health promotion theorists advocate public participation in policy formulation because it would presumably make policy more democratic and effective. The Theory of Communicative Action was developed with the explicit objective of depicting ideal speech situations which according to Habermas presuppose open-handed- ness and egalitarianism, both of which are democratic ideals. Habermas also states unambiguously that his theory conceptualizes an ideal model of commu- nication which leads to the consensus requisite to coordinated action. The theory therefore relates closely to the question of effectiveness. For all three rea- sons, therefore, Habermas' theory provides a uniquely appropriate framework for conceptualizing an ideal communication schema for policy actors and the general public seeking to formulate policies which are both democratically-sup- ported and effective. Habermas asserts that when actors communicate in the interest of achieving consensus for action, their communication inherently contains \"validity claims\" at three levels. The first is called the \"objective\" or \"cognitive\" level and relates to that which is capable of being described as true or false. This level thus 161relates to science and therefore to questions of the predictability of die influ- ence of given factors on health (i.e. to the identity of \"determinants of health\"). The second is the \"intersubjective\" or \"normative\" level and relates to that which is capable of being discussed in terms of right and wrong. This level relates to law and therefore, for instance, to the assertion of a given health objective or method (i.e. the influencing of one or more determinants of health) as morally responsible or repugnant. The third and final level is called the \"subjective\" or \"aesthetic\" and relates to that which is capable of being questioned only in terms of whether it is sincere or insincere. This level relates to art and, more concretely, to individual, cultural, or sub-cultural tastes and preferences. The aesthetic level therefore concerns the question of the desirabil- ity of a given health goal or means to achieving it. Ideally, communication between policy actors and the general public must occur at all three of Habermas' theoretical levels in order to create the binding force between the two parties which is necessary for coordinated action. At the cognitive level, policy actors and die public must communicate about the scien- tific validity of the assertion that certain policies or behaviors will lead to desired health outcomes. Though in practice policy actors more often seek to improve public knowledge than the other way around, they cannot do so effi- ciently without knowing where the scientific knowledge of the public is suffi- cient and where it is lacking. Hence the need for communication. At the nor- mative level, policy actors and the public must communicate about the morality of policies or behaviors relevant to health. Though many means to health may be scientifically sound, both the public and policy actors (e.g. ethicists) may wish to express moral concerns regarding the adoption of those means. Finally, at the aesthetic level, policy actors and the public must communicate about the personal, cultural, or sub-cultural desirability of policies which are health pro- ducing. Some policy options, even if scientifically viable and moral acceptable, will prove to be undesirable to the individual or population whose health is in question. By negotiating the validity of claims at all three levels, policy actors and the public develop the consensus requisite to the formulation of policy which is democratically supported and effective. Research objective Antonovsky's salutogenic model leads to the conclusion that policy is necessary for influencing many socially- and individually-operative determinants of health. Health promotion theory asserts that policy will be most democratic and effective when policy formulation involves the participation of the general public. However, Kingdon's empirical observations show little role for the gen- eral public in the direct influencing of public policy formulation. 162With the present study, we sought to investigate how and to what extent the health promotion perspective of policy formulation is a feasible and desirable alternative to the empirical perspective provided by Kingdon. This goal resulted in the following research question: \"How and to what extent does, could, and should the Dutch public participate in the for- mulation of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands?\" METHODS Due to the need for background research before the main research question could be addressed, the study comprised two preparatory phases before the third and culminating phase. The first phase was designed to identify the formal documents which have been most influential within the domain of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands over the past 15 years. This phase was intended to reveal prevailing assumptions in primary pre- vention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands regarding what consti- tutes and determines health. The second phase focused on comparing the docu- ments' assumptions with the results of earlier work on the Dutch public's per- ceptions of health goals and their determinants. The present study culminated in a third and final phase which comprised strategic discussions with policy experts as a means of assessing actual and potential public involvement in policy formulation. Phase I: Documents The first phase of the study used the Delphi method (Linstone and Turoff, 1975) to identify the five policy documents which had the most influence on the potential or actual development of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands between 1985 and 1999. Building on two well-estab- lished contacts in the Dutch policy community, a snowball methodology was used to identify 1 5 recognized Dutch experts in the areas of primary prevention and health promotion policy. The 15 experts were contacted by letter to solicit their participation in the study. 1 1 of those contacted agreed to participate, one was on permanent sick leave for the duration of the study, two deferred to the second phase of the study due to unavailability during the first phase, and one declined to participate. The 11 participants in Phase 1 represented a broad range of expertise, especially in the academic and civil service sectors. 163The 1 I participants agreeing to participate in both Phases 1 and 2 were: Dr. D. Dolman, Member of the 1st Parliamentary Chamber of The Netherlands and Ex- Chairman of the 2nd Parliamentary Chamber of The Netherlands Dr. M. Goumans, Author of \"Innovations in a Fuzzy Domain: Healthy Cities and (Health) Policy Development in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom\" (Goumans, 1998) and Program Coordinator for Health Care Policy, Netherlands Institute for Care And Welfare (NIZVV) Prof. dr. L. Gunning-Schepers, Chair of the Board of Directors and Dean of the Medical Faculty, Amsterdam Academic Medical Center (AMC) Prof. dr. A. Kerkhoff, Professor of Public Administration, University of Twente Prof. dr. A. Knottnerus, Vice-Chairman of the Health Advisory Council of The Netherlands (Gezondheidsraad) and Scientific Director of the Health Research Institute CaRe Prof. dr. H. Rengelink, Ex-Head of the Municipal Public Health Service in Amsterdam Drs. H. Saan, Senior Advisor on Professional Development in Health Promotion and Health Promotion Policy, National Institute of Health Promotion and Sickness Prevention (NIGZ) Prof. dr. P. Schnabel, Director, Social and Cultural Planning Bureau of The Netherlands (SCP) Prof. dr. J. Sixma, Chairman, Health Advisory Council of The Netherlands (Gezondheidsraad) Prof. dr. P. van der Maas, Head of the Institute for Social Health Care, Erasmus University (Instituut Maatschappelijke Gezondheidszorg) Drs. G. van der Zanden, Director of Knowledge Transfer, National Institute of Health Promotion and Sickness Prevention (NIGZ) Those who had agreed to participate in Phase 1 received a second letter detail- ing the content of the Phase 1 interview. The letter stated that the participant would be asked to respond to the single question, \"What, according to you, are the five Dutch policy documents published between 1985 and 1999 by or in cooperation with Dutch governmental units which have had the most influence upon the real or potential development of primary prevention and health pro- motion policy in The Netherlands?\" Telephone interviews were then held with each of the 1 1 participants. Due to crossover among the respondents, this process resulted in the naming of 29 policy documents. A list was created of the 29 mentioned documents which included the docu- ments' full formal citations. This list was then sent back to the 1 1 respondents with a request that the respondents rank the documents in perceived order of their influence upon the real or potential development of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Half of the respondents received the list in alphabetical order and the other half in reverse alphabetical order in order to minimize the chance that the initial order in which the docu- ments were presented on the list would influence the assessment of their importance. Eight of the 1 1 respondents returned the ranking form. Two declined to participate based on insufficient familiarity with the policy docu- ments in the list, and one did not respond. 164Respondents were asked to rank as \"0\" any documents they did not recognize or with which they felt too unfamiliar to make a judgement. Before calculations were performed, such zeroes were recoded as 30. The median ranks of the 29 policy documents were then calculated to determine a final order of their rela- tive perceived influence. The median was used because it discounted a docu- ment for being unrecognized but - in contrast to the average - remained math- ematically undisturbed by the presence of the 30's in the calculations. The median therefore ascribed some, but not disproportional, weight to the fact that a document was unrecognized by or unfamiliar to a participant. Phase 2: Comparing policy and public The five documents identified in Phase 1 were content-analyzed to assess their portrayal of what constitutes and determines health. These results were then compared with the results of an earlier study (see Chapter 6) which docu- mented health etiological understandings among the Dutch public. In the earlier study, we documented six areas of relevance within the discussion of the Dutch public's understanding of health and health etiology. The first two areas are, in quite general terms, what the Dutch population as a whole believes constitutes and determines health. The remaining areas of relevance relate to four (three sociodemographic and one behavioral) variables and their influence on what people believe constitutes and determines health: age, gender, socioeconomic status, and smoking status. The comparison of the assumptions portrayed in the documents with assumptions held by the Dutch public was therefore conducted along the lines of these six themes of relevance. Phase 3: Interviews on participation All 11 of the original participants in Phase 1 agreed to be interviewed in Phase 3, along with the two experts who had deferred participation to Phase 3 due to unavailability during Phase 1. Additionally, because the Phase 1 sample was pri- marily restricted to civil servants and academics, four political figures who are also recognized authorities on health policy were invited to participate in Phase 3. Of the four political figures asked to join the study, three agreed to partici- pate (and one of the three was joined in the interview by a scientific advisor). 165The 6 participants added to the sample in Phase 3 were: Prof. dr. J. Bensing, Director of External Relations, Netherlands Institute for Primary Health Care Research (NIVEL) Drs. D. Dees, Member of the First Parliamentary Chamber of The Netherlands, Previous Minister of Health of The Netherlands, and Chairman of Health Research Council of The Netherlands (ZorgOnderzoek Nederland) Prof. dr. H. Dupuis, Member of the First Parliamentary Chamber of The Netherlands Dr. M. Janssens, Program Coordinator for Prevention, Health Research Council of The Netherlands (ZorgOnderzoek Nederland) and scientific advisor to Mr. Dees Prof. drs. J. van Londen, Chairman, Council for Public Health and Care (Raad voor de Volksgezondheid en Zorg) Drs. R. Oudkerk, family physician, Member of the Second Parliamentary Chamber of The Netherlands, Health and Health Care Spokesman of the Dutch Labor Party (PvdA) The results of Phase 2 were summarized in a letter to the 1 7 participants in Phase 3. Also included in a letter was a description of the general objective of the interview: to identify opportunities for and barriers to a more interactive relationship between policy actors and the Dutch public in the quest for public health. 16 in-depth interviews were carried out with the original panel as well as the six additional experts. As with the analysis in Phase 2, the Phase 3 interviews focused on these six themes of relevance. They therefore proceeded from a broad discussion of the differences and similarities in policy-related and public assumptions of what constitutes and determines health to more specific discus- sions on the influence of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and smoking status. Interviews were tape recorded and subsequently transcribed. Summarizing head- ers were created for the themes discussed by interviewees and these headers were entered into a computer database. The summarizing headers were then coded by the interviewer as belonging to one or more of the six themes of rel- evance. Finally, summarizing headers were sorted according to theme and the sorted headers were used as a guide to the transcript data during analysis. The Phase 3 analysis was also conducted by the interviewer. In regards to each of the six themes of relevance, the assumptions found in the policy-related doc- uments were compared with the results of the large-scale survey among the public. Analysis focused on synthesizing and comparing the opinions held by the 17 experts. 166RESULTS I Phase I: Documents The five policy documents having the lowest median ranks, and thus highest perceived influence were (for all Phase I data, see Appendix 7A): 1 Tweede Kamer der Staten of health policy: facts, portrayals, and policy intentions (Chamber document 19500, nr. 1-2)]. The Hague: Staatsuitgeverij. (1997). Volksgezondheid toekomst verken- ning (VTV) 1997 : de som der delen [Report on Public Health Prospects: the sum of Priorities for Research]. Council for Health Research. Public Scientific Council Policy] (1991). Sociaul-economische The Hague: SDU Uitgeverij. Five documents do not represent a broad sample of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Additionally, only one of the five documents listed above, the Collective Prevention Act, constitutes true policy in the sense that it is a law. The other four documents are either institutional posi- tion papers or governmental notes. However, the five documents listed were identified by the policy experts in this study as having had the most influence upon the formulation of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands over the past fifteen years. As such, the assumptions in these documents were perceived by the interviewees as having influenced or encapsu- lated prevailing consensus surrounding the question of what constitutes and determines health. We believe, therefore, that the documents are a meaningful proxy for policy assumptions as a whole within the fields of primary preven- tion and health promotion in The Netherlands in the past fifteen years. 1672 Phases 2 & 3:The Meaning of Similarities and Differences between Influential Documents and Public Understandings of what Constitutes and Determines Health This section focuses on comparing the assumptions about what constitutes and determines health found in the documents with the assumptions held by the Dutch public in regards to the same. In the discussion below, we follow the schema of the six areas of relevance which were the focus of both the Phase 2 analyses and Phase 3 interviews. In each case we document what the Phase 3 interviewees asserted about how and to what extent the public understandings do, should, or could play a role in that process. 2.1 What constitutes health The documents portrayed health almost exclusively in clinical terms (i.e. the absence of measurable morbidity and mortality). There was some attention in the documents to positive health. However, this attention remained limited to discussion of the fact that people's perceptions of their own positive health has been correlated epidemiologically with morbidity and mortality rates. As such, the documents can be said to have essentially limited the conceptualization of health to the clinical domain. The Dutch public holds a broader view of health. In our large-scale survey, the Dutch public stood firmly behind the notion that health is both a positive and a clinical notion, and even agreed slightly more with a positive than a clinical definition of health. In this case, the question is therefore how and to what extent the public's broader conceptualization of health should or could be incorporated into primary prevention and health pro- motion policy. One of the first issues to arise in the discussion of the operationalization of health within policy was the competition between steadily expanding expecta- tions and the scarcity of resources to meet those expectations. Interviewees gen- erally did not find it surprising that the public agreed slightly more with a pos- itive definition of health than with a clinical definition. They attributed agree- ment with the positive definition, in fact, to the success of public health throughout the 20''* Century in reducing the incidence and prevalence of many epidemiological ills. Interviewees generally believed that the large-scale eradica- tion during the 20^ Century of infectious disease, combined with increased workplace and housing safety, has led to a natural evolution in public percep- tion of the need for perhaps fundamentally less pressing but currently more vis- ible needs and desires. Maslow's hierarchy was employed by at least one inter- viewee to illustrate this evolution: when people have achieved freedom from infectious disease and threats to safety, they can \"move on\" to meeting \"higher\" levels of needs. Positive health, with its focus on equilibrium, fulfillment, and quality of life, is perceived as an example of such higher needs. 168Though this may in some ways be a natural evolution, it was perceived by the interviewees as a largely problematic phenomenon for at least two reasons. First, rising expectations among the Dutch public of official health promoting organs, as exemplified by the public's agreement with a positive definition of health, was perceived as the product of the public's relative blindness to the still immense efforts required to maintain low levels of infectious disease and high levels of safety. In some ways, positive health was therefore seen as a threat to continued support for diligent public health services than as a boon foreshad- owing future growth in or resources for health-supporting professions. Interviewees perceived this as intersecting with the question of scarcity. The more the public demands positive health, the less political will, it is believed, will exist to support the allocation of resources to the traditional public health services necessary for the maintenance of a clinical definition of health among the public. Second, positive health was seen by interviewees as giving rise to unrealistic expectations among the public in regards to what can be done by government - even theoretically speaking - in the interest of health. That gov- ernment should not only guarantee freedom from infection and accidents is being slowly replaced by the expectation that government should guarantee quality of life from moment to moment. This is seen as placing an unmanage- able \u2014 and especially financially impossible \u2014 burden on governmental actions in the interest of health. Difficulties with the scientific operationalization of positive health motivated many interviewees to assert its undesirability in policy settings. Death rates, causes of death, as well as rates and causes of infectious disease and accidents, are relatively easy to quantify and thus to operationalize in policy. Unlike these epidemiological measures of health status, however, the things associated with positive health are difficult to measure. Positive health therefore is seen as consti- tuting a threat to the integrity of the scientific methods employed to support policymaking in the interest of health. Interviewees cited at least two reasons why positive health should not be incorporated in health-related public policy due to difficulties with operationalization. First, perhaps ironically, the same public which agrees with a positive definition of health also expects that policy- makers will take rational actions on the basis of good science in pursuit of health. Second, politicians, due largely to the public's demands in this regard, require health professionals to produce programs whose results can be measured and then reported back to the public. In other words, the public's demand for both transparent rationality and measurable progress in governmental health pro- gramming were seen by interviewees as primary barriers to the further explo- ration and integration of positive health notions in policy. Some interviewees, however, did question whether existing limitations within science should be accepted as a moral legitimization for the abandonment of positive health in policy. Oudkerk pointed to the conundrum: \"We can't pursue positive health with policy unless we develop the tools.\" Thus, in many ways, interviewees per- 169ceived the current inability to adequately operationalize positive health ideas as both the cause and effect of the demand for accountability to the public. The public, for its part, wants both positive health and accountability among policy actors. Having both, according to interviewees, is not currently possible. Interviewees cited a number of normative barriers to the incorporation of posi- tive health in policy. If health is expanded in policy settings to include positive health, some interviewees asserted, there is a corresponding risk of medicaliza- tion. Generally, interviewees were highly sensitive to the questions raised by Illich some thirty years ago in regards to the problems associated with the med- icalization of life. Further, medicalization was coupled with the potential loss of privacy. Both the public and policy actors are perceived as drawing at least some distinction between the pursuit of health goals which do not impinge upon personal privacy and the pursuit of those which do. In cases of conflict between the two types of goals, the preservation of privacy is valued more highly than the expansion of the health concept. Finally, interviewees asserted that in many ways health professionals have an ethical mandate from the public to define health for society as a whole. In a democracy, the public allocates resources toward the training and specialization of a selected group of individu- als with the intent that those individuals will develop and possess uniquely useful knowledge for the operationalization of health. There therefore exists both a mandate and a responsibility among such professionals to define health in ways which they see as being most beneficial to society. Positive health is largely perceived as an admirable social ideal, but as scientifically irresponsible, morally questionable, and fiscally impossible grounds for policymaking. Therefore, the professional has an ethical duty not to pursue it. The current structure of the Dutch bureaucracy was perceived as relevant to the question of the incorporation of positive health in policy. The things which positive health embodies have been pursued for many years under the name and bureaucratic responsibility of welfare work (\"welzijnswerk\"). In fact, there- fore, there is a governmental sector which has developed parallel to the health infrastructure which has largely pursued the goals encompassed by positive health. For the health sector to enter the game simultaneously, interviewees asserted, would expose it to conflict with the Wellness sector. Saan pointed out that this is highly unlikely in practice, since bureaucrats are extremely reluctant to impinge upon each other's domains. Another aspect of the current bureau- cratic reality is that the family physician in The Netherlands plays such a central role in the defining of health in situ. According to Knottnerus, one of the central roles of the Dutch physician is helping to distinguish the difference between positive and clinical health and to take appropriate measures in the interest of either. This conceptualization does offer the potential incorporation of the public's understandings of what constitutes and determines health within policy. Together with the family physician, the patient can relate, weigh, and 170define appropriate steps to the pursuit of personalized health goals. Though this does not constitute a contribution to policy formulation directly, it does so indirectly at two levels. First, policy must be designed to give the family physi- cian the training and time necessary to deal with different kinds of health and the individuals he or she serves. Second, it could be argued that part of the for- mulation of policy takes place in the clinical setting itself, since much health policy is put into practice there in an iterative process in which the ends of health and the means to them are constantly renegotiated. According to Rengelink, an example of such participation can be found in population health screening programs (i.e. \"bevolkingsonderzoeken\"). Family physicians often have a significant advisory role in helping patients decide whether or not to participate in such programs. In this sense, the family physician practice is a critical and unique setting for the incorporation of various notions of health into health policy. The history of health in The Netherlands was cited by interviewees as providing grounds for a critical perspective on the incorporation of currently prevailing notions of that concept within public policy. Schnabel asserted that health in The Netherlands was always a positive concept until the 20''' Century when biomedical operationalizations began to exert an influence on the way people define health. Goumans reiterated this point by asserting that health as a clinical notion may in fact be a learned concept, in contrast to health as a positive notion, which may be more phylogenetic. Kerkhoff pointed to the additional need to be extremely critical of emerging notions of positive health, since these seem to share the flavor of the individualism implicit to the biomedical, clinical approach to health. Primarily, the notion of positive health has now become the ability of each individual to reach his or her fullest potential. This has dove- tailed quite nicely with emancipatory processes in Western society, which have emphasized the autonomy of the individual with respect to social structure. Van Londen mentions the importance of respecting autonomy yet at the same time encouraging the maintenance of the social fabric. Along these lines, the notion of a healthy individual as someone who feels \"I suffer when I witness others suffer\" was raised by Kerkhoff as an example of an inherently social definition of positive health. Yet such positive health definitions are unlikely to be pur- sued, since they conflict with the fundamental individualism inherent to pre- vailing economic and cultural values. To summarize, interviewees asserted that the public's broader conceptualization of health should and could be incorporated into primary prevention and health promotion policy only to a very limited extent. They cited a number of scien- tific, moral, financial, and structural barriers to such incorporation. 1712.2 What determines health 2.2. / Determi'nonts exc/uding profess/ono/ oct/ons The documents gave attention to all six types of determinants of health mea- sured in the large-scale survey of the public: behavior, social contact, household factors, work-related factors, public environmental factors, and intrinsic factors. The documents placed more emphasis on behavioral and intrinsic determinants of health, a finding which seemed to correlate with the fact that these types of detemiinants have received proportionally greater focus in epidemiological stud- ies and can therefore be discussed on the basis of more empirical information. In contrast, the public ascribed importance to the six types of determinants in what is arguably the order of their perceived influenceability by the individual (i.e. the same order in which the six types are listed above). Further, a locus- of-control phenomenon occurred among the public: to the extent that respon- dents in the sample of the public ascribed importance to less individually-influ- enceable determinants (i.e. work-related, public environmental, and intrinsic factors) they also placed more faith in the effectiveness of all types of profes- sional actions in the interest of health. The question addressed in this subsec- tion, then, is to what extent and how do, should, or could the public's greater overall emphasis on individually-influenceable determinants of health and the potential locus-of-control phenomenon play a role in the formulation of pri- mary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Empirical documentation has accumulated rapidly over the past quarter century which has established the scientific validity of a phenomenon of which health professionals have long been aware: social factors play a large role in determin- ing health status. However, interviewees were not surprised by the finding that ihe public places less importance on social determinants than on more individu- ally-operative factors such as behavior, social contact, and household factors. They noted that this finding is consistent with a number of theoretical explana- tions, all of which would imply the presence of strong and perhaps in some ways insuperable psychological barriers to public awareness of social determi- nants under present conditions. A number of interviewees pointed to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As mentioned in the previous section, lower rates of infec- tious disease and accidents emerged from actions taken in the 19''' and 20^ Centuries to improve social detemiinants of health. This has perhaps both allowed and caused the public to shift its attention toward the determinants of health experiences which go beyond the absence of disease and death. Bensing also mentioned that people have a strong instinctual need to maintain control and are therefore more likely to attribute their health to factors under their con- trol. Knottnerus mentioned that, though they may be less so than citizens of the United States, the Dutch are essentially libertarian. Combining this with an insight by Schnabel, it may not be surprising, therefore, that the Dutch see the determinants of health in a way which validates the importance of their own choicemaking. 172In part, therefore, ihe finding that the public attributed more importance to determinants which are individually-influenceable was seen as inevitable. In that sense, however, is was not perceived as a finding which should be incorporated within policy formulation. As Guiming-Schepers mentioned, agreement between policy actors and the public on the relative importance of determinants is not often requisite to the setting of prevention priorities. Van der Maas noted fur- ther that the relative significance of determinants (in terms of the extent of the impact they have on health) is not an indicator of the relative priority they should receive in prevention actions. This is because many of die most power- ful determinants of health (e.g. genetic defects) cannot effectively be influenced one way or another. In part, however, the finding that the public attributed more importance to determinants which are individually-influenceable was seen as something which should be addressed if not incorporated. An awareness of social determinants of health was seen as essential to critical citizenship. Without at least some understanding among the public of the importance of factors such as pollution and work conditions, voter (and union) support for policies which improve these factors is unlikely to be sufficient. Critical citizen- ship could even include, according to Kerkhoff, an awareness of how society recreates within the social environment the threats to health which were once the product of the natural environment. Unfortunately, as many of the intervie- wees noted, though a greater awareness of social determinants among the public is desirable, the barriers to raising it are significant enough that doing so through programming or awareness campaigns is mostly seen as an unjustifi- able use of resources and therefore infeasible. Paradoxically, disasters seem to be the one way in which public consciousness of social determinants of health can be raised to levels which would be facilitative of the health promotion perspective of policy formulation. Interviewees referred many times to the Bijlmer and Enschede disasters as emblematic of how a crisis can raise public awareness of social determinants of health and the policies which impact them. In the Bijlmer disaster, a Boeing 747 crashed headlong into a large housing complex minutes after taking off at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Subsequendy, immense political pressure was put on the Dutch government to conduct research into the causes of health complaints among individuals who had either been involved in the disaster, lived nearby, or had contact with the materials which were salvaged during investigation of the accident itself. In the Enschede incident, a factory housing fireworks exploded in and effectively lev- eled a residential neighborhood. A number of the interviewees had been involved in the national governmental responses to one or bodl of the disasters. They emphasized the immense political pressure felt within governmental circles to be perceived as taking action to ameliorate the effects of the disaster and assure future public safety. In the Bijlmer disaster, however, the initial decision was not to gather baseline health data from those involved. All the interviewees involved strongly supported this decision. In the case of the Enschede disaster, 173however, the Ministry of Health decided to act immediately despite the objec- tions of many health professionals, largely due to the political fallout it had experienced on the basis of the Bijlmer incident and the lack of prompt data gathering which followed it. Interviewees mentioned that these incidents, though the most spectacular, are just two in a series which also includes inci- dents in The Netherlands such as the 1999 outbreak of Legionnaire's disease and polio outbreaks among religious communities who choose not to allow their children to be vaccinated. In every case, public attention for the social origins of health became quickly heightened due to the threat of disaster. The expected rise in the capacity and availability of genetic knowledge and technologies promises to raise attention for intrinsic factors, to which the public ascribed the least importance of all six determinant types in the large-scale survey. One of the questions which arises out of consideration of an expansion in awareness of the importance of genetics for health status is that such an expansion of awareness may challenge the public's perception of behavior as the most important health determinant type. Interviewees considered this unlikely, however. Instead, they largely took the position that the rise in genetic knowledge will merely enhance the behavioral messages which have been so painstakingly developed over the past two decades by health educators. The public, interviewees felt, is both intelligent and sophisticated enough to incor- porate information on the genetic origins of health with its current belief in the importance of behavior. Further, genetic technologies will allow health educa- tors to better estimate the risks and benefits of given behaviors on an individu- alized basis. Interviewees believed that this ability to individualize estimates of risk will make corresponding health education messages far more compelling to the individuals who receive them. However, interviewees cautioned that increases in the availability of genetic knowledge and technologies will give rise to new and expanded ethical questions. Many of these questions will not be capable of abstraction to the populalional level precisely because they involve the assessment of genetic risks in a highly individualized manner. These ques- tions will therefore demand the participation of the individuals (or \u2014 in many cases - parents) concerned. One of the most important places such discussion will take place is in the practice of the family physician. Therefore, interviewees perceived an urgent need for training among family physicians in both the technical and ethical aspects of genetic information and technologies. One of the central questions surrounding the employment of genetic technologies is the extent to which the public perceives that process as liberating or threaten- ing. To a great extent, this may be the result of how policy deals with the public's control over and responsibility for their use. On a general level, as well, interviewees noted that the expanding availability of information and new technologies will require a process of negotiation in regards to who controls and is responsible for those technologies. In the large- 174scale survey, as mentioned, ascribing importance to social and intrinsic determi- nants of health was positively associated with placing faith in professional actions in the interest of health. Interviewees asserted that the explosion in the use of the Internet to obtain health information may therefore have far-reaching consequences in at least two ways. Already, family physicians in The Netherlands find themselves confronted on a regular basis with patients who have researched their symptoms, medications, or needed or potential proce- dures. As the Internet grows in importance, interviewees asserted, u is likely to translate into a demand for far more, rather than less, medical intervention. This may eventually expand to the domain of public health as well. Genetic technologies, similarly, are likely to drive public demand for professional actions such as assessment of the safety of genetically manipulated foods, the establishment of ethical guidelines for the use of genetic technologies in clinical settings, and also for more medical and preventive advice. To summarize, interviewees asserted that the lower importance ascribed by the public to less individually-influenceable determinants of health should be engaged and challenged by primary prevention and health promotion policy. Interviewees asserted that disasters are an example of undirected consciousness- raising among the public in regards to such determinants. Genetics and internet technologies were perceived as having the potential to provide people simulta- neously with more awareness of and control over less individually-influenceable determinants of health. Rigorous embracing of genetics and Internet technolo- gies by primary prevention and health promotion policy was therefore per- ceived as one means of helping people simultaneously recognize and take responsibility for less individually-influenceable determinants of health. 2.2.2 Determinants: professi'ona/ actions Four types of professional actions in the interest of health were measured in (he large-scale survey among the public. These included medical care, traditional prevention activities, healthy public policy, and community-based activities. The documents emphasized the need for healthy public policy and prevention in pursuit of health, though this was always done against the background of the need for sufficient and efficient medical care. The Collective Prevention Act, one of the five documents identified in the study, specifically mandated preventive health action at the local municipal level. However, community-based interven- tions received very little and often no explicit attention in the Collective Prevention Act or the other four documents. The public's perception of the importance of the four types of professional actions for health was largely in step with the policy documents' portrayal. The public placed the most faith in medical care as a means to health, somewhat less faith in traditional prevention and healthy public policy, and very little faith in community-based activities. The question which emerges is to what extent and how does, should, or could the public's assessment of medical care as more important than traditional pre- 175vention, healthy public policy, or community-based activities play a role in the formulation of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. As with the determinants excluding professional actions discussed in subsection 2.2.1, interviewees felt that there were important psychological explanations for the order in which the public placed faith in professional actions for health. Some interviewees asserted that the most faith is placed in medical care because restorative care and cure naturally possess a higher priority than prevention. Though many things can be and are prevented, situations inevitably arise which demand curative action; in such situations, curative action gets priority. Despite the fact that many of the interviewees are strong advocates of more attention to prevention and policy, most affirmed \u2014 and none disputed \u2014 that curative action will inevitably remain the central priority in the health professions. A second psychological reason given by interviewees for the public perception that med- ical care is the most important professional action for health is that medical care is visible, whereas prophylactic actions are not. Van Londen noted that restora- tive action operates at the individual level and therefore always generates a story with a beginning, middle, and end. This is the reason, he believes, that news media, films, and books generally focus on medical stories if they concern health at all. In contrast, prophylactic action, whether it comprises traditional prevention, healthy public policy, or community work, does not often provide the public with such clear cut stories. To the extent that such activities are suc- cessful, they actually become less visible. Further, most prevention is measured at the populational level in terms of incidence and prevalence. Because these measures are based on probabilities, they remain abstract, difficult, and even irrelevant to the general public. As Van Londen asserted, \"A hole in care is visi- ble. A hole in prevention is not.\" Nonetheless, interviewees agreed that systemic forces reinforce and strengthen the perception that medical care is the most important professional action for health. Like all Western countries. The Netherlands has invested vast amounts of resources in its health care infrastructure. Some interviewees asserted that a \"medico-industrial complex\" was one result of these investments. Insurance companies, health care professionals, many public sector bureaucrats, the phar- maceutical industry, and perhaps even the news media, have vested interests in the maintenance and growth of medical care as a means to health. These inter- ests help to insure that public funds and attention are drawn toward the health care sector; the funds and attention, in turn, reinforce the power of those inter- ests to compete for further resources. Second, according to the interviewees, news media deserve special mention due to their exaggerated focus on medical care. Medical news serves the needs of news organizations better than do reports on prophylactic professional actions (see also Chapter 5). According to the interviewees, this encourages a perception among the public of the impor- 176tance of medical care. Finally, interviewees believed that political opportunism plays an important role in the allocation of more resources to medical care than to other types of professional activity in the interest of health. According to Dupuis, politicians are well aware that access to medical care is an issue of great importance to the public. The allocation of resources to curative rather than prophylactic strategies is often the result of politicians' desire for short-term political gain, though it may come at the expense of what ultimately produces health most cost-effectively for the public. Despite the psychological and systemic factors which cause the public to see medical care as the most important professional strategy for health, interviewees stood behind the policy-documents' recommendations that more resources should be allocated to traditional preventive and policy-based strategies. This was also seen as feasible to a given point within existing circumstances. Interviewees noted that approximately one percent of the public financing allo- cated to activities in the interest of health in The Netherlands goes to preventive strategies. Though this fact may seem prima facie to bode ill for advocates of pre- ventive strategies, interviewees pointed toward two reasons why this is in fact often not the case. First, the fact that the current percentage of the health sector budget which goes to preventive strategies is so small makes it easier for advo- cates of those strategies to argue the need for expanded funding. Second, because the health sector budget is so large in absolute terms, even small increases in the percentage devoted to preventive strategies deliver very signifi- cant results. Thus, even in a society in which medical care is perceived as the professional means to health deserving the highest priority and funding, general sentiment among policymakers as well as the public is that there is still signifi- cant room for the growth of preventive strategies before they achieve what would be perceived as an ideal ratio with curative services. This is particularly true because the higher cost-effectiveness and \"evidence base\" of prevention when compared to curative strategies have become increasingly employed and accepted arguments in policy circles. One of the factors which interviewees identified as critical to the continued expansion of policy allocations to preven- tive strategies is professionalization within such areas as health education. Continued efforts to professionalize health education and to expand health edu- cation into such areas as family physician training were perceived as important steps in the securing of a more substantial place for preventive strategies when it comes to annual funding distributions. Interviewees regularly returned to the importance of the family physician as a critical link between prevention and cure, policy and public. The large-scale survey revealed that the public places great faith in medical care and medical authority as a means to health. Interviewees noted that this corresponds with the fact that people tend to consult their family physician not only in regards to curative issues, but for information about other health issues, such as health - 177related behavior, family-, social-, and work problems, organ donation, and - as noted earlier \u2014 participation in public health studies and screening programs. Moreover, because they have a continuous, long-term relationship with patients, family physicians are in a unique position to perform a number of functions critical to the success of preventive efforts and the implementation of some health policy. These include negotiation of personal and family health goals and the desired means to them, the early identification of potential mental and physical health issues (at times despite a patient's personal unawareness of them), extension of trusted emotional support, and follow-up. As Oudkerk put it, \"the family physician, when one-on-one with the patient, is in a position to negotiate with the patient.\" However, interviewees believed that such a negoti- ating role will demand a number of new skills of the family physician in the future. First, family physicians are and will remain involved in dealing with burn-out and other effects of work stress, the combined effects of which have become a problem of epidemic proportions in The Netherlands. Often this demands early intervention on behalf of a patient, or support for a patient once burnout has occurred. Knottnerus noted that in this regard, the family physician has fundamentally different incentives than the industrial medical officer (\"bedrijfsarts\"). Namely, the family physician stands exclusively behind the patient; the industrial medical officer, who plays a major role in the assessment of employee work capacity in The Netherlands, must balance responsibilities to both patient and employer. The family physician will therefore need increas- ingly to play a role in advocating for the patient in organizational settings. Second, family physicians, as mentioned earlier, will need to have the technical, ethical, and communicative background to negotiate the use of medical tech- nologies such as genetic screening and organ transplants, especially when these technologies are employed with children. A third example mentioned by inter- viewees is that the family physician will need to develop the capacity to become an effective facilitator of healthy behaviors. All three of these examples, however, require skills for which family physicians are not currently adequately trained. Health education specialists, as noted earlier, were seen by the intervie- wees as expanding their role as purveyors of information directly to the public to become educators of family physicians seeking to develop similar skills to the ones described here. Interviewees expressed little surprise or concern that both the documents and the public ascribed relatively little importance to community-based initiatives. Internationally, community-based work has been promoted as an important example of the health promotion vision because it involves people on a local level in the influencing of the health-related factors they see as most pressing. In this sense, it has been promoted as a solution which can promote both democratically-supported and effective action for health even under circum- stances of poverty and social deprivation. Saan observed, however, that two fac- tors make The Netherlands unique with respect to community-based health 178work. First, community health work has a long tradition in The Netherlands. Public health nurses have long operated on a house-to-house basis in Dutch neighborhoods. In that capacity, they have fulfilled an important role in advis- ing local populations on health issues and caring for the most vulnerable. Community work (at least in this form), as an already well-established tradi- tion, largely eclipsed the somewhat more grassroots conceptualization of com- munity development when it arrived as part of the international health promo- tion movement. Second, the Dutch in large part expect and trust their govern- mental organs to perform the functions which are part of community health initiatives in other countries. As Saan put it, \"if community work is necessary, the Dutch assume that something is wrong with government.\" Some initiatives, such as the Opzomeren health initiative in Rotterdam, arose in pan due to the independent efforts of neighborhood residents. Interestingly, however, even in that case the actions of the residents were motivated by the existence of the Bureau of Social Renewal (\"Bureau voor Sociale Vernieuwing\") in Rotterdam. Also, the initiative in the Opzomerstraat was quickly developed by that Bureau into a municipality-wide program. Therefore, the idea of self-initiated health work in local settings, especially in a sustained sense, is an idea which seems - even under exceptional circumstances \u2014 largely inconsistent with the Dutch health service and municipal governmental traditions. To summarize, interviewees maintained that the substantial importance ascribed by the public to medical care as a professional action in the interest of health is the result of both natural and systemic factors, and largely incapable of change. Interviewees asserted that prevailing opinion among both policy actors and the public nonetheless implies that opportunities do exist for expansion of healthy public policy and traditional preventive strategies in The Netherlands. The family physician was cited as one key means of allowing policy to incorporate and to interact iteratively with the public's beliefs and preferences. Finally, the relatively low public faith in community initiatives was seen as reflective of an underlying cultural bias against the employment of non-governmentally coordi- nated strategies for health. 2.3 Age The documents asserted age as a factor of overarching importance regarding health status, susceptibility, and the need for various types of professional health support. The old and very young (i.e. children) were both portrayed as more susceptible to both internal and external health threats and therefore in need of unique levels and types of medical care. Youth, in contrast, were por- trayed as susceptible primarily to behavioral threats and therefore in need of health education intervention. Though no mention was made in the documents of different conceptualizations of health among age groups, the documents did portray youth as generally less attentive to health risks and the potential benefits of prevention. The picture provided of the public's understandings by the large- 179scale survey was only partially consistent with policy portrayals. Older persons were found to agree more than younger persons with the notion of health as a positive concept. Also, age was positively associated with ascribing importance to social contact and the household environment as determinants of health (and arguably strong determinants of positive health). Generally, this was inconsis- tent with the portrayal in the policy documents of a population in need of more medical care. Youth, on the other hand, was positively associated with ascribing importance to genetic factors as determinants of health. This may be consistent with the documents' presumption that youth are relatively oblivious to environmental and behavioral determinants of health. The question, then, is how and to what extent is, should or could positive health for the elderly or youth's expressed faith in genetic inheritance as etiologically important be inte- grated into health policy. As with the population in general, interviewees were not surprised by the find- ing that age was positively associated with defining health in more positive terms. The perception is that older persons generally begin to face limitations in their physical function and therefore are forced to look beyond that standard in assessing their own health. Interviewees, further, were actually mildly optimistic about the notion of promoting such health notions for the elderly. In some ways, expressions of this optimism implied a departure from the many caution- ary words in regards to pursuit of positive health for the population as a whole. However, interviewees generally seemed to believe that pursuit of positive health goals was more imaginable among the elderly than the population as a whole because within the elderly population that pursuit could be more easily linked to both feasible and affordable preconditions. There were a number of ways in which interviewees felt that the preconditions for positive health among the elderly should and could be met. Perhaps the most far-reaching was the perception that senior citizens need to continue to feel that they play a role in society in order to continue to have meaningful and rewarding lives. Oudkerk asserted that the mandatory retirement can be devas- tating to those individuals who would prefer to continue working after the age of 65. Mandatory retirement was also perceived as anachronistic within the cur- rent economic climate of The Netherlands in which unemployment is very low. Prevention by means of the broad Dutch network for in-home care (i.e. \"kruiswerk\") was a second way in which quality of life among the elderly could be promoted. However, Bensing noted that the current organizational schema, which demands equal time be devoted to each and every household, does not allow enough flexibility for the care provider to devote her time in the most effective way possible. There is therefore the potential for more qual- ity of life activity and primary prevention in the interaction with the in-home care providers. The realization of this is a question of resources and organiza- tion. 180However, though interviewees expressed sentiments supporting a greater gov- ernmental role in the promotion of positive health among the elderly, medical care was perceived as the most germane task. In the large-scale survey of the public, age was positively associated with ascribing importance to social contact and the household environment as determinants of health. Generally, intervie- wees agreed with this perception, asserting both factors as critical to both clini- cal and positive health for older persons. However, only those aspects perceived as critical to clinical health were perceived to be the proper realm of govern- ment policy. A cogent example was provided by Oudkerk, though he was not the only one to mention it. Currently, The Netherlands is witnessing the emer- gence of a private market for luxury housing and care among the elderly. This is an issue which was perceived by interviewees as quite compelling, largely because it threatens to disrupt the Dutch tradition of equity in care. There is a fear of a division (\"tweedeling\") emerging in the medical care which older per- sons receive. Those who can afford it may choose against government-sup- ported options in favor of high-quality, on-demand (i.e. non-rationed) curative and palliative care provided within the context of their more luxurious living arrangements. Without exception, the perception of the interviewees in this regard was of the need for a guarantee in the basic package of medical care which all elderly persons receive. The things which are perceived by both the public and policy actors as determining positive health, however, are presumed to be ethically capable of being left over to the market. Hence, though there is a recognition among policy actors that social contact and housing are critical to older persons' positive health, guaranteeing a standard minimum medical care package is seen as the first priority for public policy. This propensity is consis- tent with the perception among interviewees that medical care - especially wait lists for procedures - are among the most politically charged issues in the coun- try right now. Wait lists among persons over 65 for both surgery and in-home care are enormous and can lead to delays of months to years before services are provided. By staying focused on care, policy actors - and politicians in particu- lar \u2014 are responding in part to dissatisfaction among the public in regards to the less-than-ideal accessibility of medical care. The irony, of course, is that the public's (mostly older persons') fury over wait lists may be blinding it to - and therefore preventing the provision of - the broader array of resources it identi- fies as important for health. Interviewees viewed the finding that youth was positively associated with ascribing importance to genetic influences as consistent with the psychological and somatic characteristics of younger age. Younger persons, on average, suffer from far fewer physical limitations than older persons and have far less experi- ence with illness. They are therefore less likely to be aware of or to have devel- oped ideas about the things which either prevent or promote susceptibility. By ascribing etiological importance to genetic inheritance, young people are simply displaying their lack of experience with the impact of environmental and behav- 181ioral factors upon health. Interviewees contended that it is this psychological inexperience which is the most important characteristic of youth from the per- spective of health policy. Inexperience among young people with such environ- mental and behavioral influences means that it is very difficult to induce behav- ior change among this group in the interest of its health. Gunning-Schepers pointed out that it is ironic that the health educator must try to reach precisely the population which is least predisposed to hear the message. Thus, in this sense, current policy efforts do incorporate the unique belief system which exists among younger populations. Lower awareness of susceptibility and risk among youth is made even more dif- ficult from a policy standpoint by that group's developmental needs. In the quest for the prevention of clinical ills in the long term among youth, it is often ignored that the development of psychological health in adulthood is at least partially dependent on the development of autonomy. The development of autonomy, however, requires the exercise of choicemaking. Inevitably, the exercise of such choicemaking leads young people at times to choose the things which run contrary to the behavior recommended by health educators and par- ents. Saan refers to this as the pursuit of \"negative health\" goals. Such goals are negative in the sense that they are not consistent with prescriptions for long term clinical health. Yet \"negative\" is also a misnomer in the sense that, as Saan also asserts, the irony is that the pursuit of such goals is sometimes requisite to healthy psychological development. The incorporation of such needs into policy is an area which has received very little attention. The central goal of policy designed to address such goals is to prevent long-term damage to clinical health goals while making it possible for young people to exercise power over their own behavior. One example of such policy mentioned by Dupuis is sex educa- tion. The Netherlands has the lowest unwanted pregnancy rate of any country in the world. Dupuis emphasized that this is in large part due to the strongly prevention-oriented sex education in middle- and high-schools which is both extensive and accepting of the natural desire among young people to explore their sexuality. This is an example of policy which incorporates the desire of young people to engage in sexual activity while promoting the long-term mental and physical health of those involved. The reasons discussed make youth one of the most problematic sub-groups from the perspective of primary prevention and health promotion policy. However, the need of young people to take health on their own terms may be complemented wonderfully by the emergence of the Internet as an interactive medium. Van der Zanden noted that the web site set up by the National Institute for Health Promotion and Sickness Prevention (\"Nationaal Instituut voor Gezondheidsbevordering en Ziektepreventie\") which allows the interactive acquisition of health-related information by youth has been an enormous suc- cess. Internet, far more so than traditional methods, can be designed to respect 182the autonomy of the user. The user is allowed to focus on information relating only to health goals of his or her choice. This contrasts dramatically with school-based or mass-media based health education messages. Further, there is the potential for anonymous submission of those health-related questions per- ceived as most germane by the user. Such questions can be addressed either by professionals or by peers in an on-line setting. Thus, Internet may allow cir- cumnavigation of some of the taboos young persons face when in search of health information on issues such as sexuality and drug use. Further, because it can be accessed alone and privately rather than in a social environment such as a classroom, Internet holds the promise of diminishing at least a portion of the peer pressure exerted on young people not to listen to or heed health messages. At any rate, it is certainly one means in which health policy can be formulated to address youth in a way which is appropriate to their unique understandings of what constitutes and determines health. To summarize, interviewees contended that positive health goals were a more legitimate goal for the elderly than for the population as a whole. However, pursuit of these through public policy in the health sector was seen as largely infeasible given the current crisis with wait lists in medical care and the corre- sponding emergence of demand for privatized care. Inexperience with behav- ioral and environmental factors was felt to explain the positive association between youth and ascription of importance to inherited factors. This was fur- ther seen as a defining factor for the formulation of policy to promote health among youth. It was also asserted that policy oriented toward health among youth will have to account increasingly in the future for \"negative\" health goals and embrace the unique opportunities provided by the Internet. 2.4 Gender The large-scale survey revealed that gender was associated with profound differ- ences in understandings of what constitutes and determines health. Women agreed significantly more than men with both the clinical and positive defini- tions of health and ascribed significantly more importance to all ten health determinant types measured. The documents did acknowledge epideniiological differences between the sexes in health status, gender-specific health problems, and the generally higher rates of medical care utilization by women. However, the policy documents made little to no mention of the potential influence of gender upon conceptualizations of health or the determinants of health. The question of relevance to this section, therefore, is to what extent and how do, should, or could gender-specific differences in understandings of what consti- tutes and determines health play a role in the formulation of primary preven- tion and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Interviewees asserted that both inherent and systemic factors are likely to be the causes of women's greater overall concern with health. Women may be inher- 183enlly more aware of personal health, and thereby health in general, due to fac- tors associated with their reproductive biology. Menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause constitute overt changes in the body's physiology and therefore draw attention to the body's function. Pregnancy and childbirth may extend women's awareness of health into the social realm because they implicitly involve both contact with and responsibility for the child and its health. During the childbearing years, women go to the doctor on average four times as often as do men in The Netherlands. According to interviewees, though this is par- tially an inherent result of the need for prenatal care, greater contact with the health care provider also results in a systemic exposure among women to more health information. A number of largely systemic' factors are likely to play a role in women's greater overall concern with health. Women's magazines pro- vide more health information than do the magazines or other information sources accessed by men. Second, of the 850,000 individuals working in health care in The Netherlands, 650,000 are women. Therefore, there is a greater work-related exposure to health concerns. Third, interviewees pointed to the fact that women are the socially-designated providers of care in families, espe- cially to both children and the elderly (a set of responsibilities widely referred 10 as the \"sandwich effect\"). Finally, Oudkerk noted that public policies, through a number of mechanisms, provide largely hidden incentives for men to stay in the workplace and women to stay at home. Bensing noted that some theorists have asserted that the lower lever of stimulus in the home than at work may account for some of the greater attention given to personal health status and potential health problems by women. Therefore, men's relative lack of awareness or concern for health may in part be the product of systemic fac- lors, such as media and public policy, which promote women's contact with health information and experiences. Interviewees commented that men's relative lack of concern for health themes is consistent with other indications that men are in fact a unique health risk group. As the documents noted, men in The Netherlands have a shorter life expectancy than do women. They are also far more susceptible to problems with alcohol than women, and are at strikingly higher risk than women for a variety of health problems after experiencing marital divorce. Bensing and Gunning-Schepers, both women, noted that they had either published or talked I That these are in-fact \"systemic\" (i.e. culturally-determined) factors rather than merely the sociocultural effects of underlying \"inherent\" (i.e. biologically-determined) factors is far from clear.What is clear is that, whatever their origins, the factors discussed here as \"systemic\" which may predispose women to a greater awareness of health are capable of change.They are therefore analytically distinct from inherent biological factors, which - at least for the foreseeable future - will remain sex-dependent. 184about the clear empirical need to address men as a unique at-risk group. Often, such pronouncements proved highly controversial because they were seen as a threat to feminist calls for more attention to the specific health concerns of women. Bensing and Gunning-Schepers, however, each asserted that more attention to the unique populational risks of men need not come at the expense of increased attention to those of women. However, both interviewees were adamant about the need for more attention from a prevention standpoint to the unique risks facing men. The reasons for and the behavioral and psychological factors associated with men's relative lack of concern for health contrast with the documents, which do not address gender-specific conceptualizations of health and its determinants, nor the idea that being male may itself constitute a health risk. This gap, according to a number of interviewees, implies that future policy efforts may need to address the unique ideas men and women have about health, as well as the unique risks they face. The development of gender-specific policy is an important part of building a broader foundation for professional interventions which are gender-specific, something interviewees almost universally agreed was both necessary and forth- coming. Beyond the differing understandings of what constitutes and deter- mines health, interviewees asserted that the different roles, communication strategies and information sources of women and men also indicate the need for gender-specific interventions. Women, as already discussed, play a crucial role in families and communities in regards to decisions and behaviors which are both explicitly and non-explicitly related to health, prevention, and healing. Van der Zanden and Van Londen asserted the necessity of reaching women with educational efforts if one hopes to influence the health of a families; Rengelink noted the importance of women as key health actors in communities. Interviewees also pointed out that women and men have different communica- tion patterns. Such differences range from the content and style of speech to the extent and range of communication with others around health-related themes. Saan asserted that these differences are now increasingly recognized as indicat- ing the need for gender-specific health education and health promotion strate- gies, but that it will take 10-15 years for this consensus to become integrated into primary prevention and health promotion policy. Finally, as also noted above, women and men do seek out and are exposed to different information sources. At least in the case of mass media, the information sought out by and available to women tends to contain more health-related information. Janssens noted that the very fact that commercial organizations have figured out that men and women need to be approached differently when marketing health topics is a confirmation of the need to also do so within publicly funded health behavioral research and interventions. In summary, interviewees felt strongly that gender-specific differences need to be addressed within primary prevention and health promotion policy. To the 185extent that they can be influenced, the systemic factors which give rise to inequalities in awareness of health and its determinants should be corrected. Addressing men as an at-risk group for low awareness and risky behavior, as well as integrating gender-specific communication into health behavioral research and interventions was considered by the interviewees to be essential. 2.5 Socioeconomic Status The documents portrayed socioeconomic status as second only to age in terms of its importance as a predictor of health status. In the documents, considerable attention was devoted to the reasons behind and potential solutions for socioe- conomic health inequities, the existence and persistence of which were thor- oughly documented in the Netherlands in the late 1980's. The documents did not portray socioeconomic status as a predictor of what is believed to constitute and determine health. However, the documents did make both implicit and explicit suggestions that the etiological information possessed by persons of lower socioeconomic status is often lacking and therefore in need of remedial health education intervention. This stands out against the findings of the large- scale survey, which documented no differences in the types of health valued by persons of higher and lower socioeconomic status, nor in the amount of importance they ascribed to determinants of health excluding professional inter- ventions. Lower socioeconomic status was positively associated with ascribing importance to traditional prevention activities and community-based health ini- tiatives. The question which emerges from the comparison is how and to what extent is, should, or could virtually identical health values and health etiological knowledge among people of various socioeconomic status as revealed by the large-scale survey be incorporated into health policy. One of the points immediately made by many of the interviewees was that the redressing of socioeconomic health inequities with a straightforward redistribu- tion of economic resources would be undesirable, impractical, and ineffective. Fundamental changes in social, political and economic structure would be required in order to equalize incomes among individuals or households. Interviewees did differ in the extent to which they advocated government inter- vention in the interest of promoting such income inequity. However, intervie- wees did not believe that the Dutch public would support income equalization in the name of health if given the chance. Further, some economic inequity was seen as requisite to motivation and creativity within a market economy. The wealth generated by such motivation and creativity, some interviewees sug- gested, is one of the reasons for the high health status of the Dutch population in the first place. Therefore, on both democratic and economic grounds, the idea of a radical redistribution of wealth was not seriously advocated by any of the interviewees. Nor did interviewees believe that a radical redistribution of wealth, even if it did occur, would be likely to erase socioeconomic health inequities. Such inequalities, it is clear, are the result of a multitude of factors, 186only one of which is income. Other factors, such as formal education, health- related behaviors, work conditions, as well as the common social and material infrastructure defined by geographic community, are likely to be major con- tributing causes of socioeconomic inequities. It should be noted that interviewees also pointed out that equal access to and quality medical care \u2014 though certainly vastly more feasible \u2014 are no more likely than equalization of income to reduce or eliminate the social gradient in health. The Dutch public has now enjoyed universal coverage for medical care for many years. Further, interviewees asserted that research has shown that, at least among native Dutch citizens, access to and quality of care is remarkably equal across the socioeconomic spectrum. This supports the notion thai factors other than unequal medical care among social classes are responsible for the persistent social gradient. Interviewees did find a number of different meanings in the fact that in the large-scale survey socioeconomic status was associated with few differences in what people understand as constituting or determining health. First among these, some interviewees felt that the absence of truly meaningful differences among respondents of various socioeconomic status as measured in the large- scale survey did not indicate that no such differences exist. Some interviewees mentioned that if the large-scale survey had gone into greater specifics regard- ing the determinants of health, it may very well have detected differences among socioeconomic groups. However, the survey did contain items as spe- cific as \"get enough exercise\" and \"eat more fruits and vegetables\" in its behav- ior index. Messages of this level of specificity are ubiquitous in health education programming. The implication is that, if socioeconomic inequity is the product of an underlying gradient in health etiological knowledge, then that inequity could not be resolved by means of health education as it has hitherto been con- ducted. The cognitive messages employed within health education strategies would have to be more specific if they were to have any hope of success. Ultimately, however, few interviewees stood behind their initial observations in this regard. In fact, most were more than willing to consider the possibility that no social gradient exists in cognitive health etiological knowledge. In that case, they asserted that the results of the large-scale survey are consistent with the notion that it is the translation of that knowledge into concerted action where dif- ferences between those of higher and lower socioeconomic status originate. Knottnerus mentioned the importance of further investigation of the link between socioeconomic status and the coupling of information and behavior. In other words, more research will need to be conducted to determine if people of various socioeconomic status handle the same kinds of health etiological information dif- ferently. Saan and others believe that socioeconomic status does impact how health knowledge is employed, and mat the explanatory link between these 187hinges on the issue of individual and group empowerment. The issue of empow- erment arose within health promotion and education precisely because interven- tions designed to change behavior by means of cognitive informational interven- tions were found to be especially ineffective among disadvantaged groups. This evolution was embodied by discussion at the WHO Health Promotion Conference in Mexico City held in June of 2000, where the integration of affective and cog- nitive interventions was a central topic. Rengelink clarified the mechanism in question by stressing that health education messages speak to people on the level of freedom of choice. For those who have slowly been ingrained with the notion that they have little or no freedom to make meaningful choices in their lives, health education may in many ways be an inherently inappropriate tool. Van der Maas, Rengelink and others affirmed that people of higher socioeconomic status, who are presumably better able to understand, internalize, and act upon the mes- sages of health education, tend to benefit far more from the presence of health education than do those of lower socioeconomic status. Effective support of affec- tive skills, therefore, is necessary if health education is to help resolve - rather than exacerbate - socioeconomic health inequities. In the quest to minimize socioeconomic health inequities, many of the intervie- wees expressed the importance of supplementing health education efforts which include a focus on affective skills with structural interventions. Structural inter- ventions involve impacting the physical and social environments such that the people who experience them are intrinsically benefited or are enabled to make choices enhancing of their health. Van der Maas emphasized the importance of safety-net economic policies to prevent people from sinking into dire poverty, formal education, good housing, and access to appropriate facilities for children (e.g. quality day care, playgrounds) as examples of structural initiatives which can have an enormous impact on the socioeconomic inequities in health. When seen historically, the finding that socioeconomic status was not highly predictive of what people understand to constitute or determine health may hint at an underlying dynamic in the fundamental social structure of Dutch society. Kerkhoff noted that in 19''\u00bb Century Holland, the rhetoric used to educate the public about health and hygiene often employed the image of rampant infection among the poor and socially marginalized in order to influence the behavior of \"mainstream\" citizens. The image - and even the reality - of a class in which disease was the result of unsavory, unwise, and immoral behavior, was a power- ful means of social control. The incorporation into health policies of the notion that ignorance of what determines health is more prevalent among those of lower socioeconomic status therefore has old and somewhat dubious roots. By attributing fault to the individual or social group for its own poorer health status, such policy references may constitute means of simultaneously hiding the impact of the unequal circumstances wrought by capitalist economic structure and the maintaining of social control among the mainstream and privileged. 188In summary, interviewees asserted that the virtually identical results among respondents of various socioeconomic status in the large-scale survey could simply indicate that socioeconomic differences in behavior and health status are the result of more specific cognitive knowledge than was measured by the survey. More likely, interviewees felt, was that the results of the survey were valid, and that health-related knowledge does not differ a great deal by socioe- conomic status. If this is the case, interviewees asserted, it affirms the need for both structural and affective interventions. On the structural side, improvement of material infrastructure needs to be a focus, especially for children and youth. On the affective side, work oriented toward individual and group empower- ment promises to allow people to make the best use out of the cognitive knowledge they already, in large part, seem to possess. 2.6 Smoking Status The documents portrayed the smoking of tobacco as a behavior which carries great risks from the perspective of clinical health. Further, the documents noted that smoking is becoming steadily - if slowly - more stigmatized in Dutch cul- ture. Finally, though the coupling was not explicitly made with smoking tobacco, addictive substances in general were represented in the documents as influencing the perception of what determines health (e.g. denial of the impor- tance of use of the addictive substance or related behaviors to health) and pro- fessional actions for health (e.g. less utilization of prevention information and medical care). The large-scale survey among the public revealed that smokers agreed more than non-smokers with a clinical definition of health. Also, smok- ers ascribed less importance to behavior as a determinant of health than non- smokers. The question in this section is therefore to what extent and how do, should, or could smokers' higher agreement with clinical health and lower ascription of importance to behavior play a role in the formulation of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Interviewees believed that careful integration of smokers' values and beliefs could help maximize the effectiveness of health education and anti-smoking policy. Cognitive awareness of the risks associated with smoking has tradition- ally been the focus of health education efforts. Interviewees affirmed the impor- tance of such awareness. However, the finding that smokers ascribed less importance to behavior as a determinant of health was consistent with other evidence indicating cognitive dissonance among smokers. In other words, smokers are probably quite aware that smoking behavior is bad for them, so they simply deny the relevance of behavior for health in general. Therefore, though cognitive and knowledge-based intervention remains important, inter- viewees stressed the fact that it comprises merely a basis for other programming which must also include affective and biological considerations. The apparent presence of cognitive dissonance in smokers is yet another in a long series of arguments of the need for addressing affective aspects of smokers' psychology 189and behavior. In terms of smokers' psychology, affective characteristics such as self-esteem and self-efficacy were identified as important points of intervention. In terms of behavior, the positive aspects of smoking behavior, whether hedo- nistic or merely in the interest of being able to cope, need to be addressed within health education. The importance of biological addiction is also an area which implies the necessity of coupling health education with nicotine replace- ment therapies. Finally, the social environment and consensus surrounding the aesthetics of smoking were seen as a point of intervention. Kerkhoff pointed out that, \"smoking impacts the lungs for a doctor, but it impacts social relations for the sociologist.\" Smoking has come to be seen as a biologically risky and socially less desirable behavior in Dutch culture, as the documents assert. This has translated into a good deal of success in reducing the smoking rates (though not among younger women), though the improvements in this regard have leveled off substantially in recent years. The leveling off of smoking rates at around 34% of the adult Dutch population constitutes an interesting phenomenon. Interviewees asserted that social factors reveal the limitations to health education, and even to policy-based economic mechanisms for reducing smoking. As such, they may account for the leveling off in smoking rates. Schnabel noted that smoking tobacco is part of a long tra- dition in The Netherlands extending back hundreds of years. Moreover, in previ- ous centuries, Dutch women smoked as much if not more than Dutch men. Dupuis noted that, in contrast with the United States, smoking is very prevalent among the intellectual elite in The Netherlands (i.e. leaders in business, top gov- ernment officials, and cultural icons). Also in contrast with the United States, lawsuits against tobacco companies are seen as largely unjustified and in any case distasteful in The Netherlands. The perception that such lawsuits are unjustified comes out of the notion that most smokers today started smoking at a time when the dangers of tobacco smoking were already well known. The perception of such lawsuits as distasteful conies out of a long Dutch tradition of resolving conflict by reaching consensus. The widely-expounded \"polder model,\" in which consensus among all parties involved is the end goal, must have broken down if a citizen is forced to take grievances into the courtroom. Therefore, resorting to courtroom solutions even in the case of tobacco grievances implies the failure of a cherished Dutch tradition and hence a conflict with fundamental social values. Interviewees also mentioned that both legal and public tolerance for soft-drugs (e.g. marijuana, hashish, psychedelic mushrooms) in The Netherlands precludes the stiffening of policies in regards to tobacco. The tolerance of soft-drug use is part of a larger Dutch tradition in which government is expected to respect per- sonal behavioral choices to the maximum degree possible. Dolman noted that due to the public's expectations in this regard, policymakers in The Netherlands must always consider the possibility that creating policies which are too restric- tive will result in massive disobedience and a worsening rather than improve- ment of the problem intended to be addressed. 190A whole separate arena of barriers appears when the question of ethics is con- sidered. Interviewees noted that one of the most powerful arguments in the policy arena with regards to smoking is that it is unethical that persons should be exposed to tobacco smoke unless they choose such exposure. In this sense, smoking is a different health-related behavior than choices regarding diet, exer- cise, or even hard-drug use. As Kerkhoff noted, the consensus surrounding the need for policy to protect non-smokers from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke indicates a social understanding of health. That is to say, it indicates the presence of an understanding of health as \"doing nothing which causes harm to another.\" Though it sounds simple, this sentiment is in fact a radical departure from the individualism inherent to many Western conceptualizations of health and its etiology. To the extent that such a social understanding of health is pre- sent in a society, it can have important implications for the structure of health policies in that society. One of these implications in The Netherlands, ironically, is that the social ethos of doing nothing which causes harm to another also forms the basis for social acceptance of the idea that selectively targeting smok- ers with economic policies designed to influence their behavior is unfair. Interviewees mentioned, for instance, that the idea of dramatically raising insur- ance premiums for smokers or increasing taxes on tobacco products has circu- lated in policy communities for some time. Van Londen noted, however, that this is the \"eigen schuld dikke buk\" (i.e. \"you get what you deserve\") principle which runs contrary to the Dutch sense of solidarity. In other words, the same social conditions which make The Netherlands promising from the standpoint of seeing health in communitarian terms mean that it is a uniquely inappropri- ate country in which to make policy which singles out smokers with economic incentives to change their behavior. The final aspect of interviewees' commentary on the findings in regards to smokers' unique understandings of what constitutes and determines health is the importance of the family physician, once again, in moderating between public understandings and the application of policy. Oudkerk asserted that the family physician is in a unique position both to individualize the risks associ- ated with smoking and to negotiate with the patient in regards to if and how to stop smoking. As noted earlier, family physicians have a broad knowledge of the health and medical history of the patient. They can therefore identify patients who run uniquely high risks if they smoke, and communicate this within the context of the patient's medical history and behavior. Smoking car- ries unique risks, for instance, for women taking the pill, for diabetics, and for those with asthma or emphysema. As also noted earlier, when the technologies become available, the family physician may be able to play an important role in interpreting genetically-enhanced risks for individuals. In light of past experi- ence showing that the recommendation of a physician can be a powerful con- tributor to smoking cessation, interviewees asserted, combining the physician's authority with the greater individualization of risk made possible through 191genetic technologies may be uniquely effective. Interviewees also noted the fact that the family physician is in an appropriate position to help the patients assess their own health goals in terms of smoking behavior. A patient's choice to con- tinue smoking should not be respected until that person has at least been con- fronted with his or her own psychological avoidance mechanisms. This is a task the family physician might perform. However, such recommendations indicate the need for policy which mandates that training of family physicians include a strong emphasis on communicative skills, the understanding of risk profiles, psychology of hedonism and avoidance, and the ethics of patient autonomy. In summary, interviewees felt that smokers' ascription of less importance to behavior as a determinant of health than non-smokers was likely to be the result of cognitive dissonance and corresponding denial of the relevance of behavior for health. This factor comprises the basis for what interviewees felt was the prudent inclusion of affective, biological, and social intervention points in anti-smoking efforts. In this sense, interviewees asserted that smokers' ascrip- tion of relatively less importance to behavior both is and should be a part of primary prevention and health promotion policy formulation. However, both socio-cultural and ethical concerns mean that there are limitations to the extent to which the specific targeting of tobacco smokers could be expanded in future policy. Finally, the family physician was seen as one way of tailoring policy to the unique values, knowledge, risks, and behavior of patients with respect to the health-impact of smoking. DISCUSSION As noted in the introduction, Kingdon's conceptualization of policy develop- ment is as a process dependent upon two predecision processes: agenda-setting and alternative specification. In this discussion, we use Kingdon's conceptualiza- tion of these predecision processes as a framework for exploring the central research question. For the agenda-setting process, we seek to elucidate how and to what extent the Dutch public's influence in the problems and politics streams coincides with or transcends Kingdon's conceptualization of public involvement in policy formulation. Because findings indicated that the public's real or poten- tial role in agenda-setting was modest but varied, this discussion follows each of the seven themes covered in the Results section. For the alternative specifica- tion process, we attempt to describe how and to what extent the Dutch public's influence in the policies stream coincides with or transcends Kingdon's concep- tualization of public involvement in policy formulation. Due to the fact that the findings indicated almost no real or potential role for the public in alternative 192specification at the strategic level discussed by Kingdon, we focus on two areas which emerged from the interviews in which the public could be said to partic- ipate in alternative specification at more operational levels. In terms of both agenda-setting and alternative specification, whether the role of the public is less than, limited to, or exceeds Kingdon's vision, we seek also to reveal what kinds of communication are relevant to that role. In discussing communication between the public and policy actors, we build on the schema provided by Habermas. In some cases, the study reveals that the influence of public values and knowledge upon agenda-setting and alternative specification is less than or limited to Kingdon's conceptualization. In such cases, we focus on the cognitive, normative, and aesthetic communication through which public values and knowledge are influential, if they are found to be so at all. In other cases the study shows that the influence of public values and knowledge upon agenda-setting and alternative specification should or could be expanded beyond the ways Kingdon described. In these cases, we attempt to show how cognitive, normative, and aesthetic communication could contribute to such an expansion of influence. Agenda-setting The interviews revealed that a number of factors contribute to what is defined and operationalized as health in Dutch primary prevention and health promo- tion policy. The survey revealed that the public values positive health, and a number of examples reveal that the public seeks to problematize the absence of positive health. This would go beyond Kingdon's vision, because it implies that the public is demanding a new goal for public policy instead of merely evaluat- ing existing programs. To most interviewees, however, the problematization of positive health is seen as unacceptable. Interviewees felt that positive health both should not and could not be incorporated for technical, financial, and eth- ical reasons. Therefore, where the public is expressing an aesthetic desire for positive health, policy actors are answering with cognitive and normative rea- sons against such an evolution. In terms of the politics stream, it seems that political expedience motivates politicians to demand biomedically-based opera- tionalizations of health. The perceived need, especially among politicians but also among academics and civil servants, to deliver measurable progress on public health, drives the primary prevention and health promotion policy agenda. The public's role is indeed restricted in this regard to Kingdon's vision: that the public merely votes and plays a reactive role in shaping the national mood. In terms of voting, the public was asserted to vote on the basis of med- ical services and to largely disregard public health in such matters, which drives the operationalization of health further in the direction of clinical health. In regards to its involvement in shaping the national mood, the public is seen as 193going along with \u2014 and even supporting \u2014 the notion of evidenced-based medi- cine and prevention. The public's support in this regard is assumed due to its presumed demand for rational planning and budgetary moderation. Though the public may be expressing a desire to problematize the relative absence of posi- tive health, it seems also to be requiring cognitive communication from policy actors which reveals the measurable efficacy of policy for health. With regards to the determinants of health excluding professional actions, the public seems in some senses not even to live up to Kingdon's vision of involve- ment in policy formulation. Social determinants (e.g. work-safety, vaccinations, pollution control) as well as intrinsic determinants (e.g. genetic counseling and therapies) are almost the exclusive concern of professionals. The Dutch public seems at this point in history almost oblivious to the influence of public health conditioning of social determinants since these issues have largely - if only tem- porarily - been \"resolved.\" Since the clinical integration of genetic technologies is largely still to come, this also currently receives very little public attention. The interviewees pointed to the challenge but also desirability of communicating to the public on a cognitive level the importance of traditional public health activi- ties in the protection of health through the control of social determinants. In other words, professionals would seek a \"reproblematization\" of the impact of social determinants. The interviewees also pointed to the need for cognitive, nor- mative, and even aesthetic communication between professionals and public in regards to the expected future influence of genetic technologies. Within the poli- tics stream, the public lives up to Kingdon's vision but goes no further. Only disasters seem to be enough to motivate the public to become politically active in regards to social determinants of health. The Dutch public does seem to be active in other areas of policy for which health is a consequence rather than the primary objective. For instance, general environmental policy and questions of genetic manipulation of foods are politically sensitive areas among the Dutch public right now. Both issues could overlap into the health arena if the link were sufficiently established in the public consciousness. This indicates that policy entrepreneurs, to the extent that they wish more public involvement in policy oriented toward social determinants of health, could focus on communication relating to the scientific links between these issues and health. The public appears ill-prepared or unprepared to play a role in policy develop- ment surrounding professional actions for health. Both the documents and interviewees portray overmedicalization in Dutch professional actions for health. Interviewees asserted that there are currently opportunities for the expansion of traditional preventive and public policy-based health strategies. However, these will be taken advantage of by policy actors favoring such a shift, not on the basis of problematization by the public. The public places disproportionate faith in medical care as a means to health and is therefore ill-prepared to problema- tize overmedicalization in the services it is provided. While interviewees men- 194tioned numerous examples of communicating with the public (e.g. lectures, exposure in the media) on the scientific merits of a less curative and more pre- ventive approach to health service provision, they also claimed that such com- munication was not requisite to a corresponding shift in expenditures. This implies an actual and desired role for the public within the problems stream which is exceedingly limited. Within the politics stream, the public seems unprepared to assume more than a reactive role. The interviews revealed that the Dutch public believes that government is the appropriate instrument for health maintenance and improvement. If government itself is not being proac- tive (i.e. caring for its citizens and anticipating obstacles to public wellbeing) then something is wrong. In The Netherlands, it might actually be said that refraining from proactive, bottom-up action for health is a means of political activism, since it is motivated by an understanding of a proper (i.e. proactive) role for government. However, the interviewees revealed that the facilitation of a public role in tailoring of services is plausible. The public responds to incen- tives to create neighborhood improvements \"autonomously\" and therefore in some sense is willing to set the agenda in a post hoc fashion. Age has implications for public involvement in agenda setting. Older persons, feeling impatient with wait lists for publicly-financed residential care environ- ments have problematized the issue by looking to the private market for provision of such services. Where older persons are expressing an aesthetic desire for high- quality residential care on demand, interviewees asserted the normative need to maintain a universal standard (i.e. a common denominator in the quality and availability of such care). In a sense, this would rely on policy actors communi- cating with the public on normative and cognitive levels by asserting what is nec- essary in terms of policy (e.g. minimum standards and sufficient public financ- ing) in order to maintain die Dutch value of universal equity in basic medical care. The interviews revealed that younger persons have little if any active overt influence within the problems stream, but that in choosing negative health goals, youth do assure that their unique psychology becomes problematized in policy. The examples cited by interviewees of the influence of age-cohorts within the problems stream, however, do seem in at least one sense to go beyond Kingdon's conceptualization. As with the issue of positive health, both older persons' desire for luxury care and younger persons' need for pursuing negative health goals are an example of \"voting with your feet.\" That is, by walking away from what policy offers, these groups pressure policy actors to consider die accommodation of new types of health related goals within policy. Communication between policy actors and public in these regards relates to efficacy, fairness, and simple wants and hence to all three arenas theorized by Habermas. In the political stream, older persons are seen as carrying substantial political weight and as voting based on a higher concern than middle-aged or younger people with med- ical care benefits and availability. This is almost paradoxical considering that older persons also ascribed more importance to household factors and social contact 195(i.e. determinants of positive health) in the survey. Youth was portrayed as having no identifiably independent influence within the political stream on agenda set- ting. Interviewees noted that this contrasts with die 1960s and 70s, in which youth had a clearly recognizable voice, which is a reminder that the findings in the large-scale survey and this study may be as much the product of cohort dif- ferences as the effects of age. Being older seems nonetheless at the present time to imply a level of participation in the political stream well within die confines pro- posed by Kingdon, whereas being younger actually correlates with a level of par- ticipation less dian that proposed by Kingdon. Gender seems also to hold important implications for public involvement in agenda setting. Traditionally, health studies were mostly conducted on males due to the perception that monthly fluctuations in women's physiology associ- ated with the menstrual cycle would confound results. The problematization by feminists of such discrimination is a particularly illustrative example of how the public can be involved in agenda setting, in this case through communication on the normative level. Men, in contrast, seem to be unaware of the fact that they have poorer health on average than do women. Only professionals are problematizing men's health in policy, though those professionals did feel that the process could be enhanced by communicating to both men and women on a cognitive level about the risks men face and on a normative level about the fairness of their relative absence as a target group in health programming. Within the problems stream, then, women are seen as having gone beyond the merely reactive role theorized by Kingdon, whereas men have hardly even achieved Kingdon's vision. In the politics stream, there are no clearly definable differences between the sexes. However, interviewees did note a number of examples which touch upon the role of the public in the defining of a gender- specific Dutch health infrastructure. Women are occupying steadily more prominent positions in both health-related fields and national politics, trends both embodied by the appointment of the current Minister of Health, Dr. Els Borst. Similar to many women's organizations, interviewees felt that such strides were likely to have an important influence on the agenda taken up by the public health sector, largely because the normative and aesthetic positions of women would presumably be more forcefully articulated. Also, since the early 1980s, gay men have been very active participants in the formulation of HIV/AIDS policy in The Netherlands. Due to the fact that the gay male popula- tion was and remains at much higher risk for HIV infection, that group's nor- mative demand for the integration of cognitive communicative mechanisms on the nature of risk associated with HIV infection has dearly influenced the agenda in this regard. In terms of both the strategic positioning of women within the health sector and the highly active involvement of gay male organi- zations in HIV/AIDS policy, gender does seem in some cases to correlate with a public role in the political stream which goes beyond Kingdon's conceptualiza- tion of that role as limited to the vote and the shaping of the national mood. 196Socioeconomic status does relate to a public role in agenda-setting, though in something of a diffuse manner. The \"social gradient\" in health (i.e. socioeco- nomic health inequities) is a phenomenon which has been almost exclusively documented and problematized by health professionals. The less privileged in Dutch society, who might be expected to have the greatest incentive to do so, have not been active in problematizing their own disadvantage and its impact on health. Interviewees mentioned that, since the survey indicated that people believe health to be above all the product of medicine and individual behavior, the relative public silence in regards to the social gradient may be the result of universal medical care coverage and far-reaching social welfare safety-net in place in The Netherlands. Thus, in terms of the problems stream, socioeco- nomic status seems to largely irrelevant to the question of public involvement in agenda-setting. Nor did interviewees believe that resources should be invested to change this (e.g. to motivate public concern for the social gradient), or that communication would be likely to accomplish that goal even if it were attempted. The public does seem to live up to - though not to surpass - Kingdon's vision within the political stream, however. A number of the inter- viewees referred to the Dutch public's tradition of supporting social welfare for the poor and indigent in terms both proud and critical. It is clear that the public as a whole approves politically of attempts to ameliorate the most extreme forms of human destitution via public policy. Hunger and homeless- ness, for example, are theoretically unnecessary in The Netherlands and statisti- cally far less prevalent than in other Western nations. Yet interviewees were also critical of the public's motives in supporting a public policy concern with desti- tution, attributing support for such policies as much to a desire among the public not to be confronted with the human misery wrought by socioeconomic inequity originating in prevailing capitalist structure as to true philanthropy. Interviewees asserted that public support for other seemingly beneficent goals such as removal of hard-drug (e.g. heroine) users from the streets and the limi- tation of immigration from poorer nations \"to prevent slum formation in large cities\" should be seen as a product of and consistent with Dutch history. That history reveals a much more explicit public desire to get \"bad elements off the streets\" than would ever be openly expressed. Dutch public support for amelio- ration of the most extreme effects of the social gradient, then, reveals a level of public involvement fully consistent with Kingdon's vision of a public role in the political stream. Interviewees, however, stressed the need for continued normative communication with the public to minimize stigmatization and max- imize protection of those whose health is negatively impacted by socioeco- nomic inequity. Smoking status seems to have growing relevance to the role of the public in agenda-setting. Knowledge of the risks of nicotine exposure disseminated through cognitive messages from health professionals to the public over the past two decades seems to have taken hold. Though many cultural barriers have 197slowed the process, exposure to second-hand smoke and to nicotine in utero is receiving noticeably more attention and concern among the Dutch public than in years past. Interviewees applauded this process and argued for more commu- nication on cognitive (e.g. scientific risks), normative (e.g. the immorality of exposing others to second-hand smoke) and aesthetic (e.g. smoking is distaste- ful) levels to problematize smoking, especially among youth. In terms of the problems stream, then, the public \u2014 and non-smokers in particular \u2014 seem only recently to have assumed a level of involvement consistent with Kingdon's con- ceptualization. In the politics stream, at least in terms of Kingdon's standard of the vote, smoking status seems largely irrelevant to the question of public par- ticipation in agenda-setting. However, in terms of the national mood, the public may be said to participate in at least one way which goes beyond Kingdon's vision. Interviewees devoted substantial attention to a lawsuit brought by a Dutch employee against a large national employer due to the employer's refusal to provide a smoke-free working environment for the employee. The bringing of lawsuits against employers or tobacco producers is one emerging means of public involvement in providing a national mood facili- tative of stricter smoking regulations. Additionally, this is a more active involve- ment than that theorized by Kingdon. Perhaps surprisingly, interviewees viewed neither type of lawsuit as a particularly positive development, citing the fact that the lawsuits represented, respectively, the failure of the polder model (suits against employers) and the public's unwillingness to take responsibility for its own actions (suits against producers). Interviewees placed continued faith in the polder model to resolve such conflicts, and took a largely uncritical stance of the vested interests of employers or tobacco producers in such situations. Interestingly, the polder model could be said to be largely Habermasians, in the sense that it calls for communication lo achieve consensus for action, in this case among public, policy actors, and private sector representatives. Alternative specification The study revealed nothing which calls into question Kingdon's assumption that the general public plays almost no role in the specification of alternatives con- sidered for adoption as policy. Kingdon theorizes the alternative specification process as the product of the conceptualization, slow softening up, and selec- tion of viable policy alternatives within the policies stream. The policies stream is largely the domain of hidden participants such as civil servants, academics, lobbyists, and consultants. When creating, examining, and selecting policy alter- natives, such actors are not portrayed by Kingdon as consulting the larger public. Rather, the public's role is limited to whether hidden participants per- ceive a given alternative to be acceptable to the general public if it is adopted - or proposed for adoption - in policy. At the strategic level, we found nothing to refute Kingdon's assertions. Though the Dutch public was portrayed as play- 198ing a varied and sometimes extensive role in agenda-setting, at no time did interviewees mention the involvement - historically or normatively - in the specification of which aliernatives would be incorporated in policy designed to address the problems once they achieved agenda status. However, though die findings supported this observation very consistently at the strategic level, they also revealed the potential for public participation in alternative specification processes within a domain not covered by Kingdon's theory: the operational level. Alternative specification in its essence involves the process of defining precisely which objectives will be pursued by policy and which means will be employed to pursue them. In many situations, strategic policies in the health sector as in all sectors may choose specific mechanisms by which strategic policy objectives are to be achieved, but does not fill in all the gaps. For instance, within the context of this study, policy alternatives may be chosen by hidden participants which encourage family physicians to promote smoking cessation by allowing those physicians opportunities for training on relevant health education strategies and sufficient time per patient to allow ade- quate consultation. Such a policy, however, though perhaps specified without the involvement of the general public, may nonetheless leave significant room for negotiation between patient and physician in regards to the objectives and means which ultimately embody the policy in situ. The patient and physician, together, can define whether smoking cessation is a desired end for the patient and, if so, what the means are which the patient would most prefer in the attempt to stop smoking. Thus, one finding of this study is that the ambiguities between the broad lines drawn by strategic policies can create an intervening vacuum for public participation in alternative specification at the operational level. The findings indicate that the Internet is one of two important mediums through which the public can engage in alternative specification at the opera- tional level. Van der Zanden noted that youth can be reached in uniquely effec- tive ways via Internet. By confidentially making available health information which is both specifically-targeted and most relevant to young people, the Internet provides a means for interactive communication on cognitive, norma- tive, and aesthetic levels between health authorities and young people in regards to health objectives and how to achieve them. Both Oudkerk and Van Londen decried the fact that the Dutch government lags years behind the commercial sector in its use of Internet to reach citizens with health information. Oudkerk emphasized that the Internet could be used extensively to communicate with the public (at least on the cognitive level) by, for instance, providing a scientif- ically-based and non-commercially-motivated source of health information. Such a source of official health information, if extensive and accessible enough, would be useful in confronting media and pharmaceutical distortions of the threats or benefits of occurrences or therapies. Van Londen underscored the 199potential power of the Internet to allow citizens to far better understand, ana- lyze, and communicate with their government (i.e to make government more transparent and accessible). Interestingly, all three interviewees seem basically to be asserting that the Internet has the capacity to drive what are essentially Habermasian, iterative communicative processes between government and the public. These communicative processes are pictured as having many effects, among them an influence upon how citizens access the resources made avail- able to them through health policies. As such, the Internet is an important medium supporting public involvement in alternative specification of health policy at the operational level. The interviews revealed that a second medium allowing the public to participate in alternative specification at the operational level is the family physician. Knottnerus went into depth regarding the role of the family physician in help- ing patients or the parents of patients deal with therapeutic decisions that are being made increasingly technically and ethically difficult by technological innovations. Though strategic policy may make transplants, genetic technolo- gies, and other clinical resources available, patients themselves will increasingly have to decide independently whether and when to make use of these resources. This will require interaction between doctors, patients, and even third parties such as ethicists or lab specialists, regarding normative, cognitive and aesthetic considerations. Oudkerk mentioned that the strategic push toward integrating prevention practices into primary care implies that family physicians will be required increasingly to discuss behavior with patients. The negotiation processes central to such discussion will require the incorporation of factual and moral understandings as well as personal preferences. Rengelink mentioned the role of the family physician as a trusted counselor in whether or not patients choose to participate in public health screening or organ donation programs. In this case, once again, the family physician is portrayed as involved in mediating how citizens select from alternatives within the broad lines of strategic policy and hence ultimately decide how strategic policy is realized on the ground. Finally, the family physician was pictured as an advocate for psychologically and physically disabled workers vis-a-vis their employers. This process, which clearly involves the integration of cognitive, normative and aesthetic considera- tions, influences how an employee experiences employment and workers' com- pensation policies, hi all cases, the family physician was perceived as being a critical medium through which the patient identifies, considers, and specifies at the operational level the most desired health ends and the means which should be employed to reach them. 200CONCLUSION This study was designed to assess the theoretical and practical legitimacy of public participation in the current and future development of primary preven- tion and health promotion policy in The Netherlands. Findings revealed that a multitude of factors have a bearing on both the theoretical and the practical legitimacy of public participation in such policy development. Theoretically, there are many good reasons why the public plays a less prominent role in the agenda-setting and alternative specification predecision processes, and there are also good reasons why it should and could play a more prominent role. Practically, the public clearly plays a more important and varied role in agenda- setting than it does in alternative specification. However, unexpected examples emerged from the study showing how the public can play an important role in alternative specification at the operational, rather than strategic, level. Due to shifting socio-cultural, economic, political, and technological constraints, both the theoretical and practical legitimacy of public participation in policy develop- ment are likely to evolve in the future. Nonetheless, this study has been an attempt to both assess that legitimacy within the status quo as well as provide insight into the factors which ultimately influence that legitimacy. Public partic- ipation in Dutch policy development appears to be far less theoretically or prac- tically viable than the health promotion vision would suggest. Yet such partici- pation also seems to have far more nuance, subtlety, and even influence than Kingdon would wager. In the end, we hope this study will contribute to greater understanding of public participation in policy development and the communi- cation requisite to it. Arguably, the democratic support and efficiency of health policy depend upon it. 201Appendix 7A: Phase I Documents and Their Perceived Importance Absolute Median Rank Document Rank (All respondents) 1 li Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal staatssecretaris van Welzijn, en Cultuur en der door de en van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport).

Utrecht De Tijdstroom. 2} 36.0 Tweede der door der door 8 REFLECTIONS ON THE FINDINGS The Dutch Context and Its Relevance INTRODUCTION As stated in the Introduction, the investigative focus of this dissertation has been the theory, understanding, and portrayal of determinants of health and the relevance of these to health-related policies. Theoretically, in Chapters 1 and 2, it has been hypothesized that health professionalism needs to both be structured by and tailored to the public's understandings of what constitutes and deter- mines health. Empirically, as summarized by Chapters 3, 4 and 6, the public's understandings of health and health etiology have been investigated. These were then juxtaposed in Chapter 5 with media portrayals of health etiology and in Chapter 7 with policy-based representations of health and health etiology. Lastly, also on an empirical level, Chapter 7 presents an assessment of how policy experts perceive the relevance of these findings to the development of Dutch primary prevention and health promotion policy. Each of the seven chapters presented thusfar tackled at least one issue of core relevance to the investigative focus of the dissertation. Yet the need remains to provide explicit answers to at least four of the six specific research questions posed in the Introduction. The first objective of this final chapter, therefore, is to answer these questions explicitly and as thoroughly as possible by means of an integrated discussion of the six studies (two theoretical and four empirical) presented thusfar. Further, as also stated in the Introduction, the ultimate goal 205of this dissertation is a meditation on the relevance of understandings of health and health etiology among the public for the structuring of health professional- ism. The second objective of this final chapter, therefore, is to briefly reflect upon how the Dutch findings in this regard comprise a case study on an inter- nationally relevant issue. The structure of the chapter is based on these two objectives. The first and fifth research questions were addressed explicitly in Chapters 1 and 2, and Chapter 7, respectively. To reiterate, these questions were: 1 How can we conceptualize a role for the public in defining the ends pursued in the name of health and in evaluating or employing independently the means to achieve those ends? 5 To what extent and how are, should, and could the public's understandings of health and health etiology (be) incorporated within health-related public policies? However though the chapters deal extensively with the issues involved, the second, third, and fourth research questions have not yet been explicitly addressed. Therefore, these three questions will be answered on the basis of the four empirical studies presented in the dissenation as they relate to the theoreti- cal contentions made in Chapters 1 and 2. This discussion comprises the first section of the chapter, entitled \"Findings: The Dutch Context.\" The sixth and last research question can certainly never be definitively resolved, and in any case can only be discussed in terms which transcend the domain of this disser- tation. Therefore, the overall implications of the Dutch findings are considered separately. This lakes place in the second section of the chapter, entitled, \"Relevance of the Findings: The Netherlands as Case Study.\" / F/ND/NGS: THE DUTCH CONTEXT In the Introduction to this dissertation, I posed three specific research questions which relate directly to - and can therefore be answered explicitly by findings within - the Dutch context. These, the second, third, and fourth specific research questions, were: 2 What is the context of understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public? 3 Are understandings of health etiology a function of one's conceptualization of health itself? 4 How do the public's understandings compare with those portrayed by the media and public policy? 206Below, these questions are answered in the order in which they are presented above. However, in order to make the discussion as accessible and as meaning- ful as possible, it is organized around the six principle empirical findings emerging from the dissertation taken as a whole. For each of the six findings, the specific research question most pertinent to the finding is indicated. Research Question #2: The Dutch public does have a broad understanding of health and health etiology The studies presented in Chapters 3 and 6 show clearly that the Dutch public does have a broad understanding of health etiology. In the qualitative interviews described in Chapter 3, 103 respondents mentioned a total of 3101 determi- nants of health. Analysis of the interviews revealed that the determinants related to 141 distinct themes (i.e. clusters) which covered the entire range of Blum's (1983) model of health etiology. In fact, respondents went beyond Blum's schema. They devoted some attention to the inherited factors which Blum would classify as \"genetic\" determinants. However, respondents also made sub- stantial mention of \"intrinsic\" properties, which were labeled as such due to their perceived personally intrinsic but not inherited nature. The survey summa- rized in Chapter 6 confirmed that the public has a broad understanding of health etiology. Though respondents ascribed a range of importance to the 10 determinant indices measured, 9 of the 10 determinant types were understood to have at least \"some\" influence on health, with only community-based inter- ventions believed to have \"little\" influence on health. Finally, definitions of health were not investigated in the studies presented in Chapters 3 and 4. However, Chapter 6 showed that the Dutch public agrees at least as much with a \"positive\" definition of health as it does with a \"clinical\" definition of health. The argument made in Chapter 2 asserted the importance of an awareness among the public of the many factors which professionals have linked to clini- cal health outcomes. The findings indicate that the Dutch public is aware of individually-operative' determinants of health, such as behavior and genetics, which operate independently of curative medical care. Further, the Dutch public I In most cases in this dissertation, I have persisted with the use of the terms \"individually-operative\" and \"socially-operative\" determinants of health to describe what have often been referred to in the literature as \"individual\" and \"social\" determinants, respectively. This is because I feel there is a significant danger of ambiguity in the now widely-used term \"social determinants.\" Namely, this term can be mistakenly taken to mean determinants rooted in social life (e.g. social contact) as much as the intended meaning as a term describing factors which inherently affect the health of more than one individual simultaneously (e.g. air pollution). 207seems to be conscious of the influence of socially-operative determinants of health, such as air pollution and household income. This indicates at the very least that there is a cognitive platform for the taking of independent action by the public - or by professionals on the public's behalf - to improve the full range of determinants of health. However, the results presented in Chapter 3 also indicate that, if the spontaneity of their answers is an appropriate proxy, the Dutch public would be more likely to take action independently to influ- ence individually-operative rather than socially-operative determinants of health. Interestingly, Chapters 3 and 7 showed that only when people are stimulated to think about socially-operative determinants does their latent awareness of such factors become active. For example, Chapter 3 showed that when a researcher stimulates respondents to think about domains of possible socially-operative determinants (e.g. work environment), respondents are easily able to identify many specific etiological factors within that domain. However, the knowledge that such factors (e.g. work hours, work times, income, etc.) seems to remain latent unless attention to the domain is called up by the researcher. This finding is very consistent with the finding in Chapter 7 that the Dutch public displays sharply increased concern for socially-operative determinants when a disaster occurs. A disaster may activate an awareness of the potential immediacy of socially-operative factors which - due perhaps to inherent psychological barriers or to the presumption of professional responsibility for such factors \u2014 are most often \"out of sight, out of mind.\" This is very much in line with Kingdon's (1995) observation that disasters are an important factor in political agenda-set- ting. Research Question #2: There is social variation in the context of understandings of health and health etiology The studies presented in Chapters 4, 6 and 7 demonstrate that there is social variation in understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public. Chapter 4 presented indications of social variation based on the 103 qualitative interviews among residents of Maastricht. This revealed that the fre- quency with which respondents' mentioned various types of health etiological factors was associated with respondents' sex, age, average neighborhood income, and smoking status. The findings presented in Chapter 6 quantitatively affirmed the existence of social variation documented in the early qualitative study. Women ascribed more importance to all 12 indices in the study than did men. Age was positively associated with agreement with a positive definition of health and with ascribing importance to social contact and household-related factors, and was inversely associated with ascribing importance to genetic fac- tors. Socioeconomic status was only associated with the placing of slightly more faith in traditional preventive strategies and community-based interventions. Smokers agreed more than non-smokers with a clinical definition of health but 208ascribed less importance than did non-smokers to behavioral factors. Chapter 7, in turn, revealed the importance of \"negative\" health choices among young people, the potential significance of reproductive biology, socially-designated roles, and public policy on women's generally greater concern with health, and the influence of substance addiction upon faith in health promotive ser- vices. Social variation in what people believe constitutes and determines health has at least two important implications. The first implication applies only at the etio- logical level. As discussed in Chapter 2, the optimization of clinical health is often dependent upon the cooperation or even independent action of the people whose health is in question. The biomedical, clinical perspective of health defines health statically as the absence or mortality and measurable mor- bidity and correspondingly depicts the determinants of health as scientifically identifiable factors. From this perspective, social variation in public understand- ings of health etiology implies a problem: namely, that some social groups have a more accurate (i.e. faithful to the scientific^) understanding of die factors which impact health than do others. The first implication of social variation in public understandings of what determines health, therefore, is that group spe- cific health education is necessary to bring people's understandings into line with the scientific understanding of how health can be maintained and pro- moted. The second - but equally important - implication of social variation in under- standings of what constitutes and determines health presents the health sciences with a potentially far greater conundrum. In part, as discussed in Chapter 1, such variation implies the challenge of defining which aspects of \"diverse\" understandings of health itself will be pursued by health professionalism. Will 2 Here. I am referring to \"scientific\" in the sense of the realm of objectivity, as this notion was developed in Chapter I. In the second section of this paper (see \"Redefining'evidence'\"), I build on earlier work to reflect critically on the meaning of \"evidence\" in health professionalism. Until that section, however, as has been the case in the entire dissertation until now, evidence on determinants of health is taken to be \"scientific\" in the measure it would be ranked on a traditional hierarchy of research evidence such as the one provided by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (1996).This hierarchy,according to Raphael (2000:358).\"Level I refers to at least one properly designed randomized control trial; II-1 corresponds to well-designed controlled trials without randomization; 11-2 are well designed cohort prospective studies from more than one centre or research group: 11-3 are well-designed case control retrospective studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group; III are large differences in comparisons between times and/or locations, with or without interventions; and IV are opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, description studies or reports of expert committees.\" 209we pursue the lowest common denominator for all (i.e. the things most of us agree are health, such as long life)? Or will we respect the unique wishes of social groups (e.g. women value health more than men) and even individuals (e.g. the personal wish to have no or fewer depressed feelings)? This second implication applies as well at the etiological level, however. As also discussed in Chapter 1, variation in public understandings of health etiology implies the challenge of respecting or rejecting the diverse means in which people place faith to promote health. These different understandings of means may in-fact be scientifically valid. For youth, the development of robust personal autonomy may sometimes simply require behaving in ways which put clinical health at risk. On the other hand, different understandings of the means to health may also be scientifically invalid but morally or aesthetically valued. For instance, should rituals or therapies whose \"scientific legitimacy\" cannot be assessed be supported in the name of clinical or other definitions of health? In other words, social variation in understandings of what constitutes and determines health presents a core dilemma for health professionalism: should these understandings be challenged in the name of \"demythologizing\" (i.e. \"education\"), or should they be embraced in the name of respect for diverse wishes and values? In the end, the empirical documentation of such social variation seems to imply the need for a model of communication and negotiation such as the one based on the work of Habermas presented in Chapter 1. This issue will be more exten- sively discussed in the second section of this chapter. Research Question #2: There seems to be a strong locus-of-control effect concerning determinants outside immediate personal control The study presented in Chapter 6 showed that the ascription of etiological importance to \"less-individually-influenceable\" determinants of health was sig- nificantly positively associated with the placing of faith in all four types of health promotive activities in 11 of 1 2 possible cases (see Table 6.5). In con- trast, only 2 such positive and three negative associations were found between more-individually-influenceable raw^ determinants of health and faith in the four types of health promolive activities. This led to the hypothesis that, to the extent people see their health as determined by things they cannot control, they place greater faith in health promotive actions initiated and/or performed by professionals. As was noted in the Chapter 6 analysis, this would seem to sup- port the existence of a \"locus-of-control\" (Rotter, 1966) effect at work within 3 In Chapter 7, these have been referred to as \"determinants excluding professional action.\" Here, ehe word \"raw\" is used as a more efficient way to indicate the same. 210the Dutch public in regards to health etiology. The findings were perceived as highly plausible by the interviewees whose comments are documented in Chapter 7. They noted that under normal circumstances there are a number of inherent psychological barriers to a focus on determinants which one perceives to be outside one's immediate control. The occurrence of disasters in The Netherlands, such as recent outbreaks of Legionnaire's Disease, the floods of 1995, or the catastrophic events in the Bijlmer and Enschede, reveal that the locus-of-control effect observed in the Chapter 6 study is probably more the result of one's awareness level of socially-operative and intrinsic determinants of health than it is of personal disposition. If the locus-of-control effect observed were the result of personal disposition, it would be unlikely that there would be an \"outpouring\" of alarm regarding health protection measures after a disas- ter among populations which usually express much less concern. The model of communication presented in Chapter 1 presumes a role for the public in the identification and evaluation of determinants of health and steps taken to influence them. Chapter 2 argued that if health is to be optimized, the public needs to be aware of and have sufficient jurisdiction over the factors which impact health. Both of these theoretical contentions are challenged by the existence of a \"locus-of-control\" effect, as documented in Chapter 6. The find- ings imply that the more the public becomes aware of the importance of social and intrinsic factors for health, the less empowered \u2014 not the more empowered - it feels. An unempowered public would presumably be far less likely to play an active role in demanding intervention to improve social factors such as pollu- tion and work-safety or to deal with expanding genetic technologies in socially- acceptable ways. Indeed, an unempowered public would seem unlikely even to play the relatively passive role of voter scrutiny noted as important by the inter- viewees in Chapter 7. This implies that interventions designed to stimulate the public to consider socially-operative and intrinsic determinants of health must include a component which allows the public to see how it might be involved in taking responsibility for and improving those factors rather than simply being aware of them. Disasters, a common way people seem to become aware of social determinants of health, are hardly an ideal way to achieve this end. Research Question #3: Different things are understood to lead to different types of health The studies presented in Chapters 6 and 7 reveal that the understanding of what determines health is in part a function of how one defines health. Chapter 6 (see Table 6.4) presented a number of statistically significant differences among the six types of health-detennining factors measured in terms of the association of each with both the positive and clinical definitions of health. Social contact and behavior, as well as household-related and work-related factors, were sig- 211nificantly more positively associated with agreement with a positive definition of health than were public environmental or intrinsic factors. On the other hand, public environmental and intrinsic factors were significantly more posi- tively associated with agreement with a clinical definition of health than were household- and work-related factors and social contact. The interviews in Chapter 7 revealed that policymakers also believe that the ways a given group defines health have an impact on the things it understands as requisite for the pursuit and optimization of health. For instance, in-home care, undoubtedly partly the responsibility of the health infrastructure, is often geared as much toward quality of life as it is toward clinical health. Curative medical care, on the other hand, was discussed by the interviewees as focused on clinical out- comes often to the exclusion - and sometimes even to the detriment - of other aspects of health. As discussed in Chapter 1, the positivist tradition in health professionalism deliberately confines health to a set of operationalizable phenomena. This results in the ability to establish causal relationships of relatively high reliability between these empirically-operationalizable phenomena-labeled-as-health (EO- PLAH) and \"causal\" phenomena. The advantage of such an approach is a rela- tively high level of predictability in the outcomes associated with certain actions taken to promote health. The administration of Novocain, for instance, will numb pain in almost every human being to whom it is administered. The dis- advantage of the positivist approach is that it both implicitly and (in practice) explicitly delegitimizes non-empirically-operationalizable phenomena-labeled-as- health (NEO-PLAH). The positive health definition index in the study presented in Chapter 6 comprised almost exclusively NEO-PLAH by the standard of con- ventional clinical medicine and public health, whereas the clinical health defini- tion consisted of EO-PLAH. Yet Chapter 6 showed that agreement with the non- operationalizable positive definition of health among the Dutch public was actu- ally slightly greater than agreement with the operationalizable clinical definition. Further, the ascription of health etiological importance to social con- tact and household-related factors was significantly more positively associated with agreement with the positive definition of health than was ascription of importance to behavior, public environmental and intrinsic factors. What this implies is that, though the NEO-PLAH encompassed by the positive health defi- nition in the Chapter 6 study cannot easily be measured, they are considered highly important \"health\" ends by the Dutch public. Further, the study showed that the Dutch public understands these NEO-PLAH to be at least partially dependent on social contact and household-related factors. In other words, an entire arena of health ends and the relevance of certain means to those ends exists for the public which is essentially unacknowledged within the positivist tradition of health professionalism. 212Research Question #4: The Dutch press may broaden people's view -.- of health etiology but will not empower the public to take action ,?--:>> Chapter 5 showed that the Dutch press portrays the determinants of health in ways which are largely inconsistent with the public's understanding of determi- nants. The press gives most attention to sociopolitical and intrinsic determi- nants, whereas the public ascribed the least importance to these two types of raw determinants. However, the sociopolitical determinants reported on by the press are largely social determinants which operate \"acutely\" (e.g. wash-up of pollution on Dutch beaches) rather than social determinants which operate \"chronically\" (e.g. socioeconomic inequity). On the other hand, the press devotes relatively far less attention to household-related factors, social contact, and behavior as determinants of health. These, of course, were the raw determi- nants to which the public ascribed the most influence. The press' portrayal of medical care as a highly significant determinant of health does, however, seem quite consistent with the public's high level of expressed faith in medical inter- vention for health. -, ; .- The differences in the press' portrayal and public's understandings of what determines health constitute a bittersweet finding. In some ways, the press does constitute a medium of communication between the public and other stake- holders in the circles from which health-related policy emerges. When health- related policy decisions are made or other actions are taken in the interest of health by politicians or bureaucrats, it is covered in the press. On the other hand, citizen actions against current health policies and personal stories of nega- tive policy consequences are also covered, giving policymakers an idea of the public acceptability of the policies they enact. It may be very much in the inter- est of a more informed and critical public, therefore, that the press was found to cover social and intrinsic determinants of health. This information may stim- ulate and even supplement the public's latent awareness of socially-operative factors and thus enhance the basis for critical citizenship in regards to such fac- tors and their conditioning through policy or other actions. However, the find- ings are bittersweet because, at the same time, the press portrays the public as having little responsibility for the factors which the articles present as impacting health. In only approximately 20% of articles were members of the public por- trayed as responsible for improving health. The lion's share of the remaining 80% of articles focused on the responsibility of government actors, politicians, or health professionals. Additionally, no \"mobilizing\" information at all was provided in the articles in regards to how members of the lay public should or could go about improving the factors which were portrayed in the article as influencing health. Therefore, the press' coverage would seem to potentially provide an important basis for supplementing the public's awareness of social and intrinsic determinants of health. Yet the lack of portrayal of the public itself as responsible for the majority of factors affecting its health, or the provision of 213information it could use to assume that responsibility, means that the press may be merely reinforcing the locus-of-control effect documented in Chapter 6. As such, the press may thereby be creating a less rather than more empowered public. The findings in Chapter 5 therefore imply the need for advocacy by health professionals in the press of both coverage of behavior: on the one hand, to positively influence one's own health; on the other hand, to be involved in promoting the health of one's community. Research Question #4: Policy representations of health etiology are both broader and more narrow than public understandings Chapter 7 revealed subtle but substantial differences between the representations of health etiology in influential policy-related documents and the public's understandings of the same. In regards to the definitions of health, the docu- ments presented a more exclusively clinical - and thus more narrow - picture than was agreed to by the public. Though the documents did acknowledge the existence of \"positive\" notions of health, these were valued not in and of them- selves as ends for health professionalism, but due to their well-known statistical relation with clinical health outcomes. On the etiological level, in contrast, the documents were broader in their representation of raw determinants than were the public's understandings. The documents represented all six types of raw detenninants in fairly equal measure, whereas the public showed clear bias toward certain determinants (to the extent, as hypothesized in Chapter 6, that they were perceived as individually- influenceable). The documents were also more evenhanded in their approach to professional actions in the interest of health. The documents devoted attention to curative medical care, but also sig- nificant attention to traditional preventive strategies and healthy public policy. In contrast, the public expressed more faith in curative medical care than in the other two types of strategies. Finally, the documents made almost no mention of community-based actions, and this coincided with the small amount of faith the public expressed in such strategies. The documents' portrayal of social variation in health status and health etiology were often inconsisteni with the variations displayed in the public's understand- ings. The documents portrayed age as positively associated with reduced clinical health and an increased need for medical care. As Chapter 6 revealed, age among the public was positively associated with agreement with a positive defi- nition of health. The interviewees in Chapter 7 pointed out that this seems con- sistent with the documents, since a factual decrease in clinical health among older people may be precisely the reason for an increased perceived relevance of positive health. However, age among the public was also positively associ- ated with ascribing etiological importance to household factors and social con- tact, and this differs with the documents' portrayal of age as primarily associ- 214ated with the need for increased medical care. Youth, in the survey among the public, was associated with ascription of etiological importance to intrinsic fac- tors. This, too, is strikingly different than the documents' portrayals. The docu- ments portray many, but above all behavioral, factors which influence the health of the young. Though biological differences and correspondingly different needs were asserted in the documents between genders, no mention was made of different concep- tualizations of health or different psychological approaches to health etiology between women and men. Yet the study among the public showed that women agreed with both definitions of health more than men and ascribed more importance to all ten types of determinants. Though it is impossible to prove that this finding is not the result of answer tendencies (i.e. that perhaps women tend to give more socially-desirable answers to survey questions), no previous studies of answer tendencies in The Netherlands or elsewhere could be found which document such a phenomenon. Also, Chapter 4 supports the conclusion in Chapter 6 that men and women do differ in their conceptualization of what determines health. The gap in the documents' anticipation of gender-based dif- ferences in the understanding - or valuing - of health and health etiology is noteworthy and supports the contention which feminist health educators (Cohen, 1998) and at least three of the Chapter 7 interviewees have been making for some time: that gender-based health education and health policy are an important - if ethically difficult - step. In contrast to the findings on gender, the documents seemed to account for dif- ferences in understandings among persons of varying socioeconomic status which may not exist. Unquestionably, socioeconomic status is correlated with epidemiological differences in clinical health (Mackenbach en Verkleij, 1997; Adler, Marmot, McEwen and Stewart, 1999). However, the Chapter 6 survey detected no truly meaningful differences^ among respondents of varying socioe- conomic status in terms of agreement with health definitions or ascription of importance to various health etiological factors. The documents, on the other hand, routinely implied a knowledge gap among persons of lower socioeco- nomic status by urging that more health education be directed toward those persons. Interviewees explained this gap, on the one hand, by asserting that the survey in Chapter 6 was not specific enough to pick up the presumed differ- 4 As I mention in Chapter 6. the finding that lower SES was positively associated with ascription of importance to traditional prevention and community-based activities can be explained as the result of increased professional efforts in these regards among disadvantages populations in The Netherlands.Therefore, these differences may be less a function of SES itself than of the exposure which SES shapes. 215ences in knowledge between persons of higher and lower socioeconomic status. On the other hand, many interviewees believed that the findings affirm the notion that it is not a gap in cognitive knowledge but in emotional empower- ment which is responsible for the social gradient in clinical health. One inter- viewee even asserted that the perception of a \"dirty and ignorant\" underclass has served a functional role in Dutch society historically by providing a deter- rent to behavior considered socially-unacceptable (e.g. drinking alcohol to excess, promiscuous sexual behavior, etc.). Only a small percentage of the social gradient in health status can be accounted for by \"worse\" health behaviors among those of lower socioeconomic status (Lantz, House, Lepkowski, Williams, Mero and Chen, 1998). Yet health education accounted for a over- whelming majority of the ameliorative measures recommended in the policy documents. It is possible that the perception of a \"dirty and ignorant\" under- class reinforces the notion that health education is the means to solving the social gradient. This idea, however, seems to have little factual foundation. Unlike the differences found between the documents' portrayals and public's understandings in regards to age, gender, and socioeconomic status, the docu- ments and public were quite in tune when it came to the question of smoking status. The documents portrayed smokers as a high risk group of persons addicted to nicotine who were often in denial of the potential long-term impact of their habit. Being a smoker was positively associated with agreement with a clinical definition of health, but with ascribing lower etiological importance to behavior. It is difficult to explain this seemingly paradoxical finding without considering the potential influence of denial among smokers. As interviewees in Chapter 7 mentioned, smokers' higher agreement with a clinical definition of health may represent an underlying anxiety in regards to the maintenance of that clinical health despite an awareness of the threat presented by their smok- ing habit. Denial of the etiological importance of behavior is potentially a way of reducing the cognitive dissonance induced by the fear of the consequences of smoking in the face of a personal addiction. Interpretation of the differences between portrayals of health and health etiol- ogy in the policy-related documents and understandings of the same among the public have been explored in-depth in Chapter 7. The relevance and implica- tions of those differences, on the other hand, are the topic of the second sec- tion of this chapter. Consideration of the relevance and implications of differ- ences between policy-based portrayals and public understandings begs a number of questions, the prime one being \"why do such differences exist?\" Is it that policymakers are simply more conservative than the public, constantly applying the brake even as the public pushes the peddle to the metal? Is it that policymakers, or the public, are simply out of touch with current needs? Or do the differences reveal one moment in a process of interactive leadership which engages both policymakers and the public in defining health goals and how 216they should be pursued? Partial answers to these questions were given in Chapter 7. The section which follows attempts to extend and complete those answers by readdressing these questions on the basis of the findings in the dis- sertation as a whole. // RELEVANCE OF THE F/ND/NGS.THE NETHERLANDS AS CASE STUDY The field of health promotion was founded on the pretense of \"enabling indi- viduals and communities to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health\" (WHO/EURO, 1986) and has retained this mission (MacDonald and Davies, 1998). Why does health promotion assert the need to help people take control over the factors which affect their health? First, on moral grounds, the founders of health promotion sought to challenge the hierarchy and paternalism of the \"biomedical model\" which had colonized the professional health domain in the 19''' and 20<h Centuries. Maximizing die power people have over the factors which affect their health was and is asserted by health promoters as morally responsible because it respects the autonomy of individuals and communities to decide for themselves which health goals to promote and what means are acceptable and desirable for doing so (Labonte, 1994; Labonte and Feather, 1996). Secondly, though no less important, giving people power over the factors which affect their health was and is seen as sci- entifically responsible. Experience has shown that people themselves are capable of effecting positive changes in their environments and behavior in the interest of their own health which are more substantial and lasting than the changes professionals could effect unilaterally (Minkler, 1997). Yet the health promotion ideal of enabling individuals and communities to \"increase control over\" the determinants of their health is not synonymous with giving individuals and communities \"complete control over\" the determinants of their health. As has been discussed in both the Introduction and more exten- sively in Chapter 2 of this dissertation, the idea of achieving perfect health by means of establishing complete control over the determinants of health is, as far as we can currently theorize, merely a fantasy. Dubos (1959) was correct, how- ever, in calling perfect health a \"mirage\" to emphasize the compelling aspect of the ideal, despite its unattainable nature. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that almost no one - not even the most die-hard health promoter - believes that of the lim- ited extent to which we can establish control over the determinants of our health through conscious action, the public should or could play an exclusive role. The general consensus is clearly that we are all better served if the public's own important role in promoting health is supplemented by the efforts of people 217among them who are trained to act efficiently in the name of health. In other words, few would question that there is value in health professionalism. It is a democratic ideal that health professionals should and do act toward ends - and via means - which are desirable or at least acceptable to those they serve. In theory, why would a society pay to train and employ health professionals who do not act toward the ends which that society defines as \"health\"? Why would a society support health professionals who did not adopt means to accepted health-related ends which were consistent with that society's norms and tastes? Despite this democratic ideal, however, the history of Western health professionalism has shown that the picture is hardly that simple. Oftentimes \"health authorities\" act in pursuit of goals that are democratically unpopular or individually undesirable among those they serve. In such cases, health professionals work against the expressed wishes of the moment of those they serve out of a sense of professional duty, a well-intended if sometimes paternalistic sense of working in the best long-term interests of those they serve. The presumed mandate for such actions, on a very general level, is the notion that society has invested in the professional precisely to offer leadership in defining health, identifying the determinants of health, and acting to improve health (independently or by motivating the public to work toward such improvement). If such action remains within \u2014 or succeeds in changing \u2014 the boundaries of what is considered reasonable within a society, it may ulti- mately be appreciated or even seen as heroic, as is the case with the evolution in thinking over drinking and driving and actions to discourage it (Gusfield,.\u00ab 1981)''. A tension exists, therefore, surrounding the notion of the extent to ** which the public itself needs to be in accordance with the goals health profes- sionals pursue on its behalf and the means they employ to do so. At its most fundamental, this is the question of how and to what extent the ends and means of health professionalism should be consistent with prevailing public expectations. This dissertation, which will be published 1 5 years after the field of health pro- motion explicated the goal of \"enabling individuals and communities to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health\" was an attempt to ask to what extent this goal of democratic populism in health professionalism is desirable and feasible, and especially to investigate why it is or is not so. It is out of this context which the sixth specific research question posed in the Introduction arises. As it stands in the Introduction: S On the opposite extreme are situations in which such action is a repugnant abuse of authority, such as the medical experiments conducted in Nazi Germany during the Second World War (Bergsma. submitted). 2186 Given the whole picture, what is the relevance of understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public for the structuring of health professionalism through public policy in The Netherlands? Theory and models As noted earlier, it is for lack of a suitable alternative that I have chosen to employ the expression \"health professionalism\" in this dissertation to indicate all professional actions intended to promote health. As such, health profession- alism includes much more than medical and public health practice and research. To illustrate the full range, health professionalism as conceived in this disserta- tion would include but not be limited to: - a medical doctor's attempt to protect or restore the health of a patient through preventive advice or preventive or curative treatments - a behavioral psychologist's attempt to promote the health of a patient through a confronting of fear or shame, or the processing of grief - a public health specialist's attempt to maintain or enhance the health of a population through preventive or curative planning or programming - a community worker's attempt to boost community capacities in the knowl- edge that such enhancement will have a positive influence on health - a municipal or national civil servant's attempt to improve health by improv- ing the effectiveness of a government health-related program - a politician's attempt to better health by advocating improvements in the structural conditions of impoverished neighborhoods - an NGO worker's attempt to preserve health by advocating international treaties which minimize pollution, political or religious persecution, or war. In other words, the term \"health professionalism\" has been used to indicate a maximally-broad range of professional activity in the interest of health, from explicitly health-related action at the clinical-individual level to non-explicitly health-related action at the international-populational level. At this point, it would be convenient to refer to a well-known scale of professional activities oriented toward the promotion of health. However, though De Leeuw (1989b) has outlined four levels of health education, there are few if any Schemas which encompass as broad a range of health professionalism as is depicted above. In building such a schema, there are some qualitative differences across the range of health professional activities described above which are important to distinguish. In their important book on partnership and participation, Taket and White (2000) distinguish between three general levels of partnership, which, though not intended as such, provide an excellent framework for the distinction of three levels of health professionalism. Taket and White call these the \"strate- gic\", \"tactical\", and \"operational\" types or \"components.\" They describe the components as such: 219\"The strategic component is concerned with things like: developing policy with respect to some topic; improving perception and understanding of relevant problems/issues; develop- ment of political will; and target setting. The tactical component on the other hand involves: establishment of bodies to carry out necessary work; development of instruments (budgets, expertise, legislation etc.); setting of operational targets; and resource allocation. Finally, the operational component encompasses: use of instruments; service delivery; implementation; and monitoring/evaluation; and so can be summarized as being primarily concerned with taking action. (2000:16)\" Taket and White link these various types of actions to the \"levels\" at which they most frequently (but not exclusively) occur. The strategic actions are portrayed as most often occurring at the international and national levels, tactical actions as most often occurring at the regional level, and operational actions as most often taking place at the regional and local levels. In Table 8.1, below, 1 portray the diagram they provide. However, for purposes which will become clear momentarily, I have added a fifth \"Individual\" level to the diagram. Assuming that Taket and White are correct that there are links between the action types and population levels, this two dimensional diagram can be reduced to one dimension, albeit a more rough one. We can then assign a label to each end of that single dimension?. Below is a simplified version of the dia- gram illustrating such a conceptualization: The examples of health professionalism listed earlier proceed along one imagi- nary axis from health professional action at the individual to the international level. Along a different but clearly related axis, the list proceeds quite generally from what Taket and White have called \"operational\" action (in this case, how- ever, by health professionals) to what they have called \"tactical\" and \"strategic\" action. As shown in Table 8.2, by asserting a general correlation between these axes, Taket and White enable us to conceive the spectrum of health profession- alism on the basis of a single dimension between a \"systemic\" and a \"situa- tional\" level. That is, the more \"strategic\" which professional action in the interest of health becomes, as well as the greater the breadth of the population 7 As the discussion proceeds, I will be returning to the vocabulary of Habermas who distinguishes between \"communicative\" and \"strategic\" action. Since these terms relate more closely to the central objective of this section and the dissertation as a whole, I want to avoid having them confused with Taket and White's use, for instance, of the term \"strategic.\" Therefore, in the interest of preventing confusion, I want to develop a new vocabulary on the basis of Taket and White's schema and then - though indebted to them - leave their terminology behind. 220Table 8.1 Extended Version of Take t and White's (2000) Figure Linking Action Type and Population Level* Strategic Tactical Operational International National Regional Local IndividualXXX XXX XX X XX XX XXX X XX XX XXX XXX XXX 6 In the diagram, \"X\"'s stand for level of intensity.Three X's indicates more intense occurrence of that action type at that level than two X's. and two X's indicate more intense occurrence of an action type at that level than one X.

In contrast, the more \"operational\" which professional action in the interest of health becomes, as well as the more narrow the population con- cerned by the activity, the more \"situational\" that professional action can be said to be. Even with a definition of health professionalism which spans the entire breadth of the systemic-situational dimension, it is possible to say that the vast majority of the structure of health professionalism is determined by public policy. After a moment's reflection, it is not hard to see that the allocation of resources, regu- lation of practice, and negotiation and sanctioning of both through public 221policy structure each type of health professionalism listed at the beginning of this section. For this reason, the most effective way to assess the relevance of understandings of health and health etiology among the Dutch public for the structure of health professionalism is to investigate die relevance of those understandings for public policy formulation\u00ae. Chapter 7 showed empirically that the relevance of public understandings to the process of formulating health-relaled policies is in practice quite modest. The Dutch public was found to have little more than a modest influence on agenda- setting processes, and almost no influence upon alternative specification processes. However, it remains the case that the integration of public under- standings into public policy is a process which could theoretically take place to a great variety of extents. In a moment, an attempt will be made to illustrate the theoretical breadth of these varying extents. Developing a suitable instrument for doing so, however, first requires presentation of the seminal ladder of citi- zen participation conceived by Arnstein (1969). As shown in Table 8.3, Arnstein's model depicts eight rungs of citizen partici- pation. Levels 1 and 2 represent a situation in which, in Arnstein's words, the \"real objective is not to enable people to participate in planning or conducting programs, but to enable power holders to 'educate' or 'cure' the participants.\" In contrast, at Levels 7 and 8, citizens \"obtain the majority of decision-making seats, or full managerial power.\" The rungs in-between these two poles repre- sent various gradients of citizen power. Arnstein's ladder was intended as a categorization of levels of citizen power in decisionmaking processes at fairly localized levels. Arnstein herself (1969: 217) mentions the potential applicability of the ladder to colleges and universities, schools, city halls, police departments, and big businesses. The context of public policy development at the national and even at the municipal level, of course, is far broader than any of these more localized settings. However, building on the core logic of Arnstein's model, it would be possible to express a continuum of relevance of public understandings of health and health etiology for policy development. In this case, \"relevance\" refers specifically to the manner in and extent to which public understandings of the most appropriate ends and means 8 Though commercial interests may play an important role in the financing of medical or mental health care, the insurance companies involved are so tightly regulated in The Netherlands (as in most other countries) that in the ways which are most important for the discussion here, those companies' policies can scarcely be distinguished from public policy itself. For example. Dutch law dictates what care is available and whom it may be performed by. as well as how it is financed and for whom. 222Table 8.3 Arnstein's (1969) Eight Rungs on a Ladder of Citizen Participation Rung Level Name Grouping Category t 7 t S 4 3 2 1Gtizen control Delegated power Partnership Placabon Consultation Informing Therapy ManipulationDegrees ol cozen power (Levels 6-8) Degrees of tokenism (Levels 3-S) Nonparddpadon (Levels 1-2) for health professional activity are incorporated in public policies in terms of the ways these policies structure health professional action. Such a ladder would have to be relevant at both the \"systemic\" and \"situational\" levels as these terms have been defined above. The ladder presented in Table 8.4 lists five points on a continuum of levels of relevance of public understandings to the formulation of ends and means of health professionalism as these are stipulated by public policies. The levels pro- ceed from a theoretical maximum (Level +2) to a theoretical minimum (Level - 2) of incorporation of public understandings in the ends and means adopted by health professionals. The model applies at both the systemic and situalional levels of health professionalism. This ladder, like Arnstein's model, is based on the question of power and repre- sentation in communication (i.e. policy formulation) oriented toward action (i.e. health professionalism). In that sense, it is consistent with Habermas' (1984) conceptualization of \"communicative\" and \"strategic\" communication and action. The theoretical maximum expressed by Level +2 is an example of what Habermas called communicative action. Since this concept was explicated in Chapter 1, I will not belabor the point now. It is enough to say that, at this end of the model, the ends and means of health professional action adopted within public policies are theoretically conceived, designed, implemented and evaluated by the public in cooperative action with other policy stakeholders. In contrast, the theoretical minimum expressed by Level \u20142, from the perspec- tive of the public, represents a state of uninformed un-involvement in the for- mulation of the ends and means of health professionalism as these are specified 223Table 8.4 Ladder of Relevance of Public Understandings of Health and Health Etiology to the Formulation of The Ends and Means of Health Professionalism as These Are Stipulated Within Public Policies Rung Level Nam\u00ab Description at Systemic/Siruaaonal Levels Action Type +2 Partnership Ends and means determined by collaboration between poNcymakers/professionalfs) Communicative and population/individual + 1 Inquiry Ends and means determined by policymakers/professional(s) subject to reactive questioning by the population/individual 0 Scrutiny Ends and means determined by policymakers/professionals) subject to scrutiny by the population (e.g. votej/individual -I Acceptance Ends and means determined by policymakers/professional(s) alone, tailored to values & knowledge of population/individual -2 Education Ends and means determined by policymakers/professional(s) alone, tailored only to knowledge base of population/individual Strategic by public policies. From the perspective of health professionals, this level involves what Habermas called strategic action. Habermas (1984: 285) writes, \"We call an action oriented to success strategic when we consider it under the aspect of following rules of rational choice and assess the efficacy of influencing the decisioas of a rational opponent [italics added].\" Thus, the use of public understand- ings as a platform for the influencing - rather than involving - of the public regarding the setting of the ends and means taken up by health professionalism can be called \"strategic.\" Similarly, at the level of action itself, those health pro- fessional actions which are designed to influence public understandings to make them more compatible with a set of predetermined professional goals or values (e.g. \"education\") are also rightly labeled \"strategic.\" In the sense that this ladder identifies varying levels of public participation in the formulation of public policies, it is very similar to the ladder conceived by Arnstein. However, unlike Arnstein's model, this ladder is not intended to have normative connotations. Many authors, including Habermas and authors in the field of health promotion, have considered the normative issues at stake in the debate over the desirability of communicative versus strategic action. For rea- sons which will hopefully become apparent in the remainder of this section, however, I want to introduce the ladder with no explicit normative connota- tions. In other words. Level +2 is not conceived as inherently more moral than Level -2, and vice versa. The morality of a given level of incorporation of public understandings in health policy formulation, in this conceptualization, 224depends very much on the amount of power a population or individual wishes or expects to retain or relinquish to the professionals it pays to develop, use, and improve specialized skills to promote health in the common interest. The Dutch context Chapters 1 and 2 hypothesized the relevance of public understandings of health and health etiology for the structuring of health professionalism through public policy. Chapters 3-7 constituted an attempt to supply the empirical elements nec- essary to test this hypothesized relevance in one context: The Netherlands. As such, the findings in this dissertation comprise a case study of a larger issue of relevance. Most specifically, the findings are intended to be relevant to the field of health promotion and its ideals. More broadly, however, my hope is to frame the findings in such a way that they relate to the theorization of the structuring of health professionalism generally, in The Netherlands and elsewhere. The empirical findings presented in this dissertation, which culminate in the analysis of the relevance of public understandings for the formulation of health- related public policies in Chapter 7, lead to two basic conclusions: - The manner of the relevance of the Dutch public's understandings of health and health etiology for health-related policy in The Netherlands - and hence for the structure of Dutch health professionalism \u2014 is a function of at least five factors, all of which have the potential to promote the relevance of those understandings as a basis for both communicative and strategic action. \u2014 Though these factors may generate different outcomes in other societies, their present configuration within Dutch contexts at the systemic and silua- tional levels, when the balance is weighed, have created a situation in which the public's understandings of health and health etiology are more relevant as a basis for strategic than communicative action. The five factors and their influence upon the manner of the relevance of public understandings The Systemic Leve/ Four major groups were identified by a number of interviewees during the policy study as archetypal primary \"stakeholders\" in the process of health-related policy formulation. Interviewees pointed to politicians (i.e. elected officials), civil ser- vants (i.e. bureaucrats), academics, and the public. Commercial and non-profit interests were acknowledged as important, but were portrayed as having to influ- ence the policy formulation process tlirough one of the four primary stakeholders. For instance, a commercial interest may hire academics to do research supporting its position, or attempt to gain influence with politicians through donations or other means. Similarly, non-profit groups may seek to mobilize the public to political action, or curry favor with one or the other arm of the national bureau- 225cracy. Therefore, the four primary stakeholders will be used as the basis for this discussion. That said, it is important to distinguish between the public and the other three primary stakeholders in the policy formulation process. Consistent with the usage in Chapter 7, therefore, die public will henceforth be referred to as either \"the public\" or simply an \"individual\" depending on the context, and die other three primary stakeholders as merely \"policymakers.\" The S/tuot/ono/ /.eve/ As also noted in Chapter 7, the public may not only participate theoretically in the formulation of public policies at the systemic level. The public can also have an important role in the formulation of health professional ends and the means to them in situ, at the situational level. This is because there are often gaps within the broad, strategic lines of policies. These gaps are left to be filled at the situational level by individuals in collaboration with health professionals. The doctor-patient relationship is the most typical example. Though the strate- gic lines of policy have dictated that a medical doctor be trained, financed and present at the consultation, the specific nature of the goals which will be pur- sued by the doctor and patient together (whether primarily on the basis of communicative action or strategic action by the doctor) are unknown and unformulated until the moment of contact. In this case, I will refer to doctors, nurses, psychologists, public health officers, and other service providers who have direct contact with the public or individuals within the public as \"health professionals.\" The foctors The findings in this dissertation imply that at least five factors influence the choices which policymakers and health professionals make in regards to the ends they pursue and means they employ to do so. Policymakers hold privi- leged positions in the policymaking process in comparison to the public. Therefore, they are most often the interpreters of public understandings of the most desirable ends and means for health professionalism in terms of the ways these understandings might be translated into concrete proposals for health- related policies. Similarly, health professionals hold privileged positions during a consultation in comparison to individuals. Therefore, health professionals must nearly always interpret and incorporate the public's and individuals' understandings of the most desirable ends and means for health professionalism in terms of the ways these understandings might be translated into concrete steps (e.g. diagnosis, treatment/intervention) in the interest of health. Therefore, the five factors which influence policymakers' and health profession- als' choices in regards to the ends and means proposed for health-related policy have a substantial influence on the nature of the relevance of public understand- ings of health and health etiology for those policies, and hence for the resulting structure of health professionalism. Below, I discuss these five factors. The dis- 226cussion of each of the factors follows the same general pattern: - Brief description of the factor itself :. - Examples of how the factors may promote the manner of relevance of public understandings for policy and health professionalism as a basis for commu- nicative and strategic action at both the systemic and situational levels' - A weighting schema for the factor's influence'\" I Available resources The interviews presented in Chapter 7 revealed that Dutch policymakers are highly sensitive to the need to stay within budgetary constraints. Resource limi- tations were mentioned very often in the interviews as perhaps the most pow- erful driving force in determining which policy ends and means were proposed and adopted. Most often, resource limitations were portrayed as forcing policy- makers to choose the most feasible ends and most cost-effective means. Since these are not infrequently incompatible with what the public would most desire, resource limitations within the specific configuration of the Dutch con- text tend to mean that public understandings of the most desirable ends and means are dealt with in a more strategic than communicative manner. level Action Type Example (* = example from empirical research in this dissertation) Promoted by Example Systemic Communicative 'Building on the public's ascription of high etiological importance to behavior was seen by policymakers as important since prevention is cheaper than cure. Strategic 'Positive health is too expensive, so according to policymakers will not be pursued despite the popularity of the notion among the public. Situational Communicative 'The Opzomeren initiative in Rotterdam was created on the premise that having no formal funding (beyond salaries) would require the professionals to involve the neighborhoods. Strategic A padent who requests blood tests perceived as unnecessary by the family physician may be refused. 9 I have taken examples, where possible, from the empirical research presented in this dissertation. Where that have proven impossible, I have supplied a plausible mechanism. (Where examples are drawn from the research presented in the dissertation, I have placed an asterisk before the example description.) 10 These coding Schemas will be used in the final analysis to produce a unified conceptual framework for the influence of all five factors. 227Weighting Schema: Available resources (\"R\") can promote the relevance of public understandings of appropriate health-professional ends and means as a basis for communicative (\"R^\" where 0<=R<.<=0.4) and strategic (\"R,.\" where 0<=R,.<=0.4) action. 2 Scientific responsibility Dutch academics and civil servants feel a need to remain scientifically (see foot- note 2) responsible in the solutions they advocate. Within the specific Dutch context, this means that things which cannot be measured with current instru- ments are given far less attention as policy options than things which can be measured. In other words, the need to act in a way perceived as scientifically responsible often promotes the incorporation of public understandings of the most desirable ends and means within health professional action in a more strategic than communicative manner. Level SystemicAction Type Promoted by ExampleExample (' = example from empirical research in this dissertation) Communicative 'Policies to reach non-natives in The Netherlands presume that effective care and prevention cannot occur without working with those groups' norms and values. Strategic 'Acting on the basis of data and evidence requires professionals to work for increases in preventive strate- gies (on social determinants) despite public's support of medicine. Situation]! Communicative A physician may be aware that lowering patient stress through negotiation of the ends and means employed may be supportive of health (Bergsma and Commers, 1997) Strategic \"A physician may urge a female patient to stop smoking if she begins using oral contraceptives, since the combinaoon carries elevated cardiovascular risks. Weighting Schema: Scientific responsibility (\"S\") can promote the relevance of public understand- ings of appropriate health-professional ends and means as a basis for commu- nicative (\"S<.\" where 0<=S<.<=0.4) and strategic (\"S^\" where 0<=S^<=0.4) action. 3 Ethics Dutch policymakers respond strongly to the perceived ethical necessity for equity in health and distribution of public resources to achieve it. They also generally feel ethically compelled to support a maximization of personal privacy and liberty. Much has been said about the natural competition between personal and public interest. The interviewees revealed that as the arbiters of the public interest, policymakers and health professionals feel that their ethical responsibil- 228ities often compel them to limit the dedication of resources to an individual in the greater utilitarian interest. Since this is the primary way in which ethics influences policymaker decisionmaking within the Dutch context, it tends to encourage strategic rather than communicative action in relation to the public's understandings of the most ideal ends and means of health professionalism. Level Action Type Example (* = example from empirical research in this dissertation) Promoted by Example Systemic Communicative *ln the past 30 years respect for sex-specific differences in biology, knowledge, values, and info sources has increasingly been perceived as ethically necessary. Strategic 'Ethical reasoning is behind policymakers' desire to prevent the emergence of a private market for medical care in The Netherlands, despite the demand for it. Situational Communicative Informed consent requires health care providers to discuss all treatment opbons with patients before they make a decision. Strategic 'People above the age of 70 who want heart transplants are generally denied them because the expendi- ture and dedication of a heart would not provide enough benefit- Weighting Schema: Ethics (\"E\") can promote the relevance of public understandings of appropriate health-professional ends and means as a basis for communicative (\"E^.\" where 0<=E^<=0.4) and strategic (\"E,.\" where 0<=E^<=0.4) action. 4 Public bureaucratic and policy legacies There is a legacy of public trust in the national government in The Netherlands (Van der Horst, 1996). The Dutch public generally considers the government to be the natural and rightful arbiter of resources allocated in the interest of health, and sees that process largely as one which should happen on behalf of rather than in collaboration with the citizens. Awareness of these traditions was mentioned by die interviewees as increasing the perception that a clear mandate exists for the health professional to take independent action in the interest of public health on the behalf of the public. Therefore, the bureaucratic and policy legacies in The Netherlands tend to support a model whereby policymakers and health professionals act autonomously on behalf of the health of the public rather than in constant deliberation with the public. This represents the use of public understandings of health and health etiology as a basis for strategic rather than communicative action. 229Level Systemic SituanonalAetna Typt Promoted by ExampleExample (' = example from empirical research in this dissertation) Communicative The polder model is the Dutch basis for decisionmaking when controversy arises. Population screening programs have been controversial and thus required taking people's views seriously. Strategic 'The perceived undesirability of community-initiated health programming among the Dutch public requires policymakers to innovate on a strategic basis. Communicative 'Past policies respecting a patient's right to die under intolerable and irremediable circumstances motivates many physicians to listen to their patients' wishes in this regard. Strategic A patient who requests to be referred to a specialist may be refused. The tradition and law have empowe- red the family doctor as the gatekeeper in The Netherlands. Weighting Schema: Public bureaucratic and policy legacies (\"P\") can promote the relevance of public understandings of appropriate health-professional ends and means as a basis for communicative (\"P<.\" where 0<=Pj.<=0.4) and strategic (\"P,.\" where 0<=Pj<=0.4) action. 5 Political and power interests The interviews not surprisingly revealed that pressure is put on civil servants and academics by politicians within and outside the Ministry of Public Health, Wellness, and Sport (VWS). In turn, many commercial and public interest groups exert pressure on politicians. In contrast to the other four factors, this implies a relatively balanced set of forces in terms of the resulting effect on the relevance of public understandings of health and health etiology for policy for- mulation. Due to the fact that political interests tend to be tied to both public interest as well as special interest groups, the pressure exerted on policymakers tends to promote the relevance of public understandings in roughly equal mea- sure as a basis for communicative and strategic action. Level Action Type Example (* = example from empirical research in this dissertation) Promoted by Example Systemic Communicative 'Activism on the part of doctors and the public was responsible for the changing of policy to allow heart transplants in The Netherlands. Strategic Commercial resistance to the stigmatization of genetically-altered foods has in some cases motivated policy- makers to try to ameliorate the public's fears of possible negative effects. Situational Communicative 'The rise of information on the Internet in regards to medical conditions and treatments is forcing physi- cians in many cases to negotiate the demands of their patients. Strategic The promotion of various pharmaceutical by their producers and the research which is created to support them is one reason why many desired alternative therapies may not be financed. 230Weighting Schema: Political and power interests (\"I\") can promote the relevance of public under- standings of appropriate health-professional ends and means as a basis for com- municative (\"Ij.\" where 0<=I<.<=0.4) and strategic (\"I,.\" where 0<=I^<=0.4) action. Co/cu/ot/ng the forces The relevance of public understandings within a given context in which ends and means of health professionalism are determined at the systemic or situa- tional level is a product of all five factors. As such, at either the systemic or sit- uational level, the rung on the ladder\" presented above can be estimated as such: Rung on the ladder = (R^ - ig + (S<. - S,) + (E^ - E,) + (p^ - P^) + (1^ - y This formula implies, as stated earlier, that each of the five factors can promote the relevance of public understandings of the appropriate ends and means of health professionalism - albeit to different extents - as the basis for both strategic and communicative action simultaneously. In practice, the promotion of the relevance of public understandings occurs in both directions at all times. For the purposes of clarity, a theoretical illustration of the model is useful. We can imagine that all factors were maximally promotive of the relevance of public understandings as a basis for communicative action (i.e. R^. = S^. = E^. = Pf ~ I,- ~ 0.4), and all factors were partially promotive of the relevance of such understandings as a basis for strategic action (e.g. R,. = S = E,. = P = I = 0.2). This would mean that the combined sum of all factors would be equal to 1. The rung on the ladder corresponding to a \"1\" is \"Inquiry.\" This rung implies that the ends and means of health professional actions are determined by poli- cymakers or professionals, but are subject to reactive questioning by the popu- lation or individual concerned in the systemic or situational context concerned, respectively. The formula has not been provided with the illusion that the relevance of public understandings in various situations or societies can truly be \"calculated\" in the theoretical way it has been done here. Rather, the formula, and the model of which it is a part, is intended as a concise formulation of the theoreti- cal implications of the findings in this dissertation. Most specifically, the model is first meant to identify the factors which influence the way in which public 11 Here I refer to the ladder presented in Table 8.4. 231understandings of the most appropriate ends and means of health professional- ism are relevant to the formulation of public policies which structure health professionalism. Secondly, the model is meant to show clearly and concisely that each of these factors can promote the relevance of public understandings as the basis for both strategic and communicative structuring of health professional ends and means simultaneously and to varying extents. International application of the findings:The Dutch Context as case study As mentioned throughout the above analysis, the empirical studies presented in this dissertation ultimately revealed that, in the Dutch situation, the five factors generally promoted the incorporation of public understandings of health and health etiology in a strategic fashion more than in a communicative fashion (i.e. in all cases but one, X^. < X^.). Thus the Dutch situation can be seen as a case study \u2014 one specific configura- tion - which reveals the influence of a set of factors relevant to a wide range of situations in which health professional ends and means are defined. This implies that the schema presented here may in part or whole be applicable cross-culturally, at least within the situations related to health professionalism in developed Western democratic nations. Application of the findings in The Netherlands The Dutch configuration implies that the findings presented in this dissertation are only likely to be perceived as useful - or to be employed - at the more strategic end of the ladder shown in Table 8.4. That is, to the extent that the results presented in this dissertation are used in The Netherlands within the current configuration of the five factors in the model, they are most likely to be used strategi- cally, in the interest of the goals and means which stakeholders other than the public define as appropriate for health professionalism. This presents a challenge to the latest ideas within Dutch policy circles regard- ing the most needed developments in Dutch policy for health, because most of these ideas presume a communicative model for the formulation of the ends and means adopted by health professionalism. In this final section of the disser- tation, 1 discuss three points in this regard: - the growing perceived need for social and structural intervention in the inter- est of health and how such intervention implies a communicative model - what type of health professional is needed to accomplish such intervention - ultimate standards which should guide health professionals in the quest for a more healthy society 232I The growing perceived need for structural and social intervention in the interest of health and how such intervention implies a communicative model Just months ago, the Raad voor Volksgezondheid en Zorg (2000) (Council for Public Health and Care in The Netherlands) published an advisory report at the request of the Minster of Public Health, Wellness and Sport on the need for social and structural intervention in the interest of health. The report, entitled \"Gezond zonder zorg\" (Health without Health Care) advocates the allocation of significant resources to what the Dutch have traditionally referred to as \"facetbeleid\" (this term can be translated using Milio's (1986) words \"healthy public policy\" or Lavis and Sullivan's (2000) less concise but more self-evident phrasing \"policy which has health as a consequence rather than as its primary objective.\") The vision of healthy public policy asserts the need to promote health through the influencing of structural and social infrastructure. The influencing of struc- tural infrastructure, according to Raphael (2000) \"focuses on high-risk condi- tions and considers how individuals adjust to these conditions or move to change them.\" As such, the term \"structural\" refers most specifically to the manifestations of economic and political structure (e.g. public and private insti- tutions) which provide or fail to provide environmentally-based opportunities for healthy living in the course of daily life. The influencing of social infrastruc- ture, on the other hand, would include the improvement of what Putnam (1995) has defined as \"social capital,\" or \"features of social organization such as networks, norms and trust, that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.\" Though not as ambitious as the Swedish government's latest healthy public policy initiative (Swedish National Committee for Health, 2000), the RVZ's advice was well-received by Dr. Els Borst-Eilers, current Minister of Public Health, Wellness and Sport in The Netherlands (Borst-Eilers, 2000a, 2000b). In her response, Minister Borst reiterates the need for both behavioral and socio- structural promotion of health. Hence, the vision of promoting health through healthy public policy, as described by the RVZ report and the Minister's favor- able response, has been developed, expounded, and at least partially accepted within influential policy circles. However, as the RVZ (2000) itself notes in its advisory report, \"at the national level, public health interests are nonetheless not yet a structural item on the political agenda.\" /a Making heo/th a priority on the politico/ agenda A number of voices have shed light on the possibilities for making health a structural (i.e. sustained) priority on the political agenda. However, the essential point is that all of these voices assert the inherent need for a communicative model in regards to the ends and means adopted by health professionalism if such a high priority for health is to be achieved. Borst-Eilers (2000a), in her 233response, agrees with Dr. Roel Pieper, Professor of Electronic Commerce at the Technical University of Twente, asserting that The Netherlands is moving from a \"supply-driven to a demand driven society.\" She goes on to say, \"Citizens are ever becoming better informed, can easily consult \u2014 or better said \"chat\" \u2014 with one another, and will demand that administrators accept responsibility for their decisions.\" Minister Borst-Eilers mentions the possibility of restructuring Dutch government from a current total of 13 ministries to just 4 in order to facilitate communication between government and citizens, as well as between govern- ment and the private sector. In order words, the vision of healthy public policy which has been sanctioned by the Ministry is also perceived as demanding a more communicative model. Borst-Eilers is not alone in her belief that a more communicative model is essential for making health a priority of the political agenda. Lavis and Sullivan (2000), in their excellent chapter on the influence of policy legacies upon the development of health policy in Canada, assert that two possibilities exist for surmounting the stifling effect of policy legacies for innovation. The first possi- bility is interministerial advocacy of health ends within non-health ministerial policies which have health as a consequence rather than a primary objective. The second possibility is the involvement of the public not at the national but at the state level in defining the ends and means adopted by health profession- als. These processes, however, demand that health professionals deal in a com- municative fashion with personnel from ministries other than the Ministry of Health, and with the public, respectively. Finally, De Leeuw (2000) has asserted that communication is essential to a new vision of collaborative and participa- tory government. Building on Kingdon's (1995) interactionist model of policy development, De Leeuw shows that the latest insights from research into policy formulation processes indicate that policy cannot evolve without substantial communication between policymakers on traditional health terrain and those in other sectors. This process, however, requires reformulation of health goals in more general terms and a flexible approach to how those goals may be met by concrete policy-mandated steps. /b Redefining \"evidence\" The promotion of health by means of healthy public policy implies multi- faceted interventions in structural and social infrastructure. However, as is well known among practitioners, and affirmed by the study presented in Chapter 7, an extraordinarily powerful barrier to the adoption of such strategies are die prevailing ideas which influential policymakers hold about what constitutes valid evidence for decisionmaking. Chapter 7 made clear that policymakers in The Netherlands generally honor the same hierarchy of research evidence as delineated by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (1996) in Canada. In this hierarchy, according to Raphael (2000:358), \"Level I refers to at least one properly designed randomized control trial; II-1 corresponds to well- 234designed controlled trials without randomization; II-2 are well designed cohort prospective studies from more than one centre or research group; II-3 are well- designed case control retrospective studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group; III are large differences in comparisons between times and/or locations, with or without interventions; and IV are opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, description studies or reports of expert committees.\" The Chapter 7 interviews showed that to the extent that decisions are based on research evidence closer to Level I, Dutch policymakers feel more \"scientifically responsible\" about those decisions. The central problem with such a conceptualization of the relative value of research evidence for the formulation of public policy is that the types which now reside at the top of the hierarchy are largely incompatible with the kinds of evidence which can be produced to show the success or failure of interven- tion to improve structural or social infrastructure in the name of health. Raphael (2000) has provided an exceptional review of this issue. In his review, Raphael asserts that \"what counts as evidence in health promotion is a contested issue,\" and that \"ideology, values, and principles strongly influence what is accepted as valid evidence.\" He advocates the laying bare of the ideology, values, and prin- ciples which underlie notions of valid evidence as an important step in alleviat- ing the current conundrum of recognizing the need for intervention at the structural and social levels and the simultaneous perceived inability of \"science\" to show the efficacy of such strategies. Lomas (1998) also asserts that scientific conservatism is more likely to lead to individually-based rather than socially- based interventions because the outcomes of these are more easily measurable. He advocates a \"wholesale retooling\" of public health and epidemiology in order to be able to deal with the influence of social structure and interventions to improve its effect on health. In addition to Raphael and Lomas, McQueen and Anderson (2001) and, earlier, Tones (1997) have analyzed the same conundrum. In each case, the authors point to the rich variety of existing quali- tative scientific resources for establishing \"evidence\" and to the need for the sharing and weighing of values in the consideration of the meaning and appli- cation of such evidence as a basis for health professional action. This, of course, implies that the need for evidence which can accommodate the vision of healthy public policy, a vision sanctioned by the Dutch Minister of Public Health, also implies that a communicative model is necessary. This would come as no surprise to Stone, who noted (Stone, 1988) that the ways in which sym- bols and numbers are used in forming policy are inherently political and hence communicative. Her argument deconstructs the notion that one given kind of research evidence is compatible with a \"rational\" approach to policymaking. Rather, she asserts, allegiance to a model such as the hierarchy of the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, simply constitutes one of many possible ways to gain public credibility for a given political standpoint. The more ger- mane question is not which standard of research evidence is inherently better. It 235is the question of who will be involved in the process of defining which evi- dence is more preferable and more applicable within given settings, and which health professional actions are reasonable in light of those standards. 2 What type of health professional is needed to accomplish such intervention The goals sanctioned by Minister Borst imply the need for a communicative model if Dutch society is to proceed from a supply-driven to a demand-driven society. This means that professionals will have to offer leadership which tran- scends the current configuration of the five factors described earlier in this chapter. What does this mean for the future of the health professional? What kind of health professional is needed to achieve the vision espoused by the Ottawa Charter (WHO, 1986), Milio (1986, 1996), the Swedish National Committee for Public Health (2000) and the Ministry of Public Health, Wellness and Sport in The Netherlands? As Saan (1999) has pointed out, the Dutch health professional of the future will need to be able to articulate epidemiological knowledge to the public, and the public's values back into the health professional setting. Saan asserts that the health professional will need to \"learn to work in dialogue with the epidemiol- ogist regarding data in order to determine what the hierarchy of determinants is, and how to translate those data into priorities on the basis of consultation with the public.\" Boutilier, Cleverly and Labonte (2000) strongly concur with this vision of the health professional. They call for \"practitioners skilled in com- munication, social analysis, and critical reflection.\" The practitioner must be able to analyze social structure and trends and to reflect critically on such analy- ses. First and foremost, however, the practitioner must be a good communica- tor, able to articulate health professional knowledge to the public and interpret public knowledge as a critical advocate. Lavis and Sullivan (2000) have focused less on the need of the health profes- sional to articulate the ends and means of health professionalism to the public, and more on the need to articulate these things to other, non-health profession- als who are influential in policy circles. They argue that health professionals must have the communicative skills necessary to accomplish two things critical to the surmounting of policy legacies which preclude the emergence of healthy public policies. Health professionals need to articulate a theoretical reconcilia- tion of the biomedical and population health approaches and reframe choices by advocating that health ends be integrated into the policies advocated and sponsored by other ministries. Kreuter (2000) agrees with Lavis and Sullivan especially on the second point, and reiterates the need for a health professional who can communicate effectively to achieve that. Finally, as Lavis and Sullivan (2000), Duhl (1990), Kingdon (1995), Goumans (1998) and De Leeuw (1999) have all pointed out, the health professional of 236the future must not only be a good communicator to the public and other pro- fessionals, but an entrepreneur as well. The metaphor of the entrepreneur has captured the imagination of these authors, perhaps, because it describes an actor who is capable of using intuition, cunning, communication, and timing to mold available resources into policy-based innovation for health. This skill encompasses good communication skills, but goes beyond. The health profes- sional of the future, if the kinds of innovations are to occur which have been identified by leaders in the field as essential to the success of government sup- port of health, will need not only to be able to talk the talk, but to walk the walk as well. 3 Ultimate standards which should guide health professionals in the quest for a more healthy society Both communicative and strategic action for health on behalf of health profes- sionals can be the more difficult yet more ethical road. Involving non-profes- sional women in discussion of the implications of a population screening pro- gram for breast cancer, according to one interviewee from the Chapter 7 study, demanded that a great deal more time be devoted to development of the pro- gram. However, the interviewee remained adamant that the extra time invested was worthwhile because it enhanced the public's faith in the program and thus the program's viability and sustainability. That interviewee in fact described the extra effort it took to achieve a communicative model, and how it helped the end result be sustainable and acceptable to all. Motivating Dutch policymakers and public to take a hard look at the negative effects of smoking tobacco was a task which largely fell to one man, the well-known family physician Dr. Mijnsma, in the 1950s and '60s. That a pleasure enjoyed for centuries by very large parts of the Dutch population turned out to be one of the most well-doc- umented and significant health threats of all time was not a pleasant message. Convincing people to accept the \"unhealthiness\" of smoking required the rela- tively easy task of promoting a health-related end (\"lower cancer and heart dis- ease\") and the relatively difficult task of advocating a means to it (\"not smoking tobacco\"). This mission could only have been accomplished strategically, given the context in which it began. Thus there is a need for health professionals who can transcend the influence - if only momentarily and within given contexts - of the five factors discussed in this chapter as influencing the relevance of public understandings of the most appropriate ends and means for health professionalism. Essentially, as true entrepreneurs, these health leaders will need to be guided not only by a model more communicative than the one prescribed by the status quo in The Netherlands. They will need to be guided by two overarching principles: humanitarianism and humanism. A health leader should be guided by humani- tarian values because the amelioration of suffering among their own (i.e. the \"rule of rescue\"), as the interviewees in Chapter 7 asserted, is a fundamental 237and natural priority of human beings. Action in the interest of humanitarian values can take both strategic and communicative forms. The suicidal teenager may say he wants to die, and even attempt to do so; yet the health professional is right to work against his stated goal by finding the source of and relieving his psychic pain. The terminally ill cancer patient in unbearable pain is a differ- ent matter; this situation requires a higher degree of respect for the patient's stated wishes. Health leaders must also be guided by humanistic values. Humanism, a tradition at least five hundred years old in the Western world, involves at both the strategic and communicative levels the highest respect for self and other, for all others and - we now realize - for the environment in which we live. CONCLUSION With the first section of this chapter, I have attempted to answer the three out- standing specific research questions. The answers to these questions led to a description of the specific Dutch context of public understandings, as well as of media and policy portrayals of health and health etiology. In the second section of this chapter, I have attempted to develop a general model on the basis of the context-specific empirical studies. The model is a descriptive - rather than nor- mative \u2014 model for the assessment of the manner of relevance of public under- standings of health and health etiology for the structuring of health profession- alism. The model has been developed at the systemic and situational levels largely to show its flexibility. Application of the model to the Dutch context revealed that the unique status quo configuration of influential factors in The Netherlands means that the relevance of public understandings to health profes- sionalism is largely as a basis for strategic action by professionals. The findings, and the model based upon them, imply the importance of making health a pri- ority on the political agenda through leadership and redefining the meaning of evidence. These two trends, in turn, demand the health professionals develop the communicative and analytical skills necessary to advocate for and function in a more communicative environment than the one which exists presently in The Netherlands. In the final analysis, however, strategic action is sometimes necessary and responsible on behalf of the public's health. This means that health professionals will need to be guided by humanitarian and humanistic values as they seek to apply communicative and strategic tactics in a way which most benefits the public or individuals whose \"health\" is in question. 238REFERENCES Adler, N.E., Marmot, M., York Academy of Sciences.

Maximizing people's power over the factors which affect their health is said to be morally responsible because it respects the autonomy of individuals and communities to decide for themselves which health goals they most wish to pursue and how to promote those goals in light of individual and community resources and values. Giving people power over the factors which affect their health has also been asserted as scientifically responsible. Experience has shown that people \u2014 alone or in cooper- ation with professionals - are capable of effecting positive changes in their envi- ronments and behavior in the interest of their own health which are far more substantial and lasting than the changes professionals could effect unilaterally. Yet the ideal of enabling individuals and communities to \"increase control over\" the definition and determinants of their health is not synonymous with giving individuals and communities \"complete control over\" these matters. Of the lim- ited extent to which we con establish control over the determinants of our health through conscious action, neither the public nor health professionals believe that the public should or could play an exclusive role. The general con- sensus is that we are all better served if the public's own important role in defining and promoting health is both facilitated and supplemented by the efforts of people who are trained to think about and act efficiently in the name of health. In other words, the public and health professionals must work together in some configuration to define health goals and the most appropriate means to achieve them. This dissertation was an attempt to ask to what extent the public does, should and could have a role in the structuring of health pro- fessionalism, as well as to provide some insight into why or why not the answers to these questions take the form they do. Public policy is the domain in which health professionalism is given the over- whelming majority of its form. The purpose of this dissertation is to reflect upon how the public's understandings of health and health etiology are relevant to the structuring of health professionalism. Therefore, the dissertation is first - and even foremost \u2014 necessarily concerned with the relevance of those under- standings for public policy. Yet assessing the relevance of public understandings of health and health etiology for public policy requires both empirical docu- mentation of those understandings. Such an assessment also demands the devel- opment of an explicit theoretical framework for conceptualizing the potential relevance of public understandings of health and health etiology for public policy and, hence, for the structuring of the ends and means embodied by health professional actions. This dissertation, therefore, begins by presenting such a theoretical framework. It then proceeds to empirical documentation of 253public understandings, and ends with reflections on the relevance of those understandings for public policy and the structuring of health professionalism. Chapter 1 begins by asserting that empirical, theoretical, and practical insights have revealed limitations to positivist approaches in health professionalism. A working vocabulary is then developed for the discussion of subjectivity in rela- tion to health and health professionalism. This vocabulary is employed in a deep reading of Aaron Antonovsky and Rene Dubos which leads to a model for grounding the abstraction of health in the concrete currency of health etiologi- cal resources. Finally, the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas is used as a means of con- ceptualizing the dynamics of achieving consensus for action between profes- sionals and public in regards to health-related ends and the means employed in pursuit of them. Chapter 2 attempts to reveal a natural scientific foundation for the contention that participation is necessary for the optimization of health. A thermodynamic understanding of health and salutogenesis is discussed, and Antonovsky's saluto- genic model is reformulated as a complexity model of health etiology. A wide body of salutogenic research is then used to demonstrate the link between the complexity model of health etiology and the need for participation. That link is found in that fact that the complexity model implies that many - if not most - of the factors relevant to health status are either partially or exclusively accessi- ble to those whose health is in question. This leads to a final section focusing on how professionals can support participation by researching and boosting people's understanding of health etiological factors as well as their power to influence them. Chapters 3 and 4 present a qualitative study among 103 residents of Maastricht which assessed what the respondents believe determines their health. The main goal of the interviews was to generate the broadest possible inventory of what people believe to determine their health. Sub-goals were to assess whether response would differ to open and structured questions (to get an initial feeling for people's sensitivity) and whether signs of social variation existed in the data. Chapter 3 presents the aggregate inventory as well as an analysis of the response differences to open and structured questions. Chapter 4 provides an analysis of social variation in the findings by respondents' sex, age, average neighborhood income (a proxy for socioeconomic status) and smoking status. The work pre- sented in Chapters 3 and 4 forms the basis for the quantitative study presented in Chapter 6. Chapter 5 describes a content analysis of the five national Dutch newspapers with the largest daily circulations. The central objective of the content analysis was to characterize the portrayal of the determinants of health in the Dutch press. The press, used within this dissertation as a representative for the media in general, 254could comprise a critical means of communication between policy actors and the public. Yet much existing evidence indicates that the portrayal of determi- nants of health in the press is largely inconsistent with the messages which health professionals would wish to relate to the public. Further, evidence also suggests that the press does not often portray the public's understandings of the most appropriate ends and means for health professionalism nor does it support people in working independently of professionals to enhance their own health. The study detailed in this chapter tests these insights from previous research within the Dutch context and finds they are largely affirmed. Chapter 6 presents a large-scale survey of the Dutch public in regards to what it understands as constituting and determining health. The goal of the large-scale survey was to provide a quantitative evaluation of the insights raised in Chapters 3 and 4. Results of the survey were used to construct a LISREL model (n=772) which relates the Dutch public's conceptions of salutogenic health eti- ology to conceptualizations of health itself and the amount of faith placed in differing types of professional health promotive strategies. These beliefs are also linked via the model to the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample respondents. Findings indicate that the Dutch public values a positive definition of health as much as a clinical definition, ascribe most importance to individu- ally-influenceable determinants of health, and place more faith in medical care as a means to health than in public health strategies. The existence of social variation by gender, age, and smoking status in understandings of the determi- nants of health and professional strategies for health was strongly affirmed. In contrast, few differences of importance were found in such understandings among those of lower or higher socioeconomic status. Finally, respondents' agreement with each definition of health was associated in theoretically plausi- ble ways with ascription of importance to different types of determinants of health. The findings in Chapter 6 are used as a basis for the study of policy content and its compatibility with the public understandings described in Chapter 7. Chapter 7 details an investigation of the implications of the compatibility of policy actors' and the public's assumptions regarding the most appropriate health-related ends and means for health professionalism. Documents influential within the development of primary prevention and health promotion policy in The Netherlands since 1985 were identified through a Delphi method and con- tent analyzed to determine their portrayal of health and the determinants of health. The results of this content analysis were compared with the findings from Chapter 6. Finally, these comparisons were discussed with 17 persons who have relevant policy expertise to determine the meaning of the similarities and differences between policy actors' and public understandings of health and health etiology within the status quo and context of future health-related policy development. Findings of the content analysis and comparison of its results 255with the Chapter 6 survey indicated numerous similarities and differences between public and policy actors' assumptions. The public tended to discount those determinants less amenable to individual influence, including many social determinants of health. Policymakers gave such factors more - and perhaps more balanced \u2014 credence. Further, the interviews with policy experts revealed that the general public has modest but varied real and potential involvement in defining which issues are addressed by policies for health. On the other hand, the general public has a much more limited role in specifying the concrete shape those policies take in practice. Chapter 8 summarizes the empirical findings presented in the dissertation in terms of the theory found in Chapters 1 and 2 and presents a nascent theory of public participation in the structuring of health professionalism via participation in public policy formulation. The empirical findings reveal that there are both opportunities for and barriers to the participation of public in the formulation of the health-related ends and means embodied by health professional activity. These opportunities and barriers are used to abstract a interculturally-generaliz- able theoretical framework for the extent to which public participation in the structuring of health professionalism via participation in public policy formula- tion is desirable beteren\" (WHO/EURO, Men stellen dat de maximalisering van de beheersing door van samenwerken om gezondheidsdoelen om mate het publiek een rol heeft, zou moeten hebben en kan bod komen hoe dat gaat met Dubos.
