Many times, when I have been able to identify the health issue, it's the remedy that proves illusive. I have welcomed opportunities to learn about energy medicine, in particular. Thus, I would like to begin this article with the teaching of Rudolph Steiner that inspired me to look deeper into the healing power of sound. Magical Sounds of Spring Rudolph Steiner once said, \"It's the song of the birds that calls forth spring.\" These magical sounds bring about seasonal changes in temperature and moisture. As I thought about Steiner's words, I felt he was giving insight into the symphony of nature and the turn of the seasons. This, to me, was also an indication that the world sprung forth into form from heavenly vibrations. Many cultures share myths of creation with some sonorous event. Sound is a very broad topic, however, especially in the world of energy medicine. In this article, I will focus on what I have learned about how we can harness sound and vibration for healing. Cymatics I recently attended a lecture on vibrational medicine techniques by Mandara Cromwell, DCM. She was the first to introduce me to the history of sound healing and highlighted the work of Dr. Hans Jenny, a medical doctor and natural scientist who once taught at Rudolph Steiner's school in Zurich. Dr. Jenny later went on to coin a new term, \"cymatics\" (\"kymatics\" in German), which he used to describe the study of sound wave phenomena. His invention called the \"tonoscope\" was the first in history to use technology to make sound frequencies visible. You may have seen cymatics \"do-it-yourself\" plates on the Internet. The basic procedure involves sprinkling sand on top of a metal plate; then, as a violin bow is strummed on the side of the plate, the vibrating sand forms geometric patterns. Jenny's lectures focused on sound as the organizing and integrating pulse behind all matter. The photos from his book Cymatics1 give a never-before-seen glimpse into the universe, showing that it is full of sound and vibratory patterns. Live footage of some of Jenny's experiments, generating images produced by his tonoscope, is totally captivating.2 Jenny's findings on sound creating form are even more insightful, particularly so when he begins to make the connection to the human form. He wrote: \"Throughout the animal and vegetable kingdom Nature creates in rhythms, periods, cycles, frequencies, reduplications, serial phenomena, sequences, etc. This is the style in which natural structures are built, and it is ubiquitous. If we take a few examples, we shall see that this is the all dominant mode of appearance. Let us look at histology, the science which deals with the structure of tissue. The very origin of the word tissue, Latin to weave, is a significant comment on the prevailing conditions: cells are arrayed in rows, one pattern following another. . . and fibers continue in sinews which irradiate into the ligaments and bone organization. In the fields of the sensory cells, in the layers of the ganglion cells, and in the immensely complex communications between these systems, we still find that this principle of periodic seriality prevails.\"1 Thanks to modern-day equipment developed by British acoustics researcher John Stuart Reid, including something called the Cyma- Scope, it has been possible to continue Jenny's early studies. Using advanced technology, the CymaScope creates spectacular visuals that allow us to see images of the sound frequencies made by a healthy cell, and, by comparison, the sound and image made by a cancer cell.3 Looking at the sound of cells is a new aspect of the field of cymatics. It seems that when cells are in a healthy state, they produce images of great beauty. When they are not healthy, the sound frequencies of the cells begin to display distortion. A STRESSFUL TIME As a nurse practitioner, I observe patients, but also the general trends that have effects on the patient population. Our bodies are burdened daily with numerous toxins that challenge the immune system\u2014through the food we eat, the air we breathe and the countless forms of environmental toxins that constantly bombard us and break down our health potential. Most healers in the world today would also agree that stress is one of the major underlying causes of disease and that long-term chronic stress leads to inflammatory processes that can accelerate the breakdown of the body's immune system, resulting in a host of diseases. And most certainly, many negative aspects of stress have come into play with the pandemic. These include, especially, the challenge of viewing the devastation of the disease worldwide and the extended period of time we have spent trying to understand the disease and how it will impact us in the future. Knowing about the detrimental effects of stress on the immune system, I began to search for non-pharmaceutical tools that could help patients begin to manage their stress levels and possibly prevent or dissipate the inflammation that could lead to serious illness. I believe we need tools to offset the effects of stress, so we can better support the immune system. That is our real defense. Throughout my nursing career, I have watched the western medical field struggle with using \"a pill for an ill\" and \"cut it out\" procedures, totally avoiding any other options for patients. But in more recent years, I have witnessed the emergence of more integrative health approaches. I was fortunate to be in one of the first GAPS protocol trainings given by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, and I have learned much in my association with the members of the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF) as a chapter leader. The holistic orientation of the esteemed WAPF membership continues to help bring attention to the wisdom of previous cultures combined with today's technologies. Cellular Coherence I have continued to further my education in the emerging area of energy medicine. Hence, my attendance at Mandara Cromwell's lecture on sound. When I first began listening to Cromwell's presentation, I already knew about the pros and cons of ultrasound\u2014 high frequencies that are inaudible\u2014but I then realized that she was speaking of audible sound: sound frequency patterns that could entrain the cells of the body into a type of coherence or state of health. The frequency patterns Cromwell works with are called \"commutations,\" so named by a British osteopath with the distinctive name of Dr. Peter Guy Manners. Manners, who passed away in 2009, spent some forty years researching therapeutic sound with other British and German scientists, striving to find the \"prime resonant frequencies\" that could most benefit the human form. These \"codes\" (combinations of five frequencies) were created to bring the body back into resonance with specific sound combinations. Cromwell spent years studying with Manners, concluding with a doctorate in Cymatic medicine, and has since carried on with Manners' body of work. Cromwell's contributions to the field of vibrational medicine have included continued research and development of frequency patterning as well as the invention of the Acoustic Meridian Intelligence (AMI) devices. Her AMI 750 device applies the fully researched sounds to the body transdermally, through the portals of the feet or hands. The commutations (frequency patterns) are transported along the meridian pathways, long known as the \"rivers of life\" in Chinese medicine. In my constant search for tools to improve our immediate environment by seeking \"protectors\" from electromagnetic fields (EMFs), I have wondered\u2014if we can use tools to diminish and block EMF frequencies, why couldn't we also use frequencies to heal? Thus, I was fascinated to hear Cromwell describe two published studies showing the regeneration of torn tendon tissue in horses using audible sound frequencies.4,5 The proof, revealed in the diagnostic ultrasound images, made perfect sense to me. The words of the \"sleeping prophet,\" Edgar Cayce, came to mind: \"Sound is the medicine of the future.\" The Oral Health Connection What happened next in Cromwell's presentation is exactly what prompted me to write this article. She began discussing how oral health is related to degenerative conditions. (I am proud to say that disease beginning in the oral cavity is not a new concept to WAPF members.) There are more than eighteen hundred published studies catalogued on PubMed linking oral health to serious illnesses and disease processes such as heart attacks, lung disease and cancer\u2014and those are only the beginning of a much longer list. Interestingly, ischemic conditions are sometimes detected when dentists use 3D cone beam imaging or when the patient reports dental pain as a symptom, thereby revealing the underlying deteriorating condition. Cromwell presented numerous thermal images of preliminary research with participants who showed significant inflammation in the oral region linked to an ongoing disease process in the body.6 All participants received the AMI 750 dental health protocol through the feet. This combination of frequencies is known to diminish the inflammatory process in the body. Admittedly, it is difficult to imagine that the whole body, particularly the oral cavity, can be affected by transmitting energy through the soles of the feet. But, we must remember, the principles of the AMI 750 come from one of the oldest medical systems in the world\u2014Chinese medicine. In one case, the thermographic image of the participant's front torso revealed the likely source of her health puzzle\u2014her inflamed breast area showed a pathway of inflammation leading from her oral cavity into her breast. The next slides were of a patient reporting \"tooth pain.\" The visit to two dentists rendered inconclusive reports. The thermal images showed the oral and neck regions taken before and after a six-week protocol that used sound frequencies administered through the feet. This technique sends the healing frequencies via meridian pathways to the organ systems. Remarkably, the \"after\" images showed that the inflammatory process was greatly diminished, and the inflamed lymphatic system was free of the congestion indicated in the pre-protocol \"before\" images. The next part of Cromwell's presentation showed a slide of a woman with two crowns, a bridge and some ceramic fillings. Though the patient reported no symptoms, there was evidence of significant inflammation around all the areas where dental work had been performed. I had to wonder just how long it would take for this level of inflammation to manifest into a health condition. Certainly, stress and other body burdens would also play a huge part in whether the patient could continue to fight off this undesirable trajectory. Many integrative health practitioners say you cannot heal your body until you fix your teeth. Though this may be true, the thought of using this type of sound could be a possible solution for people who cannot deal with all their dental issues right away\u2014whether for safety reasons (such as identifying a safe schedule for the removal of insufficient dental work) or financial reasons. Could this therapy also be of use as a preventive measure to keep one's health in balance? Stimulating the Life Force The information shared by Cromwell suggests that noninvasive sound may be able to help the body manage the burden of highly inflammatory processes and even undiagnosed infections. What I have observed, coupled with the thermographic images and numerous testimonials I have heard and read, is that not only is inflammation substantially reduced after using this type of audible sound frequency (with the AMI 750 device), but patients' energy and \"life force\" returns in an astounding way. Of course, this is what we would expect when two of the body's major struggles (stress and inflammation) are alleviated. Lowering stress and inflammation empowers our immune system, allowing us to begin to adapt to the challenges of the world much more effectively. At this juncture, it certainly seems possible that noninvasive sound therapy may be able to create enough \"life force\" to fight off the onset of disease. With the therapeutic sound frequency protocols that have been developed, we may finally have the tools needed to fortify our surrounding fields and keep our cells vibrating at their optimum health. From the experiments in Dr. Jenny's laboratory to the research of Reid, Manners and Cromwell, it is clear that it is time to take a closer look at the power of sound waves as a major force of healing and maintenance of overall health.
