Code: DEC Type of Request: InialModicaon of 06/30/2027 1.Descripon of Work A. Scope of Work/Services to be Contracted Out: Contractor is to providescal agent and intermediary services to parcipants/programs qualied to receive Early Care & Educaon Workforce Development Compensaon Iniaves funding to support the early educators of San Francisco. Contractor will disburse payments to parcipants/programs that successfully apply and meet specic criteria. Contractor will also issue payments to contracted providers for a series of ECE Workforce Compensaon Iniaves including but not limited to: Wages, Educaonal Pathways, Higher Degree Aainment, Working Condions, and Benets. Contractor may also conductscal payment transacons on behalf of the Department of Early Childhood (DEC) for other payments that are considered one-me-only miscellaneous services. Contractor must have a database and accounng infrastructure that allows for real-me data and reporng for all iniaves related to this strategic investment. B. Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: The Oce of Early Care & Educaon housed under the Human Services Agency was scheduled to become the Department of Early Childhood (DEC), beginning July 1, 2022 when we were joined by First 5 San Francisco. The Ordinance establishing the Department of Early Childhood was not executed unl mid-October 2022. However, the crical work and services sll needed to be provided to the community during thisme. As part of the merger and transion, DEC lost crical administrave services that were being performed by the Human Services Agency (HSA), including but not limited to: assistance with contract procurement and management, processing invoices, work orders, issuing payments and advances to providers, etc. Unfortunately, stang to provide the scope of work necessary to distribute, monitor, and report on the Early Care & Educaon Workforce Development Compensaon Iniaves that were developed aer the passage of BabyProp C on June 5, 2018. Inme, DEC may have enough stato create a back oce with the bandwidth and experse to handle these operaonal funcons. However, the funding for Baby Prop C was urgently needed by early educators aer being held up in court for several years. At the request of Mayor Breed a Request for Applicaons (RFA) for this funding was released prior to April 28, 2022, with grant funding scheduled to begin on July 1, 2022 for qualied organizaons/educators. As previously menoned, the ordinance was not approved unl October 2022 so there is a need to expedite a contract with a dedicatedscal intermediary and administrator to distribute, monitor, and report on the ongoing funding iniave implemented October 1, 2022. In addion, payments, reconciliaon, and reporng will have peaks in workload commencing at the end of each quarter and therefore would not be feasible to have dedicated permanent civil service classicaons to complete this work. Failure to contract these services may delay or pause future funding of the iniaves that are ongoing and exacerbate frustraons of San Francisco's early care and educaon community who have implemented this new iniave. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC. Yes, this type of service has been provided in the past for another City & County of San Francisco Department (see PSC-49329 1819 aached). D. Will the contract(s) be renewed? The need to renew will be dependent on having the stang necessary to execute the scope of work necessary for the Early Care & Educaon Workforce Development iniaves and jusfying the need for a permanent civil service classicaon for these tasks/services.Page 1E. If this is a request for a new PSC in excess ofve years, or if your request is to extend (modify) an exisng PSC by anotherve years, please explain why. N/A 2.Reason(s) for the Request A. Indicate all that apply (be specic and aach any relevant supporng documents): Immediately needed services to address unancipated or transional situaons, or services needed to address emergency situaons. Services required on an as-needed, intermient, or periodic basis (e.g., peaks in workload). B. Explain the qualifying circumstances: The Oce of Early Care and Educaon(OECE) and First 5 San Francisco Children and Families Commission (F5SF) united as a the new Department of Early Childhood (DEC) eecve July 1,2022 and the ordinance establishing the department happened in mid-October 2022. As part of this transion DEC will need to hire a team to handle the operaons including all back oce dues (i.e. budget, advances, invoicing, contract procurement, work orders, contract monitoring, etc.). In addion, the work will be intermient with quarterly payments, reporng, and reconciliaon that would bescally irresponsible to have full-me civil service employees assigned to do the work. 3.Descripon of Required Skills/Experse A. Specify required skills and/or experse: Requirement of a minimum of three years demonstrated experience in scal intermediary and reporng services in the public/private sector for enes with gross revenues of a minimum of $5,000,000 annually. Provider must have a comprehensive database and reporng system in place to provide accounng details and transacon reports. Have sucient working capital to providescal services prior to reimbursement at no addional cost to the City and County of San Francisco. The contractor also must have the ability to review detailed informaon from the CA Workforce Registry in order to verify educaonal aainment, hours worked, role, wage informaon, and produce reports on changes and impact that occur throughout the duraon of these targeted iniaves. B. Which, if any, civil service class(es) normally perform(s) this work? none C. Will contractor provide facilies and/or equipment not currently possessed by the City? If so, explain: 4.If applicable, what eorts has the department made to obtain these services through available resources withinthe City? The department does not have the administrave capacity or internal resources to manage direct payments to providers as part of these iniaves in amely manner. Also, payments are intermient and irregular, with a quarterly advance and reconciliaon for changes during thescal year. Therefore, it is not praccal to create the administrave capacity to manage the disbursements. 5.Why Civil Service Employees Cannot Perform the Services to be Contracted Out A. Explain why civil service classes are not applicable. No specic civil service class currently has the capacity nor equipment to facilitate the payment processes across the many providers that is required to be disbursed payments in advance and intermiently throughout thescal year. Especially as new iniaves are phased in to compliment exing eorts related to the early educaon workforce in San Francisco. B.

In December 2018, a City Ordinance passed amending the Administrative Code to establish the Early Care and Education for All Initiative , funded by appropriations from the Babies and Families First Fund. This ECE for All Initiative called for a nine-month planning process and charged the Office of Early Care and Education (OECE) to engage community to create a spending framework for the first five years of Prop C funding. The language in the ordinance provided guidance for uses of the funds to reflect the language included in the original ballot measure: Providing support for quality early care and education to all San Francisco children under the age of six from households whose incomes are at or below 85% of State Median Income, and who are listed as eligible, on that basis, to receive support for early care and education\u2014but who, because of a lack of available resources, are not receiving the full amount of support to which they are entitled; Providing financial support for measures to increase the compensation of early care and education professionals and staff by not less than 10%, with an ultimate goal of achieving parity in compensation with K-12 educators who have commensurate experience, in a manner designed to improve the quality and availability of early care and education; Providing support for quality early care and education to all San Francisco children under the age of four whose families earn up to and including 200% of Area Median Income, in a manner proportionate to family income (such that families with lower incomes receive proportionately more support); Undertaking other measures designed to improve access to quality early care and education services that support the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of San Francisco children under the age of six.Page7The community planning process undertaken by OECE engaged over 3,000 San Francisco multi-stakeholders participating in various sessions-bringing together parents, families, teachers, early care and education administrators and community members. The result, a comprehensive BABY PROP C FRAMEWORK that outlines the community priorities for this fund. Lawsuit The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (aka Jarvis Group) threatened the ECE for All initiative by challenging the legality of Prop C in court, claiming that a two-thirds super majority was required to raise taxes. The California Supreme Court rejected the Jarvis Group final appeal to Proposition C in April 2021, affirming the legality of the tax and upholding the will of San Francisco voters, delivering a major victory for children, families and early educators in San Francisco. Approved Uses OECE will administer Prop C funds with a commitment to the voters of San Francisco to implement the highest priorities of the ECE for All Initiative, to ensure children access high quality early care and education, and to increase compensation for the professionals working in this critical sector of our economy. Nonetheless, recent questions raised for the approved uses of Prop C funds necessitates OECE to provide information to the public. The Baby Prop C ballot measure outlined uses for tax collection when passed. Fifteen percent of the revenue collected is for the city/county General Fund for any uses determined by the City. The remaining 85% of the tax collection is designated for child care and early education, and funds the following eligible programming: Support for quality early care and education for children under the age of six in San Francisco families at 85% or less of State Median Income (SMI); Support for quality early care and education for children under the age of four in San Francisco families earning up to 200% of the Area Median Income (AMI); Page8Investment in comprehensive early care and education services that support the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of children under the age of six; Increasing compensation (including but not limited to wages, benefits, and training) of care professionals and staff in order to improve the quality and availability of early care and education for children under the age of six. Next Steps Moving forward, OECE is embarking on a period of community engagement and input to inform joint strategic planning with First 5 San Francisco. OECE and First 5 recognize the experiences and relationships of children in the first five years of life shape the architecture of their brain and build a foundation for future learning and success. Our planning process will center on the needs of quality early learning experiences during the earliest years to help set children on a path to thrive in school and life, while supporting their families. Accordingly, our joint strategic priorities will continue to mirror the Prop C language supported by San Francisco residents: Expand access to high quality, free/affordable early care and education, including greater support for low- to moderate income families Finance infrastructure and provide operating support to build out and sustain birth to 3 capacity (largest population on the waitlist) Improve educational qualifications and degree attainment for educators, and recruit and retain them through increased compensation For more information on Prop C, Strategic Planning and the latest research on healthy child development, visit the OECE website www.sfoece.org .

INTRODUCTION AND SOLICITATION SCHEDULE A. Introduction The Office of Early Care and Education (OECE) and First 5 San Francisco Children and Families Commission (F5SF) will unite under a new Department of Early Childhood (DEC) effective July 1, 2022.Summer 2022 marks the official unification of the Office of Early Care and Education (OECE) and First 5 San Francisco Children and Families Commission (F5SF) under a new Department of Early Childhood (DEC). This integrated department will be dedicated to the early care and education, health, and well-being of San Francisco's youngest residents, children under the age of five, and their families. The departments are working jointly towards a multi-year strategic and spending plan that enables the city of San Francisco to provide a strong early learning and care foundation that supports the whole child in school and lifelong success. DEC's purpose is to elevate the importance of early childhood, ensuring that every child reaches their full potential. DEC will focus attention to the wide ranging issues and challenges that families with young children face from the prenatal period through the early childhood years. DEC's purpose is to elevate public attention to the wide-ranging issues and challenges faced by parents and their children in San Francisco from the prenatal period through the early childhood years. Our partnership with other public agencies and community organizations will focus on equity-centered solutions that make our city the best place in the nation to raise young children. DEC is committed to the creation of an early childhood system in San Francisco designed to eliminate racial disparities in both opportunities and outcomes. The City and County of San Francisco has adopted racial equity and countering institutional racism as a priority in local decision-making. This work will also seek out innovative science and research to advance early educational equity and ensure San Francisco children have early learning opportunities in high quality programs. 1.General The San Francisco Human Services Agency (SF-HSA), Office of Early Care & Education (OECE), and First 5 San Francisco Children Commission (F5SF) announces its intent to seek proposals from organizations interested in contracting to serve as a fiscal agent and administrator of the SF Early Care and Education Workforce Development and Compensation Initiatives. The ECE Workforce Development and Compensation Initiative is designed to ultimately result in improved outcomes for children in San Francisco through the support of a well-compensated, stable, and supported ECE workforce. There are four separate initiatives that will be implemented in a phased approach: 1. Workforce Compensation (implementation July 2022) 2. Workforce Benefits (estimated implementation September 2022) 3. Working Conditions (estimated implementation December 2022) 4. Educational Pathways (TBD) The administrator/fiscal agent will ensure fund distribution and monitoring to the programs participating in the workforce compensation initiatives; with an estimated annual disbursement of $40M progressing to approximately $60M as new initiatives are implemented. Page 122.Background On June 5, 2018, the San Francisco electorate passed Proposition C (Prop C), a Commercial Rent Tax for Child Care and Early Education, by authorizing an additional tax on commercial property/leases with annual gross receipts over $1 million; excluded from this tax are nonprofits and other small businesses. In December 2018, a City Ordinance passed amending the Administrative Code to establish the Early Care and Education for All Initiative, funded by appropriations from the Babies and Families First Fund. This ECE for All Initiative called for a nine-month planning process and charged the Office of Early Care and Education (OECE) to engage community to create a spending framework for the first five years of Prop C funding. The language in the ordinance provided guidance for uses of the funds to reflect the language included in the original ballot measure, including: Providing financial support for measures to increase the compensation of early care and education professionals and staff by not less than 10%, with an ultimate goal of achieving parity in compensation with K-12 educators who have commensurate experience, in a manner designed to improve the quality and availability of early care and education; Undertaking other measures designed to improve access to quality early care and education services that support the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of San Francisco children under the age of six. The ECE Workforce Development and Compensation Initiatives are designed to address Early Care and Education (ECE) program quality and workforce retention and compensation pressures in city-funded early learning programming. Workforce stability and wellbeing will ultimately lead to improved outcomes for young children in San Francisco. 3.Diversity, Inclusion, and Racial Equity The San Francisco Human Services Agency, Office of Early Care & Education, and First 5 San Francisco are committed to a culture of inclusion. Everyone should have what they need to thrive no matter their race, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or country of origin. Our departments believe a diverse and inclusive workforce produces more creative and innovative outcomes for the organization, and ultimately, the children and families we serve. We are committed to addressing systemic racism that produces disparate outcomes, especially for people of color and the impact of governmental services can have by advancing racial equity in all aspects of our work, ensuring access to services and providing support to our communities by ensuring their ability to succeed and thrive. We seek partnerships with organizations and businesses that share our values in their organizational culture and program services. Our departments, via our contracted partners, can further advance efforts to address racial equity and inclusion across San Francisco. Request for proposals respondents must clearly demonstrate how these values are exemplified in their organizational and program operations. This should include a description of the organization's plans, strategies, and activities to address racial equity and inclusion among staff and program participants, as well as internal controls that regularly reviews current practices through the lens of racial equity and inclusion to identify areas of improvement.Page 13Additional examples of information to be provided include: the organization's mission and/or inclusion statements, non-discrimination documents, and/or other supporting documents, community outreach plans, staff training activities on racial equity, and a description of or data on the demographics of staff and program participants. 4.Selection Overview The City shall award a contract to the Proposer that meets the Minimum Qualifications of this Solicitation whose Proposal receives the highest-ranking score.

Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: The Oce of Early Care & Educaon will become the Department of Early Childhood (DEC), beginning July 1, 2022 when we are joined by First 5 San Francisco. As part of this merger and transion, OECE will be losing services that are currently being performed by the Human Services Agency (HSA), including but not limited to: assistance with contract procurement and management, processing invoices, work orders, issuing payments and advances to providers, etc. Unfortunately, OECE and First 5 lack the stang to provide the scope of work necessary to distribute, monitor, and report on the Early Care & Educaon Workforce Development Compensaon Iniaves that were developed aer the passage of Baby Prop C on June 5, 2018. Inme, DEC hopes to staup and create a back oce to handle these operaonal funcons. However, the funding for Baby Prop C is urgently needed by early educators aer being held up in court for years. At the request of Mayor Breed an Request for Applicaons (RFA) for this funding is supposed to be released prior to April 28, 2022, with grants beginning on July 1, 2022. Therefore, the Early Care & Educaon Workforce Compensaon iniaves urgently needs to contract with a dedicatedscal agent and administrator to distribute, monitor, and report on the funding iniave. In addion, payments, reconciliaon, and reporng will have peaks in workload commencing at the end of each quarter and therefore would not be feasible to have dedicated classicaons to complete this work. Failure to contract these services will further delay the start of the iniaves and exacerbate frustraons of San Francisco's early care and educaon community. C.

Scope of Work/Services to be Contracted Out: Contractors will perform scheduled and as-needed maintenance and support services for a variety of Fire Safety Systemps equipment and programming systems in use at the San Francisco Fire Department staons. As technology advances, equipment and systems that are used in the day-to-day operaon of Fire Alarm Systems are becoming increasingly more complicated and integrated with other devices and systems. Oen, in addion to proprietary characteriscs of the equipment, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are turning to soware soluons used in conjuncon with the equipment to achieve full and greater funconality. Services performed by the contractor(s) may include, but are not limited to: standard maintenance services, prevenve maintenance services, applying soware/rmware upgrades, system integraons, maintenance and equipment surveys, and/or wiping of protected informaon from devices. Systems which need maintenance will includere alarm and sprinkler systems. B. Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: This service is necessary in order to maintain equipment and programming systems in use at the San Francisco Fire Department. This will prolong the life of the equipment, and ensure that it funcons properly and at published manufacturer standards in order to maintain all warranes, performance specicaons and tolerances. Denial will result in equipment that does not work and would put the lives of personnel at risk. In addion, the Department would not be able to operate and provide for the daily funcon of operaons. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC. This service has not been provided previously. The need for these services applies to new technology in Fire Alarm Systems that have been recently installed in newre staon construcons. The warranty period for many of these systems are coming up on expiraon, and the need for more regular maintenance is falling on the Fire Department. D. Will the contract(s) be renewed? YesPage 44E. If this is a request for a new PSC in excess ofve years, or if your request is to extend (modify) an exisng PSC by anotherve years, please explain why. The PSC isve years, because there will be an ongoing need to maintain Fire Alarm Systems in use at the San Francisco Fire Department, and to procure customized support services. Equipment and soware are needed for Fire Alarm Systems, and the City does not have the resources to maintain this equipment and soware. 2.Reason(s) for the Request A. Indicate all that apply (be specic and aach any relevant supporng documents): Services required on an as-needed, intermient, or periodic basis (e.g., peaks in workload). Services that require resources that the City lacks (e.g., oce space, facilies or equipment with an operator). B. Explain the qualifying circumstances: Equipment must be maintained on a scheduled basis. Prevenve maintenance or as-needed repairs for each equipment occur on an infrequent schedule, and given the wide variety of equipment in use it would be impraccal to stamulple posions with experse on mulple types of equipment on a fullme basis. Contractors will supply the personnel, and repair facilies, which may include depot repair facilies, all tools, soware, parts and other proprietary equipment used to service, upgrade and repair equipment in order to maintain and keep equipment in good working order. 3.Descripon of Required Skills/Experse A. Specify required skills and/or experse: The Naonal Fire Protecon Associaon (NFPA) codes state \"all inspecon, tesng, and maintenance ofre alarm systems shall conform to the equipment manufacturer's recommendaons\".

The Naonal Fire Protecon Associaon (NFPA) codes 25 and 72 further state that \"service personnel shall be qualied and experienced in the inspecon, tesng, and maintenance ofre alarm & sprinkler systems\" and denes qualied personnel as \"factory trained and cered\". Currently, Johnson Controls Fire Protecon is the only service provider with technicians that have current factory training cercaons on all Simplex brandedre safety equipment. Due to the specic nature of the re alarm systems relave to there sprinkler systems installed at San Francisco Fire Departmentre staons, it is highly recommended that Johnson Controls Fire Protecon inspects and services these systems to maintain operaonal reliability and service provider accountability. There sprinkler systems are integrated with regard to the tesng, maintenance and servicing of the Simplex branded Fire Alarm Systems.Page 454.If applicable, what eorts has the department made to obtain these services through availableresources within the City? When applicable, there are City resources which can repair equipment. However, for the Fire Alarm Systems in use by the Department, it would be impraccal to have City resources maintain all equipment. 5.Why Civil Service Employees Cannot Perform the Services to be Contracted Out A. Explain why civil service classes are not applicable. Civil service classes are not applicable because of the wide range of equipment and systems that need repair, support or integraon services. The City would need specialized stato repair individual pieces of equipment that may only be needed for a specic task or purpose. B. If there is no civil service class that could perform the work, would it be praccal and/or feasible to adopt a new civil service class to perform this work? Explain.

Because the experse in specicdisciplines sought through the as-needed contracts are highly specialized and required occasionally for specic tasks, that experse generally is not within thescope of exisng civil service classicaons and is not available from exisng City sta. Many of the services sought through the as- needed contracts involveresources are not available within the City, such as lease negoaon support.

Scope of Work/Services to be Contracted Out: The proposed work involves the design, fabricaon, installaon, and training for specialized machinery necessary to replace the Cable Car cables. In order to replace each of the four cables in the Cable Car system, two separate, specialized reeling machines are required. One machine funcons as a rewinder unit in that it collects a damaged and/or old cable, and the other funcons as a holdback in that it dispenses a new cable into the system while maintaining tension in the line during the cable replacement procedure. B. Explain why this service is necessary and the consequence of denial: The Cable Car Holdback and Rewinder machines are necessary for the replacement of the cables that provide tracon power to the historic Cable Car rail vehicles. The current machinery was furnished in the 1980's and has experienced unexpected issues in recent years. The Cable Car system relies solely on these machines to perform cable replacements. Were the holdback or rewinder to experience unexpected breakdown due to the age of the machinery, the system would be facing an extended shutdown as it would be without the equipment necessary to address the cable damage and age that would require cable replacement. Therefore, the machines should be replaced. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC. No D. Will the contract(s) be renewed? No E. If this is a request for a new PSC in excess ofve years, or if your request is to extend (modify) an exisng PSC by anotherve years, please explain why: This is a specialized piece of crical equipment.

The work entails specialized engineering and installaon of a modern wire rope reeling machine to replace machinery that is highly impacul to the operaon of the Cable Car system and has outlived its useful life. B. Reason for the request for modicaon: Due to a lack of administrave resources and the requirement for transioning to a dierent contract delivery method, the contract was not executed within 1 year of the original PSC approval. The modicaon desired is a shiof from 11/17/2020-11/17/2023 to 02/06/2023- 02/06/2029. The inial request was for 3 years but did not consider the period of extended warranty.

Were the holdback or rewinder to experience unexpected breakdown due to the age of the machinery, the system would be facing an extended shutdown as it would be without the equipment necessary to address the cable damage and age that would require cable replacement. Therefore, the machines should be replaced. C. Has this service been provided in the past? If so, how? If the service was provided under a previous PSC, aach copy of the most recently approved PSC.
