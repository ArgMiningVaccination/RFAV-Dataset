Recognizing that deployed Veterans have unique health care problems, we strive to improve the health of Veterans with war related ill - nesses and injuries. There are three WRIISCs - located in East Orange, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Palo Alto, California. We provide spe - cialized clinical and referral ser - vices to Veterans and their health care providers for a wide variety of post deployment health con - cerns. Each WRIISC has a multidis - ciplinary team of health pro - fessionals who are experts in responding to a wide variety of post-deployment health con - cerns. This includes focusing on exposure related concerns and symptoms and syndromes that do not have clear medical explanations. The WRIISC has access to a wide variety of medical professionals in - cluding: medical doctors, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, specialists in environmental expo - sure assessments, psychologists, neuropsychologists, social workers, chaplains, health professionals that spe - cialize in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) such as acupuncturists and yoga instructors, and risk communication, and health education spe - cialists. We focus on maintaining and increasing our knowledge about deployment health topics impor - tant for both recently returned Veterans and Veterans of prior conflicts. Because there are only three WRIISCs, an important part of our mission is to educate provid - ers on how to respond to Veterans with deployment related health concerns.Giving the Care Veterans Deserve - A focus on clinical services A unique aspect of the WRIISC program is that Veterans have the opportunity to be evaluated by our multi-dis - ciplinary team of health professionals in one visit and findings from all of these providers are integrated. Our comprehensive clinical evaluations take a holistic ap - proach, focused on addressing the health issues of concern to the Veteran and are unique in the context of the (Department of Defense) DoD-VA medical sys - tem. These examinations allow us to help the individual Veteran and their providers to better ad - dress the Veteran's post-deploy - ment health issues. At the end of an evaluation, each Veteran is provided with an in - dividualized treatment plan - or road map - for managing their health going forward into the future. To ensure appropri - ate follow up care, the findings from the WRIISC evaluations are shared with the Veteran's pri - mary care doctor. Because we focus on making the Veteran an active part of their treatment plan, we em - phasize the importance of a good relationship with a regular health care provider. We work to help connect Veterans with health services in the VA health care sys - tem and regular VA health care providers. Responding to Medically Unexplained Symptoms Since our inception, the WRIISC has developed signif - icant expertise on evaluating and assisting Veterans with complex deployment related health problems or symptoms that are difficult to diagnose or med - ically unexplained. Although there is no tradition - al \"cure\" for these symptoms and they often remain 2 | September 2009 The WRIISC: Experts in Post-Deployment Healthunexplained, there are ways to manage these symp - toms and improve the quality of life of Veterans with Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS). WRIISC cli - nicians and researchers are experts in looking at things shown to improve the quality of life from fitness and exercise to cognitive behavioral therapy to improving sleep hygiene. We focus on improving the Veteran's level of function through these things and also by em - powering the Veteran to take an active role in treating their symptoms. Recently Returned Veterans - Meeting the Mark The WRIISC is on the front lines of responding to and caring for Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation Iraq Freedom (OEF/OIF). One of our most important clinical missions is to prevent the develop - ment of long-term health problems related to deploy - ment On a broader level we recognize the significance of rapidly assessing emerging post-deployment health problems and concerns that may affect large num - bers of recently returned Veterans nationally, which we then educate the VA and non-VA provider communi - ty about. Most importantly, we recognize that our new - est Veterans need special at - tention and care during the transition to civilian life. Our programs and services for OEF/OIF Veterans focus on promoting Veterans' emo - tional wellness by identifying the issues affecting their well-being, readjustment, and offering assistance in managing those very real problems. Addressing Exposure Concerns Many Veterans, including those recently returned, have concerns that military exposures may have neg - atively impacted their health or could in the future. Addressing exposure concerns of our newest Veterans upon their return to the United States is an important part of meeting their needs and providing high quality post-deployment care. The WRIISC has extensive ex - perience in conducting Veteran exposure assessments. WRIISC occupation - al and environmental specialists conduct environmental exposure evaluations on all Veterans seen for comprehensive evaluations. These evaluations are also available as a stand alone service to any Veteran with deployment or service related ex - posure concerns in person or by telephone. A National Resource for Providers Part of the national mission of the WRIISC is to edu - cate the primary care community on a wide variety of Veterans' post deployment health concerns, including medically unexplained symptoms and environmen - tal exposures. Our efforts are modeled on good prin - ciples of risk communication and focus on communicat - ing and providing education and training that will en - hance knowledge of deploy - ment health. We continue to provide educational and risk communication support to other clinicians throughout our local VA communi - ties by providing seminars, workshops and conferences and developing written products such as fact sheets. Importance of Research Teams of researchers and clinicians at the WRIISCs work side-by-side to use research to improve clinical care. We are dedicated to conducting research aimed at preventing and treating war related health prob - lems. Current WRIISC studies focus on issues including women's health, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and read - justment and reintegration. We envision that through our work there will be improved health of the Veteran population on a national level. WRIISC Advantage | 3We provide specialized clinical and referral services to Veterans and their health care providers.The WRIISC, as a nationwide specialty service, evaluates Veterans after they come home from their deployment in hopes of quick - ly identifying issues they are dealing with that might affect large numbers of Veterans nationally. Identifying these emerging concerns of Veterans when they come home from their deployment is essential to most effectively addressing the problems our return - ing Veterans are faced with and to prevent problems from occurring in the future to the extent possible. Another goal is to educate the VA and Non-VA pri - mary care community about our findings so that post deployment health can be improved for Veterans na - tionally. We accomplish this goal through many meth - ods including the development of written educational materials, publishing research findings, and hosting seminars, workshops, and conferences. Veterans seen at the WRIISC are provided with an in - dividualized and comprehensive clinical assessment of post deployment health which includes a thorough history and physical, psychological interview, neu - ropsychological screening, environmental exposure assessment, social work evaluation, and education ses - sion. Prior to their appointment, WRIISC Veterans are asked to complete an extensive health intake packet. This questionnaire consists of over 400 questions and screens the Veterans for chronic fatigue syndrome, irri - table bowel syndrome, widespread pain, migraine dis - order, depression, PTSD, traumatic brain injury and blast injury. The Sf-36 which is a health survey used in both clinical and research settings is incorporated to collect data on physical function and mental health symptoms. The questionnaire also assesses past med - ical history, family history, social history and military exposures. In 2005, the WRIISC located in East Orange New Jersey (NJ WRIISC) implemented a clinical research extraction project for the purposes of methodically identifying 4 | September 2009 Identifying Emerging Problems in RECEnTly RETuRnEd VETERanSemerging post deployment health concerns. With ap - proval from the New Jersey Health Care Institutional Review Board (IRB), we have been systematically extract - ing, through a retrospec - tive chart review, the health concerns of the OEF/OIF Veterans we evaluate. With this effort, we hope to iden - tify the medical and men - tal health concerns as well as the environmental expo - sures being reported. These findings along with the in - formation collected in our screening intake packet, are data based for future anal - ysis. As the numbers of Veterans we evaluate contin - ues to grow, we will continue to look for emerging post deployment health trends in this population. What have we seen so far? In 2007, the WRIISC published an article in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (Helmer et al, 2007) reporting the health and exposure concerns of the first 56 OEF/OIF Veterans evaluated at the NJ WRIISC. In this review, we found that the most com - monly reported health concerns were related to three systems; musculoskeletal, ears, nose and throat (ENT) and gastrointestinal. Examples of specific conditions within these systems include rhinitis, sinusitis, chron - ic knee pain, and low back pain. Among the mental health concerns, PTSD was the most prominent diag - nosis. Exposure concerns varied with the three most common being air quality, depleted uranium, and mul - tiple vaccinations. The findings in this paper offer insight into some of the unique needs of this population. Specifically, Veterans reporting exposure concerns were primarily worried about the possible long term health effects. This find - ing indicates the need for individualized evaluation of Veterans and education about exposure concerns. In recognizing this need the WRIISC has championed the effort to educate primary care providers about how to conduct an environmen - tal exposure assessment on Veterans and how provid - ers can effectively and effi - ciently communicate with Veterans about their con - cerns. WRIISC clinicians have also hosted several events to teach providers about the top exposure is - sues, to give them the facts and the most recent re - search findings. At the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS) 2008 conference, a poster titled Pain, mental health, and physical function in OEF/OIF Veterans was pre - sented. We described the prevalence of self-report - ed chronic widespread pain in a sample of 223 OEF/ OIF Veterans evaluated at the WRIISC. We looked at the associations among pain, mental health concerns, and function in this growing cohort using standard - ized self-report screening instruments which are incor - porated into the WRIISC intake packet. In conclusion we found that pain is common in OEF/OIF Veterans, including chronic pain occurring in multiple locations and that this pain interferes significantly with daily functioning. Currently, we are examining our data to find the prev - alence of migraine in the OEF/OIF population evaluat - ed at the WRIISC. As the number of Veterans evaluated at the WRIISC continues to increase, we will continue to look for post deployment health trends in this population. Identifying these issues can have implications in practice which may include what recently returned Veterans should be screened for and how they should be treated. A unique strength of the WRIISC is our ca - pacity to impact health and health care for our new - est Veterans and Veterans of future eras by learning from both our clinical and research efforts and shar - ing this knowledge within the VA and non VA general provider community. WRIISC Advantage | 5Veterans reporting exposure concerns were primarily worried about the possible long term health effects .The popularity of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has grown tre - mendously over the past several years. One of the reasons for this is the growing recog - nition that conventional treatments have limitations- -for example, medication side effects, prolonged time commitments, and perceived psychosocial stigma. As a result, more and more people, including Veterans, are turning to CAM therapies. At the WRIISC located in Washington, D.C. (DC WRIISC), we recently started a Complementary and Alternative Medicine Program dedicated to improving the health of combat Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. This program was created in response to some of the health con - cerns of returning combat Veterans who wanted additional treatment options for some of their com - plex health issues. Since the establishment of the DC WRIISC CAM program, many Veterans with deploy - ment related injuries or illnesses have found these therapies helpful in reducing their symptoms and in - creasing their level of function. In our ongoing mis - sion to improve the health of deployed Veterans, the VA's three WRIISCs are actively looking at how CAM treatments might further meet the needs of our com - bat Veterans. What is CAM? CAM is often described as a diverse group of health care practices and products that generally are not con - sidered part of conventional medicine. CAM typically refers to any practice that does not fall within the con - ventional realm of Western medicine. There are many different types of CAM therapies. CAM treatments usually are divided into several categories: Mind-body treatMents: 1. These therapies use a variety of techniques designed to improve the mind's ability to affect bodily symptoms. Examples include meditation, relaxation therapy, prayer, and creative arts and music. biologically based therapies:2. These therapies are based on substances found in nature such as herbs, food, and vitamins. Examples include dietary supplements and herbal products. Manipulative and body-based treatMents:3. Th e s e therapies focus on manipulation and movement of one or more body parts. Examples include massage therapy, chiropractor manipulation, yoga therapy, and tai chi. 6 | September 2009 ComPlEmEnT aRy and alTERna TIVE mEdICInE at the War Related Illness and Injury Study Centerenergy therapies:4. These therapies focus on the use of energy fields. Examples include therapeutic touch, Reiki, and bio-electromagnetic based therapies. Whole Medical systeMs: 5. A primary example of this is the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (on which acupuncture is based). Why CAM? There is a growing body of research that supports the use of CAM therapies for many physical and men - tal symptoms including depression, PTSD, addiction, headaches, musculoskeletal pain, Fibromylagia, and in - somnia. However, there are still a number of unan - swered questions about CAM treatments, including questions about efficacy, quality, safety, and cost-ef - fectiveness. As more Veterans and their providers seek CAM therapies, there is an increased demand for more research to support the use and integration of these therapies into the mainstream care of Veterans. As a national post-deployment health resource for the Department of Veterans Affairs, WRIISC researchers are actively trying to answer some of these questions so that returning combat Veterans can have a wide ar - ray of available options to meet their health needs. CAM at the WRIISC: Many VA Medical Centers across the country of - fer CAM treatments. Some examples include acu - puncture, acupressure, aromatherapy, massage therapy, meditation, music therapy, progressive relax - ation, stress management/relaxation therapy, tai chi, and yoga therapy. The CAM program at the WRIISC is part of our overall comprehensive clinical program and is one of our ongoing efforts to provide innovative treatments to deployed Veterans with complex illness - es or injuries. Presently, Veterans enrolled in the DC Y oga Nidra is a guided meditation practice that can lead to improved psychological, physical, and spiritual well-being. It teach - es meditation skills that can be used to help people master and deal successfully with difficult situations and thus achieve a sense of ease in their lives. Y oga Nidra can be beneficial in healing unresolved issues, traumas, and wounds in the body, mind and senses and in recognizing the peace of mind that is always present in the midst of all of life's changing and sometimes challenging circumstances. WRIISC Advantage | 7\"Wow - this is the most relaxed I can remember ever feeling \"8 | September 2009Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a hot top - ic in the news beginning with an article in Newsweek citing brain injury as the \"singu - lar\" injury of the Iraq conflict (March, 2006) to a pop culture magazine reporting on the seeming - ly minor, yet eventually fatal head injury suffered by Natasha Richardson (March 2009). There is increased interest in studying brain injury in the military and growing concern for the long term health consequenc - es of brain injury. The challenges we face in diagnosing and treating TBI can be illustrated by the stories of Marine Cpl. Samuel Reyes, Jr. and Natasha Richardson. Natasha Richardson fell and hit her head during a ski lesson (no helmet). Although she appeared fine after the fall no loss of TBI: What is it and how do we recognize and treat it? hot off the pressWRIISC CAM program may receive individualized acu - puncture, group acupuncture, and/or Yoga Nidra ther - apies. So far, Veteran reaction to these CAM programs has been positive. Due to the high degree of Veteran satisfaction with these programs, all WRIISC locations are taking steps to expand their CAM programs. Some possible additional therapies may include Reiki and massage therapies. The goal of the WRIISC CAM pro - gram is to improve the overall health and well being of our combat Veterans. Summary: As Veteran demand for CAM therapies intensifies, we anticipate more and more VA Medical Centers will be - gan to offer these therapies. CAM therapies are valu - able treatments that can be used to address many Veteran health concerns, including deployment relat - ed health concerns. However, it is important to discuss any CAM treatment decisions with your primary care provider as CAM treatments may, on rare instances, have side effects or interfere with conventional health care treatments. Additionally, because CAM treat - ments may vary in terms of quality, it is important to seek treatment from a reputable CAM practitioner. If you are interested in CAM therapy at the VA, please contact your VA primary care provider to found out which CAM programs are available at your local VA.

Her inju - ry would have initially been characterized as a \"mild\" trau - matic brain injury (mTBI). Cpl. Reyes suffered a non-pen - etrating head injury as a result of a roadside bomb. Due to advances in body armor, hel - mets, and drastically improved battlefield medicine, he survived a blast that as recently as 15 years ago may have been fatal. Cpl. Reyes received no penetrating injury to the head yet he is left with severe deficits in memory and concentration. It is estimated that 20-30% of returning Veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq (OEF/OIF) have reported some type of head injury while serving on ac - tive duty. Head injury in combat is not new - what is new is that veterans are surviving other catastroph - ic injuries and left to struggle with the effects of TBI. The increasing number of TBI survivors and the vexing limitations they face has be - come an enormous challenge for both military medicine and for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will treat these survivors for life. What is TBI? TBI is an event. It is typically defined by the experience of any outside force that leads to at least one of these symptoms: loss of conscious - ness, loss of memory for things that happened imme - diately before or after the event, a change in mental state at the time of the event, or problems with spe - cific neurological functions. The TBI event can be a direct blow to the head, an indirect force from a mo - tor vehicle accident involving whiplash, a penetrating force of an object entering the brain, or force generat - ed by a blast pressure wave. Symptoms resulting from a TBI can differ widely de - pending on what part of the brain is involved ( see diagram ).

It is easy to recognize a penetrating brain injury but symptoms resulting from non-penetrating injuries may not appear until days or weeks after the injury. At the time of injury severity of TBI is characterized by ratings on several tests such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) which measures eye movement, ability to talk, and the ability to move. Other tests measure length of time that the individual lost consciousness or was disoriented, and whether or not they remember events before and after the brain injury. These tests are important initially but they do not help to predict long-term problems. As Natasha Richardson and Cpl. Reyes cases illustrate, an initially labeled \"mild\" TBI can lead to severe problems later on including severe disability or death. Symptoms of TBI correspond to the location of injury in the brain ( see diagram on previous page ). Neuropsychological testing can pinpoint specific functions that are impaired which map to particular locations in the brain. A person may feel dazed and confused and not like themselves for several days or weeks after a mild TBI. Some symptoms appear right away and some develop days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms include headache, confusion, lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue, change in sleep patterns and mood, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, and thinking. These symptoms are often called post concussive symptoms. In battle, soldiers are often unaware they've experienced a TBI because the urgency of the battlefield is their number one priority. They may not realize it until much later when they begin to experience post concussive symptoms such as slower reaction times and emotional and cognitive problems.How do we treat TBI? On the battlefield, initial medical care prevents further injury by maintaining blood flow, blood pressure and oxygen. Once the soldier is stable, they assess the brain injury using the GCS and will rate the TBI accordingly. If available, tests such as X-ray, CT scan or MRI can detect if the skull is cracked and if there is bleeding or swelling. It is important to relieve pressure on the brain before more damage is done so these initial diagnostic tests are important. Once a patient has recovered from the initial trau - ma, many brain injury experts recommend that the patient receive a thorough assessment by a trained neuropsychologist to determine the level of cognitive function, assess impairments in specific skills, execu - tive function, and other behavioral changes. Based on these findings, it is possible to develop a customized program of rehabilitation for each patient. Medications can help but caution should be used when prescribing medications to patients with brain injury. Brain injury can make the patient more sensitive to side effects of medications so it is important to start with very low doses and increase dosages very slowly. Avoid medications that can impair cognition such as certain anti-anxiety and pain relief medications. What's Next? The WRIISC is involved in clinical research to im - prove diagnosis and treatment for OEF/OIF veterans who have received a brain injury as a result of deploy - ment. Injuries that are the result of exposure to blasts from improvised explosive devices (IED) are difficult to diagnose. One goal is to determine the location and nature of the injury and to develop injury-specif - ic rehabilitation programs that will help veterans re - gain function and enable them to lead healthy and productive lives. It's possible to develop a customized program for each patient .WRIISC Advantage September 2009 produced by the War related Illness and Injury Study Center Editor: Susan L.

We work hard at this goal on both a local and national level- we want to help as many Veterans as possible. Each WRIISC is responsible for outreach - ing to Veterans and pro - viders in their geographic/ assigned catchment area. Some key employees in the VA community include hospital direc - tors, primary care doctors, OEF/OIF coordinators, mental health clinicians and local vet center staff. Organizations outside the VA community include colleges and universities, military organizations and Veterans' service organizations. A key form of outreach is word of mouth from the Veterans we see and providers who have referred Veterans to us. The WRIISCs are also involved in joint outreach/education efforts on a national level. One example is the breakout sessions we will host at a VA/DoD OEF/OIF Conference, Evolving Paradigms II in Las Vegas the week of September 21, 2009, that focuses on the health concerns of OEF/OIF Veterans. Topics that we will cover in this event will include understanding and assessing environmental ex - posures, an update on deployment research and complementary and alternative medicine. By sharing our expertise and educating a large number of health care providers about our programs and ser - vices we hope to reach more Veterans nationally. In the past year, our efforts to \"spread the word\" have resulted in the establishment of a National WRIISC website. This site contains infor - mation for both Veterans and providers including information on our clinical services, the referral process, deployment related health conditions and concerns, exposure related information, current re - search studies and upcoming educational events and conferences. Both Veterans and providers will find links to fact sheets specific to their needs.
