Massachusetts law specifies the following immunizations: - two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine given at least one month apart beginning at or after 12 months of age; and - one dose of tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (Tdap) is required, if it has been 5 years or more since the last dose of tetanus/diphtheria (Td); and - three doses of Hepatitis B vaccine; and - all full-time students, 21 years of age and younger, and all students(regardless of age) living in a dormitory or other congregate on-campus housing, will be required to have immunization with the Meningococcal vaccine to protect against serotypes A, C W and Y, on or after their 16th birthday, or the student/parent/legal guardian may sign the Meningococcal Information and Waiver Form developed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health; and - a history of varicella (chicken Pox) disease verified by a health care provider, or two doses of Varicella vaccine given at least 1 month apart beginning at or after 12 months of age. A copy of an immunization record from a school or medical provider's office indicating receipt of the required immunizations may be presented; or in the case of measles, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis B, or varicella, laboratory evidence of immunity. The law provides for medical and/or religious exemptions. Provision is also made to allow students to register on condition that the required immunizations are obtained within thirty days of enrollment. Students must submit the Worcester State University Health and Immunization form, completed by a medical provider, in order to register for courses. In addition to the required immunizations, this form includes a physical exam completed within 15 months of entrance to school, and the completion of the Tuberculosis Risk Screening Questionnaire. All resident students must have a complete Worcester State University Health Form in order to move into the residence halls. All students, listed previously, must have a complete Worcester State University Health Form in order to register for classes. If a student does not have a complete Worcester State University Health Form within 30 days of enrollment, a Health Hold is placed on his/her account, and he/she will not be able to register for classes the next semester.
