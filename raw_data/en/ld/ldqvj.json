To be sure, many policymakers and commentators still focus unduly on the problems in the Chinese intellectual property system.8 Notable examples from the past few years 2.

Part II recounts China's innovative turn, tracing the developments back to the mid-2000s when Chinese leaders began to make a major policy push toward the development of independent innovation. Part III examines the changing pharmaceutical landscape in China, drawing illustrations from the recently proposed amendments to Chinese patent law and pharmaceutical regulations. Part IV explores the ramifications of China's increasing assertiveness in the pharmaceutical arena, at both the domestic and global levels. Specifically, this Part discusses three sets of ramifications: the changing discourse on intellectual property developments in China, the internal challenges that confront the country at this time of policy transition, and the global complications that will affect the future development of the international trading and intellectual property systems.

As one commentator observed: The Yellow Emperor's Classic provides the first recorded evidence of widespread use of [traditional Chinese medicine] in mainland China. This ancient text, written prior to 85 B.C., details traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment. Later written examples of traditional diagnosis and healing testify to China's rich medical history, as well as to some correlation between the basic theories and products used for treatment.

Immediately after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, patent protection was retained in the Provisional Regulations Governing Invention and Patent Rights, which was adopted in 1950 and also covered inventors' certificates. Pursuant to these regulations, the first Chinese patent issued to the inventor of a soda-making process. ZHENG CHENGSI WITH MICHAEL D. PENDLETON, CHINESE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER LAW 52 (1987). Nevertheless, patents were quickly phased out, and emphasis had shifted toward other types of awards or remuneration in the next three decades: [The 1950] regulations were quickly modified in 1954 with the enactment of the Provisional Regulations Concerning Awards for Inventions with Regard to Products, Technical Improvements and Rationalisation Proposals. Between 1950 and 1963, \"only four patents and six inventor certificates were granted\". In December 1963, the regulations were once again replaced by the Regulations Concerning Awards for Inventions and the Regulations Concerning Awards for Technical Improvement Proposals. Many of these regulations were direct transplants from the Soviet Union. Yu, Building the Ladder, supra note 14, at 5 (footnotes omitted). 19.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 597 Although the 1984 statute ushered in a new innovation system, its effectiveness \"was greatly limited by a lack of experience with patent protection, the uneasiness about introducing private rights in a socialist environment and a myriad of compromises struck in the drafting process.\"21 Notably, Article 25 excluded \"pharmaceutical products, and substances obtained by means of a chemical process,\"22 similar to the exclusions found in the patent laws of India and other developing countries.23 Such limited protection in the patent area, as well as in other areas of intellectual property law such as copyright,24 eventually led to increased external pressure from the United States and other developed countries.25 In January 1992, China signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Protection of Intellectual Property with the United States, agreeing to strengthen the protections for pharmaceuticals.26 Article 1(a) stated explicitly that \"[p]atents shall be available for all chemical inventions, including pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, whether products or processes.\"27 Article 2 further noted China's \"agree[ment] to provide administrative protection to U.S. pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical product inventions.\"28 Pursuant to this memorandum of understanding, China amended its patent law in September 1992,29 expanding the scope of protection to cover foods, beverages, condiments, pharmaceutical products, and \"substances obtained by means of a chemical process.\"30 In addition, the amended law added the right to 21.

Yu et al., China and the The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 599 While the Chinese patent system experienced considerable changes in its first two decades of existence, its repeated reforms were tailored more to external demands than to changing internal conditions.45 It was not until the adoption of the third amendment in December 2008 that China was able to make major adjustments to the patent system based on its own needs, interests, conditions, and priorities.46 As Guo He observed, \"The impetus for the early amendments came from outside, whilst the need for the third amendment originated from within China, that is to say, the majority of the third amendment was to meet the needs of the development of the domestic economy and technology originating in China.\"47 Reflecting \"the country's growing emphasis on using patents to help develop a knowledge-based economy,\"48 the 2008 Patent Law increased the amount of damages and fines, including statutory damages.49 The law also allows for parallel importation while introducing the Chinese equivalent of a Bolar exception, which enables generic pharmaceutical producers to import, manufacture, or test a patented product prior to the expiry of the patent \"for the purpose of scientific research and experimentation\" or \"providing information required for administrative examination and approval.\"50 A few months before the adoption of this third amendment, the State Council adopted a new National Intellectual Property Strategy,51 which \"provided a comprehensive plan to improve the creation, utilization, protection, and administration of intellectual property rights.\"52 Paragraph 7 specifically emphasized the need for active development of independent or self-controlled intellectual property (zizhu zhishi chanquan).53 Building on this strategy and taking advantage of the new patent law amendment, the State Intellectual WTO: Progress, Perils, and Prospects, 17 COLUM.

As Dan Prud'homme observed: The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 601 actively applying for and obtaining patents at both the European Patent Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Based on the 2017 statistics concerning patent applications filed in the United States, residents from mainland China (32,127) were behind only those of Japan (89,364), South Korea (38,026), and Germany (32,771).62 According to the European Patent Office, about sixteen percent of its patent filings in that same year originated in China, which trailed behind only the United States and Japan.63 As if these statistics were not impressive enough, China ranked fourteenth in the 2019 Global Innovation Index,64 moving up from seventeenth in 2018, twenty-second in 2017, and twenty-fifth in 2016.65 As the 2019 report stated, \"China continues its upward rise . . . and firmly establishes itself as one of the innovation leaders.\"66 The country \"was [also] responsible for 24% of the world's [research-and-development] expenditures in 2017, up from only 2.6% in 1996.\"67 Although developments in the electronics and telecommunications industries have provided a key driving force behind China's recent innovative turn\u2014as evidenced by the global leadership Huawei, Oppo, BOE, Ping An, and until recently ZTE have assumed68\u2014the country in recent years has also made a major policy push toward actively developing the local pharmaceutical industry. For instance, in February 2006, the State Council released the National Medium- and Long-Term Plan for Science and Technology Development (2006-2020), which While patents are exploding in China and certain innovation is also on the rise, patent quality has not proportionately kept up and in fact the overall strength of China's actual innovation appears overhyped.

This protection would include introduction and enactment of laws and regulations to make sure that no person, other than the person who submitted such data, could, without the permission of the person who submitted the data, rely on such data in support of an application for product approval for a period of at least six years from the date on which China granted marketing approval to the person submitting the data. During this period, any second applicant for market authorization would only be granted market authorization if he submits his own data. This protection of data would be available to all pharmaceutical and agricultural products which utilize new chemical entities, irrespective of whether they were patent-protected or not.

IV. RAMIFICATIONS In view of China's growing assertiveness in this arena and the changing domestic and global pharmaceutical landscapes, this Part explores the ramifications such assertiveness will have in the intellectual property and public health areas. Specifically, the discussion focuses on three sets of ramifications: (1) the changing discourse on intellectual property developments in China; (2) the internal challenges that confront the country at this time of policy transition; and (3) the global complications that will affect the future development of the international trading and intellectual property systems. A. Changing Discourse Since the mid-1980s, China has become the poster child of intellectual property piracy and counterfeiting.111 Every year, the USTR puts the country on its watch list or priority watch list.112 In the past three years, its out-of-cycle reviews have placed Alibaba's Taobao on the list of notorious online markets.113 If pharmaceuticals are mentioned in the Chinese context, the discussion often focuses on counterfeit drugs.114 For example, in China Rx, Rosemary Gibson and toward producing innovative drugs.\"); WHO CHINA STUDY, supra note 1, at 17, 29 (\"Chinese manufacturers are moving away from reliance on API production toward [finished pharmaceutical products], in part because of generally low profit margins associated with APIs. . . .

As Daniel Chow observed: China is the largest exporter of counterfeit and substandard drugs in the world. It is also a major supplier of both genuine and substandard [APIs]. China makes counterfeit, substandard drugs and APIs for use in China and, perhaps more importantly, for export to countries around the world. The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 609 Janardan Prasad Singh warned about the increasing risks of the growing dependence of the global supply chain for pharmaceutical products and vitamins on the APIs originating in China.115 In the past few months, commentators also expressed similar concerns in relation to the potential shortages of medicines amid the COVID-19 pandemic.116 While piracy and counterfeiting remain relevant to any discussion of intellectual property protection and enforcement in China, and such discussion is unlikely to go away in the near future,117 one cannot overlook the many important developments that are now happening in the country. In the past decade, China has tremendously increased its innovative capabilities, relying on innovation models that are sometimes different from those found in the Western world.118 China has also made notable achievements in biotechnology (including genomics and stem cell research), space technology, information technology, These counterfeit exports can cause serious health problems, even deaths, and can subject MNCs [multinational corporations] to liability for these injuries. In addition, counterfeits can cause damage to the business reputation of MNCs and the goodwill associated with their brands. MNCs and the U.S. government have found themselves stymied in efforts to identify, locate, and shut down counterfeiters in China producing these illegal products. Daniel C.K.

In the same month that the United States filed its second WTO complaint against China for providing inadequate intellectual property protection and violating the TRIPS Agreement,124 WIPO announced that China had overtaken Japan to become the country with the second largest number of PCT applications in the world.125 Likewise, although U.S. politicians and policymakers have been quick to criticize the lack of intellectual property protection in the country, many of them express concern about China's growing technological competition with the United States.126 If traditional innovation and intellectual property theories are correct that a country needs good innovation and intellectual property policies to strengthen technological capabilities, the discourse cannot continue to emphasize the two ends of the spectrum without also recognizing developments in the middle. To be sure, the \"vast size, political and economic complexities, and often internally inconsistent laws and policies\" of China have made it possible for the simultaneous occurrence of developments at these two polarized ends.127 In fact, my past scholarship noted the possibility for China to \"emerge as a highly 119.

Internal Challenges The second area that deserves greater attention concerns the internal challenges that the changing pharmaceutical landscape will create within China. A notable characteristic of this vast, complex country is its highly uneven economic and technological developments. Commentators have widely noted the country's wide regional disparities131 and high Gini coefficient, which indicates the gap between the rich and the poor.132 To a large extent, China has the characteristics of \"a 'country of countries,' rather than a homogenous one.\"133 It would fit what Nobel Laureate Michael Spence described as a \"dual economy,\" 128. Yu, Yin-Yang School, supra note 127, at 13. 129. See id. (noting the \"need to come up with new theories, concepts, vocabularies and even schools of thought to address th[e] unforeseen situation\" in which a country will emerge as a highly innovative power while at the same time remaining as the world's biggest pirate nation); see also Peter K. Yu, A Spatial Critique of Intellectual Property Law and Policy, 74 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 2045, 2123-27 (2017) [hereinafter Yu, Spatial Critique] (discussing the possibility of developing differentiated intellectual property standards at the subnational level). 130. See Yu, Five Oft-Repeated Questions, supra note 89, at 113-14 (\"Although internal contradictions are not uncommon in China, especially when one takes into account the country's uneven regional, sectoral, and technological developments, this complex, dualistic, and highly dynamic picture suggests the possibility for a new phenomenon that the world has never seen before.\" (footnote omitted)); Yu, Yin-Yang School, supra note 127, at 13 (\"[A]lthough history has seen countries crossing over from the less respectful side of the intellectual property divide to the more promising one\u2014the United States, Japan and South Korea being some of the more notable instances\u2014no country has ever stayed on both ends of the spectrum at the same time.\"). 131. As I noted in an earlier article: China is large, complex, diverse, and \"sometimes internally contradictory.\" The Chinese speak different languages, enjoy different cuisines, grow up with different cultures, and subscribe to different historical and philosophical traditions. Conditions in Beijing are often very different from those in Guangzhou, intellectual property strategies that are effective in Shanghai are likely to fail in a village in western China, and the trade patterns found in the coastal areas are very different from those found in the inland areas.

Yu, Foreword to PATENTS AND INNOVATION IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG: TWO SYSTEMS IN ONE COUNTRY COMPARED xiv, xvii (Li Yahong ed., 2017) (\"According to the National of Statistics, [in 2016] China had a Gini coefficient of 0.465, one of the highest in the world.\"). 133. Yu, From Pirates to Partners II, supra note 8, at 963. 2020 / China's Innovative Turn and the Changing Pharmaceutical Landscape 612 which consists of \"a relatively rich one whose growth is constrained by the normal forces that constrain the growth of relatively advanced economies, and a poor one where the early-stage growth dynamics . . . just didn't start, owing to its separation from the modern domestic economy and the global economy.\"134 More specifically in the intellectual property area, China has experienced highly uneven technological developments. Consider, for instance, the number of invention patents filed and granted in its different provinces and autonomous regions. Based on CNIPA statistics, in 2018 Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang\u2014the provinces with the three largest volumes of applications\u2014had 216,469, 198,801, and 143,081 applications, respectively.135 Meanwhile, Jilin, Yunnan, and Shanxi (those provinces that ranked eighteenth to twentieth) had only 10,530, 9,606, and 9,395 applications, respectively.136 In the same year, the total numbers of patent grants for Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were 53,259, 42,019, and 32,550, respectively.137 By contrast, the total numbers for Jilin, Yunnan, and Shanxi were 2,868, 2,297, and 2,284, respectively.138 For either patent applications or grants, the figures for the less developed provinces were less than one-tenth of the figures for their more developed counterparts. If we include in the second group those provinces and autonomous regions that have fewer than 4,000 patent applications and 1,000 patent grants, such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Hainan, Qinghai, and Tibet, the statistical contrasts between these two groups will become even starker.139 From a policy standpoint, these disparities are highly significant. In fact, the remarkably uneven economic and technological developments in China have suggested the country's need to develop schizophrenic intellectual property policies.140 What policies China needs in one region may not be the same as what 134.

Id. 139. CNIPA, Domestic Applications, supra note 135; CNIPA, Domestic Grants, supra note 137. 140. As I noted in a recent article: From the standpoint of intellectual property development, having highly uneven subnational development could create major challenges for policymakers, especially in relation to the establishment of a national intellectual property strategy, such as the one the State Council of China launched in June 2008. If the relevant government leaders seek to tailor protection to the divergent economic and technological conditions in different regions, they likely will have to come up with a \"schizophrenic\" nationwide intellectual property policy. Under such a policy, protection will be tighter in fast-growing and technologically proficient regions but much weaker in their less-The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 613 works in another. Moreover, because different sectors in China develop at different paces, the need for schizophrenic policies can be attributed to not only regional disparities, but also sectoral disparities. As I noted a decade ago, before the State Council's adoption of the National Intellectual Property Strategy, \"based on existing developments, China is likely to prefer stronger protection of intellectual property rights in entertainment, software, semiconductors, and selected areas of biotechnology to increased protection in areas concerning pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, seeds, and foodstuffs.\"141 From a public health standpoint, the uneven economic and technological developments in China have also been highly alarming. As China increases its assertiveness in the pharmaceutical arena and as the pharmaceutical landscape continues to evolve, one cannot help but wonder whether and how China's eagerness to develop national champions in this arena will affect the overall access of the Chinese populace to medicines and healthcare. As Frederick Abbott rightly reminded us: [I]n order for the health sector not to be adversely affected, there must be some type of transfer payment, whether in the form of increased public health expenditures on pharmaceuticals, by providing health insurance benefits, or other affirmative acts. In a world of economic scarcity, the prospect that governments will act to offset increases in medicines prices with increased public health expenditures is uncertain.142 To be sure, innovation and intellectual property policies remain key components of the larger public health policy. If stronger intellectual property rights are created, such protections can be balanced by greater limitations and exceptions to these rights, as well as by introducing competition law, other legal or policy safeguards, or complementary public health measures.143 Nevertheless, developed counterparts.

The continuous public concern about inadequate or unaffordable healthcare indeed explained why the film Dying to Survive resonated with tens of millions in China and became a local blockbuster.146 Policymakers and commentators should not overlook the costs of creating national pharmaceutical champions. A related area that also deserves policy and scholarly attention concerns the impact of the recent law and policy changes on the future development of traditional Chinese medicine,147 which in 2015 \"account[ed] for 28.55% of the total [output value] generated by the country's pharmaceutical industry.\"148 144.

RIGHTS, INTEGRATING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY: REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 29-55 (2002) (discussing issues lying at the intersection of intellectual property, development, and public health). 145. As Frederick Abbott observed in a World Health Organization study: \"[T]he single most important aspect of China's current policy with respect to the pharmaceutical sector is its close linkage to the objective of universal health care (UHC). UHC is a key priority for the China Government, which has committed to providing access to medicines for its people.\" WHO CHINA STUDY, supra note 1, at 1; see also id. at 6-7 (discussing China's commitment to universal health care). 146.

Wo bu shi yaoshen translates to \"I am not God of Medicine.\" Based on a real-life story, the film concerned the owner of a Chinese aphrodisiac store who smuggled cheap generic medicine from India for sale at affordable prices to leukemia patients in China. 147. As Fan Ruiping explained: Traditional Chinese medicine dramatically differs from modern scientific medicine in its basic medical orientation, physiological theories, etiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and pharmacology. For instance, while modern scientific medicine views the essence of illness as anatomicopathological, traditional Chinese medicine views it as symptom-complex (zheng) of the whole body. While scientific medicine identifies the sources of illness as disease entities, Chinese medicine identifies them as imbalanced climate and/or emotional factors. While scientific medicine uses advanced lab and mechanical investigations as diagnostic means, Chinese medicine uses ordinary contacts (looking, smelling, asking, and feeling) to locate problems. While scientific medicine emphasizes pathological anatomy, Chinese medicine focuses on the patient's complaint and actual experience of being sick. While scientific medicine aims at curing diseases, Chinese medicine appeals to balancing functional factors. While scientific medicine employs chemical drugs or surgeries, Chinese medicine appeals to natural herbs or simple needles.

Will the greater development of Western medicine and national champions that specialize in the development of such medicine lead to more innovation of traditional Chinese medicine?151 More integration?152 More been approved (based on the number of Approval Letters), and 4424 pharmaceutical enterprises (including active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished dosage forms) have been granted manufacturing licences and passed the [good manufacturing practice] inspection. In addition, 177 sites for crude drugs (raw pharmaceutical materials) have been certified for good agricultural practices (GAP). Chinese drug regulatory authorities are also exploring the revision of GAP and the implementation of a record system for Chinese crude drugs. A modern Chinese pharmaceutical industry, held together by commerce, has been established. In 2015, the total output value of the traditional Chinese medicine pharmaceutical industry was RMB 786.6 billion, accounting for 28.55% of the total generated by the country's pharmaceutical industry.

More displacement? Or more weakening? What impact, if any, such development will have on the Chinese populace? C. Global Complications The final area that deserves greater attention pertains to the global complications China's changing position in the pharmaceutical arena has generated. Since entering the WTO in December 2001, China has joined Brazil and India in pushing for stronger accommodation of developing countries' interests in the international trading and intellectual property systems.153 Together with Russia and South Africa, these three countries have worked hard to explore greater cooperation in the BRICS context.154 Ironically, China's recent policy shift in the pharmaceutical arena will create tensions, if not conflicts, with India.155 While India remains eager to provide strong support for generic drugs at the international level156\u2014notwithstanding the changing dynamics in its pharmaceutical industry157\u2014China's position is now 153. See Peter K. Yu, Intellectual Property Negotiations, the BRICS Factor and the Changing North-South Debate, in THE BRICS-LAWYERS' GUIDE TO GLOBAL COOPERATION 148, 149 (Rostam J.

As my colleague Srividhya Ragavan declared emphatically: [D]ata exclusivity as a tool detrimentally affects generic competition. Thus, it is no coincidence that India has been pressurized by the [United States Trade Representative] to extend the existing 4 year period of data exclusivity to 10 years. For countries like India, it is good to appreciate that generics have become a part of the global pharmaceutical industry.

See Sudip Chaudhuri, Is Product Patent Protection Necessary to Spur Innovation in Developing The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 617 closer to those of the European Union, Japan, Switzerland, the United States, and other developed countries.158 This position shift has raised questions about the ongoing negotiations at the WTO and WIPO. Will both China and India continue to team up to push for standards that align with the positions of developing countries? Or will the slowly changing pharmaceutical landscape cause these two leaders of the developing world to slowly drift apart? If so, how can other developing countries maintain an effective coalition to push for positions that are more in line with their needs, interests, conditions, and priorities? Although the multilateral system involving the WTO and WIPO has received considerable scholarly and policy attention, the biggest tensions between China and India over the development of regulatory standards in the pharmaceutical arena will likely arise at the regional level.159 A case in point is the ongoing negotiation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (\"RCEP\"),160 in which both China and India have played important roles.161 While the draft RCEP intellectual property chapter has never been officially released, Knowledge Ecology International\u2014a nongovernmental organization active in the health and intellectual property arenas\u2014leaked online the October 15, 2015 Countries?: R&D by Indian Pharmaceutical Companies After TRIPS, in THE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA: GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 265, 285-86 (Neil Weinstock Netanel ed., 2009) (discussing new drug-delivery systems in India); Dwijen Rangnekar, Context and Ambiguity in the Making of Law: A Comment on Amending India's Patent Act, 10 J.

As the leaked draft text revealed, Japan and South Korea were the negotiating parties proposing the data exclusivity provision.168 Although Australia and New Zealand opposed such protection, both Australia and New Zealand signed the TPP Agreement, suggesting their willingness to accept high TPP-like standards for the protection of pharmaceutical and biological products.169 If these three countries were to eventually join those ASEAN members that have embraced stronger intellectual property protection and enforcement, such as Singapore, China's changing position will have serious ramifications for future international and regional intellectual property negotiations.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 51 619 of the Belt and Road Initiative (\"BRI\").170 Although this initiative has thus far focused on interconnectivity and infrastructural developments,171 there has been growing developments in the intellectual property area.172 At the time of writing, China has already hosted two high-level international conferences on BRI-related intellectual property matters.173 In May 2017, the country also entered into the Agreement on Enhancing \"Belt and Road\" Intellectual Property Cooperation with WIPO.174 In addition, \"over the past [few] years, China has carried out extensive cooperation with [Belt and Road] countries in terms of [intellectual property] education, publicity, training and information exchange.\"175 Given the important role the BRI can play in facilitating intellectual property cooperation,176 China's position in the pharmaceutical arena will likely have serious ramifications for future intellectual property developments in the more than sixty countries along the Belt and Road. 170.

CONCLUSION In the past three decades, China has been slowly but actively building its patent system. Having undergone multiple developmental phases\u2014from imitation to standardization to integration to indigenization177\u2014the Chinese patent system has arguably advanced much faster than any system that has ever been built.178 In the past few years, China has also been actively strengthening its position in the pharmaceutical arena. While the proposed changes to patent law and pharmaceutical regulations provide good indications of what is to come in the near future, China's growing deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the health area also deserves scholarly and policy attention. Given all of these developments, it is high time that policymakers and commentators paid greater attention to China's assertiveness in the pharmaceutical arena and the changing domestic and global pharmaceutical landscapes. Until policymakers and commentators foster a deeper understanding of these changes and developments, they will have great difficulty formulating appropriate regulatory and policy responses toward China. 177.
