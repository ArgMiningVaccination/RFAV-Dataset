These holistic detoxing agents, however, may level the playing field.", "sitename": "Dr. Lam Coaching - World Renowned Authority on Adrenal Fatigue Recovery", "date": "2019-09-02", "cleaned_text": "If you feel like your body may need to detoxify, these homeopathic detoxing agents might be just what you need. Sometimes the use of detoxing agents is of great benefit to those with adrenal fatigue. It does, however, depend on the cause of your adrenal fatigue as well as the stage you are in. Caution is always key when dealing with this condition. One of the main reasons one might decide on a detox regimen is due to the presence of toxins in the body. These toxins not only overburden your body but may overload your liver and trigger Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS) as well as retard your recovery from this condition. [Detoxing involves a cleansing](/blog/detox-your-body-naturally-to-enhance-your-health/) of the bowels, liver, lungs, blood, and kidneys. In homeopathy, your body is seen as a whole. Thus, unlike in conventional medicine, homeopathy holds that, where one organ is compromised, the whole body is compromised. The body is looked at holistically, and what affects one area may have an effect on others. Sometimes, as is the case with adrenal fatigue, for example, these myriad symptoms can all be rooted back to one cause. Homeopathic remedies help you detox at a cellular level. As your whole body is composed of cells, this means that each and every cell in your entire body is being addressed, not just your liver or kidneys, as is the focus of more conventional detox methods. By incorporating your whole body, each organ in the body is affected, making sure that each also has the benefit associated with the remedy. You may feel a little worse while using homeopathic remedies during your detox period, as these remedies incorporate a very watered down version of whatever is causing the issue in their makeup. In the long run, however, by stimulating and working with your immune system, you are better able to deal with toxins and their expulsion from your body. Toxins can be classified into three groups: This includes all toxins that are ingested in some shape or form. They may be derived from the foods we eat, what we drink, or over the counter drugs. Much [heavy metal toxicity](/blog/in-depth-guide-to-heavy-metal-poisoning-and-detoxification-part-1/) is due to food, as these heavy metals are often added to the fertilizers used in food production. Unfortunately, heavy metals end up in the plant matter we eat and stay in our bodies after food is digested. We also get these metals as well as other toxins from animal protein sources. Fish, for instance, may contain metals the fish has ingested due to pollution of oceans, rivers, and lakes. These refer to toxins produced in the body by bacteria, viruses, or your body's reaction to them. A good example is the pus you may find due to an infection. These are toxins produced by your body in the natural course of events. An example is the by-products of protein synthesis. Another is the waste produced by a body with certain diseases such as the uric acid that causes arthritis. The detoxification process may have many benefits for those suffering from adrenal fatigue. Please note, however, that detoxification during certain phases of adrenal fatigue may do more harm than good, as the body may be in a weakened state and not be able to handle it. This is especially [true for advanced adrenal fatigue](/adrenal-fatigue/concepts/4-stages-of-adrenal-fatigue/). Please consult a healthcare professional when considering a detox program of any kind. However, for those who are able to handle detox and who have the support of their healthcare practitioner, detoxing can have several benefits. Our tissues and cells store the environmental pollutants, chemicals, heavy metals, and pesticides we are exposed to on a daily basis. As these accumulate, they start affecting not only our immune system and metabolism but our mood and ability to fight disease as well. Many of the symptoms commonly associated with adrenal fatigue are due to a buildup of these toxins in our systems. Detoxing agents help your body get rid of these toxins. In so doing, not only do they aid in improving your liver and other body functions, but they also improve other symptoms commonly associated with adrenal fatigue. Toxicity of any kind influences your body's ability to fight inflammation, one of the results of increased cortisol production and adrenal fatigue. Detoxification, however, removes the cause of the inflammation, allowing your body to function better overall, including your liver. Detoxing results in your body having fewer stressors. Stressors, in other words, are anything causing you stress, whether physiological, psychological, or environmental in nature. These lead to adrenal fatigue. Detoxification, once complete, reduces these stressors and often leaves you feeling more energetic, with fewer mood swings and brain fog to inhibit your thought processes. A detox not only boosts your metabolism. It raises your energy levels as well. It also helps balance your gut's microbiome. Studies show that weight loss is often one of the side effects of a detox program. When you get rid of toxins in your body, inflammation is reduced. There are also fewer pollutants and chemicals in the body to clog your skin's pores or dry it out. As detoxing improves your skin's metabolic function, its health and general appearance both benefit. Toxins in the body manifest in a variety of symptoms that are also often part of the adrenal fatigue scenario. You might consider detoxing if suffering from: In many cases, these conditions are associated with toxicity of some sort, and using detoxing agents may give relief. There are several effective homeopathic detoxing agents dealing with numerous toxins in the body. Glycerinum, glycerin, or glycerol, as it is more commonly known, is widely used in a range of products including cosmetics, soap, food, and different medications. It is thus used both internally and externally. It is one of the few detoxing agents with few or no side effects. It is also great, in moderation, for those suffering from diabetes or who are pre-diabetic. Diabetes is one of the conditions relating to adrenal fatigue, sometimes a result of insulin resistance due to the action of excessive cortisol in the body. Research indicates that a glycerol enzyme, G3PP, has the ability to prevent the formation and storage of fat by converting glucose into glycerol and lower the excessive production of glucose in the liver. The excess glycerol is then transported out of the body. This could help with obesity, which may be due to hormonal imbalances, stress, or lifestyle issues. Glycerinum also has excellent laxative properties and is thus often used for constipation. It can be taken internally to soften stools and speed up the excretion process. Its antiviral and antibacterial properties also help with good gut health. Glycerinum is often used on suppositories, an effective method of combating constipation in younger children. Constipation and other gut health issues are directly linked to adrenal gland issues. In many cases, gut bacteria is to blame for arising conditions. This, in turn, may be linked to a compromised immune system due to a cortisol imbalance. Glycerinum may also play a role in uric acid elimination. In so doing, it helps fight gout and arthritis, as uric acid is associated with both these conditions. These conditions are also directly related to adrenal fatigue, more specifically the latter stages, which sees the adrenals producing an ever decreasing amount of cortisol. Too little cortisol is just as bad, if not worse, than too much of the hormone. Phytolacca decandra is one of the most effective detoxing agents that detoxifies and aids with the elimination of waste products from the lymphatic system while supporting adrenal and liver function. The detoxing effect of this herb helps prevent various skin conditions, like eczema, psoriasis, and boils; in other words, it helps with disorders of the surface due to internal action. Phytolacca decandra is also great for those with arthritis, as it helps eliminate uric acid from your system. These conditions are often linked to adrenal fatigue and the accompanying compromised immune system. Taraxacum officinale, or dandelion, is one of those detoxing agents that, while acting as a diuretic, also improves bowel function, getting rid of toxins in the process. The flavonoids in Taraxacum officinale gives it that characteristic bitter taste but are also the compounds that work at increasing your flow of urine. In addition to its diuretic properties, this herb has high quantities of calcium, potassium, and vitamins that help control blood pressure. This herb has a high fiber content, giving it the ability to stimulate bowel movement, while its antibacterial and antifungal properties help maintain intestinal flora balance. One of the signs of adrenal fatigue is a compromised gut due to a bacterial imbalance. As far as metal poisoning goes, or more specifically mercury poisoning, Nitricum acidum is one of the most effective natural detoxing agents. Mercury tends to have a major negative impact on your central nervous system and may cause various symptoms associated with adrenal fatigue, such as panic attacks. Nitricum acidum, as a detoxing agent, eliminates mercury from your body. Although phosphoric acid can cause damage, the concentrations used in homeopathy are negligible and do not cause any damage if used correctly. Phosphoricum acidum is one of the detoxing agents that are effective for removing synthetic chemicals such as those found in pharmaceutical or recreational drugs as well as [toxicity due to electromagnetic (EMF) radiation](/blog/emf-radiation-and-health-an-emerging-danger/). It stimulates the liver, kidneys, and bladder during the detoxification process. This remedy addresses the following symptoms commonly associated with adrenal fatigue: Acetylisalicylicum produces what are known as chelates. In other words, it is able to bond with metals in the body. As such, it may be effective in instances of mercury and other heavy metal toxicity. We ingest many heavy metals from what we eat. Many of the symptoms of metal toxicity are also worsened by adrenal fatigue, including indigestion, constipation, fatigue, and headaches. Acetylisalicylicum (or aspirin) has long been used to manage these symptoms. Glonoinum is one of the fastest acting detoxing agents around. Its action is fast and explosive in the sense that it might give you a headache, cause your heart to race, and cause shortness of breath, amongst others. However, these are all short-lasting effects, and the relief felt afterward from the condition it impacts is almost immediate. Glonoinum, which is made from nitro-glycerine, may prove effective for combatting angina, constant headaches, rheumatism, and sunstroke. Insulinum, as one of the body's detoxing agents, is involved in just about all your metabolic processes. Its main function is balancing blood sugar levels and keeping them within normal parameters so that your body functions correctly. It is very involved in your body's oxidative process. A shortage of insulinum may result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which may develop into diabetes, a condition commonly associated with adrenal fatigue. Besides being one of the detoxing agents used for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, Lithium carbonicum is a great detox agent for those suffering from acidity-based conditions such as gout and rheumatism. The supplement targets anything in the body that is acidic, such as the uric acid responsible for the pain so often suffered when you have one of these conditions. Another benefit is that it has a promising positive effect on anxiety and depression. Many people, when reading about the benefits of detoxing agents or other health products, tend to rush out and buy them in the hope of getting rid of their health issues. However, not all supplements have the desired outcome, and they may also have negative effects if used incorrectly. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. If you are in advanced stages of AFS, the risk of negative effects increases. The weaker you are, the greater the risk. Symptoms of improper detoxification include nausea, diarrhea, bloating, anxiety, headache, joint pain, muscle ache, fever, and fatigue. In severe cases, one can be incapacitated. The key to healthy detoxification is matching the body's state to the supplements. What is considered a normal dose for one person may be excessive for another. Sometimes only a minute amount is needed to prime the detoxification process, while other times, a pulsing strategy may be needed for maximum effectiveness. Not to be forgotten is the proper delivery method for the nutrient, such as transdermal, oral, or IV. Certain methods are more desirable and effective compared to others. Fermented forms may be more easily bio absorbed by the cell but may trigger candida systematically, for example. Much consideration has to go into the process of putting in a comprehensive plan to achieve positive clinical outcomes. Much of it depends on the sufferer's sensitivity and the clinical experience of the healthcare practitioner. Detoxification is one key factor to successful recovery but [only if done right](https://www.webmd.com/diet/a-z/detox-diets). If done wrong, it can also lead to worsening of the entire clinical picture. Retoxification reactions, Herxheimer's reactions, and adrenal crashes can be precipitated, and they can seriously retard the overall recovery process. Our supplement choice recommendation, [HomeoPlex D](https://www.supplementclinic.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=799861441182&Click=32154&utm_source=drlamcoaching.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=shmd&utm_content=coaching-38211), is a proprietary homeopathic formulation containing various components that promote the detoxification process. These include, amongst others, Glycerinum, and Thyroidinum. Before embarking on any course of supplements, please do talk to a professional health care expert first to establish whether the supplement will work for you, and about which dosage you should take. As with any supplement, detoxing agents have their benefits and their drawbacks. To ensure safe use, it is always better to consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner to see whether your choice is the best for you and to determine the appropriate dosage. "}
