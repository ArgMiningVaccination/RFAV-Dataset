It is designed to provide information and assist decision ma king. It is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. Vari ations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, avail able resources, a nd limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. The recommend ations for research contained within this document are general and do not imply a specific protocol. *Commissi oned evidence review included articles published through April 2017. Consensus opinion statements use literature published though August 2018. SEC TION II: DISC LOSURE Kidney Disease Outcomes Quali ty Initiative (KDOQI) and American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) make every effort to avoid any actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an outside relationship or a personal, professional, or business interest of a member of the Work Group. All members of the Work Group are required to complete, sig n, and submit a disclosure and attestation form showing all such relationships that might be perceived or actual conflic ts of interest.

Choi, MD Vice Chair, Policy Past President, National Kidney Foundation Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 10 METH ODS The Guideline Development Process According to the Institute of M edicine (National Academy of Sciences), \"Cl inical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intend ed to op timize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and h arms of alternative care options\". This ch apter describes the p rocess and ed to condu ct compr ehensives system atic reviews and how the findings from these systematic reviews were used to dev elop clin ical practice nutrition guideli nes for patients with ch ronic kidn ey disease. These guidelines were developed according to the Standards for Developing Trustw orthy Clinical Practice Guid elines as stated by Institute of M edicin e. Development of the se guidelines was a collaborative process between National Kidn ey Found ation (NKF) and the A cademy of Nutrition and Di etetics (Academy). Nutrition and its management are an integral aspect of care for patients with k idney disease. Due to recent developments in the li terature regarding treatment and assessment of CKD, the Academy and NKF collaborated to m erge, update and expand the current 2010 Evid ence Analysis Library\u00ae (EAL\u00ae) CKD guidelines and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Nutrition Guid elines. Hence, the obj ective of this initiative is to pr ovide medical nutrition therapy (MNT) guidelin es for patients with ch ronic kidney disease (CKD) to assess, p revent and tr eat protein-energy wasting, mineral and electrolyte disord ers, and ot her metabolic co- morbidit with eline development is a detailed and compr ehensive process. The steps followed to develop this guideline are below (some steps were completed concurrently): 1. Select the Work group or expert panel that works with the eviden ce review team. 2. O rient the wo rk group the 5 -step system atic review process of t he Academy of Nutrition and Di etetics' Evid ence Analysis Center. 3. D evelop research questions, in clusion and exclusion criteria and a detailed search plan as well as identi fy interventions and outcom es of interest. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 11 4. Search mu ltiple d atabases based on s earch plan. 5. Screen abstracts and full te xt articles based on a priori eligibility criteria. 6. E xtract data and critically assess the quality of included studies (risk of bias of studi es) 7. Synthesi ze eviden ary and conclusion st atements) and in table format (Study characteristics and findi ngs table). Grade the qu ality of eviden ce for each outco me and provide GRA DE tables. 8. D evelop recommendation statements bas ed on the findin gs of the systematic review and other important con siderations and assign \"strength of recommendation\". 9. Write a guideline m anuscript. 10. Condu ct internal, external, and public review of the guideline. 11. R espond to r eviewer comments and upd ate the guideline b efore publication. Work group sel ection process: The Academy of Nutrition and Di etetics l ed the p rocess of work group mem ber recruitm ent. To assure appropriate expertise and limit bias, the Eviden ce Based Practice Com mittee Work Group Selection su b-committee follow ed a transparent process of selecting wo rk group members. An op en recruitment message with a link to onl ine application was circulated via stakeholders for experts in the topic area of chronic kidney disease. Interested candidat es provided: si gned Disclosu re and Confli ct of Interest From, curriculum vitae, and personal statements indic ating interest and qu alifications th at related to the topic. The workgroup selection committee then evaluated each candidate based on set criteria. Higher scoring candidates were consid ered for position of wo rkgroup chair /co-chair. A total of 15 workgroup mem bers were selected to dev elop these guidelines. T wo co-chairs were appoin ted, and the work group consisted of physicians, registered dieti tians or nutrition ists, researchers, and method ologists with e xpertise in the renal nutrition fi eld. The selected memb ers, according to their experiences and skill sets, w ere assigned to co rresponding subtopics. The work group participated in all steps of systematic review process, whi ch includ ed developing research questions, agreeing on inclusion and exclusive criteria, developing the search plan, evaluating the evidence, and approving and grading the evidence and developing recommendation st atements. All wo rkgroup memb ers and the eviden ce review team (ERT) met twice for 2-day face to face meetings as well as a teleconference calls on ce a month for the du ration of the p roject. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 12 Guid eline focus: During the first meeting the work group defined the scope for the guideline. The co-chairs developed the first dr aft of the scope which was discussed and refined by the work group memb ers. It was determined that the guideline would f ocus on Nutrition in all stages of CKD in adults and would cover the subtopics of macronut rient, micronutr ient, and electrolyte ass essment and in tervention qu estion und er these subtopics w ere proposed. Three workgroups were developed, with five members assigned to each workgroup and a Chair appoin ted to help le ad the workgroup. Systematic review pro cess: Question development, literature search and stu dy selection This guideline followed the Academy of Nutrition and Di etetics system atic review methodolo gy. An analytical framework was developed by the ERT and refined by the work group mem bers to h elp guide qu estion development. Du ring the ini tial tel econference calls and first face to face meeting, the workgroup developed a list of qu estions th at were deemed important for clinicians and patients (T able 1 ). The workgroup developed the a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria as listed in T able 2. A compr ehensive search of lit erature was conducted using PubM ed, ME DLINE, EMBA SE, and CINAHL search engines. A first literature search was condu cted to id entify studies addressing assessment q uestions and a second search was conducted to ide ntify studies addressing intervention questions in or der to identify studies that answered more than one question. Inclusion criteria included in the s earch plan in cluded: human adults with CKD aged 19 years and ol der published between 1985 and December 2016. hu Search terms included terms to identify relevant nutrition in terventions assessment too ls in adult CKD patients. The first literature search focused on assessment questions id entified 4,857 potential studies. The PRISMA di agram illustrating the stu dy selection process are presented in Figure 1. The second comprehensive s earch to ans wer all the in tervention qu estions in o rder identified 11,017 potential studies. The PRISMA di agram illustrating study selection process for intervention qu estions is in Figure 2. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 13 After the search was completed, studi es were systematic ally screened based additional a priori inclusion/e xclusion criteria. For inte rvention qu estions, on ly random ized controll ed trials that had at least 6 individuals per arm were included. Included studies investi gated an intervention of int erest (e.g. protein restrictions, phosphorus in take, sodium intake etc.) in compa rison with no in tervention or minimal intervention. For assessment qu estions, on ly studies that t ested the validity, reliability or relationship of an assessm ent tool a gainst a comparative tool (reference stand ard) or mortality were includ ed in this review. The list of t itles and abstracts were indep endently reviewed and ma rked for inclusion or exclusion (along with the reason) and any differences were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Full texts of articles m eeting inclusion criteria were ordered and reviewed for inclusion. 225 studies met the inclusion criteria for Intervention qu estions and 125 for assessment articles. A list of excluded articles with reason f or exclusion w as also created to maintain tr ansparency (available of Academy of Nutrition and Di etetics Eviden ce Analysis Center website). Data extraction and study quali ty assessm ent: Relevant data was extracted from the includ ed articles using a stand ardized onl ine data extraction too l. Key information extracted from each study includ ed: Authors information; year of publication; type of study design; det ails of intervention: type of intervention, du ration of the intervention, who delivered the inte rvention, setting, number of centers; Participants: s ample size, mean age, age range, gender, stu dy inclusion and exclusion criteria, comorbidit ies; Interventions: in Outcom es: reported prim ary and second ary outcom es, time points of reported outc omes; oth er details such as funding source. All included studies w ere critically appraised for risk of bias. T wo indep endent reviewers assess ed the qu ality or studies using the Academy's online risk of bias to ol, the Quality Criteria Checklist (QC C). The questions of the QCC are based on qu ality constructs and risk of bias domains id entified by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Agency for Healthcare Research ad Quality (AHRQ). Questions examine sampling bias, p erformance bias, d etection bias, attrition Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 14 bias, and reporting bias. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Data s ynthesis and grading the evidence: Descriptive synthesis of condu cted for all identifi ed outcom es for which th ere were included studies. When poss ible, m eta-analysis was condu cted using r andom-effects model. For continuous d ata, results were summa rized as mean dif ference (MD) v/s control/placebo) with 95% confid ence interval (CI) or standardized me an differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcom es were reported as odds r atio (OR) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. The I2 statistic was used to determine the d egree of heterogeneity in the calculated effect size, and 25 %, 50%, and 75% were consid ered low, mod erate, high, respectively. Sub-group analysis was condu cted as appropriate to ma nage clinical heterogeneity. After completion of the data extraction and data synthesis, the ERT provid ed the systematic review results in the following formats for the workgroup to review, edit, and approve: 1) Evid a narrative ed trials for each iden tified outcome was drafted for each research question in the system atic review. A conclusion statement was developed for each proposed question /ou tcome. The conclusion st atement is a clear, simp le and to the point answer to the p ropos ed questions.; 2) Stu dy characteristics tabl e: provided information r egarding study characteristics, s ample size, population, intervention details and quality of each inclu ded study; 3) Quality of evidence (strength of evidence): Each of the conclusion st atements w ere assigned a GRA DE (reference) to reflect the quality of studies, inconsi stency of results, imprecision, ind irectness of the eviden ce, and pub lication bias. Using this method, the eviden ce for each outcome of int erest was graded as A (high), B (moderate), C (low), or D (very low). A GRA DE table was generated using G radePro and demonstr ated how the str ength of evidence (GRA DE) was derived for each outcome of interest. Guid eline developm ent: The workgroup members drafted compr ehensive recommendations for nutrition c are for adults with CKD. During this phase, the role of the work group member was to translate the available eviden ce into action st atements th at were clear, concise, and ready to Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 15 be implem ented by practitioners. The workgroup and ERT used the GRA DE method for development of recommendations. The GRA DE method invo lves two m ajor component s: a rating for quality of evidence (described above) and r ating the st rength of recommendations. The eviden ce grades are reported at the end of the recommendation st atements (e.g. A, B, C, or D) and reflect the confidence in the estimated effects (T able 3). The second component is r ating the st rength of the recommendation st atement. This r ating reflects the extent to which one is con fident that desirable effects of an intervention outw eigh undesirable effects. The grade for strength of the recommendation can be assigned Level 1 or Level 2. T able 4 sho ws the implication of each level for practitioners, clinicians, and pol icy makers. Level 1 recommendations use the terminology \"We recommend\", which me ans th at this course of action should be applied to most people and practitioners can have confidence that i mplem enting this recommendation has more benefit th an risk. Level 2 recommendations use the terminolo gy \"We suggest\". When providing the level for the str ength of the recommendation, a number of factors besides the qu ality of eviden ce are taken into consid eration, including patient valu es and preferences, quality of evidence, benefits and h arms, cost/resources to implement the recommendation, acceptabil ity, feasibility, and health equity. In addition to evid ence-based recommendations, in certain scenarios \"Opinion\" stat ements w ere developed. These statements w ere developed when the re was not enough evidence or evidence had too low of quality to write a graded recommendation, but the workgroup determined it w as important to provide some guidance to patients and p ractitioners. These recommendations are ungraded, and usu ally refer to general or routine practice. Once the full draft of recommendation st atements w as ready, it was reviewed and edited multiple times by all the workgroup memb ers and the ERT. The workgroup participated in a final blinded vote of recommendation st atements, and a majo rity of votes approving the statement w as necessary for each statement to be accepted into the final guideline. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 16 Draft report wi th suppor ting rat ionale: Once the recommendation statements were developed, the work group memb ers drafted a guideline m anuscript th at included the suppo rting materials for each top ic, includi ng rationale, lement ation consid erations, risks and h arms, costs, and need for future research. In these sections the work group mem bers also cit ed additional references important to the respective topic, including discussion of studies publish ed after our search dates or other system atic reviews on t he topic. Peer review pro cess: These guidelines und erwent a systematic peer review process. The first phase of review was an internal review conducted by KDOQI leadership and the National Kidn ey Found ation Scientific Adviso ry Board. Feedb ack from this internal review were reviewed and inco rporated in the guideline as appropriate. The second ph ase of the review was an external review conducted by 12 experts in this field. The AGREE II tool (Appraisal of Guid elines for Research and Ev aluation) criteria was used to assess the q uality of guideline reporti ng. The third phase was an open, publ ic review phase. Reviewer comments from all phases were collated by staff and sent to workgroup members for discussi on and poss ible edits. Work group chairs coordinated the final revision of the guideline do cument based on review comments and the final guideline m anuscript will be submit ted for publication. Table 1.

Implications of strong and weak recommendations for different users of guidelines Strong Recommendation (Level 1 = We recommend) Weak Recommend ation (Level 2 = We suggest) For patients Most individuals in this situat ion would want the recommended course of action and only a small propor tion would not. The majority of in dividuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. For clinicians Most individuals should receive the re commended course of action. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and prefere nces. Recognize that different choices will be ap propri ate for different patien ts, and that you must help each pa tient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and prefere nces. Decision aids may well be useful helping indi viduals making decisions consistent with the ir values and prefere nces. Clinicians should expect to spend more t ime with patien ts when working towards a decision. For policy makers The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations including for t he use as performance indicators. Policy making will re quire substantial debates and involvement of many stake holde rs. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Perfo rmance indicators would ha ve to fo cus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place.

Nutrition Screening Tools 1.0.2 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, there is limited eviden ce to suggest the use of one tool over others for identifying those at risk of protein-energy wasting (2D). Routi ne Nutrition Assessment 1.0.3 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable that a registered dieti tian nut ritionist (RD N) or an international equiv alent condu ct a comprehensive nutrit ion assessment (including but not limited to appetite, hi story of dietary intake, bioch emical data, anthropom etric measurements, and nut rition- focused physical findin gs) at least within the first 90 days of starting dialysis, annually, or when indicated by nutrition screening or provider referral (OPINION). 1.1 Statement on Technical D evices & Anth ropometric Measurements to Assess Bo dy Composition Bioel ectrical Impedance for Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis (MHD) 1.1.1 In adults with CKD on available.

Rationale/Backg round Methods of assessi ng body composi tion, including anthro pomet ric measurements, of the nutrition ass essment in CKD. Anth ropomet ric measurements are practical, ine xpensive and non -invasive techniques that describe body mass, si ze, shape, and levels of f atness and leanness; they are the most b asic and ind irect methods of assessing body composi tion. Th ese include height, w eight, skin folds, circumferences, bio electrical imped ance analysis (BIA), creatinine Dual-energy X-ray absorptio (DXA) is a direct method that is consid ered the gold s tandard for assessing body composi tion in patients with CK D; how ever, this measure is labor intensiv e, invasive, expensive and can be influ enced by a number of CKD related factors su as hydration statu s. Timing of body composi tion ass essments is important in CKD since assumptions of hydration are required for accurate interpretation of the results, and fluid/electrolyte balance is likely to be altered significantly in CKD patients. For these reasons, in adults und ergoing dialysis, assessments are best ob tained after treatment when body fluid compartments levels are balanced .2, 3 Regardless of the m ethod selected to assess bo dy composi tion, none are perfect, and the errors sur rounding them should not be ignored. Errors may have clinical relevance, especially if the ind ividual is tr eated and observed over tim e.3 Moreover, the results of the measures are only as use ful as the availability of sui table reference data from a group of persons of at least the same age, race, gender and dis ease status. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 38 Detailed Justification Technical D evices to Measure Body Composition Multi-frequency bioelectrical imped ance analysis (MF-BIA) Twelve studi es reported on the use of M F-BIA to assess fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) in MH D, PD and pre-dialysis patients. Four of these studies were validity/reliability stud ies: two in MHD patients;4, 5 one in patients;6 and one in pr e- dialysis pati ents.7 Three were prediction s tudies: two in MHD patients, and one in MHD and PD patients.8-10 Eight were correlation studies; five p 6, 11 patients; me asured had good agreement with DEXA in two studies,4, 5 had high correlations with s everal markers of nutritional s tatus in four stud ies,4, 13 - 15 and predicted hard outcomes in three studies.8-10 Furstenburg et al. con cluded that M F-BIA was a more robust tool than DEXA for measuring body composition in MHD p atients.5 Donadio et al. found that MF-BIA yielded a small er prediction e rror in atients.4 Body composi tion zation9 and surviv al.8-10 In al., BIA underestimated FM FFM when compared with air disp lacement plet M HD patients.14 PEW by MF-BIA was pos itively related to BMI and negatively associated with s erum albumin level.13 In Mancini et al., bio imped ance vector analysis was predicted by norm alized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) and albumin in MHD p atients with norm al nutrition al status, but the predictive effects were not a ccurate in unde rnourish ed patients.12 In MHD p atients, a bo dy protein index score calculated from M F-BIA protein mass and height significantly correlated with blood protein lev els in men on M HD, but there was no relationship in wom en on MH D.15 Guid eline on Nut FM and FFM me asured by MF-BIA show ed wide limits of agreement with DEXA in 1 stu dy, which was affected by hydration status,6 and w as an independent risk factor for surviv al in another study.8 In CAPD p atients, asured by creatinine kinetic m ethod w ere highly correlated but there was no dif ference in LBM using BIA in patients with or without periton eal dialysate.11 A bo dy protein index score calculated from M F-BIA protein mass and h eight significantly correlated with b lood p rotein lev els in men on MHD, but there was no relationship in wom en on M HD or CAPD p atients. The findin gs varied according to sex and dia lysis treatment.15 Pre-dialysis patients: In diabetic patients, % LBM me asured by DEXA was greater than that pr edicted by BIA (p<0.05). Bland & Altman analysis demonstr ated b iases by BIA, but the me an of the results obt ained by combined anthro pomet ry and BIA demonstrated no bi as from D EXA measurements.7 Anth ropometric and other measurements to measure body composition Skinfold m easurements Ten studies reported on the use of skin fold measurements to assess bo dy composi tion, including four agreement/valid ity/reliability studies,16-19 one -25 MHD patients: Bross et al. used DEXA as the reference test and sh owed tha t, triceps skinfold th ickness (TS F), BIA (Kushn er), and near-infrared in teractance were most accurate of the index tests in estimating total BF%, although the B IA (Segal) and BIA (Lukaski) equations ov erestimated total BF%.17 These results were not affected by skin color. In Bross et al., there were significant co rrelations ( all p<0.001) between DEXA measurements and tric eps sk infold measures of bo dy fat in MHD participant s.17 Kamimura et al. compa red SKF with DEXA and BIA and found that bo dy fat estimates using SKF and BIA were not significantly different from those obt ained by DEXA in the total group .18 There were significant intra-class correlations b etween DEXA with SKF (r=0.94) and BIA (r=0.91). DEXA show ed relative ly good agreement wi th both SKF [0.47 \u00b12.8 (-5.0 ( -6.9 to 6.1) k g] in the total group, but BIA sho wed greater mean prediction error for both men and wom en. This stu dy indicated th at SKF was preferable o ver BIA, Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 40 which show ed gender-specific variability in the assessment of bo dy fat. A prediction s tudy by Araujo et al. show ed that TSF <90% was not associ ated with higher odds of mo rtality.20 Oe et al. in MHD p atients found a significant co rrelation in p<0.025) four skin BF-BIA (r=0.65, p <0.005 ).24 Both techniques are comparable for LBM and BF me asurements; how ever, four site skinfold anthro pomet ry (FSA) is less affected by change in fluid s tatus. Malnutrition score was significantly correlated with bicep skinfolds (r= -0.32) in MHD stu dy by Kalantar-Zadeh et al.22 Aatif et al. show ed that fat tissue index and TSF had a posit ive significant co rrelation ( r=0.61, p<0.001 ).21 Kamimura et al. found a strong correlation between BIA and SKF (r=0.87) and near-infrared interactance and SKF (r=0.78).18 This stu dy confirmed th at the most simple, lon g-establi shed, and inexpensive method of SFT is ve ry useful for assessing body fat in patients on lon g-term MHD therapy. PD patients: Stall et al. examined five different tools to assess BF%. BF% measurements were dif ferent between all methods (p <0.001 ), although there were differences according to sex.25 For m en, all techniques were significantly different from e ach other (p<0.05) except BIA and D EXA, as well as the S teinkamp method (SKF) and to tal body potassiu m. For wom en, all techniques were significantly different from e ach other (p<0.05) except DE XA and the two m ethods for measuring SKF (Durnin & Womersley and Steink amp). D espite the differences between modali ties, all techniques w ere found to correlate significantly with each other (p<0.01 or better for men and p<0.001 or better for women). HD and PD patients: Woodrow et al. compared SKF with DEXA and BIA.19 Bland & Altman analysis demonstr ated no obs erved differences in 95% levels of agreement for percent total body fat (TBF) and FFM from S F-BIA or There in agreement between the measures. Pre-dialysis patients: Avesani et al. used a Bland-Altman plot analysis for body fat% and show ed that the b est agreement w as between SKF and DEXA compa red to o ther Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 41 measures.16 SKF also h ad significant intraclass correlations with body fat% and it significantly measured by (r=0.74, r=0.85) indic ating mode rate and good reproducibility, respectively. This stu dy indicated th at SKF may be a good method to determine body fat% in pr e-dialysis, and m ild to advanced CKD p atients. Serum Cr eatinine/Cr eatinine or creatinine kin etics and compa rative measures of muscle mass in MH D, PD and pre-dialysis patients. MHD patients: One study in creatinine kin etics correlated with creatinine l evels, and ot her traditional me asures of muscle mass (e.g. CT s can, anthropomet ric me asurements) .26 Anoth er three studies in MHD patients showed that p re- dialysis, inter- dialytic change, and w eekly creatinine clearance levels predicted mort ality.26- 28 PD PD patients, c o ther body composi tion measurements in one study;29 however, significant differences existed between creatinine and anthropom etric measures for LBM/FFM in another.30 A stu dy in PD examined creatinine clearance and relative risk of mo rtality.31 Evid ence was limited in p re-dialysis patients to study.16 CK was significantly and r=0.57, r espectively, indicating mode rate reproducibility, though the re were significant differences in adjusted me ans of BF% and FFM between CK and DEXA (p<0.05).16 Waist circumference Two studies reported on the use of waist circumference to assess nutritional st atus in dialysis patients.32, 33 MHD patients: Cord eiro et al. examined risk of PEW, infl ammation and mortality according to waist circumference tertile in MHD p atients. As w aist circumference increased, ind icating increased abdom inal fat, patients had in creased odds of PEW (assess ed by SGA) and inflammation (assess ed by IL-6). In the fully adjusted model, th ere was no in creased risk of mort ality according to waist circumference tertile.33 Guid eline in CKD Page 42 PD patients: Bazanelli et al. found a strong correlation between waist circumference and trunk f at (r=0.81, p<0.001) for both men and wom en, and a significant asso ciation with BMI (r=0.86, p <0.001 ).32 There was a mode rate agreement b etween waist circumference and trunk fat (kappa=0.59) and area und er the curve was 0.9 0. In a prosp ective evaluation of the same study, changes in w aist circumference was also correlated with ch anges in trunk fat (r=0.49, p<0.001) and kappa of 0.48 ind icated a mode rate agreement b etween the tools. The authors concluded that w aist circumference is a reliable m arker of abdom inal adiposi ty in PD patients. BMI Twenty-four studies reported on the use of BMI to assess nutritional st atus, including 17 prediction s tudies20, 27, 34 -48 and nine correlation st udies.15, 17, 21, 41, 49 -53 There were no studies examining validity or reliability of usi ng BMI in this population to classify nutritional st atus. MHD patients: Eight studies examined MHD patients on ly. Seven studies examined mort ality risk according to BMI category. In three studies,35, 47, 48 the authors examined mort ality risk according to traditional w eight categories (und erweight, normal weight, overweight and ob ese), although in a st udy with T aiwanese participants ,48 these categories were defined differently. In five additional studies, the authors examined risk according to 5 to 11 BMI categories.34, 38, 40, 54, 55 In one study that only compared two groups (< or >25 kg/m2), the authors found no associ ation between BMI and mort ality at 10 years.20 However, in the remaini ng studies in which BMI was examined according to traditional w eight status groups or by 5 to 11 categories, the re was consistent ly a higher risk of mo rtality for participants who w ere underweight, and low er risk for participants who were overweight or obese.34, 35, 38, 40, 47, 48 Length of follow -up for these stud ies ranged from 1.34 to 10 years. There was an inverse relationship with mortality when BMI was measured as a continuous v ariable in three studies,40, 46, 47 but H arell's C s tatistic was not s ignificant in de Roij van Zuijdewijn et al.27 Findings from correlation studies in dicated th at BMI was pos itively associated with albumin lev els, fat and l ean body mass (LBM) measured by a variety of methods in HD Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 43 patients. Beberashvili et al. show ed that s erum albumin was significantly and posit ively correlated with FM in MHD The higher BMI group had greater LBM (p=0.001) and FM (p=0.000 1), and hi gher phase and Extracellular Mass/Body Mass (p<0.05). MHD patients wi th elevated BMI demonstr ate better nutrition al status comp ared to normal BMI or overweight patients. Severity of in flammation w as not r elated to BMI in MHD patients. Bross et al. indicated th at BMI had a strong linear correlation with total body fat percentage measured by near infrared radiation and BIA (Segal) (r 0.85) in MHD patient.17 Fat tissue index, as estimated by BIA, was significantly correlated with BMI in the stu dy by Aatif et al.21 In another study, Kadiri et al. show ed that BMI was pos itively with album =0.04), HD patients.50 BMI was negatively correlated with CRP (r=-0.065, LBM (r=0.278, p=0.085 ). Kahraman et al. studied the relationship b etween CRP and BMI status and found that C RP levels were significantly higher in obese and underweight MHD patients comp erweight ( p<0.05).51 Steiber et al. found that mean BMI was significantly different across the 5 categories of SGA (p <0.05) in MHD patients.52 Visser et al. demonst rated th at there was a strong correlation between the 7-point SGA scale and BMI in MHD patients <0.001 ).53 MHD and PD patients: Three studies reported on the relationship betw een BMI and mortality in a combination of MHD and PD patients (Badve et al. reported results for MHD and PD patients separately). In Mathew et al., participants who surviv ed had higher baseline BMIs compared to the group that did not surviv e, but BMI category was not a si gnificant predicto r.44 Hoogeveen et al. d emonstr ated that und erweight and o besity were risk factors in a combination of MHD/PD patients less than 65 years of age, but for those who were at least 65, the re was no relationship betw een BMI and mort ality.37 Lievense et al. demonstr ated th at PD patients h ad lower mortality risk compa red to MHD patients.42Leinig et al. show ed that there was a posit ive correlation between BMI and FM in pr in CKD Page 44 and PD patients (r values ranging from 0.778 to 0.88 6, p<0.0001 ).15 Hoogeveen et al. followed dialysis patients < or 65 years of age for seven years. In the multivariable adjusted model, compared to those with \"normal\" weight status, those who were categorized as underweight (2.00 (1.30 -3.07) and obese (1.57 (1.08 -2.28) had a significant ly higher hazard of mortality for those who were <65 years, but there was no significant relationship between weight status and mortality for those 65 years of age. 37 PD pat ients: Four studies reported on the relationship b etween BMI and mortality in PD patients. Badve et al. found that u nderweight increased mort ality risk at 2.3 years, but results regarding higher BMI categories were not consis tent.34 Leinig et al. found no difference in mort ality risk according to wh ether PD patients h ad a BMI < or >23 kg/m2 at 2 years.41 McDonald et al. found t hat, in adjusted analysis, PD patients who w ere obese had higher risk of mo rtality (up to 10 years) compared to patients with norm al weight status.45 In the study by Kim et al., the group with the lowest qua rtile of BMI had the h ighest mortality risk at 2 years, but there were no other significant asso ciations 39 In a systematic review performed by Ahmadi et al. , authors confirmed an inc reased risk of 1 year mortality for people with CKD who were underweight, but this relationship did not persist for 2, 3 and 5 year mortality. Conversely, Ahmadi et al . found that overweight/obesity status decreased mortality risk at 1, but not 2, 3 or 5 y ears.56 Non-dialyzed pat ients: Finally, two studies examined the relationship b etween BMI and mort ality in no n-dialyzed CKD p Madero, et al. examined risk according to BMI quartile and found no relationship .43, 57 Hanks et al. took a di fferent app roach and examined risk not on ly according to traditional BMI categories, but also according to whether participants w ere metabolically healthy.36 Of those who w ere metabolic ally healthy, there was decreased risk for overweight/obese participants compa red to those with a norm al BMI. However, there was no dif ference in mortality risk according to weight status in those who were metabolically unh ealthy. These findings were consistent with a systematic review by Ahmadi et al. 57 Post-transplant patients: A systematic review by Ahmadi et al . examined the relationship between BMI and mortality in 150,000+ adults with CKD with kidney transplant. Authors conclude that, compared to participants with \"normal\" weight status at baseline, those who were underweight [HR on Nut rition in CKD Page 45 were at increased hazard of mortality.58 Near Infrared: Evidence examining the validity of near infrared radiation ( NIR) as a measure of body composition was too limited to make recommendations. Special discussions The guidelines for MF-BIA, DEXA and skinfold m easurements require sp ecialized equipment. Good qu ality calipers are needed to ob tain an accurate measurement of SKF. How ever, the measurer must be t rained in order to obtain accurate results. To obtain waist circumference, only a measuring tape is required. On ce again, the m easurer must be trained on how to obtain th is measure. MF-BIA is b ecoming more widely available as the technology advances. However, training is needed to unde rstand and to appropriately interpret the output from the d evice. Implementation considerations MF-BIA The guideline for MF-BIA applies to all adult patients receiving MHD. The measure must be obtain ed pos t-dialysis on a non -conducting surface for an accurate assessment. When bio imped ance is performed in patients on PD, m easurements should be done with an empty abdom inal cavity (following PD fluid dr ainage) and bladd er. For individuals on MHD with residual kidney function, bladder should be empty. There are no potential risks or h arms associ ated with the application of the guideline for MF-BIA in adult patients receiving MHD. BMI BMI is not an id eal marker of obesity, since it cannot d ifferentiate between higher weights d ue to increased adiposi ty vs. mus cularity and it cannot identify visceral adiposi ty, whi ch has negative metabolic effects. To ensure accuracy of BMI, height should be measured periodically. There are no potential risks or h arms associ ated with the application of the guideline Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 46 for BMI. The stand ard weight status categories that have been defined by the WHO according to BMI ranges for adults should be us ed in the CKD population; these include <18.5 kg/m2 for underweight; 18.5 to 24.9 k g/m2 for norm al weight; 25.0 to 29.9 k g/m2 overweight; for obese. Population -specific BMI cut -offs to define weight status may be lower for Asian populations. Limited evidence suggested that obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2) may be a risk factor for higher mortality in individuals who are on dialysis and under the age of 65. Therefore, practitioners should consider patient age when determining mortality risk according to BMI. In patients on dialysis, weight to calculate BMI should be measured following dialysis treatment to improve accuracy. Skinfold m easure ments The guideline for skinfo ld me asurements apply to all adult CKD patients, including pos t-transplant. However, for the measurements to be useful to the practitioner, lon gitudinal assessments must be done to provide meaningful information about changes in p ercent body fat for that p atient. There are no potential risks or h arms associ ated with the application of the guideline for skinfold measurements in all adult CKD patients. Skinfold me asurements may not be accurate for ob ese patients, since calipers may have upper limits that do not accommodate high levels of adiposity. Creatinine kinetics The guideline for using creatinine kin etics to measure muscle mass applies to all adult CKD patients. How ever, the p rocedure requires the patient to collect his/her urine for a 24-hour period and, p referably, to keep the collection on ic e, whi ch may make the procedure inconv enient for some patients. Furthermore, intake of meat or protein supplem ents containing creatine m ay contribute to urine creatinine excretion and th is must be consid ered when calculating creatinine kin etics. In M HD patients, c reatinine kinetics is more useful for patients who are anuric. There are no potential risks or h arms associ ated with the application of the guideline Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 47 for creatinine kin etics in ad ult CKD patients. Dual energy x-ray abso rptiometry DEXA is a v alid technique for measuring body composi tion in adult CKD patients, including post-transplant patients. In MHD and PD patients, this is despite the me asurement being influenced by over-hydration. DEXA is associated with very small amounts of radiation and this should be considered when weighing benefits and risks of this method for a particular individual . Ten screenings with DEXA results in a similar amount of radiation exposure as one chest x -ray. Measuring body weight When using published weight norms in the anthropomet ric assessment of adult CKD patients, caution must be use as each norm has s ignificant drawbacks. Ideal body weight (IBW) is the body weight ass ociated with the lowest mortality for a given height, age, sex and frame si ze and is b ased on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Height and Weight Tables. [Caution: Not gen eralizable to the CKD popula tion and data -gathering m ethods w ere not standardized .] Hamwi method can be used to estimate LBM . [Caution: A quick and easy m ethod for determining op timal body weight but has no sci entific data to support its use.] Standard Body Weight, NHANES II (SBW as per KDOQI Nutrition Practice Guid elines) describes the medi an body weight of average Americans from 1976 to 1980 for height, age, sex and frame size. [Caut ion: Although data is validated and standardiz ed and us es a large database of ethnically diverse groups, da ta is provided only on what ind ividuals weigh, not what they should w eigh in ord er to reduce morbidity and mortality.] BMI often defines generalized obesity and CKD research, sp ecific to dialysis patients, has identifi ed that p atients at higher BMIs have a lower mo rtality risk. [Caution: The researchers may not ha ve statistically adjust ed for all confound ers relat ed to comorbid conditions o ccurring in CKD on dialysis (diabet es, malignan cy, etc.) and it is uncl ear how it may relate to CKD patients not on dia lysis.] Adjust ed Body Weight is based on the theory that 25% of the excess bo dy weight Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 48 (adipose tissue) in obese patients is met abolically active tissue. [Caution: This has not been validated for use in C KD and may either overestimate or underestimate energy and protein requir ements.] Monitoring and Evaluation Anth ropomet ric measurements for assessment of body composi tion should be done routin ely in CKD patients; these include skinfold me asurements, waist circumference and creatinine kin etics. BMI should be used routin ely to assess weight status in CKD patients since it is useful in pr edicting mortality. However, in iso lation, BMI is not suf ficient to establi sh a dia gnosis of PEW unless it is very low (<18 kg/m2) However, because of the cost asso ciated with so me of these measures (e.g., MF- BIA, D EXA), there is insuf ficient evid ence for the workgroup to suggest the use of these me asurements on a routine basis in clin ical practice. Future research MF-BIA Determine the frequency with which MF-BIA measurements shou ld be performed in CKD patients , particularly in individuals who are non -dialyzed , on PD or post - transplant. Determine the validity and reliability of these measurements compa red to DEXA and anthropom etric markers of nutritional status in PD, pos t-transplant and p re- dialysis patients. BMI Examine the p redictive v alue of BMI with mortality and oth er markers of nutritional status in mainten ance dialysis patients of dif ferent racial and ethnic backgrounds. Determine whether the BMI categories for dialysis patients are similar to the general population.

Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 50 1.2 Statements on Asse ssment with La boratory Measurements Single Bio marker Measurements 1.2.1 In adults with CKD stages 1-5D and post-transplant, biomarkers as realbumin may be consid ered complementary too ls to assess nu trition al status. How ever, they should not be inte rpreted in isolation to assess nutritional st atus as th ey are influ enced by non-nutritional Serum Albumin adults with CKD on maintenance dialysis, serum albumin may be used as a predictor of hospitali zation and mort ality, with lower levels associated with higher risk (1A). Background/ Rationale Assessments of nutritional st atus in patients with CKD have traditionally relied upon bioch emical or oth er related calculated indi ces such as serum album in, pre albumin, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) as diagnostic tools. Album in is a m ajor circulating protein that plays a numb er of biologic roles, such as maint aining osmotic pressure and transporting a variety of mol ecules. Se rum pr ealbumin, also known as transthyretin, is anoth er circulating protein produced by the liver with a sho rter half-life than albumin, it is therefore more sensitive to rapid changes in nutritional st atus. nPCR is a common tool us ed to estimate protein intake and is calculated usi ng the intradialytic rise in the blood ur ea nitrogen in MHD patients and f rom urina ry urea from 24-hour urine collection in o n-dialyzed CKD p atients. The advantages of su ch ma rkers include the fact that they are easily quantifiable and available for each patient. However, these markers are known to be heavily influ enced by inflammation, illness, liver failure, volu me expansion and urinary or dialysate protein loss es (or in the case of nP CR, prot ein bal ance and other factors). In fact, serum albumin is one of the best predictors of illness or d eath in patients with E SRD. In light of this, their uti lity in assessing nutritional st atus has been re-evaluated in recent years. E xisting data sugg est that such markers are not suf ficiently reliable or valid to use in isolation for assessing nutritional status. Instead, it should be used as part of a more compr ehensive and inc lusive evaluation as used for screening purposes. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 51 Detailed Justification Serum Albumin Sixteen obs ervational studies th at comp ared serum album in concentration to other methods used to ass ess nu trition al status, including twelve studies with MHD patients, two studies with PD patients, and two stud ies with bo th MHD and PD patients were inclu ded in this review MHD patients: Amo ng the MHD studies, one was a ective cohort dy,27 two w ere retrosp ective cohort stud ies,20, 59 seven were cross-sectional studies .21, 49, 50, 60 -63 Two studies w ere diagnostic validity or reliability studies.12, 64 Gurreebun et al. determin ed that s erum albumin concentration w as a sensitive m ethod for identi fying patients at ri sk of PEW defined by the 7-point SGA s core.64 In a study by Mancini, et al., albumin independently predicted bio imped ance vector analysis in patients with norm al values of oth er nutritional indexes, but the associ ation w as not si gnificant in with p atients with worse nutritional v alues.12 Araujo et al. demonstr ated th concentration <3.5 g/dL were associ ated with higher odds of mo over 10 years [OR (95 4.10); p albumin (<38 g/L) were significantly associ ated with h igher mortality and morbidity (length of hospital st ay), but th ere was no adjustment for comorbidit ies.20, 59 De Roij van Zuijdewijn et al. determined that albumin concentration predicted all-cause mortali ty and was the most pr edictive of 8 oth er nutrition measures.27 In Yelken et al., serum albumin concentration w ere significantly correlated with h igh sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsC RP), tricep skinfold, mid -arm circumference (MAMC). 63 Serum albumin con BMI;50 7-point SGA score;61 and le an tissue ind ex, but not fat tissue index from b ioimpedance spectroscopy21 BMI and FM.49 PD patients: Of in PD, one was a prosp ective cohort stu dy 31 and the oth er was a retrosp ective cohort stu dy.65 Leinig et al. d emonstrated th at hypoalbuminemia was a significant independent predictor of mo rtality [HR (95% CI): 2.3 (1.1-5.0) ] after Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 52 follow -up.65 Chur chill et al. d escribed that for every g/L increase in serum albumin, there was a 2-year relative mortality risk (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.90, 0.97 ).31 MHD and PD patients: Both MHD and patients in two prosp ective cohort studies.44, 66 Mathew et al. found that s erum albumin concentration did n ot predict mort ality and w as not correlated with lean tissue ind ex.44 De Mutsert et al d emonst rated a 1g/dL decrease in serum albumin was associ ated with an increased mort ality 47% in MHD patients and 38% in PD patients.66 After adjusting for systemic inflammation, or for SGA and nPCR, these mortali ty risk ratios were not s tatistically significant indicating potential confounding effects of systemic infl ammation. In summ ary, one study showed that s erum albumin concentration w as a sensitive m easure of nutritional status d efined by 7-point SGA scores in MHD patients. Seven icated that s erum albumin was associ ated with other common markers of nutritio nal status in MHD patients. The p reponderance of evidence suggested that low er serum albumin con centration predicts mort ality in bo th MHD and PD patients. Inflammatory Markers There were no studies examining the v alidity and/or reliability of utili zing inflammatory markers to me asure nutritional status. Thirteen studies examined correlations between inflammatory markers and other nutrition indices, including seven studies in MHD patients, one study in PD patients, two studies in both MHD and PD patients, one study in patients with kidney transplant, and t wo studies in pre -dialysis patients. MHD patients: Amo ng the MHD studies, all seven were cross-sectional studies.49-51, 60, 62, 63, 67 hsCRP levels were positively associ ated with FM;67 and negatively associated with LBM 60, 62, 63, etric indices, or BIA measurements .67 While CRP was not associated with BMI in Vannini et al.,67 there was a negative correlation in Kadiri et al.50 Kahraman et al. found that CRP levels were highest in obese and un derweight participants compa red to their counte rparts.51 Beberashvil i no Araujo cted a cross-sectional study in PD patients. Compa red to patients with CRP level <1 m g/dL, those with CRP level 1 mg/dL had higher BMI (29.4 \u00b1 6.1 vs. 24.4 \u00b1 4.5 k g/m ; p=0.009 ), % stand ard weight 106.8 \u00b1 17.9 %; p % BF by SF-BIA (38.9 \u00b1 6 .3 vs. 26.2 low h andgrip str ength, rather than low mus cle mass measured with DE XA, was associated inflammato ry markers including hsCRP, IL-6 and T NF-.70 In addition, CRP levels were negatively associated with BIA phase angle.8 Post-Transp lant patients: Only one cross-sectional study was identifi ed for kidney transplant recipients. In this study, malnutrition inflammation score (MIS) was pos Both s tudies in pre -dialysis patients w ere cross-sectional in nature.72, 73 In a study by Wing et al., hsCRP levels were higher in the highest BMI quartile, but r esults with other cytokines were mixed. In Stages 2-4 CKD CRP levels were negatively associ ated with testos terone distribution .73 In summ ary, many studies found correlations b etween higher inflammatory markers and subopti mal nutritional status, find ings varied according to comp arison m easure. The relationship betw een BMI and infl ammatory marker levels was unclear, and a U-shaped relationship may exist. MIS was associ ated with inflammation infl ammatory in kidney transplant patients. nPCR This evid ence review included s even studies that examined the relationships b etween nPCR and compa rative measures in CKD patients. MHD patients: Of the three studies with MHD patients, one was a prospective cohort stu dy27 and the oth er two were cross-sectional studies.60, 62 In the stu dy by de Roij van Zuijdewijn et al., nPNA (nPCR) was a in CKD Page 54 p<0.01), but the authors reported that MIS and serum albumin had the b est predictive value.27 Jones et al. and Molfino et al. found that n PCR w as a significant predictor of serum albumin and pr ealbumin. 60, 62 PD and cross-sectional studies were condu cted in PD patients. The former showed that n PCR w as negatively correlated with anth ropomet ric bo and posit ively correlated ex scores (r=0.32, p<0.001 ), but there was no relationship betw and serum albumin.74 The latter study demonstr th PCR as not correlated with asured r=-0.29 p M HD and PD patients.75 Pre-dialysis patients: A cross-sectional study by Cigarran et al. ind icated that n PNA (nPCR) levels were progressively reduced across decreasing tertiles of testos terone distribution (p<0.05) in CK D.72 In summ ary, nPCR was albumin concentration and mor tality in MHD p atients. In PD patients, the relationship b etween nPCR and bo dy composi tion measurements w as unclear, and the relationships with o ther measures of nutritional status va ried. Serum Prealbumin This evid ence review included four stu dies th at examined relationships b etween prealbumin concentration and comparative measures in CKD patients. MHD patients: Of the three studies in MHD, one was a prospective cohort stu dy9 and the other two w ere cross-sectional studies.21, 62 In the study by Molfino et al., pre-albumin concentrations were associated with n PCR and IL-6 lev els.62 Prealbumin increased by 20.8 g/kg increase in nPCR (p <0.001 ), and the re was a decrease in pr e-albumin concentration of 0.94 mg /dL for each inc rease in IL-6 concentration of 1 pg/mL. In the mu ltiple regression model, pre-albumin con centration increased by 1.8 mg/dL for each kg increase in VAT (p=0.015). Fiedler et al. d etermin ed that p re-albumin co ncentration w as predictive of 3-year Guid eline on Nut in et al. d emonstr ated th at lean and fat tissue index derived by bioimped ance spectroscopy were significantly correlated with patients: In a cross-sectional study, Cigarran et al. found that p re-albumin concentration was progressively reduced across d ecreasing tertiles of testos terone in men (p<0.05).72 ary, serum ere associ ated with n PCR, inflammatory markers, lean and fat tissue index, mort ality, and hospitali zations in MHD patients. How ever, there were no studies examining validity and/or reliability of this measure compa red to a gold standard. Special Discussions The bioch emical markers must be obtained pre-dialysis for mainte nance dialysis patients. Implementation considerations The guideline for serum albumin applies to all adult patients with CKD on mainten ance dialysis. There are no potential risks or h arms associ ated with the application of the guideline for serum albumin in adult patients with CKD on mainten ance dialysis. Gold standard method for measuring albumin is nephelometry, which is not commonly used in practice due to cost and time. In patients with ESRD patients, bromoscresol green (BCG) method should be used to estimate albumin, while in pati ents without ESRD bromocresol purple method is more accurate. Future research General Determine the in cremental value of usi ng one or more nutritional ma rkers for better nutritional assessment and risk p rediction. Develop risk p rediction models using multiple nut ritional ma rkers. Determine the effects of establi shed or promis ing nutritional in terventions on Guid eline on Nut in CKD Page 56 nutritional ma rkers. Inflam matory markers Determine whether systemic inflammatory markers m ay be used to as sess nu trition al status in adult patients with CKD stages 3-5, including those on mainten ance dia lysis and with idney Serum pr Determine the frequency with which s erum pr ealbumin concentration should be measured. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 57 1.3 Statement on Ha ndgrip Strength 1.3.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D, we suggest using handgrip str ength as a surrogate measure of protein-energy status and functional status wh en baseline data (prior measures) are available (2B). and reliable method to ev aluate muscle function in patients with CKD. In addition, it can be used as an ind irect measure of nutritional status in mainten ance dialysis and non-dialyzed patients. Detailed Justification Five studi es examined relationships b etween HGS and compa rative measures in p atients with CKD, including one study with non-dialyzed patients,76 one study with incident dia lysis patients,70 two with MHD patients,77, 78and one study with PD patients.6 Overall, HGS was a valid measure of nutritional status compared to malnutrition infl ammation score (MIS) in M HD patients (sensitivity=70-87%, specificity=43-66%)78 and was negatively associated with MIS in non-dialyzed patients (r=0.42; p<0.001 ),76 but results may vary according to co nfounding variables. HGS was correlated with LBM assess ed by other methods, but there was no correlation w ith other markers of body composi tion or nutritional status in PD patients.6 In incid ent dialysis patients, HGS h ad higher correlations with nutrition al status and infl ammatory markers, and w as more predictive of mo rtality than muscle mass me asured by dual energy X-ray absorptiom etry (DEXA).70 Special discussions There is a cost asso ciated with pur chasing the equipment to measure HGS. Implementation considerations The guideline for HGS applies to all adult MHD, PD and non-dialyzed patients. The potential risk or h arm associ ated with the application of the guideline for HGS in MHD patients involves the side of the body assessed. The measurement should b e obtain ed on the opposite side of the v ascular access. In all other patients (i .e. PD and pre-dialysis), there are no potential risks or harms. Staff need to be properly trained on performi ng the m easurement and in terpreting the results. Many individuals with CKD also have type 2 diabetes, a consequence of which may Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 58 include peripheral neuropathy. Practitioners should account for potential loss in HGS due to peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes when comparing measurements over time.79 Monitoring and Evaluation Measuring HGS is simple; how ever, it is not routin ely used in clin ical practice. Future research The workgroup recommends fu rther research on HGS to det ermin e: the ti ming of the measurement (e.g. pre or post h emodialysis session, no n-dialysis day) the cutoff values that are correlated with other measures of mus cle function used as surrogate measures of nutritional status the b est method to standardize the technique (e.g. posit ion of the arm, the evaluation period, choice of arm si de) the reliability and validity of the measurement in comp arison to a gold s tandard us ed as the p referred ins trument to obtain the muscle function measurement the associ ation between HGS and other markers of physical fun ction. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 59 1.4 Statement on Methods to Assess E nergy R equirements Assessment of Resting Energy Ex penditure 1.4.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable to use indirect calorim etry to measure resting energy expenditure when feasible and ind icated, as it remains the gold s tandard for determining resting energy expenditure (OPINION). Resting Energy Ex penditure Equations 1.4.2 In adults with CKD 5D who are metabolically stabl e, we suggest that the absence of indir ect calorim etry, dise ase-specific predictive energy equations m ay be used to estimate resting energy expenditure as they include factors that may influ ence the m etabolic rate in th is popul ation (2C). Rationale/Backg round Achievi ng energy balance is critical in persons di agnosed with CKD so th at protei n-energy malnutrition and wasting can be prevented or treated in susc eptible p ersons. Thus, obtaining reliable d ata regarding dietary energy intake as well as having a valid me asure for energy expenditure is paramoun t. Indirect calorim etry remains as the b est practice measure for determining rest ing energy expenditure (REE) in adults diagnosed with CKD stages 1-5, including those receiving renal replacement the rapies such as MHD, PD or pos t-transplant. More research is needed to demonstr ate whether handheld indirect calorimetric devices may be a suita ble alternative in this popul ation. In the absence of indi rect calorim etry, there are over 200 predictive energy equations available that m ay be able to estimate REE in patients di agnosed with CKD. Several have been shown to either over- or und er-estimate REE in earlier stages of CKD as well as tho se patients treated with maintenance dialysis. There have been several cross-sectional studies th at sug gest that the energy requirements of patients with e arlier stages of CKD may not be substantially different than healthy adults, but the eviden ce is limited. Recent research has shown that predictive energy equations spe cifically designed for patients with CKD on mainten ance dialysis have lower bias and greater precision. Even the b est predictive models d esigned for CKD do not a ccount f or the contribution of Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 60 physical activity or structured exercise. Relia nce on current estimates for physical activity may not det ermine total energy requirements accurately in this population. Detailed Justification There were six studies whi ch tested REE equations in CKD patients and compared them to a reference stand ard of indirect calorimetry.80-85 Two of the six studies used indirect calorimetry data to d erive a disease-specific equation.80, 85 The Harris-Benedict equation over-estimated REE in four studies across the sp ectrum of CK D; e.g., MHD PD),82 Lee et (CAPD )83 and N eyra et al (CRF, MHD and PD),84 but the Harris-Benedict equation underestimated REE in MHD participants in Vilar et al.85 (MHD). Similarly, the Scho field equation ov er-estimated REE in Di as Rodrigues et al. (MHD)81 and K amimura et al. (non-dialyzed, MHD and PD),82 but u nder- estimated REE in Vi lar et al. (MHD).85 Byham-Gray et al. demonstrated th at the Maintenance Hemodialysis Equ ation more accurately predicted REE th an the Mifflin-St. Joer equation.80 Vilar et al. also found th at their created equation for REE was best predictor of REE when compared to traditional p redictive energy equations.85 Generally, agreement betw een equations and methods w as low -to-moderate. Special discussions Among patients with s tage 5 CKD on M HD or PD, the re are several factors that may influence energy expenditure beyond the t raditional d eterminants (age, sex, and fat-free mass ), such as hyperparathyroidis m, hyperglycemia, and chronic inflammation that shou ld be consid ered into the ov erall energy prescription. Energy needs will be variable depending on the h ealth status of the p atient (e.g., acutely ill versus chroni cally managed) as well as overall health goals (e.g., weight maintenance, repletion or loss). En ergy needs m ay be different depending on the st age of CKD and its respective treatment (dia lysis versus transplantation) . In the context of these recommendations, \"metabolically stable\" indicates absence of any active inflammatory or infectious diseases; no hospitalization within two weeks; absence of poorly controlled diabetes and consumptive diseases such as cancer; absen ce of antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications; and absence of significant short -term loss of body weight. Implementation considerations The RDN should consid er a number of factors w hen determining the energy Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 61 requirements f or adults diagnosed with CKD, and these include the patient's overall health status, CKD diagnosis and associ ated th erapies, l evel of p hysical activity, age, gender, weight status, di sease-specific determinants, met abolic stressors, and treatment goals. Disease specific equations, such as the M aintenance Hemodialysis Equation, should be used wh en estimating energy requirements for the CKD population. Thermal effects of food may be decreased in individuals who are non -dialyzed compared to dialyzed due to lower protein intake. Monitoring and Evaluation Patients should be moni tored routinely to ass ess whether energy requirements are being met satisfactorily. Ch anges in nutritional st atus shou ld be treated and the energy prescription modified accordingly. Future research Determine the energy requirements across the s pectrum of kidn ey disease and evaluate for the contribution of exercise and physical activity; i.e., inde xing total energy expenditure in CKD. Uncover the key determin ants of energy expenditure in CKD, enabling practitioners to account f or them in the energy prescription. Develop and t est predictive energy equations in CKD that can mo re accurately or precisely determine the ind ividual 's unique energy requirements. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 62 1.5 Statement on C omposite Nutritional Indices 7-point Subjective Global Assess ment (SGA) 1.5.1 In adults with CKD 5D, we recommend the use of the 7-point Subjective Glob al Assessment as a valid and reliable tool for assessing nutritional st atus (1B ). Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) 1.5.2 In adults with CKD on MHD a nd post-transplant, Malnutrition Inflammation Score may be used to as sess nutrition al status (2C). Rationale/Backg round Assessment of nutrit ional status in adults diagnosed with CKD stages 1-5 must oc cur on a routine basis in ord er to prevent and/or treat malnutrition and w asting. The Nutrition Care Process begins with a nutrition s creening, whereby key nutritional ind icators may trigger further assessment and i ntervention. Th ere are several nutrition s creening me chanisms in clinical practice, but f ew are specific to CKD, and there are limited d ata on their validity and reliability. Most of the existing tools focus on id entification of malnutrition risk; only one currently screens for PEW. Regardless of the mechanism used, the nut ritional assessment condu cted subs equent to the s creening should be compr ehensive and include the routine monitoring of nutrition care outcom es. The main components of the comprehensive nutrit ion assessment comprise anthropometric measurements, biomarkers, clinical symptoms exhibited on physical exam, dietary intake assessment, and medi cal/psychoso cial hi story. The availability of composi te nutritional ind ices [e.g., the Sub jective Glob al Assessment (SG A) or Malnutrit ion Inflammation Score (MIS)], collect such data and th erefore assist the clinician in deciding about the individual 's nutrition al status and eventual plan of care, and are specific to the unique nutritional requirements of this p atient popu lation. Detailed Justification COMPOSITE NUTRITIONAL IN DICES: SCREENI NG TOOLS Geriatric Nutrition Risk Index (GNRI) Three studies reported on the use of GNRI to assess nutrition al status, including two validity/reliability studies86, 87 and one prediction s tudy in MHD p atients.27 In one study, GNRI Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 63 had the greatest area under curve (using MIS as a reference) of the nutrition sc reening tools.87 GNRI showed a significantly negative correlation wi th the MIS (r=-0.67, P 0.0001 ), and the most accurate GNRI cutoff to identify a malnou rished patient according to the MIS was 91.2. The GNRI's sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a score of 91.2 in p redicting malnutrition according to the MIS were 73%, 82%, and 79% respectively. Anoth er study reported that GNRI had high inter-observer agreement score (k=0.98) and high intra-observer reproducibility (k=0.82).86 In another study, GNRI was a significant predictor for mo rtality at 2.97 years (p<0.001) but had low er predictive v alue for all-cause mortality compa red to Tool/M alnutrition Screening Tool (MU ST/MST) Two validity/reliability study reported on the u se of MUST and M ST tools to assess nutritional status in MHD patients.87, 88 A stu dy by Lawson et al,, reported on t he validity and reliability of both MUST and M ST tool in MHD patients.88 The sensitivity of both the MUST and MST tool was low (53. 8% for MUST; 48.7% for MST), indic ating that th ey are not particularly sensitive at identifying individuals with malnutrition in this group, compa red to SGA. Both tools h ave a high specificity (MUST=78.3%; MST=85.5%), so they are good at excluding individuals who are not malnourished. R eliability assessed by kappa was 0.58 f or MUST (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.80) and 0.33 for MST (95% CI, 20.03 to 0.54). Both tools h ad an NPV or 60% and PPV for M UST was 73.7% and for MST was 78.7%. Tho ugh the se tools are not s ensitive enough to identify all malnou rished renal in-patients, they are still fairly reliable and related to other nutrition status markers. In Yamada et al., the authors compared results from va rious malnutrition assessment too ls to the reference standard of MIS.87 MUST and M ST scores w ere both significantly associated with MIS (p<0.0001 for each). The ROC curves of the MUST and MST compa red to MIS were the smallest of the tools measured, and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to de tect hypoalbuminemia were among the lowest of all tools considered, ind icating these may not be the best tools to disc riminate nutrition al risk in patients on MH D. Mini-Nutrition Ass essment (MN A) Four studies reported on the use of M NA to assess nu trition al status in MHD patients, three were validity/reliability studies87, 89, 90 and one was a correlational stu dy.91 Afsar et al. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 64 reported on the reliability of M NA tool comp ared to SGA 3-point scale.89 The reliability coefcients was 0.93 (good degree of reproducibility). MNA might underestimate the nut ritional status of p atients on MHD who are not in an inflammatory state. Hence, MNA may not be as reliable as SGA in det ecting PEM in the MHD MNA to Bio-electrical Impedan ce An alysis (BIA), reported a significant correlation between MNA score and sin gle frequency-BIA (r=0.2, p =0.045), mus cle mass (r=0.382; visceral fat ratio (r=0.270; p=0.007 ).91 Autho rs concluded BIA is not as sensitive as MNA to detect early effects of secondary causes for malnutrition. Santin et al. 2015, compa red SGA A-SF had fair agreement (kappa=0.24; p<0.001 ).90 The worst agreement was found b etween MIS and MN A- SF (kappa=0.14, none to slight; p<0.004 ). Again, both SGA and MIS had good concurrent and predictive v alidity for CKD population, elderly individuals. Y amada et al., compa red MNA to other nutritional too ls and reported that MNA had low er area under curve (0.73) than GNRI and Nutritional Risk Score but h igher than MUST and MST .87 Nutrition Impact Symptoms (NIS) One validity study reported on the use of NIS score for identi fying those at risk of malnutrition in patients on HD and concluded th at NIS score is a us eful nutrit ion screening tool for identi fying who are at risk of malnutrition .92 NIS score >2 had the stro ngest predictive v alue for mortali ty and for predicting poor nutritional o utcom es, behind the rating of m alnourished by SGA. Con current val idity indicated simi lar agreement b etween each of the malnutrition risk tools (patient-generated subjective global assess ment (P G-SGA), an abbreviated PG-SGA and NIS). Serum albumin was p =0.018 ). Nutrition Screening Tool ( NST) One validity study reported on the use of NST to assess nutritional st atus in PD patients. In this study, NST h ad a sensitivity of 0.84 (range: 0.74 to 0.94; acceptable.93Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 65 Renal Nutrition Screening Tool ( R-NST) In another study by Xia et al. in PD patients, the R -NST w as compa red to SGA-7 point scale.94 Autho rs determined that the R-NST tool wh en compared to SGA- 7 point scale is v alid to d etect risk of m that is a good tool for identi fying renal in-patients at risk of undernutrition. Protein En ergy Wasting (PEW) score Two predictive studies reported on the use of PEW score to ass ess nu trition al status. Leinig and colleagues identifi ed that SGA and albumin were significant predicto rs of mo rtality, but BMI, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) and PEW score did not predict mort ality at 24 months in PD patients.65 However, Mo reau-Gaudry et al., a stu dy condu cted in patients on MHD recorded that PEW predicts surviv al. Each unit decrease in score was related with a 5- 7% reduction in surviv al (p<0.01).95 This score can be helpful in identi fying subgroups of patients with a hi gh mor tality rate and recommend nutrition support. COMPOSITE NUTRITIONAL INDICES: ASSESSMENT TOOLS Subjective Glob al Asses sment (SGA) Eleven stud ies examined the betw ng three validity/reliability studies52, 53, 90 and six additional prediction and/or correlation studies.27, 61, 67, 96 -98 Three studies examined the validity and/or reliability of the 7-point SGA score in MHD patients. In Visse r et al., 7-point SGA score demonstrated fair int er-observer reliability [intra- class correlation (ICC) = 0.72] and good in tra-observer reliability (ICC=0.88) in MHD patients.53 In Santin et al., SGA had <0.001) and MNA-SF (=0.24; In fair interrater Three cohort stud ies examined whether the 7-point SGA score was predictive of hard outcomes in patie nts on MH D. In Perez et al., SGA was a significant pr edictor of mortality at 2 years after adjustments for significant con founders.97 In a study by de Roij van Zuij edewijn et al., SGA was a significant predictor (p<0.001) for m ortality at 2.97 years, but had low er predictive v alue for all-cause mort ality compa red to MIS and albumin levels.27 de Mutsert and oth ers reported that hazard of mortality increased with SGA in a dos e-dependent mann er among patients on dialysis.66 Compared to norm al nutrition al status, p ersons who had a SGA of 4-5 had an increased HR (9 5% CI) at 7-year mortality of 1.6 (1.3, 1.9) and SGA of 1-3 had an HR of 2.1 (1.5, 2.8) at 7-year mortali ty. The strength of associ ation inc reased in time-dependent models. Finally, in a stu dy with PD patients, ev ery one unit increase in the 7-point SGA adapted for end-stage renal disease (ESRD)/conti nuous ambulatory PD patients, there was a 25% decreased 2 year mort ality risk (p<0.05).31 Six studies examined correlations b etween the 7-point SGA score and oth er measures of nutritional st atus. In Vis ser, et al., th ere was a strong correlation between the 7-point SGA score and BMI (r=0.79), % fat (r=0.77), id arm circumference (r=0.71) (all p<0.001)in MHD patients.53 In a study by Steiber et al., there were statistically significant differences in mean BMI and serum albumin according to SGA score in (p<0.05).52 Tapiawala et al. assessed the 7-point SGA score in patients with CK D, ESRD and those on all types of d ialysis.98 SGA scores were not c orrelated with d ietary protein and energy intake or serum albumin levels, but anth ropomet ric =0.5). Autho rs concluded 7- point SGA is a reliable m ethod of assessing nutritional st atus. Mal gorzewicz et al. compa red near-infrared measurements and MHD patients.61 LBM me asured was significantly decreased in malnourished p atients (p<0.05) and th ere was a correlation b etween SGA score and LBM( r=0.5; p<0.05) and (r=0.7; p<.0 5). In Vannini et al., SGA were associated with traditional nutritional ma rkers, reinforcing validity for use among patients on MH D. SGA score was not associ ated with CRP lev el.67 Jones et al. examined the relationship between 3-point SGA score and a composi te nutritional s core that inc luded SGA (3 point and 7 point), BMI, % reference weight, skinfold and MAMC measurements and albumin levels in patients treated by MHD.96 Compa red to the Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 67 composi te score, the S GA score misclassifi ed a \"large numb er of subjects\" and score w as not associ ated with ma ny nutrition parameters such as dietary intake, BMI or albumin levels. In one study99, the authors ut ilized a version of the SGA th at was adapted for patients on MHD, and in two studi es,65, 100 the v ersion of the SGA tool us ed was unclear. Garagarza et al. compa red bio imped ance spectroscopy measurements to SGA scores from a version mod ified for MHD99 that includ ed a 5-point score compris ing weight changes, eating habits, gastroin testinal symptoms, fun ctional activity and comorbidit ies. PEW measured by BIS extracellular weight (ECW)/body weight (BW) was pos itively (p=0.009) and SGA score (p =0.03). Leinig et al. examined the relationship betw een SGA score and mort ality risk at 24 months in PD patients, but ve rsion of the SGA employed was unclear. SGA score was a significant predictor of mo rtality in PD patients.65 Passadakis et al. compa red BIA measurements to SGA score in CAPD p atients, but the version of SGA utilized was uncertain.100 SGA was significantly correlated with imped ance 8) and ph ase angle (r=0.43; p=0.0048 ). Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) Eight studies reported on the use of MIS to ass ess nutritional st atus, including two validity/reliability studies86, 90, four prediction s tudies9, 27, 97 and thr ee correlation studies).71, 76, 101 One study by Bebershavili et al. reported that MIS had mode rate int er-observer agreement (k=0.62) and in ter-observer reproducibility (k=0.77) and is a valid tool for longitudinal assessment of nutritional st atus of p atients on MH D.86 Anoth er study by Santin et al., indicated that MIS had good agreement with SGA (k=0.43, p<0.001) and w orse agreement with MN A- SF (k= 0.14, p <0.004).90 MIS also had good concurrent and p redictive v alidity for the MHD population. Four studies reported on the use of MIS as a predictor of mortali ty.9, 27, 90, 97 Three of the studies reported that in patients on MH D, MIS is a significant pr edictor of mort ality. 9, 27, 97 In one stu dy, MIS was a significant pr edictor for mortality at 2.97 years (p<0.001 ), and best predictiveGuid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 68 tool for all-cause mortality and secondary end-points like cardiov ascular events in patients on MHD.27 Anoth er study by Fiedler et al. also reported that MIS was predictive of both mortality and hospitali zations in p atients treated by MHD with survival analysis ind icated th at MIS was one of the best predicto rs of mo rtality [HR 6.25 (2.82 - 13.87 ), p<0.001 ].9 Perez et al. also indicated th at MIS was a significant predictor for 2 year mo rtality in MHD patients.97Finally, in Santin et al., while mi ld MIS did not predict mort ality, severe MIS was a significant predictor of mortality in adjusted analysis [HR (95% CI): 5.13 (1.19, 13.7 ).90 Three studies reported on the use of MIS and correlation wi th other tools. Ampa ro et al, indicated th at there was a significant negative correlation betw een hand grip strength and MIS (r= -0.42, p<0.001) in predialysis subjects.76 Hou et al. indicated th at MIS was strongly correlated with mod ified quantitative subje ctive p atients.101 Molnar et al. reported that MIS showed significant negative correlations with abdominal circumference (p= -0.144; whereas significant posi tive transplant recipients.71 All s tudies show t hat MIS is a us eful tool to ass ess nu trition al status in CKD patients. Other Composite Nu tritional Indices Nutrition Risk Score A prediction s tudy reported that N utrition Risk Score was a good predictor of mo rtality (HR 4.24 (1.92-9.38), p<0.001) in patients on MHD and w as superior when compa red to lab markers and BIA in pr edicting mortality.9 Protein Nutrition Index (PNI) A reliability study investi gated PNI as a predictor of su rvival in PD patients. Compa red to the reference stand ard (nPNA (nPCR) 0.91 as malnutrition), the sensitivity, specificity, posit ive and negative predictive value of PNI were 0.4, 0.978, 0.901 and 0.783, respectively.102 This study ind icated th at PNI is a good predictor of mo rtality (even after adjusting for age and comorbidit ies). An inc rease in PNI score by 1 led to a 16% decrease in mortality risk. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 69 Composi te Score of Prot ein En ergy Nutrition Status ( cPENS) de Roij van Zuijdewijn et al. studied eight nu trition assessment too ls used to p redict all-cause mort ality.27 Composi te Score of Prot ein En ergy Nutrition Status had a Harrell's C s tatistics of 0.63 (0.61 - 0.66) for predicting mortali ty. However, the study indicated th at it had in adequate discrimination and calibration or a lower predictive v alue for mortality. Other Measures Blumberg et al. comp ared the integrative score with the SGA-7-point scale in MHD p atients. Integrative clinical nutrition dia lysis score is bas ed bioch emical measures of albumin, creatinine, urea, cholest erol, C RP, dialysis adequacy, and w eight change.103 With every unit increase in integrative score, the odds of death were significantly decreased (HR=0.929, CI 0.885 -0.974, (n=69, r=0.853, p <0.01) and according to the author this is a useful p rognostic tool to detect early nutrition det erioration. A prediction s tudy investigated which nutritional compos ed scoring system best pr edicts all- cause mortali ty in MHD patients.97 This stu dy indicated th at SGA and MIS are better predicto rs of all-cause mortali ty at 15.5 months in this study and International Society of Renal Nutrition and M etabolism c riteria was not able to predict mort ality in this sample. One correlation stu dy investigated the relationship between body adiposi ty index (BAI), BIA, anthropom etrics, and DEXA.104 The correlation coefficient anthropom etric measurements ( r=0.76) and BAI (r=0.61) when compared to BIA (r=0.57) in the adjusted analysis (p<0.0001 ). Results sug gest BIA estimates body fat with high accuracy in non-dialyzed CKD patients. Special discussions The large body of literature on nutritional assess ment and composi te nutritional ind ices have been completed in CKD 5D. While some of these tools may be relevant and can be translat ed to earlier stages (1-4) CKD, th ere is a need for the practitioner to conduct a compr ehensive Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page nutrit ional assessment comp rising the m ain doma ins of the Nutrition Care Process. PEW, a term support ed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism, describes the complexity of nutritional and m etabolic alterations that exist in CK D. While PEW definition is us eful in identify patients with overt nutrit ional abno rmalities, its sensiti vity criteria. While compr ehensive nutrit ional indices have been validated for the recognition of a poor nutritional st atus (e.g., malnutrition), it is un clear how well some of these same tools m ay be applied in the early ident ification of PEW. Implementation considerations Rout ine nutrition sc reening of adults diagnosed with CKD stages 1-5D should oc cur to allow for the identifi cation and fu rther assessment and treatment of con cerns. A compr ehensive nutrition ass essment, using a composi te nutritional ind ex, should be condu cted at the initial visit and completed whenever there is a change in health status or as per inst itutional or regulatory policies. Monitoring and Evaluation The compr ehensive nutr ition assessment will guide the nutrition intervention prescribed. The clinician should mon itor key nutrition care outcomes b ased on the t reatment plan prescribed and re-assess and change the pl an accordingly to achieve the goals established. Future research More research is n eeded in trying to standardize the methods for nutrition sc reening mechanisms so that early identifi cation and ref erral can result. Addit ional investigations shou ld focus on wh at composi te nutritional ind ices, if any, can be used reliably in earlier stages of CK D. More research is needed to examine which composite nutritional indices are appropriate for nutrition screening or assessment in people with CKD who are non -dialyzed. More research is needed examining validity and reliability of the GNRI and SGA tools in elderly people with CKD. Further development and testing of screening and assessment too ls for PEW are necessary, especially in terms of response to nu trition al interventions. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 71 1.6 Statement on Tools/Methods Used to Assess Protein and Energy Intake Consi derations when Assessi ng Dietary Intake 1.6.1 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable to assess factors beyond d ietary intake (e.g. medi cation us e, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behavior and access to food, depression, cognitive function etc.) to effectively plan nut rition interventions. ( OPINION). 3 Day Food Records to Assess Die tary Intake 1.6.2 In adults with CKD 3-5D, we suggest the use of a 3-day food record, condu cted during both d ialysis and non-dialysis treatment days (when applicable), as a preferred method to ass ess dietary intake (2C). Alternative Methods of Assessing Dietary Intake 1.6.3 In adults with CKD 3-5 (OPINION) and 5D (2D), 24-hour food r ecalls, food frequency questionnaires and rmalized protein catabolic rate (nP CR)/no rmalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) may be consid ered as alternative methods of assessing dietary energy and protein in take (2D). Rationale/Background Poor nutritional intake and ob esity are prevalent among patients d iagnosed with CKD and therefore, it is import ant to mon itor diet ary intake that p rovides info rmation on to tal energy, macro- and m icro-nutri ents as w ell as overall food/liquid servin gs and eating patterns. In this context, it is important to identi fy reliable m ethods for estimating dietary intake in diverse care settings. Und er- and over-reporting of inta ke are a concern in this popul ation. Detailed Justification A tot al of six studies reported on use of methods to assess p rotein and energy intake in CKD subjects.105-111 Food Records/Dia ry Based on t he findin gs of four studies, food records/diary for assess ing dietary intake of protein and calories were reliable and correlated with r eference standards. Food records can provide accurate information if p atients are instructed and trained, and food intake is recorded for at least 7 d ays. 107-109. Two studi es used food dia ry/3-day food records to determine underreporting of energy intake in no n-dialyzed and PD patients.105, 106 Underreporting w as Guid eline Nut CKD Page 72 72.5% of non-dialyzed CKD patients and 52.5% PD patients. Both the studies indicated th at underreporting was mo re pronounced in ove rweight patients. Shap iro et al. compared en ergy intake measured by 3-day food record (dietitian interview-assisted) and REE measured by indirect calorimetry. Energy intake reported by interview-assisted food records were lower than measured REE.111 Food Frequency Questionnaires Delgado et al. condu cted a validation stu dy comparing Block Brief 2000 food frequency questionnaire (BFFQ) against 3-day food diary records112 and found the Block Brief 2000 food frequency questionnaire under-estimated energy and macronut rient intake in patients on hemodialysis. How ever, the use of simp le calibration equations can be used to ob tain intake similar to 3-day food diary records. Protein Catabolic Rate Three studies examined the use of protein catabol ic rate (PCR) to ass ess prot ein intake in CKD patients,110, 113, 114 and found si gnificant co rrelations with r eference stand ards for measuring dietary intake (ex: food records). However, PCR ov erestimated protein in take when daily protein intake was <1 g/kg and w hen daily protein intake was >1 g/kg it was underestimated by PCR. In PD patients, PNA (PCR) normalized to desirable bo dy weight was correlated better with BUN (r=0.702) and Kt/V (r=0.348 ). 114 Special discussions Despi te the food record/dia ry being the most rel iable and val id measure of dietary in take among pat ients d iagnos ed with CKD, it does rely on accu rate reporting inclus ive of portion sizes. The food record may be seen as cumbersome to complete for seve ral days an d is l imited to individuals that are able to read and record inta ke reliably. With the gen eration of smartphone appl ications, there has been a bu rgeoning in terest in recording dietary in take using technology, with limited success in its adopt ion among certain subgroups (e.g., elderly). In non-dialyzed CKD patients. 24 -hour urine collection to measure urine urea nitrogen (UUN), sodium and potassium is more reliable to yield estimates of DPI, sodium and potassium. Dietary in take methods may need to be simpl ified, mod ified, or be combined with a f ew strategies in order to obt ain rel iable dietary in take data, wi th emphasis on them being Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 73 culturally appropriate. Implementation considerations Rout ine dietary assessm ent among adults diagnosed with CKD stages 1-5D should occur to allow for the identification and tr eatment of nutritional con cerns related to nutri ent intake. Assessing dietary intake using multiple, complementary methods, such as FFQ and 24-hr urin e collection to measure urine urea nitrogen, sodium and potassium, may be useful to confirm accuracy of dietary intake estimates. Dietary assessment should be condu cted at the initial visit and completed whenever there is a change in health status or as per inst itutional or regulato ry policies. Monitoring and Evaluation A tho rough assessment of dietary intake will guide the nut rition intervention pr escribed. The clinician should mon itor key nutrition care outcomes b ased on the t reatment plan and re-assess and change the pl an accordingly to achieve the goals establish ed. Future research Identify the b est methods for dietary assessment among adults diagnosed with CKD stages 1-5D and those receiving a kidney transplant. Focus on how to better determine ins tances of under- and over-reporti ng of dietary intake in this population. Further development and testing of dietary assessment too ls to integrate technolo gy and assist individuals wi th limited li teracy, vision, and are culturally appropriate. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 74 GUIDELINE 2: MEDICAL NUTRITION TH ERAPY 2.1 Statements on Medical Nut rition Therapy (MNT) MNT to Improve Outcomes 2.1.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D, we recommend that a registered dieti tian nutritionist (RDN, USA or international nutrition credential) in close collaboration with a physician, or oth er provider (nurse practitioner or physician assistant), p rovide m edical nutrition therapy (MNT). Goals are to opt imize nutritional st atus, and to m inimize risks imposed by co-morbidit ies and alterations in met abolism on the p rogression of kidney disease (1C) and on adverse clinical outcomes (OPINION). MNT Cont ent 2.1.2 In adults with CKD 1-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable to p rescribe MNT that is tailor ed to the individuals' n eeds, nutrition al status and co-morbid c onditions (OPINION). MNT Monitoring and Eval uation 2.1.3 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable for the registered dietitian nut ritionist (R DN) or an international equival ent to mon itor and evaluate appetite, di etary intake, biochemical data, anthro pomet ric measurements, and nutritio n- focused physical findin gs to ass ess the effectiveness of medi cal nutrition therapy (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round Individualized man agement of nutritional in take is a crucial aspect of care for individuals diagnosed with a ny stage of CK D, including those on mainten ance dialysis and those who h ave received a kidney transplant. Th ese patients are vulnerable for nutritional abnorm alities, which are associated with h igher risk for morbidi ty, mor tality, and le ngth of hosp ital st ay. Nut ritional needs change throughout the dis ease course, from the earlier stages of CKD to the post- transplant period. The metabolic abnorm alities and co-morbid dis eases that often accompa ny CKD further emphasi ze the n eed for specialized nutrition he alth care. Therefore, it is ess ential that su ch ind ividuals r eceive tailored nutrition ass essment and counseling in the form of MN T. MNT is a collaborative approach that typically requires the m edical expertise and prescription of M NT by a physician or oth er provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant) and implem entation by an RDN, or international equival ent). Th ese roles are not mutual ly exclusive and invo lve ongoing team-patient an alysis and dis cussion. Participating providers Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 75 and RDN are recommended to have received specialized education and training in nu trition and CKD in accordance with the requirements set forth by local regulations. Medical Nut rition Therapy (MNT) In 2002, t he then American Dietetic Association publ ished a nutrition c are model that p rovided eviden ce-based, high-quality standardized care for patients with CKD, non-dialyzed and pos t- transplant.115 The document w as later revised in 20 10, whi ch reported that n utrition care provid ed by an RD up to twice monthly over a one-year period can have a valuable role in the medi cal care of the CKD patients by: Providing nutrit ion assessment and in terventions to d elay kidney disease progression in addition to co-morbid c onditions such as diabetes mellitus, cardiov ascular disease, dyslipidemia, gout, neph rolithiasis; Utilizing behavioral methods to individual ize the approach and minimize barriers to individuali zed goals; Providing individuali zed me al plans and follow up on adherence and su ccessful implem entation. Interventions in clude but are not limited to w eight management and mainten ance/repletion of patient nu trition rting obtaini ng contributing to correction of electrolyte abnorm alities, assisting in anemia management and man aging bone disease through nutrition assessment and di etary interventions in cluding individuali zed me al plans; Assis ting identi and in collab oration with nephrol ogy Provid er (Medical Doctor, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assist ant); Providing and upd ating nutrition the rapy as new knowl edge emerges. Detailed Justification MNT requires nutrition screening and assessment of nutritional status to provide indiv idualized treatment for specific disease states. CKD patients are on a dynamic nutrition trajectory according to their dis ease stage and MNT is n eeded at each stage of CK D. Metabolic abnorm alities, acid ba se, fluid and electrolyte balances often change as CKD progresses. For Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 76 example, a patient can be hypokalemic during Stage 2 CKD requiri ng potassium suppl ement ation and a high potassium diet. Months or years later, this s ame patient during Stage 4 CKD might be come hyperkalemic, requiring medi cation adjustment and diet ary potassium restriction r ather than suppl ement ation. Should this same p atient receive a kidney transplant, they might stabilize potas sium balance and have no need for potassium suppl ement ation or dietary potassium restriction. This type of complicated CKD patients requires specialized nutrit ion health care and ongoing monitoring by a nephrology RDN. Sixteen RCTs examining the effect of MNT on n utrition-related outcom es were identif ied in the system atic review. However, these studies were heterogeneous in t erms of the popul ations (five studies in cluded p atients who were non-dialyzed, nine in cluded p atients on MH D, one includ ed patients on CAPD, and one t-transplant); inte among the studi es); and dyslipidemia. Intervention anged from four weeks to two years. CKD Progression In four of the studies ranging from 4 weeks to 4 months, authors found no effect of MNT on CKD progression in no n-dialyzed patients comp ared to pa rticipants r nutrition edu cation for CKD, whi ch may or may not have also be en provid ed by an RDN. Interventions r anged from one i n-person contact plus phone contacts wi th the RDN for 12 weeks (S tage 4 CKD)116 to a mul ti-disciplina ry intervention including 4 weeks an RDN (Stages 3-4 CK (Stages 3-5 CK D).119 SGA Scores Three RCTs, including two study populations, r eported on the effect of MNT on SGA scores. Campbell et al. demonstr ated th at malnourished S tage 4 CKD patients' SGA scores significantly improved in the intervention group compa red to the control group, for whom malnutrition by SGA score inc reased.116 The intervention consisted of nutritional couns elling Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 77 from an RDN for 12 weeks, with an emphasis on s elf-management techniques, face-to-face consultation at b aseline, and tel ephone consultation ev ery two weeks for the first month, and then month ly for the next 2 months. In Leon et al., MHD participants received mon thly consultation by RDN for 12 mon ths.120 Intervention RDNs were trained to d etermine potential b arriers to achievi ng normal albumin levels for each patient, to attempt to ove rcome the b arriers, and to monitor for improv ements in b arriers. There was no di fference in the percentage of participan ts that h ad improved or decreased SGA scores between groups. BMI Four RCTs examined the effect of MNT interventions on BMI, includi D),117, 119 one study participant s120 and one with post- transplant patients.121 Howden et al. examined the effect of 12-month mu lti-disciplina ry lifestyle inte 3-4 CK D.117 The intervent ion group received 4 w eeks of group behavioral and li festyle modification sessions provid ed by an RDN and a psychologist. Mean BMI significantly decreased in the intervention group compa red to the stand ard care group (p<0.01). Paes-Barreto et al., examined the effect of MNT on BMI 119 in participants with st ages 3-5 CKD who received i ndividualized dietary counselling monthly for four months. In addition to the routine couns elling, an inte rvention a low-protein and low - sodium d iet. Th ere was a significantly greater decrease in BMI in the intervention group compa red to the standard care group (p<0.01). In Leon et al., MHD participants received monthly consultation by an RDN to det ermine and address barriers to reaching norm al serum albumin levels for 12 mon ths.120 There was no effect on BMI, though this was not the obj ective of the intervention. Finally, in Orazio et al., intervention participants r eceived RDN couns elling using a Mediterranean-style diet, wh ich consisted of a low glycemic index and mode rate energy deficit. MNT couns elling w as based the S tages of Cha nge Mod el.121 There was no dif ference in change in BMI between groups after 2 years. In a meta-analysis of two studies, participants who received MNT h ad a greater mean (95% CI) decrease in BMI compare to the control groups (=1.52, ResultsGuid eline on CKD Page 78 regarding effect of MNT on arm and waist circumference as well as body composi tion w ere limited and un clear. Phosphate Le vels Eight studies examined the effect of MNT on ph osphorus/p hosph ate levels in MHD p atients for durations ranging from 8 w eeks to 6 mon ths. In Ashu rst et al. and Lou et al., phosphoru s- focused education, p rovided once and mon thly for 6 months, r espectively, significantly improved (decreased) m ean serum phosph ate levels.122, 123 In Karavetian et al., weekly education nutrition couns elling for 2 mon ths also de creased phosph ate levels (p<0.01).124 However, Mor ey u sed phosphoru s-focused RDN couns elling and education, mon thly for 6 mon ths, and found no dif ference in change in pho sphate levels bet ween groups at 6 months .125 Participants r eceiving a multi-disciplina ry nutrition edu cation program did not have any changes in phosph ate levels comp ared to participants receiving an oral nutrition supplem ent (ONS).126 In Reese et al., p articipants who were coached by a trained RDN about d ietary and medi cation adherence (3 times a week) for 10 weeks were compared to patients receiving a financial inc entive or usual care.127 There were no between-group differences in ch ange in phosph ate levels. There was no effect of MNT in the form of diet ary counselling in CAPD patients128 or in the form of RDN couns elling lo w-protein and cation in non -dialyzed patients119 on ph osphate levels, but the objectives of th ese studies were to improve energy, protein and sodium intake. Meta-analysis of four studies with compa rable data revealed th at, mean (95% CI) were decreased -0.715 phosphorus/phosphate levels 126, 129 but effect on phospho rus/phosph ate levels as well as the effect on calcium or pot assium levels in non-dialyzed patients,119 was unclear. Lipid Prof ile Three RCTs examined the effect of MNT from an RDN on lipid pro file.117, 118, 126 In Hernandez-Morante et al., M HD participants in the inte rvention group received a 12-session multi- disciplina ry Nutrition E ducation Program over four months, including group and Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 79 individual therapy, while control participants r eceived an oral nu trition suppl ement th ree days/week.126 Within group analysis show ed no si gnificant changes in mean triglycerides and to tal cholest erol levels ov er 4 months. There was a significant increase in mean low- density lipoprotein cholest erol (LDL-C) and erol (HDL-C) in tudy period (p<0.001 for each me asure). Between-group analysis was not r eported. Both Howd en et al. and Flesher et al. examined the effect of MNT in Stages 3-4 CKD participants. In Ho wden et al., in tervention participants received a multi-disciplina ry lifestyle intervention for 12 months .117 It included 4 weeks of group b ehavioral and lifestyle modifi cation by an RDN and a psychologist. No si gnificant ch anges were observed in triglyceride or total, H DL or LDL cholest erol levels betw een the 2 groups. In Flesher et al., in addition to the stand ard nutrition care for CK D, the inte rvention group received cooking classes over 4 weeks for 2 hou rs per session and a shopping tour led by an RD N.118 No significant difference was obs erved in mean total cholest erol level between the 2 groups. Pooled analysis con firmed no effect of MNT on to tal cholest erol and tr iglyceride levels. However, in po oled analysis, LDL lev els were decreased by MNT (Mean (95% CI): -6.022 ( - clear effect of MNT on blood pr essure (BP). Protein intake Six RCTs examined the effect of MNT on protein intake in CKD patients. Two of those stud ies targeted p rotein intake as their prim ary outcome of the MNT p rovided to t he participants. Paes-Barreto et al. educated non -dialysis patients on eating a low protein diet (LPD) ,119 while Leon et al. couns eled M HD participants on following a high protein diet .120 Both s tudies show ed high compliance of recommended protein intake among the p articipants in the inte rvention group as compa red to the control group. The other four studies did not show any signifi cant differences in protein int ake between the inte rvention and control groups, but p rotein intake was not the prim ary outcom e. The utilization of MNT p rotocols h as the pot ential to pr eserve nutritional status, modify risk factors for progression of kidney disease, as well as assist wi th living with CKD from a di et Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 80 and lifestyle prosp ective throu gh teaching patient's healthy food choices in an individuali zed mann er. Special Discussions The full uti lity and value of M NT provided by the RDN on both nu trition outcom es and risk of morbidi ty, mortality and hospitali zations h as not yet been fully identifi ed. The impact of the RDN in many disease states and the v alue of repeated contacts wi th an RDN on sp ecific nutrition pa rameters has been documen ted in the literature 130. This is particularly true for CKD patients as w ell as in other disease states and metabolic phenotypes such as obesity that affect CKD risk and exacerbation of CKD progression. While MNT out comes research is still in its infancy, the studi es that do exist exhibit important relationships on nutrition pa rameters and other outcom es. An MNT d atabase that mon itors MNT intervention effectiveness on nutrition and ov erall outcome p arame ters would enable the formalization of this an alysis. Studies that prove causality or significant association betw een MNT application and patient outcom es is currently in progress. In addition, the strength of the evidence in studies reviewed prohibits strong recommendations due to the variability in study populati ons, proto cols and analyses. Therefore, this section includ ed recommendations th at are mostly opinion based. MNT facilitates the delivery of Nutrition Practice Guid elines throu gh a systemic approach of delivery that is b ased on scientific eviden ce and expert opinion. The education, content and practice expertise for the provision of MNT individuali zed care is found w ithin the s cope of practice of the RDN with expertise in n ephrolo gy. Implementation considerations Evid ence based protocols are inherent to MNT but do not r eplace individua lized modification. Implementation of MNT for CKD patients requires the formation of a fiscal structure that will support the inte gration of MNT into ro utine medi cal management of CKD patients. The inte rest level to integrate MNT into clinical practice exists by many nephrol ogy and general medi cine clinics, ho wever, the lack of adequate reimburs ement for RDN services Guid eline in CKD Page 81 Demand for MNT is growing as the global p revalence of CKD increases. Reimbursement pol icies for dis ease prevention need to include M NT. Legislation awareness is needed to d isseminate the v alue of MNT. MNT m ay be delivered through telehealth options, in ord er to improve patient education and su ccessful mainten ance of nutrition interventions and adherence. Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation of M NT on p atient's nutritional parameters is an essential component of treatment and in cludes assessment of patient's labs, nutrit ional status, etiolo gy of kidney disease, lifestyle (stress, exercise, evaluation of smok ing and alcohol use, etc.), and patient identified nutrition goals. Future research Development of an MNT database is imperative to the formalization of MNT out comes research. Evaluation of the Impact of MNT care on progression of kidn ey disease by analysis of associ ation with risk f actors of co-morbid conditions is necessary. Patient ou tcomes p ertaining to the individuali zed nutrition p lan formulated for patients and /or g roup classes to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy should be explored in future studies. Research examining access to MNT as well as methods (ex: fiscal, referral, etc.) that support MNT access for individuals with CKD. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 82 GUIDELINE 3: PROTEIN AND ENERGY INTAKE 3.0 Statement on Energy Intake 3.0.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D (1C) and post-transplant (OPINION) who are metabolically stable recommend prescribing an energy intake of 25-35 kcal/kg LBM per day based on age, gender, level of p hysical activity, body composi tion, weight status goals, CKD stage, and concurrent illness or p resence of infl ammation to maintain norm al nutrition al status. 3.1 Statements on Protein Amount Protein Restriction, Non-Dialysis 3.1.1 In adults with CKD 3-5 who are metabol ically stab le, we recommend protein restriction wi th or without keto acid an alogs, to reduce risk for ESRD/d eath (1 A) and improve QoL (1C). Protein restriction should be supervised by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) or equivalent in collaboration with a physician. a low p rotein diet p roviding 0.55 to 0.60 g dietary protein/kg ideal body weight/day, OR a very-low protein diet providing 0.28 to 0.43 g dietary protein/kg ideal body weight/day with a dditional k eto acid an alogs to me et protein requirements (0.55 to 0. 60 g /kg body weight/day) Dietary Protein Intake, Maintenance Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dia lysis 3.1.2 In adults with CKD on MHD (1C) and PD (OPINION) who are metabolically stable, we recommend prescribing a dietary protein intake of 1.0 -1.2 g /kg ide al body weight per day to maintain a stable nutritional st atus. Dietary Protein Intake, Diabetes Mellitus 3.1.3 In the adult with CKD 3-5 and who have diabetes, it is reasonable to prescribe a dietary protein intake of 0.8 - 0.9 g /kg ideal body weight per day to maintain a stable nutritional st atus and opt imize glycemic control (OPINION). 3.1.4 In adults with CKD on MHD a nd PD and who have diabetes, it is reasonable to prescribe a dietary protein intake of 1.0 -1.2 g /kg ide al body weight per day to maintain a stable nutritional st atus. For patients at risk of hyper and/or hypoglycemia, higher levels of dietary protein intake may need to be consid ered to maintain glycemic control ( eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 83 Protein metabolism in the body is respons ible for adequate growth in children and mainte nance of body protein mass su ch as mu scle mass in adults. Every day, approximately 250 g of protein are cataboli zed, leading to protein catabolic products, such as urea and ma ny other known or unidentifi ed compounds. Most of th ese degradation products are norm ally cleared by the kidneys and excreted in urine. When kidn ey function declines , there will be an accumulation of th ese by-products into the blood, which will progressively impair organ function131 This has been clearly identifi ed for compounds su ch as P-cresylsulphate, ind oxyl-sulph ate, trimet hyl now uremic toxins. Secondly, protein intake is respons ible for a major fraction of kidney workload, and many experimental and clinical research have confirmed t he renal effects of a protein load and a deleterious role of the renal hyperfiltration response associ ated with prot ein intake. Therefore, in a situ ation of nephron reduction, su ch as CKD, reducing protein intake will reduce hyperfiltration, with an additive effect to those of angiotensin-reducing drugs.131 As a consequence of both actions, reducing uremia and uremic toxins on one hand and improving renal hem odynamics on the other hand, a reduction in protein in take may reduce clinical symptoms and postpone the n eed to start maintenance dialysis treatment. In the context of these recommendations, \"metabolically stable\" indicates absence of any active inflammatory or infectious diseases; no hospitalization within two weeks; absence of poorly controlled diabetes and consumptive diseases such as cancer; absence of antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications; and absence of significant short -term loss of body weight. Detailed Justification Energy Intake Energy metabolism maybe impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease. Hence, maintaining adequate energy intake is necessary to prevent protein -energy wasting. Evidence from ten controlled trials in pre -dialysis population and from 3 studies in MHD patients indicates that energy intake ranging from 30 -35 kcal/kg/d helps maintain neutral nitrogen balance and nutritional status .132-144However, it is important to remember that many other factors may influence energy expenditure beyond traditional determinants like age, sex, and fat -free mass. Some of these factors include hyperparathyroidism, hyperglycemia, and chronic Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 84 inflammation that should be considered into the overall energy prescription, health status (e.g., acutely ill versus chronically managed), overall health goals, and weight maintenance --repletion or loss. There is still paucity of controlled metabolic stu dies, as well as long -term well -designed outpatient clinical trials studying energy intake in this population. Results from an old metabolic study examining energy requirements in MHD (sample size = 6) indicated that mean energy intake of 35 kcal/kg/d hel ped maintain neutral nitrogen balance and body composition .145 Another similar study in 6 individuals indicated that average intake of 38 kcal was desirable to maintain neutral nitrogen balance.146 Recent review articles not included in this evidence review, also suggest that energy intake in the range of 30 -35 kcal/kg/d is appropriate to maintain maintains neutral nitrogen balance and nutritional status.131, 147 Protein intake Reducing protein intake may impair nutrit ional status in individuals at risk for PEW. However, it is a well-known fact that adults in w estern countries eat too much p rotein (1.35 g protein/kg/d) as compa red with their optimal d aily needs, estimated to be 0 .8 g protein/kg/day. Further, metabolic b alances in h ealthy adults and CKD patients have confirmed th at, provided a sufficient energy intake (e.g., above 30 kcal/kg/d), the protein intake level can be safely decreased to 0.5 5-0.6 g protein/kg/d. A further reduction in protein intake to 0.3-0.4 g protein/kg/d can be achieved with the addition of pills of keto acid an alogs to ensu re a sufficient bal ance of the essential amino acids (EAAs) no rmally brought by animal pro teins, which are essential ly absent in these low protein vegan-like diets. PROTEIN RESTRICTION AL ONE In adults with CKD/kidney transplant, thirteen RCTs r eported the effect of protein restricti on only (no suppl ementation) on outcom es of inte rest.136, 138, 143, 144, 148 -156 Duration of the follow -up in the included studies ranged from 3 months to 48 months. (Appendix - study characteristics table) Survival/R enal D eath Research reports a beneficial effect of protein restriction (0.5 5-0.6 g/kg/d) on ESRD/d eath in Guid eline in CKD Page 85 adults with CKD. In adults with CKD, 5 RCTs r eported findin on effect of protein restriction on surviv al/deaths. Thr ee studies clearly indicated a beneficial effect of m oderate restriction in dietary protein on the development of ES RD/death.140, 151, 155 Rosman et al. indicated p eople consuming 0.6 g/kg/d of protein had b etter survival (55%) compared to patients consum ing free protein intake (40%).155 Hansen et al. indicated that d eath or ES RD was significantly lower in low p rotein in take group (0.6g/kg/d) (10%) compared to usual protein intake (27%).151 Locatelli et al. also show ed that LPD (0.6 g/kg/d) had fewer events (27/19 2) compared to usu al protein intake (1g/kg/d) (42/188), borderline significant (p <0.06).140 Whereas, Cianciaruso et al. indicated th at cumulat ive incid ences of d eath and dia lysis therapy start were unaffected by the diet regimen, and low protein intake group (0.55 g/kg/d) do es not s eem to confer a surviv al advantage compa red with a mod erate protein intake group (0.80 g/kg/d) but m ay be explain ed by a relative ly small sample size.148 Pooled t ogether, results from the s econdary analysis on the numb er of events of d eath/ESRD combined from the th ree studies ind icated a beneficial effect of protein restriction on de ath /ESRD (OR 0.621 CI: 0.391, 0.985 ). 140, 148, 151 Quali ty of Life Research reports an improved quality of life of a protein restrict ed diet in one study. In adults with CKD, one RCT examined the effect of p rotein restriction on quali ty of life.143 QoL scores at the end of the stu dy indicated th at the protein restrict ed group had significantly higher scores for general health (MD 4.0, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.86) and physical status (MD 10.0, 95% CI: 9.1, 10.9) compa red to p<0.05). CKD, 5 RCT 's reported on effect of protein-restrict ed diet on GFR. Results from the all the studi es ind icated th at LPD (0.55-0.6 g/kg body weight) had no significant effect on GFR compa red to the control group (0.8 g/kg protein). Hansen et al. indicated that at a 6-month follow -up time, th ere was a compa rable and significant de cline in GFR in bo th groups .151 However, the difference between groups was insignificant (p =0.87). Sanchez et al. indicated that G FR rates decreased by 17.2% in the control group compa red to on ly 6.9% in low p rotein group (NS between groups).143 Cian ciaruso et al. indicated no effect of diet assi gnments w as noted on eGFR and proteinuria (0.55g/kg/d vs 0.80 g/kg/d).148 Juesudason et al. reported that dietary treatment had no effect on ch anges in e GFR.152 Meloni et al. (stage 3) also ind icated no Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 86 effect of protein restriction on eGFR decline (0.6g/kg/d). 157 Decline in GFR was reported by three studies, a pooled analysis of these studies ind icated no clear effect of protein r on eGFR (SMD -0.002, Levels In with CKD, two RCT 's reported mixed resul ts regarding the effect of p rotein restriction on se rum pho sphate levels.149, 154 Rosm an et al. indicated th at patients in the p rotein restriction group h ad signifi cantly lower serum phosph ate levels (us ed less phosph ate bind ers) (0.4-0.6 vs 0.8 g) (p<0.05).154 Whereas, Cianciaruso et al., indicated that phosph ate levels were similar in the two groups throu ghout the entire period of follo w-up (0.55 g protein/kg/d group vs 0.8 g protein/kg/d) .149 Dietary Intake Seven random ized controlled studie s136, 143, 144, 150 -152, 157 and 1 NR CT138 reported on diet ary intake. Dietary intake was used as a compliance measure in most of the studies. These studies indicated th at protein int ake was lower in groups assigned to low-protein diet (0.6 g/kg/d) compa red to con trol or stand ard groups (0.8-1.3 g/kg/d). In one study, the average protein intake during the entire duration of follow-up was higher than expected in both the groups (CPD=1.03 \u00b1 0.18, LPD=0.78 \u00b1 0.17 g protein/kg/d) .150 Follow-up at least 1.5 years indicated th at compl iance to diet did not ch ange in time in either group. Hansen et al. reported an estimated dietary protein intake at 4 years significantly lower in LPD compared to Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 87 usual PD group (p=0.005).151 Jesudason et al. show ed that the mod erate protein intake group increased their protein intake (NS) and standard protein group d ecreased their protein in take.152 In the stu dy by Kloppenburg et al. the p rotein in take during the high protein diet w as higher than du ring the regular protein diet .136 Kuhlmann et al. reported that p rotein intake was not significantly different among the groups.138 However, tot al energy intake significantly differed among each other. In the Meloni et al. study, patients in the low p rotein group were maintaini ng their intake at 0.68 g protein/kg/d level which was significantly lower than the free protein diet group.157 Phosph ate intake was also significantly lower in the LPD group. Sanchez et al. show ed that p rotein in take in the LPD group decreased significantly from baseline to end of the study (p<0.05).143 Energy intake tended to d ecrease during the study duration in bo th the groups but it was non -signifi cant. In Williams et al. study, compa red to con trol, on ly dietary prot ein and phosph ate restriction group had significantly lower protein in take level.144 Finally, Cian ciaruso et al. reported that the 2 groups (LPD vs M PD) maintain ed signifi cantly different protein intakes (p<0.05), with a di fference between the 2 groups of 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 g/d, which last ed from month 6 un til the stu dy end.148 Dietary intake can be used as a compliance index to the diet. Nutritional status Research findin gs ind icated th at protein restriction did not affect serum albumin levels or anthropom etrics in adult CKD In adults with CKD, 2 RCTs r eported no effect of protein restriction (0.55 -0.9 g protein/kg/d) on s erum album in lev els comp ared to cont rol group (0.8-1.3 g protein/kg/d).136, 148 In adults with CKD, one RCT reported no effect of p rotein restriction (55 -70 g/d) on anthropom etrics compared rol group (90-120 g/d).152 Blood pressure Two RCT 's reported no effect of p rotein-restrict ion (0.6 g/kg body weight vs usual) on BP values.151, 152 Hansen et al. reported that BP changes were compa rable in the two groups d uring follow -up period.151 BP was equally and significantly reduced during the study compared to baseline in bo th groups. Jesud ason et al. reported no overall changes in BP for both the groups. However, there was a time-by-treatment interaction (p<0.05) for diastolic BP.152 Diastolic BP was lower throughout the follo w-up period in the mode rate protein intake group. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 87 Lipid prof ile Research reported an improvement in serum lipid pro file during a LPD . Coggins et al. determined that an intervention diet providing 0.28 kg/kg/d show ed significant de creases in total chol esterol, H DL, and LDL between baseline and 6-month follow -up (p<0.05).158 The diet p roviding 0.575 g/kg/d reported trends for decreases in total and LDL-C between baseline and 6-month follow -up (p<0.10). Cian ciaruso et al. show ed a significant de crease in LDL values in the LPD group, but not in the mode rate protein intake group. PROTEIN RESTRICTION + KETOACID ANALO GS SUPPLEMENT In international sett are available, a controll ed diet m ay be consid ered. For adults with CKD without d iabetes, not on d ialysis, with an eGFR below 20ml per minute p er 1.73m2, a providing 0.28g to 0.43g prot ein/kg/d wi th addition of k eto acid (KA) analogs to meet protein requirements m ay be recommended. In adults with CKD including kidney transplant, fourteen studies reported the effect of protein restriction + KA suppl ementation on ou tcomes of interest. One non-randomized controll ed trial (NRCT ),132 and 13 RCTs w ere includ ed.133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 14 2, 158 -164 Survival/r enal death In adults with CKD (st ages 3 to 5), 4 RCTs reported mi xed effect of p rotein- restrict ed diet+ KA on renal survival/ RRT.134, 141, 162, 163 Garneata and Mircescu et al. indicated a significantly lower percentage of patients in the VLPD+ KA group required RRT init iation intervention.134, 141 Whereas, and Malvy et al. indicated no effect, but Malvy stu dy was unpo wered.162, 163 Pooled analysis of two studies th at reported RRT incid ence ind icated that p rotein r estricted di et + KA has a lower risk ratio for incid ence of RRT (RR 0.412, CI: 0.219, 0.773).134, 141 Levey et al. indicated that after controlling for protein in take from food and supplem ent from the studies evaluated, assignment to the VLPD did not have a significant effect on r enal failure/death risk .162 Malvy et al. also indicated no effect of p rotein r estriction + KA on renal surviv al.163 Whereas, Mircescu et al. indicated a statistically Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 88 significantly lower percentage of patients in the VLPD+KA group required RRT init iation throu ghout (4% vs. 2 7%);141 and G arneata et al. also indicated a delay in dialysis initiation.134 Both G arneata and Mircescu are newer studi es134, 141 and short er in dur ation (12 to 15 months) compa red to Levey and Malvy (Levey-2.2 years).162, 163 When pooled to gether, there is prob ably an overall benefit of di etary protein restriction + KA supplem entation on RRT/r enal survival in CKD stage 3 to 5 patients (RR 0.65, CI 0.85, g protein/kg/d) could help p reserve renal function in stage 3 to 5 CKD patients. One study was conducted in PD patients, and GFR was preserved. In adults with CKD, 1 NR CT132 and 4 random ized controll ed trial134, 141, 142, 161, 162 reported on effect of protein-restricted diet+ KA analog (0.28 - 0.4g/kg body weight) on eGFR. Results from the all the 6 studies ind icated th at VLPD +KA LPD only (0.5 8-0.68 g/kg protein) did indicate decline in eGFR. All stud ies were conducted in subj ects in stages 3 to 5. Pooled analysis for all five studies was not poss ible to condu ct. Bellizi reported that GFR significantly decreased in the control group .132 Garneata et al. indicated th at the decrease in eGFR was less in KA group compa red with LPD.134 Klahr et al. indicated th at comp ared with usu al protein group, the low -protein group had a more rapid G FR decline in the first four months (p=0.004) but slow er decline from the first four months to the end (p=0.009 ).161 Among patients with G FR of 1 3-24 m l/min/1.73m2 (MDRD stu dy 2), th ere was a trend for slow er GFR decline in the VLPD group when compared with the low-protein group (p=0.07). Levey et al. (post-hoc analysis of MDRD) indicated th at at a fixed lev el of protein intake from food only, assignment to a VLPD was associ ated with a decrease (trend) in the st eepness of the mean GFR slope of 1.19 mL/min/yr (p=0.063).162 Similarly, after controlling for protein intake from food and suppl ement, assi gnment to the VLPD did not improve the rate of decline in GFR (p=0.71). Mircescu et al. indicated that eGFR did not change significantly in patients receiving VLPD+KA but significantly decreased in the LPD group (p <0.05), suggesting renal prote ction for VLPD+KA.141 et al. indicated eGFR Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 89 stayed unchanged in the KA suppl ement ed group, however, it s ignificantly decreased in the placebo group (p=0.015 ). Keto-suppl ement ed diet over the eGFR.142 protein/kg/d) could potential ly decrease serum phosph ate and improve some markers of bone metabolism (calcium, parathyroid hormon e). Four random ized controll ed studies (stages 4-5)133, 141, 154, 163 indicated a decrease in serum phosph ate lev els at the end of intervention among LPD+ KAA groups. One study with MHD patients also dem onstrated a decrease in serum phosph ate in the LPD group.139 Feiten et al. indicated th at serum phosph ate did not change in the LPD group but tended to decrease in the VLPD + KA group (within VLPD, p=0.07). Serum PTH concentration did not significantly change in the VLPD + KA group; however, it in creased significantly in the LPD group (p=0.01).133 Li et al. in MHD patients indicated th at in the LPD +KA group, no significant changes in serum c alcium w ere observed, how ever, mean serum phosph ate lev els significantly fell at the end of t he study (p<0.001) compa red to the NPD group.139 Mircescu et al. in stages 4 and 5 patients indicated th at in the VLPD+KAA group a signifi cant increase was seen in s erum calcium levels po st intervention (p<0.05); serum phos phate levels decreased (p<0.05); whereas no statistical changes were observed in the LPD group.141 In the stu dy by Rosman et al. , patients in the LPD group show ed significantly lower serum phosph ate levels and us ed less phosph ate bind ers (p<0.05).154 In a recent meta-analysis, it was reported that serum phosph ate levels were lower in patients supplem ented very low p rotein in take in two random ized stud ies from China.165 Dietary inta emented with KA (0.2 8-0.40 g protein/kg/d) can effectively be achieved. Dietary intake can be used as a compliance index to the diet. Five random ized controll ed studies and 1 NR CT (4 studies with CKD stage 3-5 patients and 1 with PD patients) reported on dietary intake. These studies indicated th at prote in intake was low er in Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 90 groups assigned to low-protein diet or v ery-low-protein diet groups compa red to cont rol or stand ard groups. Dietary intake was used as a compliance measure in most of the studies. In Bellizi (stage 4 and 5), at 6 months, prot ein intake and salt intake were significantly lower in VLPD than LPD (p<0.0001).132 Feiten et al. (stage 4) reported a reduction in prot ein intake in the VLPD supple mented group; energy intake did not change in both groups during the whole study, and was low ( approximately 23 kcal/lg/d).133 Phosphorus int ake decreased significantly only in the VLPD + KA group. Calcium intake was low and did not change during the intervention period for both groups. In Herselma et al. study, protein intake during intervention was significantly reduced from ba seline in bo th groups .135 In the stu dy of Jian et al. in PD patients, diet ary protein intake between groups LP and HP w as different in the 6th and 10th month (p<0.05).159 Kopple et al. looked at both pr otein and energy intake (CKD stage 3 and 4), compa red to usu al pro tein diet, low-protein diet had significantly lower dietary protein intake in study A (p0.001).137 Compa red to LPD , VLPD had significantly lower dietary protein intake in study B (p0.001 ). Dietary energy intake in low-protein diet was significantly low er in stu dy A (p0.0 01) compa red to usu al protein die t, how ever, there was no s ignificant dif ference between LPD and (p>0.05). Mircescu et al. (CKD Stages 4 and 5) r esults indicated th at compliance with pr escribed diet w as good thro ughout the study in bo th arms.141 Nutritional status Research reports that a VLPD suppl ement ed with ket o-analogues (0.28 -0.4 had no si gnificant effect on serum albumin levels and nutritional st atus as me asured by SGA, and effects on anthropom etry were inconclusive. In adults with CKD, 6 RCT s133, 134, 137, 141, 142, 159 and 1 NRCT132 reported no effect of v ery LPD and KA in tervention on serum albumin levels. Jian et al. and G arneata et al. were the on ly studies that s tudied effect of protein r estriction + ketoanalogues suppl ement ation on SGA and no st atistically significant effect was not iced.134, 159 Both the studies indi cated th at nutrition al status w as maint ained. In the stu dy by Kopp le et al., (MDRD stu dy B, CKD stages 3 and 4), no significant differences in anth ropomet rics m easurements w ere observed between groups (p >0.05).137 Malvy et al. reported that for the patients in the VLPD group, a significant weight loss w as obse rved at the Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 91 end of the stu dy (p<0.01) and le an and FM were redu ced in this group at the end of study. Mod erate protein group indicated no di fference for weight va riables. Garneata et al. in a l arger and more recent study, reported no dif ferences throughout the study period in bo th groups for BMI, MAMC, and TS F.134 Blood pressure The with keto-analogues (0.28 -0.40 g protein/k g/d) on blood pressure are inconclusive. In adults with CKD, 1 NR CT132 and 2 RCT s135, 141 reported mixed effect of a protein-restricted di et (0.3-0.4 g/kg/d) + KA suppl ements on BP. Only one study show ed a significant reduction in systolic BP and diastolic BP.132 In this study, the VLPD had antihypertensive effect in response to the reduction of sodium intake, type of protein in take and ketoanalogue suppl ements, ind ependent of actual protein intake. The other two studies reported no effect of p rotein -restricted di et + ketoanalogues on BP.135, 141 Lipid Prof ile Research ind icates a suppl emented serum l ipid pro file of CKD patients. In adults with CKD, 1 NR CT132 and 4 RCTs reported on the effects of a protein-restricted diet (0.3-0.4 g/kg/d) + ketoanalogues on serum lipid pro file.133, 134, 158, 163 Feiten et al. and M alvy et al. reported no effect of VLPD + ketoanalogues on s erum lipid pro file,133, 163 whereas, Bellizi et al. indicated a decrease in TC and TG only in the VLPD group. Cog gins et al. indicated a significant de crease in TC, HDL, LDL in the VLPD group.158 Garneata et al. showed that cholest erol levels remain ed stable during the entire duration of the stu dy however patients w ere taking statin s/fibrates as standard the rapy.134 Dietary Protein Intake , Diabetes Mellitus Nutrition play a significant role in the management of individuals with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in conjunction with pharmacological interventions. The goal is to maintain optimal glycemic control and at the same time maintain adequate protein and energy intake to achieve optimal nutritional status. There are some previous guidelines that suggest that 0.8 g/kg body weight/day among those with CKD stages 1 -4 and also for CKD stage 5 .166 However, KDIGO guidelines suggested that more liberalization with protein restriction and recommended that 0.8 g/kg body weight/day be maintained and avoiding levels above 1.3 weig ht.167 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 92 Evidence from controlled trials in this non -dialyzed DKD population has been conflicting . 151, 157, 168-173 Recent meta -analysis does show small beneficial impact of LPD on eGFR decline; however, the heterogeneity was really high (the type of diabetes, stages of CKD, types on interventions, duration, adherence to recommendations) .174, 175 For the DKD patients receiving dialysis, evidence from observational studies indicated low dietary protein intake is associated with higher hospitalization rates and higher risk of mortality . 176, 177 The KDOQI guideline for dialysis patients suggests dietary prot ein intake of >1.2 g/kg body weight/day to manage the protein catabolism and losses of protein in dialysate. Ko et al . conducted an extensive review of existing guidelines and original research in patients with DKD and indicated that dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day was advised for DKD not on dialysis and dietary protein intake >1.2 g/kg body weight/day was advised for DKD patients on dialysis.178 Special discussions These diets shou ld be progressively installed to allow a careful die tary counselling and adequate compliance. Althou gh such diets are not associated with wasting in careful ly monitored research stud ies, on a routine b asis, attention should be focused on energy intake which may decrease over time and induce wasting. A potential b eneficial effect of reducing protein intake relies on t he fact that it also reduced glomerular hyperfiltration and potential ly protects them from hyperfiltration, accelerated hyalinosis and proteinu ria. On a nutritional point of view, reducing protein from animal sour ce and mov ing towards more vegetal protein sources also reduced acid production and metabolic acidosis. Th ese effects are mostly observed for more reduced protein intakes (0.3-0.5 g/kg protein/kg/d) CKD patients with PEW? This qu estion cannot easily be answered sin ce it may depend on the cause of patient wasting. For example, an acute catabolic st ate may induce PEW despite nutri ent intake that is norm ally conside red adequate. Therefore, priority shou ld be given to the correction of etiology of wasting and protein in take should be increased unt il the wasting state improves. An LPD/VLPD + KA diet should not be Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 93 started du ring a catabolic state in CKD patients. Do LPD and VLPD+ ketoanalogues have impact on the nut ritional st atus? In a post-hoc analysis of the MDRD stu dy,137 the authors compa red the random ized groups (LPD versus VLPD+ ketoanalogues) for various outcom es related to nu trition al status. Ov erall, the results demonstr ate the safety of dietary protein restriction over two to three years in patients with mode rate to advanced CKD. However, there were small but si gnificant changes from ba seline in so me nutritional ind ices, and m inimal differences between the random ized groups in some of these changes. In both LPD and VLPD+ ketoanalogues, both prot ein and energy intake declined. Serum albumin rose, while s erum t ransferrin, bo dy weight, percentage of body fat, arm muscle area and urine creatinine excretion declined. In a longitudinal stu dy looking at body composi tion, a VLPD+ k etoanalogues diet induced a small d ecline in LBM on the average of 1.2 kg, with con comitant inc rease in FM, mainly in the first 3 months; these parameters subs equently stabil ized and even improve slightly thereafter.179 Other sho rt-term studies did not show not iceable effects of LPD and VLPD+ ketoanalogues on nutritional parameters. Nevertheless, small anthropom etric measurement's d ecline observed in some studies are of concern sin ce, in routine p ractice, LPD and VLPD+ ketoanalogues are used on the long term and because of the adverse effect of protein-energy wasting in patients with en d- stage renal disease. This is why physicians who prescribe low-protein diets must regularly monitor p atients' protein and energy intake and nutritional status. Implementation considerations Energy intake The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should consider a number of factors when determining the energy requirements for adults diagnosed with CKD, and these include the patient's overall health status, CKD diagnosis and associated therapies, level of physical activity, age, gender, weight status, metabolic stressors, and treatment goals Patients should be monitored routinely to assess whether energy requirements are being met satisfactorily. Changes in nutritional status should be treated and the energy prescription modified accordingly Among patients with stage 5 CKD on maintenance dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), there are several factors that may influence energy expenditure, beyond the Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 94 traditional determinants (age, sex, and fat-free mass), such as hyperparathyroidism, hyperglycemia, and chronic inflammation that should be considered into the overall energy prescription Energy needs will be variable depending on the health status of the patient, e.g., acutely ill versus chron ically managed and overall health goals, weight maintenance, repletion or loss. Energy needs may be different depending on the stage of CKD and its respective treatment (dialysis vs transplantation) . IBW is the body weight ass ociated with the lowest mortality for a given height, age, sex and frame si ze and is b ased on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Height and Weight Tables and many other methods. [Caution: Not gen eralizable to the CKD popula tion and data - gathering m ethods w ere not standardized .]. The IBW can also be estimated as follows: in males as 50.0 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 ft (each 2.5 cm over 152.4 cm) and in females as 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 ft. Protein restriction Increase the training and number of sp ecialized ren al dietitians wo rldwide who could effectively and safely implem ent low and very low protein diets . Promote low protein produ cts to simplify dietary couns eling and help achieving LPD . BE more aggressive with the dietary interventions to i mprove symptoms wh en chronic dialysis is not a t reatment option or need to be pos tponed (v ascular access maturation, organizing preemptive ren al transplant). The need for food inf ormation is i mportant to obt ain a good compliance to the restrict ed protein intake. However, therapeutic education can help patients to i mprove personal motivation, and can even become a personal goal to achieve. Getting more interested in food harvesting, preparation, and cooking may improve quality of life. In addition, postpon ing initiation of dialysis undoub tedly maintains a b etter quality of life rather than und ergoing chronic dialysis.180 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 95 Monitoring and Evaluation Comp liance to diets should be moni tored frequently during the first year of dietary intervention by dietary interviews (3 is opt imal) and 24- hour urine collection for urine urea nitrogen content. Th en yearly follow-up m ay be recommended unt il start of maintenance dialysis. Future research Determine whether a LPD has an additive or a synergistic effect to that of r enin angiotensin aldos terone antagonists or newer nephroprotective agents (i.e. S GLT2 inhibitors) on proteinu ria and nephroprotection th rough RCT s. Examine the impa ct of a low and very-low pro tein dies with or without KA on di gestive microbiota in CKD p atients. Investigate at what is the best CKD stage to start dietary protein intake modification. Examine ways to impro ve adherence and compliance with LPD, VLPD+KA diets Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 96 3.2 Statement on Protein Type 3.2.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D (1B) and post-transplant (OPINION ), there is inadequate evidence to recommend a particular protein type (plant vs animal) in terms of the effects on nutrit ional status, c alcium or phospho rus levels, or the blood l ipid pro file. Rationale/Backg round Vegetable protein diets (VPD) may have beneficial effects on h ealth. A recent popu lation- based stu dy suggested s oy or soy isoflavo nes intake si gnificantly reduced the risk of postmenop ausal breast wh en treated with VPD (soy isoflav ones) and in vitro experiments have shown th at VPD p rotects against inflammation in vas cular endothelial cells.182 These findin gs lead to the development of p reventive strategies for hum an health and disease. For example, the US Food and D rug Admin istration sug gested t hat the intake of 25 g soy protein dai ly may prevent the risk of corona ry heart dise ase due to reduced serum lipids and lipoproteins. In CKD patients, VPD m ay have posit ive biological actions and poss ibly clinical ben efits throu gh a variety of mechanisms. In vitro stud ies show ed that VPD reduce the expression of renin-angiotensin.183 Studies in rod ents demons trated th at VPD retard the development and progression of CKD, vs animal protein diets ( APD),184 presumab ly through favorable effects on G FR. In addition, a v egetarian die t, was associated with a significant reduction in serum phosph ate and FGF-23 levels in pr edialysis CKD patients.185 As a result, it was thou ght that VPD m ay be used in he lping to reduce phosphor us load and potential ly CKD progression in this group of patients. Detailed Justification Three random ized controlled trials (CKD 5D) and two random ized crossov er (Stage 3-4 CKD) trials comp ared the imp act of v egetable-based protein (VPD) vs animal-based (APD) protein intake on bio markers and health outcom es in p atients with CKD. Serum Album in Protein type did not affect nutrition al status as me asured by serum albumin. In Soroka et al., serum albumin significantly increased after both VPD and APD, compa red to the pre-study Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 95 diet, but there was no s ignifi cant difference on serum album in between VPD and APD .186 Fanti et al. found no significant difference between VPD and APD on serum albumin (p<0.05) increase in serum album in lev els with in both groups, but no significant difference found between groups.188 Finally, Chen et al. found no s ignificant differences in serum albumin between groups .189 However, the power to disc riminate might have been insuf ficient due to the small number of patients en rolled. In pooled analysis of four studies, the re was no effect of protein type on serum albumin levels. Protein catabo lic rate (PCR) VPD m be associ ated with a d ecrease in PCR after 6 months, but evidence was limited. In Saroka et al., PCR w as significantly (p<0.05) lower after 6 month of VPD compa red to the pre- study diet, but there were no changes in the APD diet.186 In a secondary analysis, there was a mean dif (95% CI) of values in the VPD vs the APD. This might have been the consequence of a slightly reduced absorption of protein from v egetal source (estimated to be 90% of animal protein ). Pre-albumin le vels VPD did not affect serum pre -albumin levels compared to a control group, but evid ence was limited. Fanti et al. found no si gnificant difference between VPD and APD on serum albumin or pre-albumin levels after receiving soy protein for 8 weeks, compa red to the control group .187 Inflam matory Markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-) Protein type did not affect inflammatory markers. Fanti et al. compared the impact of a soy protein vs a milk protein supplem ent on inflammation.187 No si gnificant differences were found within or between groups for CRP, IL-6 or TNF- levels. Calcium and Phosphorus le vels There was no effect of protein type on plasm a/serum or u rinary calcium levels. V PD for 7 days to 6 months did not affect plasma/serum phosph ate lev els, but d id decrease 24-hour urinary phosph ate levels by a mean difference of -126.6 (-200.4, -52.7) mg. Soroka et al. found no significant difference between VPD, APD, or pre-study diet on u rinary sodium, po tassium or Guid eline on Nut rition calcium or phosph ate.186 Urinary phosp hate was significantly lower after the VPD vs the APD and pre-study diet. In a small r andom ized crossov er trial in predialysis patients, Moe et al. d emonstrated th at plasma phosphate lev els were significantly higher in the APD vs the VPD g roup at day 7 (p=0.02), but there was no dif in urinary phosphorus excretion.185 There were no in plasma calcium or u rinary calcium excretion lev els between groups. In poo led analysis of these 2 studies, th ere was no effect of VPD, compa red to APD, on s erum/pl phosph ate mean difference (95% CI) of -126.6 (-200.4, -52.7) mg. HDL Cholest erol, Triglyceride l evels Protein type did not affect lipid profile in Stage 4 and 5D CKD patients. Th ree studies examined the effect of VPD vs APD on blood l ipid panel. Chen et al. compared the imp act of a soy protein vs a milk protein supplem ent on p lasma lipids during 12 w eeks in MHD patients with and without hyperlipidemia .189 In patients without hyperlipid emia, no significant differences were found in total chol esterol, LDL-C, H DL-C and tr iglycerides levels wi thin or between groups. In hyperlipidemic p atients how ever, soy protein lead to a significant decrease in total choleste rol, LDL cholest erol and tr iglyceride levels, comp ared to milk protein, wh ereas HDL significantly increased. Tabibi et al. compared the impa ct of a soy protein suppl ement vs control in PD patients and found no si gnificant impact on total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides levels in the inte rvention group.188 Soroka et al. found no significant differences after VPD, APD or pre-study diet on total cholest erol, HDL-C lev el was significantly lower after VPD compa red to the p re-study diet. In pooled analysis of 3 studies, the re was no mean difference in total, LDL or HDL-C levels or triglyceride levels betw een groups. Special discussions VPDs h ave been studied to test metabolic hypothe ses in CKD patients. Particularly, the fact that phosphorus m ay be less absorb ed during a VPD diet may benefit calcium and phosph ate metabolism. Th is becomes more important since currently processed food contains mu ch added ino rganic phosph orus as compa red PD. The fat content of VPD poss esses a healthier profile and m ay benefit patients in lon g-term studies. Finally, toxic middle mole cules Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD such as P-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl-sulfate and trim ethylamine o xide (TMA O), almost exclusively produc ed from animal sour ce protein, could be r educed by VPD and th is hypothesis should be t ested in long-term clinical trials in CKD patients. As demonstr ated in other subtopics of this guideline, VPD h as shown reduction in a cid load, increase in dietary fiber intake, reduction of phosphorus, and bo dy weight. There is increasing interest in the role of VPD in CKD due to the benefits of this di etary pattern on cardiov ascular disease risk factors in the general popu lation. However, current evid ence from RCTs sp ecifically comparing benefits of VPD vs APD in CKD patients is limited. Implementation considerations Work with patients to help them meet their individuali zed diet ary protein intake needs. Based on C KD patient's preference for animal or plant -based prot ein ensure that th ey meet their dietary protein needs and that their diets provide adequate essent ial amino acids. Monitoring and Evaluation Comp liance to diets should be monitored frequently during the first year of dietary intervention by dietary interviews (3 is opt imal). Then yearly follow-up m ay be recommend ed unt il start of mainten ance dialysis. Future research Condu ct adequately powered random ized clinical trials to study the effect of VPD on mort ality, CKD progression, proteinuri a, markers of mine ral and bo ne metabolism, and urinary phosphorus excretion in CKD patients. Examine the effects of VPD on the lipid profile in hyperlipid emic CKD patients. Examine the impact of VPD on generation of toxic midd le molecules. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 98 3.3 Statements on Die tary Patterns Mediterranean Diet 3.3.1 In adults with CKD 1-5 (no n-dialysis) and post-transplant, with or without dyslipidemia, we suggest that prescribing a Mediterranean Diet may improve lipid profiles (2C). Fruits and Vegetables 3.3.2 In adults with CKD 1-4, we suggest that prescribing increased fruit and vegetable intake may decrease body weight, blood p ressure and net acid prod uction (NEAP) (2C). Rationale/Backg round Dietary patterns reflect the variety of foods which represent habitual diet ary intake.190 Particular dietary patterns, including the M editerranean diet, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH ), plant-based and diets high in fruits and vegetables (including V egetarian diets) are examples of h ealthy dietary patterns which h ave been the subj ect of in terest in nutritional epidemio logy.191 A whole -diet approach consid ers the synergistic effects of n utrients resulting in cumulative effects on h ealth and dis ease.191 CKD presents many challenges for nutrition management, including increased risk of death and appreciable cardiov ascular disease burd en among affected p ersons. T raditional ly, nutrition education has focused on individual nutrients, su ch as prot ein, phosphor us, potassium and sodium. Recent evid ence has linked healthy dietary patterns with reduced chronic CVD and mort ality risk in the healthy population .192-194 However, these relationships have not be en explored conclusively with the CKD population. Detailed Justification While various diet ary patterns were investig ated (Fruits and Vegetables, Mediterranean Diet, Low Fructose Diet, Hypolipidemic, Ca rbohydrate restrict ed- low iron, po lyphenol-enriched diet (CR-LIPE), High-protein /Low-carbohydrate), there was little evidence examining the efficacy of most of th ese patterns in controll ed trials. H ence, only the M editerranean and H igh Fruit and Vegetable dietary patterns h ad sufficient eviden ce to create recommend ations.Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 99 Mediterranean dietary pattern eGFR One RCT reported on the effect of M editerranean dietary pattern on eGFR.195 Mekki et al. indicated no clear effect of M editerranean dietary pattern on eGFR at 90 d ays post in tervention in adults wi th CKD stage 2. Addit ional research on the effect of M editerranean diet ary pattern is needed. Lipid prof ile Limited evidence from thr ee studies, two of which examined non -dialyzed patients (CKD stages 2 and 3) and one of which examined pos t-transplant patients, d emonstrated th at the Mediterranean diet i mproved lipid pan el by decreasing total to cont rol groups. Two controll ed trials reported on the effect of Mediterranean diet ary pattern on l ipid pro file in non-dialyzed patients.195, 196 In the RCT, M ekki et al. (stage 2) reported a 35% reduction in TC (p<0.05) in the Mediterranean diet group, whereas, no change in TC was obse rved in the control group. LDL-C levels and TG levels were also reduced compa red to standard care.195 In an NR CT, Daniele et al. reported a significant reduction in TC in bo th Mediterranean diet group and organic Mediterranean diet group.196 However, most reduction w as not ed in the organic M editerranean diet group. In pos t-transplant patients, one RCT reported that Mediterranean diet led to significant reduction in TC, TG and LDL-C lev els compa red with a low-fat diet.195, 197 Other Out comes Compa red to a control group, the M editerranean Diet had no clear effect on BP in post- transplant patients 197 or on CRP levels in stage 2 patients. 195 However, one NRCT reported on the effect of M editerranean diet ary pattern on albuminuria in stage 2 and 3 CKD adults, and both M editerranean diet groups Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 100 (normal and organic) had significant reductions in albuminuria values compared to low p rotein group.196 High Fruit and Vegetable Dietary Pattern CKD Progression In adults with stages 3-4 CKD, fruits and vegetables di etary pattern has mixed effects on eGFR compa red with o ral bicarbonate suppl ement ation.198, 199 Body Weight Two RCTs r eported on the effect of a fruit and vegetable di etary pattern on body weight in adults with CKD. Goraya et al. reported that the group following t he fruit and vegetable dietary pattern had greater net body weight loss than both or al bicarbonate and st andard care groups (p<0.05).199 Goraya et al. reported lower body weight in adults with CKD stages 3-4 following a fruit and vegetable dietary pattern compa red to o ral bicarbonate suppl ement g, 95% CI - 7.73,2.44; I2=56%).198 Blood Pr essure Three studies (2 R CT, 1 NRCT) reported on the effect of i ncreased fruit and vegetable intake on BP in adults wi th CK D. All three studies ind icated th at increased intake of fruit and vegetable had a significant effect on lowering systolic BP compa red to or al bicarbonate suppl ement in take group or standard care group.198-200 Goraya et al. indicated reductions in systolic BPs in all gr oups, how ever, the 3-year value for the fruits and vegetables group was lower than those in HC O3 and control .199 Goraya et al. show ed that compa red to HC O3 group, the fruit and vegetables group had lower systolic BP at 1-year follow up (p<0.01).198 Goraya et al. (NRCT) show ed that fruit and vegetable intake, but not control or HCO3, significantly decreased systolic BP in individuals wi th CKD Stages 1 and 2 (p<0.001 ).200 Pooled analysis of data from Go raya et al. 2013 and Go raya et al. 2014 ind icated a Mean Difference (95% CI) of -5.6, CI: -8.3, -2.8 m mHg. Increased of vegetable Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 101 dietary pattern lo wered systolic BP compared to oral bicarbonate suppl ement intake or stand ard care group in adults with CKD stages 1 - 4. Comparison with recent research A recent systematic review (SR) examined the effect of diet ary patterns on CKD outcom es using cohort stud ies.201 In agreement wi th the current an alysis of controll ed trials, Kelly et al. found no effect of die tary pattern on CKD progression in studies with foll ow-ups r anging from 4 to 6.4 years. However, unlike the current SR, K elly et al. were able to d emonstr ate a relationship betw een a dietary pattern rich in v egetables, fruit, fish, cereals, whole grains, fib er, legumes, and nuts and seeds, and low er in red meat, sodiu m, and refined sugars in studi es reporti ng outcom es from 4 to of follow up [RR (95% CI): 0.73 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83)].201 A recent Cochrane review of 6 RCTs evaluated dietary patterns in CKD (one study (n=191) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, po lyphenol en riched diet, two studies (n=355) of a Mediterranean diet, two studies (n=181) of increased fruit and vegetable in take and one study (n=12) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet). From this review, diet ary interventions h ad uncertain effects on all-cause mortali ty and cardiovascular events. Ho wever, with low qu ality eviden ce, there was reduced systolic and di astolic BP, and higher GFR and albumin following dietary intervent ions.202 Althou gh the inte rvention studies examining dietary patterns in CKD are limited, th ere is consistent eviden ce from observational analyses on diet ary patterns contai ning fruits, vegetables, whol e grains, lean me ats, low fat dairy and low added salt, and improved clinical outcome (notably mortali ty) in CKD .201 A recent study confirmed that in take of nuts, lo w-fat dairy products, and legumes are protective against the development of C KD\".203 There is therefore a need to unde rtake future trials to further inv estigate more hol istic dietary interventions ov er single nutrient approaches in these patients. Dietary pattern may improve additional outcomes not reported in the systematic review, including constipation. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 102 Implementation considerations Safety of various die tary patterns, in cluding the DASH and Mediterranean diet, with high intakes of fruit and vegetables must be determined on in individual basis in advanced stages of kidn ey disease, especially in regard to serum potassium contro l and adequacy of protein intake . Individualized support and follo w-up m ay be required to suppo rt patients in implem enting complex dietary changes. Monitoring and Evaluation Adherence to dietary patterns in clinical trials can be challenging. Engaging a process of self- monitoring against food group targets may assist with suppo rting adherence. Future research Establish the opti mal method to suppo rt dietary change to implement diet ary patterns into clinical trials wi th CKD. Condu ct large-scale, pragmatic clinical DASH and/or di etary guidelin e-based diet ary pattern in CKD patients to det ermine the effect on clinical outcomes in cluding kidney disease progression and cardiov ascular disease. Evaluate the association of mult iple di etary patterns with CKD progression in a l arge cohort with establi shed CKD over a longer duration than currently available (i.e. >10 years). Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 105 GUIDELINE 4: NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION 4.1 Statement on O ral, Enteral post-transplant (OPINION) at risk of or with protein-energy wasting, we sugg est a mini mum of a 3 -month trial of o ral nutritional suppl ements to improve nutritional st atus if dietary couns elling alone do es not a chieve sufficient energy and protein intake to me et nutrition al requirements. Enteral Nut rition Supplementation 4.1.2 ch ronically inadequate inta ke and w hose protein and energy requirements cannot be attained by dietary couns elling and or al nutrition al suppl ements, it is reasonable to consider a trial of enteral tube feeding (OPINION). Total and I ntradialytic Parenteral Nutrition Protein-Energy MHD with protein-energy wasting, we sugg est a tri al of IDPN for MHD patients, TPN for CKD patients and AA dialysate for PD patients to impro ve and maintain nutritional st atus if nutrition requirements cannot be m et with existing oral and enteral intake (2C) Rationale/Backg round Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is common among patients with CKD, especially those undergoing mainten ance dialysis therapy,204 and is ated morbidi ty and mort ality.205 The etiology of PEW in patients with CKD is compl ex and multifactorial, and includ es reduced energy and protein in take resulting from anorexia and di etary restrictions, inflammation, hypercatabolism, pr otein loss es during dialysis, met abolic acidosis, uremic toxicity, and the presence of comorbid conditions.204, 205 As a result, patients with CKD may develop an imbal ance between diet ary intake and nutritional requirements. Indeed, ma ny patients with CKD consume less p rotein and energy than th eir recommended intakes even when indiv idualized diet ary couns elling is provi ded by a renal dietician.206 When diet ary couns elling alone proves insufficient to brid ge the gap between protein-energy Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 106 intake and the ta rget requirements in p atients with CKD, provision of oral nutritional supp lements ( ONS) is oft en the n ext app ropriate step to pr event and treat PEW. Therefore, it is important to establi sh the effectiveness of ONS on nutritional st atus, clinic al outcomes and quality of life in patients with CKD. Althou gh feeding through the g astrointestinal route should be the p referred choice of nutritional suppl ement ation, feeding through the parenteral route (i.e. total parenteral nutrition), m ay be a safe and convenient approa ch for patients who cannot tolerate oral or enteral admin istration of nutri ents.204 In MHD patients, of for TPN p rovides a significant adv antage by eliminating the need for an additional p ermanent venous catheter placement. Since HD access is routinely utilized for the HD procedure. TPN can be convenient ly administered during HD via the dialysis tubing. This type of TPN administration is called \"intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN )\". Detailed Justification This evid ence review included fifteen clinical trials, tw elve of which were RCT s207-217 and three NRCTs.218-220 Most of t he studies examined the effect of ONS in patients on MHD. However, Mo retti et al.213 includ ed patients on M HD and PD with the results merged; Gonzalez-Espino za et al.211 and eixido-Planas et al.214 patients on PD on ly; and Wu et al.217 studied patients with CK D, stag es 3-4. No studies were performed in patients with CKD with k idney allografts. Most of the studi es examined the effect of oral prot ein-energy or protein-based ONS using commercial products. However, Allman et al.207 used a glucose - polymer ONS and Wu et al.217 used a non-protein calorie ONS. Four studies us ed renal- specific protein-energy ONS.210, 212, 219, 220 A major drawback of the literature was the lim ited use of a placebo group, though most s tudies did in clude a comparator group whi ch was defined as participants not re ceiving ONS or receiving only nutritional couns elling. Study durations r anged from 12 weeks to 13\u00bd mon ths. Seven of the RCTs includ ed participants w ith some level of m alnutrition at baseline.207-211, 216, 221 In contrast, five stud ies did not a ctively enroll malnou rished p atients.212-215, 217 et ed malnou rished patients as by serum albumin or weight loss, Cheu et al.218 enroll ed patients with hypoalbuminemia, and Scott et al.219 did not actively recruit p atients with malnutrition. Mortality, Hospital izations, and Quality of Life Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 107 One NRCT examined the effect of ONS on mortality in 276 patients on MHD who received for ONS for a low s erum albumin versus 194 si milar patients who r efused ONS or in whom treatment was deemed i nappropriate.218 No di fference in mortality [HR (9 5% CI); 0.70 (0.36, 1.35)] was not ed over a medi an duration of 13.5 months. Two RCTs213, 216 and one NRCT218 evaluated the effect of ONS on hospitali zation ov er a period of 6 to 13.5 months in patients on MHD or PD. A pooled analysis of the two RCT s213, 218 found no si gnificant difference in odds of h ospitalization by group assignment, but a NRCT218 reported a 34% reduction in hospi talization risk [0.66 (0.50, 0.85 )] by 12 months in patients receiving ONS compa red to cont rols. Three studies (two R CTs209, 210 and one NRCT219) each of t hree months' d uration examined the effect of ONS on quali ty of life (QOL) measures in patients on MH D. One RCT209 and one NRCT219 reported that patients r eceiving general209 or renal-specific219 protein-energy ONS had higher QOL scores in the dom ains of p hysical fun ctioning209, 219 and bodily pain209 compa red to receiving dietary advice only209 or no ement ation,219 but another RCT210 reported that renal-specific protein-energy ONS did not influence QOL scores in a ny domain. A pool ed analysis of the two RCT s209, 219 found that ONS d id not si gnificantly influ ence bodily pain, physical fun ctioning, or general health QOL dom ain sco res. CKD Progression A RCT217 condu cted for 24 weeks examined the effect of an energy-based ONS on progression of CKD in 109 patients with CKD 3-4 who were following a low-protein diet. While no difference in serum creatinine or eGFR was obse rved between ONS and controls, the re was a compa rative reduction in proteinuria in the ONS arm (p<0.05). Composite Nutritional Scor es & Biochemical Ma rkers of Nutritional S tatus A 3-month RCT in 18 p atients on MHD examined the effect of a food-based ONS on Subjective Glob al Asses sment (SG A) scores.209 Authors d escribe a significantly greater SGA improvement in patients r eceiving ONS compa red to patients r eceiving nutritional guidan ce only. One NRCT found that O NS over a six-month period did not influ ence the M alnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) as compared to d ietary advice.220 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page Fifteen studies (twelve RCTs207-211, 213 -217, 222 and thr ee NRCTs218-220) examined the effect of ONS on s erum albumin in patients with 3-5D. These included eleven in patients on MHD 3 to 13.5 months' du ration, one RCT213 in patients on MHD and PD of 6 months' dur ation, two RCT s211, 214 in patients on PD of 6 mon ths' du ration, and on e217 in patients with CKD 3-4 of 24 weeks' duration. Ov erall, the li terature suggested th at protein-energy ONS modest ly improved serum albumin levels though the results shou ld be interpreted with caution. A pooled analysis of 11 studies207-214, 217, 219, 220 that includ ed patients with CKD 3-5D found that O NS modestly improved serum albumin (0.006, 0.236) g/dL]. However, a sub group analysis found the effect to be si gnificant on ly when using protein-energy ONS209, 210, 212, 214, 219, 220 [mean difference (95% CI); 0.16 (0.08, 0.24) g/dl] and or protein-based208, 211, 213 suppl ements. Heterogeneity of results in the pool ed analysis was high (I2=68.3%, p<0.001) so results shou ld be interpreted cautiously. One RCT210 in 86 patien ts on MHD reported that ONS d id not influence serum p re-albumin levels as compa red to d ietary advice. Two RCTs of 3-6 mon ths' du ration in patients on MHD reported confli cting effects of O NS on to tal protein, p erhaps related to type of ONS.207, 208 The fi rst study of 30 patients reported a posit ive effect on to tal protein using an amino acid- based ON S208 while a second of 21 patients found no effect of a 6-month energy-based ONS intervention.207 Two stu dies (a RCT207 and a NRCT219) in p atients on MHD of 3-6 mon ths' duration found no effect of ONS on s erum tr ansferrin, either individual ly or in a pooled analysis. Anthropom etric Measurements The effect of ONS on anthropometric indic es varied in large part according to the type of ONS used, with the greatest effects bei ng seen in one s tudy207 that us ed an energy based ONS. Body Mass Ind ex (BMI): Seven studies (six RCT s207-212 and one NRCT220) evaluated the effect of ONS on BMI over a 3-6-month period. Six of the studies were condu cted in p atients on MHD207-210, 212, 220 and one in patients on PD.211 A pool ed analysis demonstr ated no ov erall effect of ONS on BMI though the stu dy using an energy-based ONS no ted a rise in Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 107 h eterogeneity was mod erate (I2=49.8%, p=0.06). RCTs and 1 NR CT) investi gated the effect of ONS on body weight over 3 to 6 months in patients on MHD ,207, 208, 215, 219 PD, 214 and with CKD 3- 4.217 Overall, ONS was linked to increased body weight but main ly in patients on MHD consuming an energy-based supp lement. Ho wever, one p atients on PD that used a protein-based ONS reported increased body weight.214 A pool ed analysis of all six studies207, 208, 214, 215, 217, 219 found higher body weight in the ONS group compa red to the control arm [mean (95% CI);2.77 (1.19, However, the dif ference was main ly driven by energy based ONS in patients on MH D. Dialysis Target Weight: Four studies (3 RCT s209, 210, 221 and 1 NR CT220) in p atients on MHD209, 210, 220, 221 examined the effect of ONS on dialysis target weight over a 3 to 6-month period. Ov erall, no effect of ONS on target weight was obse rved, thou gh one NRCT220 reported an inc rease in target weight us ing a renal-specific protein-energy ONS220 as did one RCT222 using a protein-based ONS. A pooled analysis of thr ee studies209, 210, 220 found no overall effect. Hirosh ige et al. reported results in a figure and could not be includ ed in poo led analysis. Lean Body Mass/Fat Fr ee Mass/Muscle Mass: Seven trials (six RCT s207-209, 215, 222 and NRCT220) in p atients on MHD207-209, 215, 220, 222 or PD214 studied the effect of ONS on ma rkers of lean mass ov er 3 to 6 m onths. Ov erall, ONS increased LBM or fat free mass on ly in patients on MHD who received an energy based ONS. In patients on MH D, the effect of protein based ONS on LBM was mixed. In a pooled analysis of 6 studies207-209, 214, 215, 220 ONS w as associ ated with a si gnificant increase in LBM or fat free mass [mean difference (95% CI); 1.18 (0.1 6, 2.20) kg] compa red to the control a rm, but a subgroup analysis found the effect to be si gnificant only in patients on MHD using energy-based ONS. Body Fat: Seven studies (six RCTs207-209, 212, 215, 222 and one NRCT220) in p atients on MHD evaluated the effect of ONS on bo dy fat over a period of 3 to 6 months. A pool ed analysis of six studies207-209, 212, 215, 220 reported no ov erall effect of ONS on bo dy FM though subgroup Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 108 analyses demonstr ated that energy207 and protein -energy209, 212, 220 based ONS significantly increased body FM compa red to con trols, but prot ein-based ONS had no effect. Five studi es (four RCT s207, 209, 214 and one in p CKD on MH D207, 209, 220 or PD211, of ONS on skinfo ld me asurements ov er a 3 to 6 -month period. A pool ed analysis of 4 studies207, 211, 214, 220reported that O NS significantly or no suppl ement ation, but this effect was significant on ly in patients on MHD using energy based ONS. Arm or Muscle Circu mference: Four RCTs in patients on MHD207, 209 or PD211, 214 evaluated the effect of ONS on arm or muscle circumference over a 3 to 6-month period. None of the studies show ed any effect. Dietary Intake Protein : Ten studies (nine R CTs207-211, 213, 214, 217, 222 and one NRCT220) examined the effect of ONS on protein in take as estimated by nPCR/nPNA (nPCR), 24-hour dietary recall or multiple-day food r ecords with stu dy durations of th nPCR in patients on MHD and PD but energy207, 217 or protein-energy suppl ements d id not influence either marker in patients with CKD 3-5D. A pooled analysis of seven studi es208-211, 213, 214, 220 found that ONS significantly increased nPCR in patients on dialysis [stand ardized sug gesting a potential ly clinically relevant effect. However a subgroup analysis found the effect to be si gnificant on ly in persons receiving protein-based208, 211, 213 but not prot ein-energy based ONS.209, 210, 214, 220 Similar results were noted in a pooled analysis of three studies210, 211, 214 examining the effects of ONS on reported protein in take where ONS increased reported protein intake only in one stu dy that suppl ement ed egg albumin protein .211 Energy Six RCTs207, 210 -212, 217, 222 with study duration of 3 to 6 months examined the effect of ONS on energy intake in patients on MHD ,207, 210, 212, 222 on PD,211 and with CKD, stag es 3-4.217 Overall ONS raised energy intake though the effect was limited to p atients on MHD receiving Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 109 renal-specific protein-energy ONS. Four out of five studies in p atients on dia lysis reported that ONS increased energy intake.207, 210 -212, 222 However, a subgroup analysis found the effect to be significant on ly for patients on MHD receiving prot ein-energy ONS,210, 212 but not receiving protein-211 or energy-based217 ONS alone. The only study in patients with CKD 3-4 found no improvement in energy intake using a non-protein calorie ONS.217 Phosphorus and Calcium An RCT of 3 mon ths' du ration in patients on MHD found no effect on phosphorus or calcium intake.210 Seven studies (six RCT s208-210, 212, 215, 217 and one NRCT220) of 3-6 mon ths' duration in patients on MH D208-210, 212, 215, 220 and CKD 3-4217 found no effect of ONS on CRP. Seven studies (five RCTs207-209, 211, 215 and two NR CT 208, 220) in p atients on MHD207-209, 215, 220 or PD211 examined the effect of ONS on markers of anemia over a 3 to 6-month period. Ov erall, ONS had no effect on these markers. Five studi es (four RCT s209, 211, 215, 217and one NRCT219) examined the effect of ONS on s erum calcium, p hosph ate, and potassium levels over 3 to 6 mon ths. Th ree of the trials were in patients on M HD209, 215, 219, one was in p atients on PD211, and one was in patients with CKD 3-4.217 None of the studies found any effect on ONS on these electrolytes. Five studies (four RCT s207, 211, 212, 217and one NRCT220) examined the effect of ONS on p lasma lipids ov er 3 to 6 months. IDPN This evid ence review encompass ed three studies that examined the effects of IDPN on nutritional st atus and clinical outcomes in MHD patients, including one NRCT221 and two RCTs.223, 224 In all these studies, participants w ere malnou rished. In Hiroshige et al.,221 participants received tary couns elling from an RDN and an IDPN infusion of 200 ml 50% dextrose, 200 ml 7.1% E AAs, and 200 ml 20% lipid emulsion, providing 2400 k cal and 42.3 g amino acid for one year. Results were compared to a group receiving dietary couns elling only (control group). In Cano et al.223 all participants w ere given an oral nutrition al suppl ements ( ONS) p roviding 25 g/prot ein/day and 500 kcal/day for one year, and the intervention group additional ly received IDPN to meet target ranges of 30 to 35 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 110 kcal/day and 1.2 g/protein/kg/day; and in cluded a stand ard lipid emulsion of 50% glucos e, 50% non-protein en ergy suppl y, and a stand ard amino acid solution.223 In Toigo et al., participants in the intervention group were given (EAAs) IV formula for 6 mon ths.224 Results were compared to pa rticipants in the inte rvention group wh ere isoni trogenous tandard formula containi ng both non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) and E AAs for 6 months. Both groups simul taneously received 500ml of 10% glucose. Participants w ere followed up for an additional 6 mon ths. Mortality and hospita lization Only one study examined and found no effect of IDPN on mo rtality and hospitalization. In Cano et al., statistical compa risons were not p rovided but the authors d escribed no significant differences in mort ality or hospitalization events betw een ONS only and IDPN with ONS groups. 223 Anthropom etric measurements The three studies examined the effect of IDPN th erapy on anthropom etric that d ietary ONS,223 increased BMI221, 223 skinfold measurements, 221 MAM C221 compa red was obse rved when adequate and comparable protein and energy were given to patients receiving O NS only.223 Compared to a sta ndard IDPN formulation of both EA As and N EAAs, an IDPN formula tion wi th EAAs did not affect % desirable bo dy weight, skinfold m easurements, and AM A.219 Laboratory markers of pr e-albumin, transferrin, and nPCR ) Three studies221, 224 examined the effect of IDPN on labo ratory markers of nutritional status in malnou rished MHD patients. The results from these studies concluded th at IDPN in conjunction wi th diet ary couns ovements in albumin and p re-albumin levels were observed when adequate and compa rable p rotein and energy were provid ed to patients Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 111 receiving ONS only.223 Compa red to a sta ndard IDPN formulation of both EA As and N EAAs, an IDPN formulation wi th EAAs on ly did not affect album in and transferrin lev els.224 Other laborato ry markers (inflammation (CRP); hemoglobin, lipid profi le) One study evaluated and found no effect of IDPN on inflammation in malnourished hemodialysis patients. Cano et al. reported no change in CRP levels in either ONS on ly or IDPN+ONS groups, although data was not provi ded.223 One study examined and found no effect of IDPN therapy with EA As only vs standard IDPN formulation with bo th EAAs and N EAAs on hemoglobin lev els in malno urished MHD patients after 6 months.224 Two studies examined the effect of IDPN on l ipid pro file. The results from these studies show ed that combin ing IDPN with diet ary couns elling221 or ONS223 n ot affect total cholest erol221 or triglyceride levels.221, 223 Dietary inta ke (energy and prot ein intake) Two studies221, 223 examined the effect of IDPN on dietary intake in malnourished MHD patients. The findings from these studies show ed incon clusive effects of IDPN on di etary energy and protein intakes. Special discussions A complete nut ritional assessment should be p erformed prior to consid ering ONS and should be repeated at regular intervals ng the suppl ement ation period. IDPN t herapy does not alter patient's eating behavior, nor does it encourage healthy eating habits. Patients on IDPN may suffer from time-limitation due to MHD frequency and duration. Because IDPN is usual ly given for 4 hours du ring dia lysis thrice weekly, it may not provide sufficient calories and protein to meet long-term nutrit ional requirements. TPN is usual ly Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 112 administered on a daily basis. The potential of IDPN to me et target protein and energy requirements in MHD patients mainly depends on the actual dif ference between these targets and spont aneous di etary intakes via ONS or dietary counselling. If the di fference can be met by the IDPN regimen, the workgroup felt that IDPN should be considered in conjun ction with ONS or di etary counselling. This evid ence reviews suggested t hat IDPN o ffers no further benefit over ONS. It was postulat ed that ma rkers of nutritional st atus improv ed irrespective of the route of nutrient administration as long as dietary protein and energy targets are met.223 However, a direct compa rison b etween IDPN and O NS was lacking, this would on ly imply that O NS is equ ally effective as IDPN when oral intake is poss ible. S ince ONS was inclu ded in the intervention arm as well, the in feriority of IDPN ov er ONS cannot be confirmed. A recently published a RCT inv estigating the effect of IDPN the rapy on pre-albumin and oth er bioch emical and clinical nutrition al markers in m alnourished M HD patients,225 demonstr ated that IDPN t pre -albumin w as supe rior to nutrition al couns elling after 16 weeks. This st udy was not includ ed in this evid ence review because the d ate of publication w as beyond the cut-off time for study inclusi on. In this study, patients random ized to the intervention group received standardized nutrition al couns elling plus IDPN th ree times weekly for 16 weeks. T here were no within-group changes and between-group dif ferences at week 16 in o ther bi ochemical nutritional markers (BMI, albumin, phase angle alpha, and SGA). Implementation Consi derations ONS should be prescribed two to three times d aily and patients should be advised to t ake ONS preferably 1 hour after meals rather than as a meal replacement in ord er to m aximize benefit.204 Monitor ed in-center provision of high-protein meals or O NS during MHD may be a useful strategy to increase total protein and energy intake.226 Many of the perceived negative effects of in tradialytic feeding such as pos tprandial hypotension, aspiration Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 113 control and hygiene, as well as diabetes and phosphorus control c an be avoided with careful monitorin g. ONS prescription should take into account patient preference. The acceptability of ONS in terms of appearance, smell, tast e, texture, and type of preparation (milksh ake type, juice type, puddi ng type, protein/energy bar, ered. Energy-dense and lo w-electrolyte, renal-specific ONS may be necessary to inc rease protein and energy intake and avoid fluid and electrolyte derangements. Increased risk of i nfectious complications and the high cost of IDPN are the g reatest barriers for regular use of IDPN. MHD patients meeting all of the follow ing three criteria may benefit from IDPN therapy: 1) eviden ce of protein-energy malnutrition and in adequate dietary protein and/or energy intake; 2) in ability to administer or tolerate adequate oral nutrition, including food suppl ements or enteral feeding; and 3) protein and energy requirements can be met wh en IDPN is us ed in conjunc tion wi th oral intake or enteral feeding. IDPN t herapy should not be consid ered as a long-term approach of nutritional support. It should be discontinu ed and O NS should be attempted as soon as improvements in nutritional st atus are observed and patients are capable of using oral or enteral route. If IDPN the rapy in conj unction with oral intake does not achieve the nutritional requirements of t he patient, or the gastroin testinal tract is malfun ctioned, then total parenteral nutrition ( TPN) given on a daily basis should be consid ered. Monitoring and Evaluation Gastroin testinal side effects can influe nce adherence to ON and extended periods of mono tonous supp lement ation can lead to flavor and taste fatigue as well as non-adherence to the p rescribed ONS. Therefore, regular monitoring and evaluation du ring the suppl ement ation period is c rucial and adjustments to the ONS pr escription m ay be necessary to improve adherence and opt imize effectiveness. Nutritional st atus should be moni tored regularly suppl ementation pe riod in order to evaluate effectiveness of ONS. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of nutrit ional status during IDPN th erapy is necessary. Serum glucose should be closely monitored during and post MH D. In the case of insul in requirement, the u se of subcutaneous shor t-acting insul in analogs shou ld be chosen to avoid post-dialytic hypoglycemia. The ultrafiltration rate should be adjusted to r emove the extra fluid provided by IDPN. Future research Adequately powered RCTs are necessary to ev aluate the impact of ONS on long-term surviv al, hospi talization, and qu ality of life in patients throu ghout the range of CK D. An on going study will help add ress this unmet need [NCT02933151 ]. In addition, fu rther research is n eeded to d efine the optimal composi tion and scheduling of ONS as well as define the p atient subgrou ps mo st likely to benefit. Adequately powered and long-term clinical trials compa ring the ind ependent effects of IDPN compa red to ONS on nu trition al status, morbidi ty, mor tality and quality of life are required. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 115 Nut rition Dialysate Dialysate Protein-Energy Supplementation 4.2.1 In adults with CKD on peritoneal dialysis with protein-energy wasting, we suggest not substituting conventional dextrose dialysate with amino a cid dialysate as a general strategy to improve nutritional st atus (2C), although in s elected cases of protein-wasting when energy intake is adequate, 1.1% amino acid dialysate with alk ali suppl ements m ay amelior ate protein deficits (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round Protein-energy wasting is common among patients on mainten ance PD, and is asso ciated with increased ality.228 Inflammation, acidosis, insulin resistance, insuf ficient dietary intakes of protein and energy as a result of anorexia, and periton eal losses of p roteins and amino acids contrib ute to p eal amino acids suppl ement ation w as introduced to comp ensate for low protein intake and protein losses. Substi tuting amino acids for glucose in PD solutions should increase the amino acid intake and decrease the net amino acid losses of the p atient, thereby increasing the net intake of protein precursors.230 IPAA supplem entation may also reduce the in fused carbohydrate load, thereby reducing the risk of hyperglycemia and the tendency to hypertriglyceridemia.230 Detailed Justification This evid ence review included thr ee studies that examined the effect of IPAA suppl ement ation on nutritional st atus in malnourished p atients, including two RCTs231, 232 and one non- random ized crossov er trial.233 In the two RCTs ,231, 232 results were compa red between those receiving traditional 1.5% dextrose dialysate vs those who replaced one to two d aily exchanges of 1.5% dextrose dialysate anged from the non -random ized crossover trial, Misra et al. utilized the s ame study design in which the participants w ere assigned to e ach exposure (amino acid dialysate for one exchange/day or dextrose dialysate on ly) for 6 mon ths.233 In all of these studies, PD patients demons trated some level of m alnutrition or p rotein energy wasting. In Mi sra et al.,233 the m ajority of patients w ere presented with hypoalbuminemia; in Li et al.,232 all patients w ere malnou rished; and in Jones et al.,231 participants were mildly to moderately malnou rished. Guid Nut rition in CKD Page 116 Anthropom etric Measurements and Laboratory Measures of Nutritional S tatus Two RCTs examined the effect of IPAA therapy ceps sk infold me asurements and FM were maintain ed at 3 months231, 232 and 3 years232 in bo th IPAA and dextrose dialysate groups. The results from these studies indicated that sub stituting amino acid dialysate for dextrose dialysate had no effect on anth ropomet measurements. RCTs231, 232 and one s erum album t ransferrin levels in malnou rished PD patients. One random ized-controll ed trial evaluated the effect of IPAA supplem entation on total protein lev el.231 The findin gs from these studies concluded that subs dialysate for dextrose dialysate in patients ffect serum album in, pre- albumin, transferrin, and total protein l evels comp ared dextrose dialysate The findings from these studies sug gested th at substituting amino acid dialysate for in malnou rished PD patients decreased their phosph ate and bicarbonate levels, but the effect on po tassium levels was unclear. Jones et al. show ed that s erum potassium and phosph ate levels decreased significantly in IPAA group and le vels were different betw een groups at 3 months ( p<0.05 for each measure).231 In contrast, Misra et al. show ed no within-group changes in potassiu m, phosph ate or bicarbonate either IPAA or dextrose dialysate groups.233 However, wh en averaged across time, p atients receiving IPAA therapy had low er mean phosph ate (p=0.018) and bicarbonate levels (p=0.002). In secondary analysis, the IPAA groups in Jones et al.231 and Misr a et al.233 demonstr Nut rition in CKD Page 117 compa red to the dextrose dialysate group. In poo led analysis, there was a mean difference (95% CI) of -0.55 (-0.70, -0.41) mg/dL in phosph ate compa red to the dextrose dialysate group. Dietary inta ke (protein and energy intake) One random ized-control led trial examined the effect of IPAA suppl ement ation on total and oral protein and energy intakes in malnourished PD p atients.232 Compa red to bas eline intake levels, total p rotein in take increased in the IPAA group beginning at 6 months and continuing until 3 years (p=0.002 for each measure), but the re was no s ignificant difference between IPAA and dextrose dialysate groups. Compa red to baseline intake, total energy intake increased in the IPAA group at 6 months (p <0.001) and 3 years (p=0.002), but it decreased in the d extrose dialysate group (p<0.001 ), though there were no significant differences between groups. S imilar results were observed for oral and peritoneal energy intake only. nPNA (nPCR) increased in the IPAA group at 3 years, but d ecreased in the dextrose dialysate group, and values were significantly different between groups at 3 years (p<0.001 ). Special discussions The recommendation st atement is based on two random ized-controll ed and one non- random ized crossov er trials. The in cluded studies only assessed intermediate nut rition-related outcome measures, including dietary intake (total energy and protein intakes, and oral energy intake); laboratory markers of nutritional st atus (s erum albumin, pr e-albumin, etry (MAMC, triceps sk infold and FM). The effects of substituting amino acid dialysate for conventional dextrose dialysate on patient surviv al, hospitali zation, other clinical outcomes and qu ality of life have not been adequately evaluated. The long-term effect of IPAA therapy remains u nclear. Implementation considerations IPAA creased bicarbonate levels,233 m ild acidosis may occur in some p atients,229, 230 although it is readily treatable.Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 118 In dia betic patients on PD with uncontroll ed hyperglycemia, subs tituting amino acid for glucose in PD solutions may serve as an immedi ate str ategy for glycemic control. Future research Adequately powered long-term R CTs are required to ev aluate the effects of IPAA therapy on nutritional st atus, p atient survival, hospitali zation, other clinical outcomes and qu ality of life in PD patients at risk or with PEW. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 119 4.3 Statement on Long Chain Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids LC n-3 PUFA Nutritional Supplements for and Cardiovas cular disease 4.3.1 In adults with CKD on MHD post-transplant, we suggest not routinely prescribing long-chain n-3 PUFA, in cluding those derived from fish or flaxseed and other oils, to lower risk of mortali ty (2C) or cardiov ascular events (2B). 4.3.2 In adults with CKD on PD, it is reasonable not to routinely prescribe long-chain n-3 PUFA, in cluding those derived from fish or flaxseed and other oils, to low er risk of mort ality or cardiov ascular events (OPINION). LC n-3 PUFA Nutritional Supplements for Lipid Profile 4.3.3 In adults with CKD on MHD, we suggest that 1.3-4 g/d long-chain n-3 PUFA may be prescribed to reduce triglycerides and LDL cholesterol (2C) and raise HDL levels (2D ). 4.3.4 In adults with CKD on reasonable to consid er prescribing 1.3-4 g/d long- chain n-3 PUFA to improve the lip id profile (OPINION). 4.3.5 In adults with CKD 3 -5, we suggest prescribing ~ 2g/d long -chain -3 to lower serum triglyceride levels (2C). LC n-3 PUFA Nutritional Supplements for AV Graft and Fistula Patency 4.3.6 In adults with CKD on MHD, we suggest not routin ely prescribing fish oil to improve prim ary patency rates in p atients with AV grafts (2B) or (2A). LC Nutritional Supplements Kidney Allogra ft Survival 4.3.7 In adults with CKD with kidney allograft, we suggest not routine ly prescribing long-chain n-3 PUFA to r educe the number of es or impr ove graft surviv (2D). n-3 PUFA) include eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and do cosapentaenoic and do cohexaenoic acids (D HA), both of which are obtai ned prim arily from diet ary sources like cold-water fish (i.e. fish oi l), or linoleic acid, which is derived from flaxseed or certain other vegetable oils. In recent decades LC n-3 PUFA have demonstr ated p rotean transduction, met abolism, apoptos is, oxidation, and in flammation. Accordingly, they have been test ed in a variety of medi cal conditions. Of particular interest has been their putative effects on cardiac memb rane stabili zation le ading to possib le reduction of malignant arrhythmias and sudd en cardiac death. Patients with CKD have been documen ted to have some of the lowest blood levels of LC n-3 PUFA on record,234 thus making them potential ly very suitable candidat es for suppl ementation interventions. In fact, LC suppl ement ation has been studied as possib le therapy for a number of conditions common ly observed in p atients with CKD including dyslipidemia, h emodialysis access failure, cardiov ascular disease and death, as well as for their immuno modulato ry effects in patients with k idney allografts. Justification Thirty-five RCTs LC n-3 on a variety of he biomarkers mes in adults with CKD kidn ey transplant. Twenty-four of these studies patients on MHD as the t arget popu lation, tho ugh one study also includ ed patients on PD.235 Nearly all the inte rventions used fish o il as the main sour ce of LC n-3 PUFA but flaxseed oil235 and ground flaxseed 236 were also studied. Study length (4 weeks to 2 years) and size (12-567 participants) v aried widely. The heterogeneity of this literature in terms of the absolute and relative amounts of n -3 PUFA supplemented, the type of placebo used, and study duration mak es it more difficult to provide conclusive eviden ce for or against the use of LC n-3 PUFA as a treatment op tion. All-Cause Mortality and Cardio vascular Ev ents Despite the put ative overall benefits of LC n-3 PUFA and the elevated risk of death in patients with CKD, three RCTs d emonstr ated no improv ement in mortality with supplem entation. However, the studies were heterogeneous in te rms of stu dy population (one in patients with MHD237, two in patients with CKD with k idney allografts 238, 239, the dose of LC n-3 PUFA (Maachi et al. 1.44g /d EPA et al. /d al. 2006 0.77g /d EPA+ 0.64g /d DHA) and the stu dy duration (1-2 years), with the combined stu dy population being fairly modest in si ze (n=264). Two well-designed but modest ly sized (combined n=351) RCTs in patients on MHD reported Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 121 mixed results on the effect of LC n-3 PUFA supp lement ation on cardiovascular events.237, 240 Lok et al. 24 0 reported that 4 g/day fish oil (1.6 g /d EPA, 0.8 g /d DHA) for 12 months as compared to corn oil -based p lacebo si gnificantly lowered the cardiov ascular event rate surviv al 0.43 (0.19 to 0.96) (p=0.04) but did not influence the number of patients with one or more events 0.78 (0.55 to 1.09) (p=0.15). All were secondary outcomes in a trial designed to study MHD vascular access. In a secondary prevention trial , Sven sson et al. reported that 1.7 g/d fish oil (0.77 g /d EPA and 0.64 g /d DHA) for two years had no effect on the primary combined endpoint of cardiovascular events or death as compar ed to olive oil -based placebo237 but d id improve the secondary endpoi nts of myocardial infarctions (0.30 (0.10, 0.92) (p=0.036) (0.40 (0.17, 0.97) (p=0.043). Hemodialysis Access Previous stud ies have suggested t hat LC n-3 PUFA, in pa rticular those derived from fish o il, have anti-proli ferative, antioxidant, and vasodilato ry effects. Th is was the impetus for the four RCTs that examined wh fistulas (AVF) in patients on MH D. Of the three RCTs240-242 studying AV graft survi val, the two sm 0.96 -1.76 g/d EPA and 0.6 -0.96 g/d DHA) had mixed results with one s howing no benefit at six mon ths (n =29)241 and the oth er (n=24) reporti ng higher primary patency rates compa red to p lacebo group at 1 year (p<0.03).242 The third and much l arger trial (n=201) noted a borderline statistically significant improv ement in the loss of n ative patency at one year 0.78 [0.60-1.03](p=0.064 ) after providing 1.6 g/d EPA and 0.8 g/d DHA .240 While the ov erall results are not cl early posit ive they do suggest at a possible b eneficial effect. However, by far the largest study in this field (n=567), which examined patency rates in n ew AVF at 12 months243, reported that fish o il 4 g/d (1.84 g /d EPA and 1.52 g /d DHA) had no benefit. Rejection Episodes and Graft Su rvival in Kidney Allografts While LC n-3 PUFA have been reported to mediate the immuno logic response, they have not yet demonstr ated any benefits on k idney transplant. Two RCT s239, 244 with differing study interventions (2.4 g/d EPA + DHA for one year, 9 vs 18 g/d EPA for 26 weeks) found no benefit on r ejection episod es or a relationship betw een supplem entation dose and rejection Guid Page entation us ing approximately 2.5 g/d EPA+DHA influence graft surviv ession Based on six RCTs with wide ly differing study design and populations (CKD stage 3, MH D, kidney allografts),238, 239, 244 -247 fish oil suppl ement ation w as not fou nd to influence estimated or me asured GFR. In the study by Guebre Egziabher et al, participants received 1.8g of n -3 fatty acids, but authors do not describe EPA or DHA amount.246 In the study by Bennett et al, participants received \"9 or 18g /d EPA capsules\".244 In the remaining studies, EPA dose ranged from 0.46 -1.62g /d and DHA ranged from 0.25-1.08g /d. Similarly, fish oil suppl ement l evels in three studies of non-dialyzed patients w ho used pla cebo or non -placebo-based control groups. In the study by Guebre Egziabher et al, participants received 1.8g /d of n-3 fatty acids, but authors do not describe EPA or DHA amount.246 In the remaining studies, EPA amount ranged from 0.69 -1.44g /d and DHA amount ranged from 0.25 -0.96g /d. 245, 246, 24 8 Blood Pr essure (BP) Five R CTs examined the effect of LC n-3 PUFA supplem entation on BP, two in non-dialyzed patients (no st age reported)247, 248, two in patients on MHD240, 249, and one in patients with CKD with kidn ey allografts244. The results were mixed. In non-dialyzed patients, Svensson et al. reported that fish oil (0.96g /d from DHA and 1.44g /d EPA) for 8 weeks did not a ffect BP248 while Mo ri et al. found t hat fish o il (0.38g /d DHA and 0.46g /d EPA) for 8 weeks for each change) blood pressures.247 A pooled analysis of these two trials did not find an overall beneficial effect. In patients on MH D, Lok et al. reported an improvement in systolic BP in patients on MHD with fish oil (0.8g /d DHA and 1.6g /d EPA) for one year [Mean Difference (95% CI): - 8.10 (-15.4, -0.85), p=0.014)240 and a reduction in the numb er of BP medi cations but no effect on diastolic BP. In contrast, K hajehdehi et al. found no effect at all on BP of 1.5 g/day fish oil (DHA and EPA content not reported) as compa red to p lacebo for two months.249 Data from these two tri als could not be pooled. B ennett et al. random ized patients with CKD with k idney allografts and reported no benefit of \"9 or 18 g EPA capsules\" per day v ersus plac ebo for 26 weeks244 on systolic BP but d id note a reduction in d iastolic BP in bo th EPA arms (p<0.05 for Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 123 each) only. Lipid Prof iles Nineteen separate RCTs (thou gh one without a true control group250) addressed the impact of LC n-3 PUFA suppl ementation on lipid lev els. Thirteen studied patients on MHD235, 236, 241, 251-259 (with one study also including patients on PD179), four studied patients with CKD 2- 5185,186,199,200, and two st udied p atients with CKD with k idney allografts244, 260. The studies ranged greatly in terms of the type of suppl ement (seventeen with fish o il, two with flaxseed oil or g round flaxseed (2 g/d oil in Lemos and 40g/d seed in Kh alatbari)) and duration (3-6 mon ths). Additionally, amount and reporting of dosing was inconsistent. Studies reporting amount of specific LC n -3 PUFAs described doses ranging from 0.42- 1.8g/d EPA and 0.25 -0.82g /d DHA. The specific amounts of EPA and DHA were not clear in several studies .244, 246, 249, 252, 257, 258 Triglycerides: Eighteen RCTs studied the impact of LC n-3 PUFA on serum triglycerides. Seven of the thirteen trials studying patients with MHD found no effect235, 241, 251, 252, 255, 256, 258 and six reported a reduction in levels.235, 236, 249, 254, 257, 259 In a pooled analysis of twelve of these studies, LC n-3 PUFA suppl ement ation lowered (-63.21, mg/dL as high (I2=92.36 %, p<0.001 ). While outcom es did not app ear to be related to stu dy quality or duration, triglyceride lowering tended to be associ ated with using lower doses of LC n-3 PUFA (0.42-0.96g /d EPA and 0.24 -0.6g/d (2g/day) a counte rintuitive finding. Interestingly, posit ive results were more consistent in non-dialyzed patients245, 247, 248, 250 where fish oil suppl ement ation (1.8g/d total or 0.46 -1.44g 0.25 -0.96g /d DHA ) for 8-12 weeks consistent ly low ered triglycerides. Total Cholest erol: The literature did not suggest a beneficial effect of LC n-3 PUFA suppl ement ation on to tal chol El of thirt een studies in p atients on MHD reported no effect (0.42 -1.8g EPA and 0.24 -1.14g DHA per day f or 4 weeks-6 mon ths) .235, 241, 249, 251, 252, 254 -259, while the two studies suppl ementing with fl (2g/d Guid on Nut rition in CKD Page 124 ground flaxseed (40 g/d for 8 weeks)236 noted a significant reduction in total cholest erol levels (tho ugh one study did not compa re differences between groups 236). A pooled analysis of all 13 studies did not find any effect on mean total cholesterol but did no te a high lev el of heterogeneity in the d ata (I2=95.77%, p<0.001 ). Three of four suppl ement ation studies patients reported no effect on total choles terol levels237, 247, 250 while the fourth demonstr ated a reduction at three mon ths (p <0.05) with no d ifference between arms.245 Results could n ot be pool ed for these four studies. While Ramezani et al. 260 reported low er cholest erol levels in CKD patients with kidn ey allografts p 6 months suppl ement ation with 1.76g /d EPA with 0.96g/d DHA in fish oi l, Schmitz et al.242 found no su ch benefit in a similar population. LDL Cholest erol Eight of tw elve studies in p atients on MHD found no benefit of suppl ement ation,235, 251, 252, 254, 256-259 while four reported a reduction in LDL.235, 236, 241, 249 Two of the four positive studi es supp lement ed with fish oil (1.5g total in Khajehdehi et al.249 and 0.96g /d EPA with 0.6g /d DHA in 241 while the other two us ed flaxseed oil or ground flaxseed.235, 236 (with both latter studies observing a drop in LDL).235, 236 Study quality or duration or the type of compa rison group used did not influ ence the outcom e. A pooled analysis of all twelve studi es not ed an improvement in LDL only when excluding the then, the result was clinically marginal. In non-dialyzed patients, fo ur studies of 8-12 w eeks length us ing fish o il found no effect on LDL (1.8g /d total in Guebre -Egziabher et al. and 0.46 -1.44g /d EPA with 0.25 -0.96g /d DHA) .237, 245, 247, 250 In patients with CKD with k idney allografts, one study reported that EPA \"9 g capsules\" per day increased LDL levels (but a hi gher dose did not) while another study reported negative results.242, 244 HDL Cholest erol Seventeen RCTs includ ed HDL as an outco me. Though HDL may be influenced by physical activity, smoking status, and gender, the preponderance of these studies did not cont rol for these factors. Of the twelve studi es in p atients on MHD six reported negative results235, 251, 252, 254, 256, 258 and six found that H DL levels were increased.235, 236, 241, 249, 257, 259 Effects were not c learly influ enced by study quality or duration. Ho wever, the positive studies tended to use low er dos es of LC n-3 PUFA (0.72-0.96g /d EPA with 0.42-0.6g/d DHA), rition in CKD flaxseed oil (2g/day), or g round flaxseed (40g/day). In a pooled analysis of all twelve stu dies, LC n -3 PUFA suppl ement ation w as found to r aise HDL by a mean (95% CI) of 7.1 (0.52, 13.63) mg/dL. However, the heterogeneity was high overall. Results were mixed in the four trials of p re- dialysis patients, with two sho wing a benefit248, 250 and two reporti ng no effect.245, 247 Again, the outcome was not clearly influ enced by quality of study, study duration or dosage, and results could not be pooled. Finally, the on ly study in CKD patients with k idney allografts show ed anti-inflammato ry effects PUFA were tested on t wo establi shed biomarkers of inflammation. C-Reactive Protein Fifteen RCTs studied the effect of fish o il suppl ement ation on circulating CR P. In pre-dialysis patients throughout the stages of CK D, fish oil either compared to p lacebo247, 261 or at varying doses250 had no effect. The pattern in p atients on MHD was similar. A po oled analysis of ten studies235, 236, 241, 2 51, 254 -256, 262 -264 found no effect of LC n-3 PUFA suppl ementation (nine using fish oil containing 0.42 -1.8g/d EPA with 0.24-1.14g /d DHA, one using 2g/d flaxseed oil) on circulating CRP as -1.73 mg/L, 95% CI: -3.54, fat supplem entation ( which also includ ed fats other than LC-n-3 PUFA and specific n -3 PUFAs were not described ) was associated with a reduction in CRP (p=0.01) after 12 weeks as compa red to non -suppl ement ed patients.252 Interleukin-6 Six RCTs stu died the effect of LC n-3 PUFA on circulating IL-6. Neither of the two studies in predialysis patients com paring fish oil suppl ement ation to p lacebo or at varying doses found a significant effect on IL-6 (one study reported 1.8g /d n-3 PUFAs total and one reported 1.4g/d EPA with 1.0g DHA)250, 265, nor did a pool ed analysis of four studies in patients on MHD (MD 5.32 p g/ml, 95% CI: -5.637, 16.275 ) -1.93g /d EPA with 0.72 -0.97g /d DHA .254, 262, 264, 266 Special discussions Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 126 The clinical impact of LC n-3 PUFA suppl ementation in patients w ith CKD was challenging to assess due to short stu dy durations, modest sample si zes, and broad heterogeneity in the composi tion of the suppl ements dosi ng strategies. Furthermore, baseline LC n-3 PUFA levels (either in blood or tissues) were not typically used to target popu lations th at would most benefit. This is an important but often overlook ed point because the put ative benefits of LC n-3 PUFA suppl ement ation may be inversely related to bas eline blood or tissue concentrations.234, 267 suppl ement ation consid erations will differ depending on whether the intervention is die t-based or capsule -based. For di etary interventions the goal of supplem entation must be clearly defined. If it is to raise blood levels of -linolenic acid then suppl ement ation should fo cus on s oybean, flaxseed, and other oils as well as meat and d airy products. If it is to r aise EPA or DHA blood /tissue levels then the p rimary dietary sources mu st be s ardine, m ackerel, salmon and other high- content ma rine-based foods.268 Potential l imitations to diet ary suppl ement ation include their relative ly high cost and difficulty in achievi ng high dai ly intake. In addition, the source and processing method will influ ence LC n-3 PUFA foodstuff content. For example, farmed fish typically (but not always) has low er LC n-3 PUFA compa red to wild fish, whi le frying fish could alter the n-3/n-6 ratio which m ay be of clinical significance.269 Capsule-based of commercial LC n-3 PUFA suppl ements are available, qu ality control This makes precise dosing r ecommendations dif ficult. An alternative route is to h ave the p atient obtain suppl ements ethyl esters). For either option c ost could be an issue. Achieving high dose suppl ement ation will be easier with capsules then thro ugh dietary consumpt ion. Adv erse effects of suppl ement ation may lead to gastroin testinal side effects like stomach ups et and eructation (thou gh the l atter can be mask ed by different formulations). Th eoretical risks l ike bleeding have not be en borne out in clinical trials. LC n-3 PUFA content is listed on the website of the National Institutes of Health271 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 127 Monitoring and Evaluation There is no n eed to rout inely monitor diet ary LC n-3 PUFA intake other than in the context of general dietary counselling. An exception would be if the patient is spe cifically instructed to consume greater diet ary quantities of LC n-3 PUFA. Future research There are no adequately powered studies into whether LC n-3 PUFA reduces cardiov ascular risk, and in particular sudd en cardiac death, in the hi gh-risk CKD population. This is a high prio rity topic and the re is currently an ongoing RCT looking into these outcom es.272 The dosage and ratio of LC n-3 PUFA to be supplem ented as well as the quality control and pu rity of the suppl ement us ed should all be carefully consid ered in a ny study design. For example, a recent RCT found that a hi ghly purified form of EPA ethyl esters (with no ALA or DHA included) at a high dose (4 g/daily) available only in prescription fo rm was effective in reducing cardiov ascular risk.273 This is in contrast to several negative trials in recent years that used dif ferent formulations and dos es of LC n-3 PUFA. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 128 GUIDELINE 5: MICRONUTRIENTS 5.0 Statements for General Guidance Dietary Micronutrient Intake 5.0.1 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable for the registered tian nut ritionist (R DN) or inte rnational equival ent to encourage eating a diet that meets the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adequate intake for all vitamins and m inerals (O PINION). Micronutrient Assessment and Supplementation 5.0.2 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable for the nut ritionist (R DN) or inte rnational equival ent, in close collaboration with a physician or physician assistant, to ass ess dietary vitamin intake periodi cally and to consid er multiv itamin s upplem for individuals with equate vitamin intake (OPINION). Micronutrient S upplementation, Dialysis 5.0.3 In adults with CKD 5D who exhibit inadequate dietary intake for sustained periods of time, it is reasonable to consid er suppl ement ation with multivitamins, including all the water-soluble vitamins, and essential tr ace elements to prev ent or tr eat micronut rient d eficiencies (OPINION). RATIONAL E/BACKGROUND Micronutri ents are essential for metabolic function and hence maintaining an adequate intake of th ese micronut rients is important. For he althy individuals, many countr ies have established dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for individu al micronutri ents. Ho wever, there is a paucity of guidance regarding appropriate intake for people with ch ronic dis eases. There is some eviden ce to indicate that patients with CKD are likely to be deficient in certain m icronut rients. Some of the common reasons for this include insuf ficient dietary intake, dietary prescription may limit vitamin-rich foods (p articularly water-soluble vitamins), dia lysis procedure may contribute to micronutri ent loss, improp er absorption of vit amins, and certain medi cations and illness. Due to these concerns, th ere is a tr end for routin ely prescribing multivitamin suppl ements. Findings from the DOPPS study indicate that more than 7 0% of M HD patients in Uni ted States take suppl ements. Ho wever, there is insufficient evidence micronut rients or mul tivitamin supplem entation is beneficial or al in this population. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 129 DETAILED JUSTIFICAT ION At present the re is a paucity of good-quality evidence to eith er suppo rt m ere is some eviden ce to state that that p atients with CKD might be deficient in thiamine,274-276 riboflavin,277 vitamin 6278-280vitamin C,281, 282 Vitamin K,283-285 and/or tamin D286. However, most of the supporting eviden ce on deficiencies is for the MHD population and not much has been explored in o ther stages of CKD or for those on p eriton eal dialysis or post-transplant. This SR includ ed a compr ehensive search of controlled trials evaluating the effects of micronut rient suppl ementation (both w ater- and fa t-soluble) in patients with CK D. A total of 80 controll ed trials were includ ed in the systematic review (Folic acid alo ne- 14 trials, folic acid + B vitamins- 13 trials, vi tamin E- 8 trials, Vi tamin K- 1 trial, vitamin D - 14 trials, vitamin B12- 4 trials, vitamin c - 8 trials, thiamin e- 1, Zinc- 10 trials, Selenium- 7 trials). Some of the good qu ality evidence from these articles led to dev elopment of recommendation statements f or specific micronutri ents (s ee specific sections). However, the current ev idence in this field h as signifi cant limitations. A majority of the includ ed studies in this SR did not report either bas eline status of mic ronutrients examined or dietary intake during the trials. Moreover, the outcomes reported by these studies varied significantly across the s tudies, m aking it difficult to synthesi ze eviden ce. Also, the dosage of suppl ement ation and du ration of intervention varied across studies. Included studies p rimarily reported the effect of micronut rient suppl ement ation the the micronut rient being suppl emented. T he quality of eviden ce from these trials ranged from ve ry low qu ality to mode rate qu ality for a majority of the micronut rients. Due to these significant limitations, it is very difficult to provide recommendations r egarding the exact levels of su pplem entation or routine suppl ement ation for all patients with CKD. On the other hand, th ere is some eviden ce to support that the re might be some individu als who are at higher risk of certain micronutri ent Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 130 deficiencies. Taking all these issues into consid eration, the expert panel felt that it was important to draft expert opinio n-based recommendations s tatements to guide practitioners and to emph asize the n eed for individu alization of micronut rient us e. In recent years, th ere have been a few systematic or narrative reviews on the topic of micronut rient supp lementation in patients with CKD. The findi ngs from these SRs are in line with findin gs from the current SR. Tucker et al., in a d etailed review of mic ronutri ents in patients on MHD, st ates th at there is insufficient evid ence based judgement.287 Similarly, Jankowska et al. and K osmad akis G et al. , also state that the re is insufficient evid ence to support or oppose supplementation and more good quality trials are needed to help clarify eviden ce in this area.288, 289 SPECIAL DISCUSS IONS Certain CKD population might be at higher risk of micronut rient d eficiencies, and th is mu st be tak en into consid eration. For example, pregnant women, g astric bypass surgery patients, patients with ano rexia with poor intake, patients with mal absorption condit ions, p atients following vegetarian d iets, and p atients taking certain medications m ay have different micronut rient n eeds. Nutrition Focused Physical Examination should be condu cted with patients to identify if signs and symptoms of c ertain vitamin and m ineral deficiency are present. Th ese can be used in combination with lab me asures to get a complete pictu re of problem. If patients with CKD are meeting their recommended intake as assessed by 24-hr recall and have poor nutritional st atus, th en it is likely that t hey might be at-risk for micronutri ent deficiencies and appropriate inte rvention is required. IMPLEME ON CONSIDERAT IONS Gather information on wh ether they are taking any micronutrient or mu ltivitamin sup plements. Suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 131 population (ex: Recommended Dietary Allowance) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Assess Diet ary intake, including consid eration of fortified foods. Supplem entation dose should be individuali zed based on each patient's n eeds and risk profile. FUTURE RES EARCH Well-designed trials are needed to investigate if supplem entation improves out comes. These trials should limit inclusion to a certain baseline status ( ex: deficiency/insufficiency) or adjust for baseline status in results. Researchers shou ld consid er the effect of dietary intake of mi cronut rients on findin gs. There is a need to det ermine how dietary interventions targeting micronutrient intake may affect relevant ou tcomes. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 132 5.1 Statements on Folic Acid & Vitamin B12 Folic Acid Supplementation who have hyperhomocysteinemia associa ted with e, we recommend not routin ely suppl ementing folate with or without CKD Vitam deficiency/insufficiency based on clinical signs and symptoms (2B). Rationale/Backg round Folic acid is involved in the synthesis of several amino acids, including serine, glycine, methion ine, and hist idine. Folic acid can be provid ed by dietary sources as well as over-the- counter nutritional suppl ements. Ov er-the-counter suppl rms, such as folic acid, methyl folate (also known as L-methyl folate, ng others. Folic acid's primary mechanism of action is i ts role as a one-carbon dono r. Folic acid is reduced to methyl folate which helps transfer single methyl groups in various met abolic reactions in the bo dy. Folic acid also p lays a role in the functioning of the nervous system, in DNA synthesis and in cell division. Food sour ces rich in folic acid include green leafy vegetables, fruits, yeast, and liv er. Even thou gh intake of food naturally rich in folic acid is limited in p atients with CKD due to their high potassium content, folic acid deficiency among this patient popu lation seems to be rare. This is especially true since 1996, when folic a cid fortification of enriched cereal grain products was man dated in the United States and C anada.287 Because folate, vitamin B12 and vi tamin B6 assist in the conversion of homo cysteine to methionine (and the refore reduce serum homo cysteine levels), th ey have received as a putative t in Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 133 Detailed Justification Mortality, Cardio vascular Out comes and Vas cular Fun ction Four RCTs did not show any effect of folic acid when tak en with v itamins B6 and B12 on h ard outcom es, including all-cause mortali ty and/or cardiovas cular events in patients with stage 5 CKD, on MHD or PD, and pos B12 for a duration of 2-5 years. Folic acid (alone) intake of 1 to 5 m g/day for 4 to 40 weeks show ed no effect on flow m ediated dilation.294, 295 Addit ionally, folic acid supplem entation did not alter the risk of cardiovascular outcom es in four RCTs.296-299 The 4 RCTs inc luded patients with CKD, stage non- dialyzed and MHD. suppl ement ation du ration in these studies. Supplem entation wi th folic acid in combination with o B-vitamins did not improve total cholest erol levels, intima media thickness (IMT) or BP in MHD p atients. Doses ranged from 5 mg to 15 mg folic acid and a B-complex vitamin for 3 to 6 months.300, 301 CKD Progression One RCT examined the effect of acid supplem entation on CKD progression.302 In a sub- study of a larger primary stroke prevention trial i ncluding 15,104 p articipants with CKD Stage 3 dia conv mg/day of folic acid or p lacebo for a medi an of 4.4 years. Comp ared to the group receiving enalapril and pla cebo, the enalapril + folic acid group significantly reduced the adjusted risk of CKD progression (H azard Ratio (95% CI): 0.45 su b-study's prim ary outcom e.302 The limitation of this study was that a placebo alone group (without e nalapril) was not includ ed. Two other RCTs show ed no effect of suppl ement ation with folic acid wi th vitamins B12 on the risk of dia lysis initiation/ESRD in pa rticipants with st ages 3-5 chronic kidney disease and those post-transplant.290, 292 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 134 Serum Homo cysteine Levels Fourteen studies examined the effect of folic acid supplem entation alone on plasma homo cysteine levels.294-299, -309 Participants in cluded were those with CKD, non-dialyzed (4 studies), on M HD (10 st udies) and PD (4 studies ), and pos t-transplant (1 st udy). In the t en RCTs, f olic acid supplem ents ranged from 0. 8-60 mg/day and duration varied from 4 w eeks to 4.4 years in patients of various st ages of CK D. All but one study concluded th at folic acid suppl ement the effect of supplem entation with fol ate and oth er B-vitamins on cysteine levels.290-293, 300, 301, 310 -316 Serum homo cysteine level was a prim ary outcome of interest in ei ght studies.300, 301, 310 -312, 314 -316 Twelve out of 13 studies found that folic acid wi th other B vitamin suppl ement ation decreased homo cysteine levels in participants with CKD Stages 3-5, on MH D, PD and pos t-transplant. Supplem entation dos es in these studies ranged from 2. 5-40 m g/d folic acid (one study utilized 3 mg IV folinic acid/week), 1 \u00b5 g/d oral to 1000 1.4 -100 mg B6 and suppl ementation du ration ranged from 8 weeks to 5 years. CRP and IL-6 Levels Daily oral folic acid (5 mg) with a B-complex vitamin for 3 mon ths was associ ated with a decrease in CRP, but not IL-6, lev els in a RCT th at included 121 p atients on MH D.300 Folic acid and B12 r ementation of folic acid alone increased serum folic acid levels in participants with st ages 3-5 CKD and those on MHD and PD.294, 299, 302, 305, 306, 309 When folic acid wi th vitamins B6 and B12 was provid ed, it is worth no ting that s erum folic acid level increased with a daily intake of 5 mg for 3 mon ths, or a daily intake of 2.5 mg for a longer time frame. In the M ann et al. study that included p atients on MH D, serum folic acid significantly increased with an intake of 2.5 mg after 2 years of suppl ementation as compa red to the control group.293 In Chiu et al., a suppl ement ation of 3 mg folinic acid weekly via IV for 3 mo nths d id not r esult in a significant increase in serum folic acid levels in participants with st age 3 - 5 CKD or were on MHD and PD.312 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 135 Of the ten studies th at examined the effect of sup plementation of folic acid with B -complex, nine found a significant increase in serum folic acid lev els.291-293, 300, 301, 310, 311, 313, 316 Doses ranged from 2. 5-60 mg folic acid and stu dy duration ranged from 4 w eeks to 5 years. Special discussions Folate status is mo st often assess ed thro ugh measurement of folate levels in the pl asma, serum, or red blood cells. Serum or plasma folate levels reflect recent dietary intake, so deficiency must be diagnosed by repeated m easures of serum or plasma folate. In contrast, RBC fol ate lev els are more reflective of folate tissue st atus than serum folate and represent vitamin status at the time the RBC was synthesi zed (i.e. longer-term folate status). Usually, RBC fol ate concentrations dim inish after about 4 months of low folate intake reflecting the 120-day life sp an of R BC in he althy individuals. In patients w ith CKD such concentrations often decrease more rapidly reflecting the short er RBC life span in CKD. Excessive folate intake inhibits zinc absorption in the gut by forming a complex with zinc in the intestinal lumen. High intake of folic acid may mask s igns of pernicious an emia leading to undetected progression of neurological disease. Based on the 2015 US RDS annu al report, more than 2/3 (38. 9%) of the patients who are on dia lysis are 65 years or older. Older people h ave a higher risk of impaired gastroin testinal fun ction. Since absorption of vit amin B12 is dependent on Intrins ic Factor and no rmal gut function and sin ce the latter is o ften at least partially impaired in o lder individu als, assessment of serum vit amin B12 m B12 and folate levels monitoring may be considered for patients who t ake certain medi cations s uch as methotrexate, nitrous o xide, 6-azaridin e, phenytoin, carbamazepine, o ral cont raceptives, and excessive alcohol in take that can interfere with fol ate absorption. Implementation considerations Vitamin B deficiencies may be identifi ed by clinical signs and symptoms. Assessment of s erum vit amin B12 should CKD Page 136 administered. High folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurological disease, and thus levels of folate and vitamin B12 should be monitored if folate is being supplemented. Suggested vitami n intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (ex: Recommended Dietary Allowance) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, includi ng suppl ementation dos age, is ess ential to the management of any comorbid condition. Individualization should include patient age since adults over 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of athrophic gastritis in this population. Monitoring and Evaluation Serum/pl asma/ RBC fol ate level, serum v itamin B12 should be assess ed as appropriate Future research Condu ct dose response s tudies for folic acid intake especially in people undergoing chronic dialysis and persons who are taking medications th at interfere with the intestinal abso rption, s erum lev els, or actions of folate and/or vit amin B12. Assess the re commended daily allowance of folic acid and other B vitamins in va rious stages of CKD and various types of kid ney diseases. Examine the p revalence of serum folate deficiency in patients with v arious stages of CKD. Given one preliminary positive report, condu ct more RCTs to con firm wh ether folic intake may slow d own CKD progression. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 137 5.2 Statement on Vit amin C Vitamin C Supplementation 5.2.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D and pos t-transplant who are at risk of Vita min C deficiency it is reasonable to consider suppl ementation to meet the recommended intake of at least 90 mg/d for men and 75 mg/d for women (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round There are currently limited studi es identi fying daily vitamin C r equirements for individuals with CKD at all s tages of the dis ease. Amount of daily intake and opt imal s erum lev els of vitamin C r equired to maintain nu trition al health, reverse deficiency, and to avoid toxicity are unclear. Studies in cluded for this current review evaluated the effect of vi tamin C suppl ementation on nu trition al status, inflammation, ent levels, electrolytes levels, fluid s tatus, serum u ric acid levels, lipid lev els, morbidi ty events, qu ality of life, mort ality and hospi talizations. Limited data from a very small n umber of studies p rohibit definitive eviden ce-based conclusions for all the above surrogate and hard outcom es. Therefore, we suggest that individualized decision-making is the best clin ical app roach to determine if vit amin C suppl ement ation, or termination of suppl ement for adults with CKD stages 1-5D and pos t-transplant. Detailed Justification Nine studies examined the effect of vit amin C on nutritio n-related outcom es in the CKD population, including 317-321 one rative studies.322, All studies examined MHD patients. Two stu dies (Canavese et al. and Singer et al.) also includ ed PD patients and those with e GFR <20mL/min.321 Quali ty of Life (QoL), Mortality, and Hospital izations In adults with CKD, one RCT (250 mg oral ascorbic acid 3x/week for 3 months)321 and one compa rative study323 (500 mg oral vitamin C/day for 2 years) measured the effect of vit amin C suppl ement ation, compa red to either a placebo or control, on ha rd outcom es, including all- cause mortali ty, QoL or events. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 138 Singer et al. reported no changes in symptom, cognitive, or nausea sub-scales of the KDQOL- SF in either the vitamin C suppl ement ed or placebo groups in MH D/PD participants .321 QOL was the p rimary outco me of inte rest. Appro ximately 40% of participants were vitamin C deficient at baseline. In a compa rative study by Ono et al., the re were no differences in mort ality rates or hospit alization events betw een vitamin C suppl ement ed and no n- suppl ement ed periods in MHD participants .323 Mortality was a prim ary outcome m easure. Baseline vitamin C status w as not r eported. In summ ary, Vitamin C suppl ement extremely limited. Eviden ce based recommend ations for the use of vitamin C in this patient popu lation for these endpoin ts could Albumin, P re-albumin, Transferrin, and Protein Nitrogen App earance Three studies examined the effect of vit amin C suppl ement ation on nutritional st study.322. However, ritional st atus w as not the p rimary outcome of inte rest. In Zhang et al., all patients w ere vitamin C-deficient at baseline,282 while in DeVriese, et al. 44% of participants were deficient at baseline.322 In Fumeron et al., vitamin C d eficiency status at baseline was unclear.319 All ou tcomes were reported as quantitative values but w ere not compa red to a reference stand ard. Supplem entation dos age and duration ranged from 750 mg/week for 2 months319 to 1500 mg/week for 3 mon ths.322 All three studies reported no effect of supplem entation on albumin levels, as did p ooled analysis of two of the RCT s. Zhang et al. me asured the effect of vit amin C suppl ement ation on pre-albumin levels in a random ized trial with MHD participant s.282 While one suppl ement ed group experienced an increase in pre-albumin levels after three months of suppl ement ation with 200 mg vitamin C, pre -albumin lev els did not ch ange in the other group after the same inte rvention. Therefore, the effect of vitamin C suppl ement ation on p re-albumin levels is unclear. Fumeron al. suppl ement ed MHD participants with 750 mg/week of vitamin C for 2 mon ths.319 There were no significant ch anges in transferrin levels in either Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 139 group. DeVriese et al. measured nPNA (nPCR) in a NRCT and found no effect of months in MHD patients.322 CRP le vels Three studies examined the effect of oral vitamin C suppl ement ation on CRP levels in MHD participants 282, 319, 322 and found no si gnificant effects compa red to p lacebo or control groups, but evid ence was limited. Vitamin C Levels/deficiency Four RCTs282, 317, 319, 321 and two compa rative studies.322, 323 examined the effect of Vitamin C suppl ement ation in dos es ranging from 36 0-3500 mg/week and du ration ran ging from 3 months to 2 years. In summary, oral vitamin C suppl ement ation inc reased serum vit amin C levels in MHD patients and decreased the proportion of participants who were vitamin C deficient/insufficient (cut-offs were 11.44 and 23.0 \u00b5mol/L). However, in pooled analysis of three RCTS, the in crease in vitamin C lev els may not be clinically significant. The quality of eviden ce in this regard remains low. Other CKD populatio ns such as non -dialysis CKD pos t-transplant participants r emain po orly studied. These studies did not an alyze the effects of vi tamin C suppl ement ation on opt imal dosing or thresholds for toxicity. The potential for toxicity was acknowledged with dosage ranges maintain ed at 200 -250 mg daily or three times weekly in most studies. The study by Ono th at dosed MHD patients wi th daily 500 mg oral Vitamin C d aily for 2 years reported an aggravation of hyperoxalemia .323 De-Vriese et al. had subj ects do sed as 360 mg per week for 0- 3 mon ths follow ed by 1500mg/week dosing x 3-6 months and then no supplem entations for 6-9 months in MHD p atients. This stu dy reported an increase in plasma m alondiald ehyde.322 Supplem entation with vitamin C inc reased the low levels but there is a pot ential risk of toxicity that requires moni toring. Lipid Levels: Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, LDL, HD Ratio Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 140 The results of thr ee trials, 317, 320, 322 demonstr ated th at vitamin C suppl ement ation of 125-200 mg/d for 3 mon ths ay decrease total chol esterol and LDL cholest erol levels, but there was no effect on triglyceride or HDL cholest erol levels. Vitamin of 1 25-200 mg/day decreased LDL:HDL ratio or prevented the increase seen in the placebo group. There were several limitations to th is eviden ce including a small number of studies, small sample sizes and low eviden ce quality. It is important to no te that the study by Khajehdehi, et al. included suppl ementing patients with po tentially toxic dos es of ergocalciferol, 50,000 IU daily x 3 mon ths.320 The impact of this amount of vitamin D on stu dy outcome p arameters, if any, cannot be ascertained. Treatment of anemia with vitamin C suppl ement ation w as beyond the s cope of this guideline. Special discussions Current nu trition al requirements or R ecommended Dietary Intake of vitam in C for individuals with CKD stages 1-5D and pos t-transplant are not known and are based on those f rom the general popu lation. T he prevalence of vitamin C deficiency may vary according to the stage of CKD and dia lysis modal ity. Toxicity is a possible concern for excessive vitamin C suppl ement ation. The above findin gs do n ot how ever preclude t he importance of assessi ng for vitamin C suppl ement ation or when to discontinuing suppl ement ation. On going monitoring of overall food intake and nutrition status is required to assess for vitamin C d eficiency. An individual ized approach to evaluation and moni toring of vitamin C status is ideally accomplished by the n ephrolo gy care team that includes Nephrol ogist, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, and RDN. Implementation considerations Initiation and cessation of vitamin C suppl ement ation as well as suppl ementation dose should take into account of t he subject's nutritional st atus, diet ary intake, co-morb id conditions and dia lysis modal ity. Suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (ex: Recommended Dietary Allowance) unless there are specific Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 141 considerations requiring modification. Monitoring and Evaluation Higher dos es of Vitamin C suppl ement ation (500 mg daily) have been shown to inc rease serum oxalate levels. Vi tamin C is a pot ent physiologic antioxidant. Lipid met abolism may be affected by vitamin C suppl ement ation and patients receiving vitamin C supp lement ation should h ave lipid fractions monitored. Vitamin C also affects immune funct ion, and carnitine metabolism. Patients with a ny malabsorption or dise ases of an inflammatory nature may be more prone to having lower plasma vit amin C levels than the general population. Therefore, suppl ement ation dose should take into consid eration of medi cal history, co-morbid c onditions, and concomitant medi cations. M easurement of serum oxalate levels may be considered in patients pr escribed high doses of vi tamin C and/or who are susc eptible to calcium oxalate stone formation. Future research Identify methods to assess vitamin C status. Current methods ut ilize serum lev els of vitamin C, but reliability is uncl ear. Ascertain the optimal vi tamin C status of CKD population including CKD stages 1-5D and those with kidn ey transplant. Confirm the recommended diet ary allowance for vitamin C in va rious CKD popul ation and the suppl ement al vitamin C dose that will prevent vitamin C deficiency without increasing risk of toxicity. If feasible, evaluate the effect of vi tamin C suppl ement ation talization, cardiov ascular events as well quality of measures with RCTs in CKD populati on. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 142 5.3 Statements on Vit amin D Vitamin D Supplementation for Vitamin D Deficiency and Insufficiency 5.3.1 In adults with CKD 1-5 D (2C) and post-transplant (OPINION ), we suggest prescribing vitamin D s upplem entation in the form of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency. with CKD with nephrotic suppl ement ation of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol or other safe and effective 25(OH)D precursors (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) are recognized as a pro- hormon es and comprise a group of fat-soluble secosteroids. A unique aspect of vit amin D as a nutri ent is that it c an be synthesi zed by the hum an body through the action of sunli ght. Th ese dual sour ces of vitamin D (di et and sunli ght) make it challenging to dev elop diet ary reference intake values.324 The classic actions of vitamin D are the regulation of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis contributing to bone health. More recently, there has been a growing interest in the pot ential pleiotropic actions of vitamin D on immune, cardiov ascular and neurological systems and on antineoplastic activity since extra-renal organs possess the enzymatic capacity ert 25 ( OH)D to 1,25 (OH)2D.325 Insufficiency/deficiency of D, assess ed by serum concentration of calcidiol [25(OH)D], has been found to be common in the general popu lation and even more prevalent in patients with CKD sta ges 3-5D.286, 326, 327 For most experts, vi tamin D insufficiency is defined as a serum 25 (OH)D level betw een 20-29 ng/mL, deficiency is considered as 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 n g/mL and suf ficiency serum 25 (OH)D equal or greater than 30 ng/mL.328 A numb er of factors or conditions a re implicated in subopti mal vitamin D status in p atients with CKD, including aging, diabetes m ellitus, ob esity, reduced sun exposu re, loss of Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 143 urinary/dialysate D binding protein (DBP), impaired lar 25(OH) reabsorption and diet ary restrictions.329-332 Consid ering the h igh prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in CKD/ESRD and the potential b enefits of restoring the vitamin D status the K/DOQI ( ) ation.333, Detailed Justification Vitamin D Le vels and D eficiency Despite differences in dosing regimens and vi tamin D status at b aseline, supplem entation was effective in increasing 25(OH)D serum concentration in 14 RCTs, including in the form of ergocalciferol335, 336 and cholecalciferol.337-348 This effect was demonstr ated in HD patients (8 studies ), HD and PD patients combin ed (1 stu dy), stages 1-4 CKD patients (4 studies) and in 1 stu dy with any CKD participants. Five studi es reported that ergocalciferol using doses 50,000 IU/week and dose dependent on st atus335, 336 and cholecalciferol in doses ranging from 25,000 -50,000 IU/week improved vitamin D st atus.337, 338, 341, 345 There were significant effects no ted after three months of suppl ement ation. How ever, there was no difference in vitamin D d eficiency status bet ween non-dialyzed groups r eceiving two different dosing regimens.343 A meta-analysis was conducted to determine odds of vitamin D su fficiency according to vitamin D suppl ement ation, which includ ed Bhan et al. (each group compa red to the placebo group), Delanaye et al., Massart et al., and Alvarez et al.335, 337, 341, 345 Participants that were suppl ement ed with v itamin D h ad an OR (95% CI) of 9.31 (3.38, 24.7) (p<0.001) of being vitamin D su fficient (defined as either >30 or 32 ng/mL), tho ugh the re was mode rate heterogeneity in the data (I2=51.84; p=0.08). Add itionally, data from eight studies were pooled to det ermine mean difference (95% CI) in vit amin D l evels according to vitamin D supplem entation. Th ere was a mean increase of 21.06 (17.46, 24.66) ng/mL in the vitamin D suppl ement ed groups compared to the placebo groups, but h eterogeneity was mod erate (I2=67.3%; p=0.003 ), so results shou ld be interpreted with caution. Calcium and Phosphorus Levels Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 144 In adults with ch ronic k idney disease, twelve studi es examined the effect of vitamin D intake on bio markers and/or health outcom es.253, 335 -337, eviden ce effect of vit amin D suppl ement ation on calcium or phosphorus l evels. In predominantly vitamin D d eficient p articipants, there was no effect of ergocalciferol suppl ement ation on effect of calcium levels in doses of 50,000 IU/week or /month or in individuali zed doses.335, 336 The effect of cholecalciferol on calcium lev els was unclear with seven studies finding no effect on calcium levels and thr ee studies determining suppl ementation inc reased calcium levels. In Massart et al., there was no effect of 25,000 IU weekly cholecalciferol on prop ortion of HD participants reaching target levels at 3 months. Th ere was no clear pattern of effect according to participant population, de ficiency status or vit amin D dos age. In pooled analysis of four studies in which data could be combined, there was no effect of vitamin D supplem entation on ergocalciferol suppl ement ation with do ses of 50,000 IU/week or /month or in individualized doses) or cholecalciferol dos es ranging from 50,0000 IU/day to 50,000 IU/mon th (10 studies). In pooled analysis of five RCTs, there was no effect of vit amin D s 336, 341, 346, 347 Special Discussions Due to the complex nature of vitamin D, the p resent guideline is fo cused on the effect of vitamin D suppl ement ation, in the forms of cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, on vit amin D insuf ficiency/deficiency in patients with CKD and not on ou tcomes related to CKD -MBD or other clinical disturb ances. Supplement ation of prehormone and activated forms of vitamin D, calcidiol and calcitriol, w ere not includ ed in this guideline. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 145 There are potential benefits of vitamin D suppl ementation ( cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) in CKD. A systematic review with met a-analysis of observational and randomized studies show ed a significant decline in PTH levels wi th cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol suppl ement are non-dialyzed, on hemodialysis or periton eal dialysis, and renal transplant recipients.349 However, whether such improvements tr anslate in to clinically significant outcom es is yet to be determin ed. Cross -sectional analysis of Third National Health and Nut rition E xamination Survey (NHANES III) showed progressively higher prevalence of albuminuria with de creasing 25(OH)D levels.350 In a prosp ective cohort stu dy vitamin D d eficiency was associ ated with a higher incidence of albuminuria.351 There are limited random ized clinical trials investigating the effect of cholecalciferol or calcifediol on prot einuria in CKD Consi derations The optimal s erum 25 (OH)D concentration for patients with CKD and the concentration at which patients with CKD are considered deficient/insufficient is not well defined but is generally consid ered to be t he same as in the general population, although the re is no absolute consensus about the definition of vitamin D su fficiency. For most e xperts, vi tamin D insuf ficiency is defined level een 20-29 ng/mL, deficiency is conside red as 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL and suf ficiency serum 25 (OH)D equal or greater than 30 ng/mL.328 Both the Kidn ey Disease Outcomes Quality ng 354 In the most r ecent upda te of the KDIGO guidelines on bone m ineral disorder, it is suggested based on low q uality evidence that p atients with CKD sta ge 1-5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be ind ividuali zed according to bas eline values and in terventions. Ho wever, there was no clear suggestion on how Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 146 frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed.333 With respect to vitamin D suppl ement ation, current guideli nes suggest that patients with CKD stages 1-5D and tamin D insufficiency/deficiency ation using the same str ategies recommended for the general population. However, even for the general popu lation, the opti mal dosage of suppl ementation varies among the m ain guidelines. It has been recommended 1000 -2000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D that p atients th CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan.354 There is also a debate regarding whi ch form of vitamin D should be us ed, ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. In the general popu lation th ere appears to be some advantage of using cholecalciferol ov er ergocalciferol.355 Since in CKD the re is no clear eviden ce about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians shou ld use the fo rm commercially available in the context of th eir clinical practice. The tolerable up per intake levels (UL) proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for the general popu lation is 4,000 IU/day.356There is no recommendation of safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supple mentation to prevent for toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosph atemia in CK D. However, calcium and phos phorus should be consid ered especially for patients who are on calcium -containi ng phosphate bind ers and/or on vitamin D active analogs. Future Research There is a need of well-designed trials to determine: Optimal definition of thresholds for suppl ement ation Dosin g, timing of administration and type of vitamin D analogues in the CKD population Risks and benefits of vit amin D suppl ement ation in the CKD population Long- term goals of vit amin D suppl ement ation in the CKD populationGuid eline on Nut in CKD Page 147 5.4 Statement on Vit amins E and A Vitamins A and E Supplementation and Toxici ty 5.4.1 In adults with CKD on MHD or PD , it is r easonable to not routin ely supplement vitamin A or E because of the potential for vitamin to xicity. However, if supplem entation is warranted, it is reasonable to use caution and mon itor patients for toxicity (OPINION). Rational/Background Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nut rient recognized for antioxidant p roperties. Th ere are eight known naturally occurring forms of vitamin E,324 but alp ha-tocoph erol is the only known form of vitamin E th at meets hu man requirements and is the form found in plasma. Therefore, Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin E is on ly available for alpha-tocop herol. The RDA for vitamin E was determined by identifying serum l evels of vi tamin E th at provided protection to erythrocyte survival when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. While vitamin E suppl ements are typically provided as tocoph erol (RRR-alpha -tocoph erol, labeled as D or d) is not identical to the n atural form. This is because synthetic alpha-tocoph erol contains eight s tereoisomers of which only 4 are found in tissues and serum. Synthetic alpha-tocop herol: all rac-alpha-tocoph erol, labeled as dl or DL is therefore only half as active as the n atural form, therefore requiri ng 50% more IU to receive a dose equival ent to the n atural sour ce.324 Most supplements provide vitamin E as alpha- tocoph erol in a 100-400mg dose. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin. The potential risk of vi tamin E t oxicity is pri marily related to the use of suppl ement s.324, 357 High dos es of vitamin E supp lements in the form of alpha- tocoph erol h ave been reported to c ause b leeding and/or disrupt blood coagulation in vivo and there are alpha-tocopherol inhibi ts platelet aggregation.357 The RDA for vitamin E for normal adult men and w oman is 15mg per day (22.4 IU). The Food and Nutrition Board has defined an upp er level of int ake for vitamin E in the form of alpha- Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 149 tocoph erol and the st ereoisomer forms in synthetic vitamin E supplem ents as 1500 IU and 1100 IU/day respectively. While not de finitive, these levels of intake appear to be the safety limit with regard to the potential of vitamin E to con fer bleeding ris k. Several studies evaluated the effects of Vitamin E coated di alyzer membranes on biocomp atibility, blood pressure during dialysis and oxidative str ess.358, 359 However, results were inconclusive. Data regarding the effect of vi tamin E coated di alyzers on hemoglobin, lipid pro file and nutritional st atus w ere inconclusive and stu dy design for these trials and the meta-analyses were of low qu ality.360 Studies examining daily vitamin A requirements for individu als wi th various st ages of CKD are lacking. Optimal serum levels of vi tamin E are not de fined for this pop ulation. D aily vitamin E required to maintain nu trition al health, reverse deficiency, and to avoid toxicity in CKD population a re unclear. Vitamin A was initially investig ated in the systematic review, but there were no die tary trials available, on ly trials in which vitamin A was delivered intravenous ly, which was consid ered beyond the scope of this guideline. Detailed Justification The eight studies in cluded for this review examined the effect of o ral vitamin E suppl ement ation in adults with health outcom es.320, 361 -367 three of these studies, vitamin E supp lement ation w as combined with -lipoic (ALA).361, 364, 367 All patients as the t arget popu lation, except for et al.,367 3-5 CKD subj ects. Subjects in Hodkov a et al. w ere vitamin E repleted, but bas eline vitamin E status w as not r eported for any of the other stud ies.365 All- Cause Mortality and Cardio vascular Dis ease Outcomes Participants with CKD (serum creatinine 1.4 to 2.3 mg/dL) and high risk for cardiovascular events w ere given 400 IU daily oral vitamin E f or a medi an of 4.5 years.366 Compa red to the placebo group, there was no dif ference in total mortality between groups. Additional ly, there Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 150 was no dif ference in the relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death from CV causes, uns table angina, heart failure hospitali zations, h eart failure, TIA or composi te or MI, strok e, or death from c ardiovas cular causes between groups. Boaz et al. examined the effect of vit amin E suppl ement ation ed with dai ly oral 800 IU oral vitamin E for a medi an of 519 days. Risk of all-cause mort ality was not s ignificantly different betw een groups. The vitamin E g roup h ad a si gnificantly decreased risk of experiencing a CVD endpoi nt comp ared to the control group, but the RR for fatal and non-fatal MIs, ischemic stroke and PVD were not significantly different between groups. Based on t hese limited d ata, vitamin E supp lement ation did not affect all-cause mortali ty. Results regarding the effects of vi tamin E sup plement ation on CVD outcom es were mixed, Differences may be due to the popul ation studied or vitamin E dos age. In pooled analysis condu cted in the current system atic review, there was no effect of vit amin E supplem entation on CVD outcom es, though h eterogeneity of results was high. Anthropom etric Measures Two RCTs examined the effect of vit amin E supplem entation on nu trition al status in MHD participants.361, 363 Participants received either tocotrienols (90 m g) and to copherols (20 mg) for16 w eeks or 400 IU oral vitamin E/d ay, 600 mg alpha lipoic acid (ALA)/day, or both for 2 months. While there were no changes in albumin levels betw een groups in the former study (Daud et al.), in Ahmad i et al., SGA score w as improv ed in the vitamin E, ALA, and combined suppl ement ation groups compa red to p lacebo. SGA was the p rimary outcome of in terest in this study. Vitamin E d eficiency status at b aseline was not described in either study. Three RCTs examined the effect of oral vitamin E supp lement ation on anthropom etric measures.361, 363, 367 All tudies reported no effect of vitamin E supplem entation on BMI or body weight. Ant hropom etric measurements were not the prim ary outcom es of interest in any of these studies. Guid eline on Nut rition Five studi the effect of vit amin E su pplem entation on inflammatory biomarkers, particularly CRP and IL-6 lev els.361, 363 -365, 367 In three of the studies these inflammatory markers were the primary outco mes of inte rest.361, 365, 367 Himmelfarb et al. and Ramos et al. gave vi tamin E supplem entation in combination with -lipoic acid,364, 367 and Ahm adi et al. examined vitamin E sup plements alone and in co mbination wi th -lipoic acid.361 All stu dies assessed the effect of o ral vitamin E supp lement ation on the C RP inflammatory marker levels in patients with CKD Stages 3-5 and MHD participants. None of them fou nd any effect of vitamin E supplem entation r anging from 40 0-800 IU oral vitamin E p er day (with or without 600 mg -lipoic acid) for durations r anging from 5 weeks to 6 mon ths on CRP levels. Three of the studies also measured IL-6 and found no relationship betw een vitamin E suppl ement ation and IL-6 364, 367 al. (Stages 3-5 CK D) and Him melfarb et al. (MHD patients) both su pplem ented with daily oral 666 IU mi xed tocoph erols (Vitamin E) + ALA 600 mg for 8 weeks and 6 mon ths, respectively.364, 367 Neither found an effect of suppl ement ation on s erum IL-6 levels. Ho wever, Ahm adi et al. found th at oral vitamin E alone (400 IU per day) or in combination with 600 mg -lipoic acid per day, reduced IL-6 cytokine levels in MHD participants.361 In pooled analysis of two RCTs that ut ilized vitamin E alone or with - lipoic acid, there was no effects on IL-6 levels comp ared to the p lacebo groups. Serum Vitamin E Levels Two RCTs examined the effect of d aily oral vitamin E supp lement ation on vi ies includ ed MHD patients. Hodkov a et al. found that serum v itamin E levels increased in the vitamin E supplem ented group (-tocop herol 400 m g/888 IU) after 5 weeks, but no change in the control. Between group differences were not report ed.365 Boaz et al. found that the vitamin E supplem ented group had significantly higher vitamin E l evels compa red to the placebo group when MHD participants with pr e-existing CVD were suppl ement ed with 800 IU oral vitamin E/d ay for a medi an of 519 days, but betw een group differences were not reported.362 In poo led analysis of the two RCTs that examined vitamin E suppl ement ation alone, th ere was no s ignificant supp lement ation compa rition in CKD Page 152 placebo/cont rol group. Therefore, available evidence indicates th at vitamin E supplem entation alone do es not affect vitamin E l evels. Lipid Levels Daily oral vitamin E supp lement ation of 110 mg for four months 363 and 200 mg for three months (Khajehdehi et al.) did not change serum tr iglyceride, total chol esterol or LDL (low density lipoprotein) levels but demonstr ated efficacy of in creasing HDL-C lev els.253 Special discussions As a result of the limited number of high-quality studies, (see study selection criteria) and the variability in the outco mes reported in these trials, there is insufficient evi dence to make recommendations on vi tamin E int ake for CKD patients. The nutrition al requirements or Recommended Dietary Intake of vitamin E for individuals wi th CKD stages 1-5, those undergoing chronic dialysis and post-transplant are unknown. Dose response studies identi fying the relation between Vitamin E intake and serum lev els of vi tamin E are not available. The prevalence of vitamin E d eficiency in CKD population is unclear. The potential of vitamin E to xicity with supplem entation is a concern for this f at-soluble vitamin. There is a potential for toxicity in those patients who are being suppl emented. High doses of vitamin E supplem entation has the potential to increase risk of hemorrhagic stroke and impair platelet aggregation. Vit amin E int eracts wi th anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and therefore caution is advised on vit amin E supplem entation for CKD patients already receiving these medi cations. Vitamin A w as invest igated in th is SR, how ever there were no trials examining dietary intake of vitamin A, and suppl ement ation trials includ ed IV vitamin A, which the WG determined qualified it as a medi cation vs a nutritional supplem ent. How ever, the same concerns regarding toxicity of vit amin E supplem entation app ly to vitamin A suppl ement ation. Recommendations cannot be m ade with r egard to vitamins A or E supplem entation in CKD population. An ind ividuali zed approach is r equired in conside ring the need to supplem ent Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 153 vitamins A or E supplem entation or t ermin ate supplem entation in adult CKD population and the re is also a n eed to mon itor for toxicity with s upplem entation. Implementation considerations Implementation of vitamin E suppl ement ation should consid er individu al patient 's nutritional st atus, diet ary intake, concomitant med ications, co-morbid conditions p articularly with r egard to baseline cardiov ascular disease, and lipid levels. Oral doses >= 400 IU of vitamin E are not recommended without at least intermittent mon itoring of serum vit amin E l evels. Monitoring and Evaluation Platelet count should be moni tored as shou ld any changes in medical status, medications, and nutritional st atus. Future research Identify methods to assess vitamin E s tatus. Current methods ut ilize serum lev els of vi tamin E, but the sensitivity and reliability of this approach are unclear. Ascertain the optimal vi tamin E status of CKD population including CKD stages 1-5, those on di alysis and those that have received a kidney transplant. The potential role of vitamin E treated di alyzer membranes on preventing intradialytic atus, d ecreasing/preventing intradialytic inflammation, and anemia resistance is not yet defined. Ongoing studies in this area are ind icated to further define the role of vitamin E treated di alyzer membranes. Investigate the recommended diet ary vitamin E int ake that will prevent vitamin E deficiency and the recommend ed suppl emental dose of vitamin E that will correct vitamin E deficiency without increasing the risk of toxicity, including investig ation of the effects of larger dos es of oral vitamin E (i. e. 800 IU/day). Examine the effects of v itamin E supp lement ation on h ard outcomes ty and Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 154 5.5 Statements on Vit amin K Anti coagulant Medication and Vitamin K Supplementation 5.5.1 In adults with CKD 1-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable th at patients receiving anticoagulant medi cines kno wn to inhibit vitamin K activity (e.g., warfarin compounds) do not receive vitam in K suppl ements ( OPINION). Background Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase which enables the carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins p roducing coagulation factors. Co agulation factors II, VII, IX and X are the most w ell-known vitamin K -dependent proteins, and d eficiency in these factors can lead to impairment in blood clot ting. Vitamin K also enables no rmal calcification processes to pro ceed in bone and soft tissues. M atrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent protein produced by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that is a powerful inhibi tor of vascular calcification in culture media fter carboxylation, MGP b calcium c rystals, inhibiting further crystal growth. MGP binds to bone mo rphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) thereby ards osteo chondrogenic type cells. Vitamin K p articipates in the enzymatic carboxylation of proteins controll ing bone calcium deposit ion (e.g., ost eocalcin) and p lays an important role in no rmal b one formation and structure. Hence Vitamin K, by facilitating carboxylation of certain pro teins, h as major effects on blood clothing, preventing soft tissue calcification, incl uding vascular calcification and controlling bone calcium crystal fo rmation. Two classes of vitamin K compounds are primarily respons ible for vitam in K activity, phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and men aquinones (vitamin K2 ).368 Phylloquinone is found prim arily in foods, especially green and leafy vegetables (e.g., spin ach, kale, cabbage, broccoli), plant ba sed oils found in many food products, and cow's milk. There are more than Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 155 10 men aquinones whi ch differ in the numb er of isoprenoid un its in its side chain. Mo st menaquinones are produced by bacteria. Menaquinone 4 is dif ferent and appears to be produced in v ivo from p hylloquinone.368, 369 Menaquinones are found in dai ry products (yogurt) meats, and fermented foods, and also synthesized in the intestine by colonic bacteria. The Intestinal absorption of vitamin K requires biliary and pancreatic secretions and occurs in the small intestine where vitamin K is in corporated into chylomicrons. T he role of the menaquinones in vitamin K function and nutritional n eeds is s till not completely understood. Large doses of vitamin E m ay induce vitamin K deficiency.369 Detailed Justification & Special Discussion The United S tates Institute of M edicine states that the Adequate Intake of vitamin K is 120 and 90 m icrograms per day for adult men and w omen, respectively.370, 371 These values are based on medi an vitamin K intak es reported in the NHANES III data. Glob ally, dietary recommendations f or vitamin K usu ally vary from 50 to 120 micrograms/day.372 These recommendations do not differentiate phylloquin one from menaquino ne intake. At the ti me the US Institute of M edicine recommendations w ere set, the food composi tion dat abases on which these recommendations were made only contain ed the p hylloquino ne content of foods. Hence, these current recommendations are based on phylloquinone, which is the major form of vi tamin K in Western diets. Increasing age, platelet count and s erum u rea and creatinine and low er serum album in concentrations w ere associated with more severe elevation in prothrombin time in patients taking antibiotics.373, 374 Vitamin K suppl ements m ay return p rothrombin time to norm al in such patients.374 Patients receiving antibiotics who have poor intake and at higher risk of bl eeding (e.g., surgical patients) m ay be consid ered for vitamin K suppl ements, p articularly if acute kidn or chronic kidn ey disease.373 However, the foregoing conclusions w ere essential ly based on obs ervational studies of sm all number of patients. A stu dy of the NHANES data indic ated th at 72.1% rate CKD (eGFR- EPI 58 mL/min/1.73m2) h ad vitamin K intake below the recommended adequate Intake (AI) level (mean, 97.5 \u00b5g/day; 95% CI, 89.7-105.3).375 Studies in Italy confirmed that d aily intake of Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 156 vitamin K1 in MHD patients is commonly below recommended levels.372 Several observational studies in advanced CKD (stages 3-5) or MHD patients indicated th K1 (phylloquinone) and vi tamin K2 (menaquinone) concentrations w ere frequently low and that s erum lev els of oth er unc arboxylated compounds whi ch, wh en elevated, indic ated vitamin K d eficiency were increased.376, 377 The recommended diet ary vitamin K intake for patients with CKD 1-5, including those with the n ephrotic syndrom e, those who are undergoing MHD or PD or those who are post- transplant recipients were not de fined and were based on that d erived for the general population. In MHD patients, vi tamin K intake and serum vit amin K l evels are often low or undetectable, and serum uncarboxylated osteocalcin and PIVKA-II are commonly elevated.303,304 Vitamin K Levels Only one short term randomized controll ed stu dy has been publ ished that examined the effects of vitamin K suppl ements on vitamin K st atus in MHD patients.377 No su ch studies h ave been carried out in other stages of CKD or in PD p atients or those pos t-transplant. The study involved sm all number of patients who r eceived, by random ass ignment, suppl ements of 45, 135 or 360 m icrograms per day of vitamin K2 (menaquinon e-7) for only six w eeks. In general, there was a dose dependent increase in serum vit amin K2 and decrease in serum and PIVKD-II. Mean serum vit amin K2 rose to previous ly reported normal values with the 45 \u00b5 g/day dose and to modestly above norm al valu es with the 135 and 360 \u00b5g/day doses. Serum dpucMGP, ucosteocalcin and PIVKD-II decreased most wi th the 360 \u00b5g/day dose, but co ncentrations s till tended to be above norm al with this dose. There are currently several clin ical trials of vi tamin K suppl ements in MHD patients, and more information r egarding vitamin K suppl ement ation should be available within the n ear 379 (Clinical Trials is a paucity of data on the long- term safety of different vitamin K intak es and especially of vitamin K sup plements and of the value, if any, of taking different vitamin K compounds. Individuals receiving vitamin KGuid eline on Nut rition in CKD eceive anticoagulant me dicines that inhib it vitamin K activity (e.g., warfarin compounds). Implementation Consi derations Patients receiving antibiotics who have poor intake and at higher risk of bleeding (e.g., surgical patients) m ay be consid ered for vitamin K suppl ements, p articularly if they have acute kidn ey injury or chronic kidney disease.373 However, the foregoing conclusions w ere essent ially based on obs ervational studies of small number of patients. The RDN may provide dietary assessment/counseling related to excess dietary intake of Vitamin K or irregular excess intake of foods containing high vitamin K; and providing education regarding dietary sources of vitamin K . Future research Consid ering the h igh prevalence of bone disord ers and severe atherosclerotic and coronary artery vascular disease in CKD patients and the relationship of t hese disord ers to calcium deposition in these tissues, th ere is a great need to more precisely define the dietary vitamin K requirements and the v alue, if any, for routine vitamin K suppl ements in patients with dif ferent types and stages of CKD and with vas calcification. Examine the confounding effects dif ferent co-morbid c onditions on the di etary requirements f or vitamin K intake and the need for vitamin K suppl ements and the dose of su ch suppl ements in p atients with k idney disease. Examine the p hysiology and met abolism of vi tamin K in p eople with CK D, with particular regard to evaluate why vitamin K d eficiency appears to be more common in people with advanced CKD, including those un dergoing chronic dialysis. Evaluate the lo ng-term clinical effects including the safety and potential ri sks, if any, of vitamin K suppl ements. Examine whether there are interactions b etween vitamin K suppl ements and anticoagulants th at are not warfarin-type compo unds. Examine whether dietary intake of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 h ave any different clinically important effects. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 158 5.6 Statement on Trace Minerals - Selenium and Zinc Selenium and Zinc Suppleme ntation 5.6.1 In routin ely suppl ement ing selenium or zinc since there is little eviden ce that it improves nutritional, infl st atus (2C). Rationale/Backg a trace element that has kno wn antioxidant properties and pl ays a role in en zymatic activities inside the body. It acts as a cofactor for the reduction in important antioxidant enzymes like glutathione p eroxidase and thus protects against oxidation. Several studies have suggested that MHD patients have low levels of selenium compared with healthy controls, and deficiency of this trace element may contribute to increased oxidative stress and in flammation .380-383 There is also some preliminary suggestion that low selenium levels may be associated with increased death risk in MHD patients, esp ecially death due to infections.382 Zinc is an essential micronutri ent and forms a component of bi o-memb ranes. It functions not only as an antioxidant but also has anti-inflammatory effects and prevents free radicals-induc ed injury during inflammation. There is some suggestion that marginal zinc intake may be associ ated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in gen eral popu lation384 and zinc has been shown to protect against atherosclerosis by inh ibiting the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholest erol in animal studies.68 Zinc deficiency has been shown to increase oxidative stress and NF-B DNA-binding activity and induce inflammation in experimental models .385-387 Zinc is also essential for insulin synthesis and release and glucose homeostasi s388 and zinc deficiency has been suggested to impair insulin secretion and decrease leptin levels.389 Studies have reported a high prevalence of zinc d eficiency in hemodia lysis patients.390-392 The current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc is 8 mg/d for wom en and 11 mg/d for men in the general population and for s elenium is 55mc g/d for wom en and men. Whether similar amount of in take is recommended in various CKD stag es and mainten ance dia lysis population is currently not known. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 159 Detailed Justification Selenium In adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), seven studies have examined the effect of selenium intake on biomarkers and other s urrogate health outcom es. Most of the studies utilized oral selenium suppl ement ation and all studies were performed in MHD patients. Koenig et al. examined the effect of intravenous selenium suppl ement entation in the form of a Brazil nut.394 Selenium dosages generally ranged from 175-1400 \u00b5g per week. The selenium dosage in Stockl er-Pinto et al. was not described (1 Brazil nut/day) and in Koenig et al. , the parenteral dose of selenium used was much higher (400 mg 3 times a week) compa red to other studies. Study duration ranged from 14 days to 6 months. In Temple et al. , participants' selenium status at baseline was norm al.395 In a study by Ton elli et al. , 28% of treatment group versus 15% of placebo group had low selenium levels after suppl ement ation.396 Around er-Pinto et al. , and the remaini ng studies did not r eport s elenium status at baseline.394 Nutritional Status Only one very shor t-term (12 weeks) random ized placebo-controll ed study examined effect of oral selenium suppl ement ation of 200\u00b5g per day on nutritional status in 80 MHD patients. 397 The study reported a significantly greater reduction in SGA and malnutritio n-inflammation score in the selenium group compared to the placebo group. Ho wever, no significant difference was observed in serum albumin concentrations between the two groups.397 The same study by Salehi et al. did not observe any difference in the medi an changes of CRP levels between selenium and placebo groups. Altho ugh a smaller inc rease in in terleukin-6 levels was observed in selenium group compa red to placebo group,397 this is the on ly study that examined inflammation as an outcome. Thus, there is not enough evidence to make recommendation of selenium suppl ement CKD Page 160 Selenium Le vels Althou gh two short -term small random ized controll suppl ement plasma and erythrocyte selenium levels,395, 398 it is not known if ement ation may impact on any patient health- related or hard clinical outcom es. Only one short -term random ized study by Salehi et al. examined the effects of or al selenium suppl ement ation on lipid levels. The results show ed no difference between selenium group and control group in any of the lipid parameters includi ng triglyceride, Nutritional Status small short-term RCTs examined the effects of zinc supplementation on nutrition status in MHD patients. The study duration ranged from 8 weeks to 90 days. The dose of zinc suppl ement ation ranged from a daily dose of 11mg, 50mg to 100mg elemental zinc.399-401 In the study by Argani et al. , serum albumin levels increased in the zinc supple mented group but there was no change in the placebo group.399 Guo et al. examined zinc suppl ement ation of 11mg daily for 8 weeks in a cohort of 65 MHD patients with low baseline zinc level (<80mg/dL). Descriptive quantitative data was not provid ed but the authors concluded that protein nitrogen appearance and albumin levels significantly increased in zinc suppl ement ed group but not in control group.400 Jern et al. show ed that protein catabol ic rate increased with 50mg zinc suppl ement ation for 90 days but no change in placebo group.401 Between group differences were not provid ed in these studies. The data from these three small low-quality trials were regarded as incon clusive and not enough to make recommendation. Lipid Prof ile Four short -term R CTs examined the effect of oral zinc suppl ement ation on l ipid levels.399, by Argani et al. and Rahimi-Ardabili et al. administered 100 mg oral zinc daily to MHD p atients for two months.399, 403 Argani et al. show ed no changes in cholesterol and triglyceride levels with zinc suppl ement ation.399 Rahimi-Ardabili et al. showed that cholest erol levels increased significantly in the placebo group but no change in the treatment group and total Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 161 cholest erol levels were not different between the two groups after 2 months' stu dy 403. In the other two studies, Roozbeh et al.404 and Chevalier et al. 402 both suppl ement ed MHD patients with 50 mg zinc daily for six weeks and 90 days, respectively. All patients in both these two studies were zinc d eficient at baseline (<80ug/dL). Both studies show ed that total cholest erol, LDL-C, and serum triglyceride levels increased in zinc supplem ented group but no change in the control group. The conclusions by the authors in these studies suggested that this increase in lipid parameters was desirable.402, 404 Pakfetrat et al. examined the effect of 50 mg oral zinc per day for 6 weeks in MHD patients, and found that significantly decreased homo cysteine levels decreased in the zinc s upplem ented group compared to the pl acebo group.405 Two studies examined the effects of zinc supp lement ation on inflammatory parameters, but results were incon clusive.406 Data on the effects of zinc suppl ement ation on body weight and BMI were mixed and limited. 399, 407 Zinc Le vels Six RCTs examined zinc suppl ement ation in relation serum zinc levels in MHD patients.396, 399, 400, 402, 404, 408 All except Tonelli's study 396 described zinc deficiency at baseline. The dosage of zinc suppl ement ation used ranged from 11mg to 110m g. Study duration ranged from 5 weeks up to 6 months. In the study by Ton elli and co-workers, zinc levels in the medium dose (50mg p er day) but not the low dose (25mg per day) group were significantly higher than the non- suppl ement ed group at 90 days and 180 days after supplem entation .396 A pooled analysis of these 6 studies show ed a mean (95% confid ence intervals) increase of levels compa red to control group. However, heterogeneity was high. Furthermore, it is not known if zinc suppl ement ation in deficient patients may impact on any health-related outcomes or clinical hard outcomes in CKD and dialysis patients. The long- term effects or any toxicity of zinc suppl ementation are also u nclear at this stage. There were no identified studies examining the effect of zinc supplementation on dysgeusia in patients with CKD, though this topic has been explored in other populations .409 Implementation considerations Suggested intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (ex: Recommended Dietary Allowance) unless there are specific considerations requiring Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 162 modification. Monitoring and Evaluation There are no specific guidelines for monitoring selenium and zinc deficiency or suppl ement ation. However, although unlikely, practitioners should be aware of signs and symptoms of severe selenium and zinc d eficiency in CKD Stage 3-5D patients. Future research recomme ndations Condu ct population -based cohort studies to determine the prevalence and importance of selenium and zinc deficiency across different stages of CKD and kidney transplant patients as well as dialysis modali ty and examine whether selenium or zinc deficiency may be related to va rious surrogate and hard clinical outcomes. Condu ct adequately powered clinical trials of long enough duration to evaluate whether selenium or zinc suppl ement ation in deficient CKD and mainten ance dialysis patients may improve v arious surrogate markers of inflammation and protein energy wasting, lipid parameters, wound healing, dysgeusia and other health outcomes in dose d ependent mann er. Limited data suggest that further random ized trials shou ld recruit specifically selenium deficient p atients. The safety of prescribing zinc in non-deficient dialysis patients also needs to be determin ed. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 163 GUIDELINE 6: ELECTRO LYTES 6.1 Statements: Acid Load Dietary Management of net acid production ( NEAP) 6.1.1 In adults with CKD net acid produ ction (NEAP) throu gh increased diet ary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) in ord er to reduce the rate of decline of residual ki dney function. Bica rbonate Maintenance 6.1.2 In adults with reducing net o rder to of d ecline of residual kidn ey function. 6.1.3 In adults with CKD 3-5D, it is reasonable to maintain s erum bic arbonate levels at 24 - 26 m mol/L (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round Acid base homeost asis is maintain by urinary acidification using titratable anions, such as phosph ate, to tr ap proteins, and trapping ammonia that is generated as ammonium in an acid urine. As kidn ey function declines, the n et acidification requirement by residual n ephrons increases. This leads to inc reased ammonia p roduction per residual nephron and requires delivery of glutamine to the residual n ephrons. The increased per nephron need for increased acidification and ammonia g enesis is in p art endothelin controll ed and m ay increase injury to residual n ephrons. Acid retention also w ould have the pot ential to promote muscle wasting as part of the hom eostatic processes of normalizing acid base status. Met abolic acidosis increases skeletal muscle proteolysis by p athway that d egrades actin potential ly having adverse nutritional i mpact on the patient accompani ed by an increase in prot ein catabolic rate. Detailed Justification Eleven studies examined the associ ation between dietary acid load/oral bicarbonate on h ealth outcom es in the CKD population. Of the in cluded s tudies, th ere were four RCTs,198, 199, 410, 411 one NRCT,200 three non-controll ed studies ,412-414 two p rospective cohort stud ies,415, and one retrospective cohort stu dy.417 CKD Progressio n; effect of reducing net a cid production Studies aimed at evaluating the effect of reduction in net acid produ ction (NEAP) h ave been two-fold; either directly reducing NEAP by administration of sodium b icarbonate, or by dietary alteration using f ruits and vegetables, whi ch both decrease NEAP and alter the composi tion and qu antity of dietary protein p artially confounding the effect of reduction of NEAP alone. In adults with CKD, four RCTs ,198, 199, 410, 411 one non-RCT ,200 two non -controlled studi es,413, 414 two cohort and one retrosp ective cohort stu dy417 examined the effects of di etary fruit and vegetable or oral bicarbonate supplem ents on progression. mL/min 1.73 m2 endog enous (15 or <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) compared to lowest dietary acid load tertile, highest dietary acid load had greater relative h azard of ESRD (p=0.05).415 Studies reducing N EAP by the u se of administration of oral sod ium b icarbonate are not confounded by alteration in dietary protein comp osition and easier to study in random ized controll ed prospective manner. In studies involv ing patients with CKD Stages 4-5, the oral sodium b icarbonate group had significant greater creatinine clearance after 18 and 24 mon ths (p<0.05). Rapid CKD progression (creatine clearance loss of >3ml/min per 1.73m2 /yr) was lower 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06-0.40). ESRD low ium b icarbonate group (RR: 0.13; CKD Stages 4-5; not on dia lysis, there was no s ignificant difference in creatinine clearance between before and after intervention (p>0.05).414 In patients with less impaired kidney function at baseline (CKD Stage 3), there was a reduction in eGFR in all groups, ho wever, at 3 years, lesser reduction in eGFR was obs erved with HCO3 group or fruits and vegetables than usu al care grou p.199 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 165 In a study by Goraya et al. , in patients with CKD Stage 4 using either fruits and v egetables or NaHCO3 as the int ervention, treated either with HCO3 or fruits v at baseline and 1-year follow-up (p=0.99, 0.49, respectively), eGFR were comparable between the two groups at baseline and 1-year follow -up (p=0.84, 0.32, respectively).198 This st udy does not iso late the effects of alteration in dietary composi tion and NEAP suf ficiently to est ablish whi ch intervention is associated with any biological change observed. The outcome of studies in patients wi th CKD Stages 1-2 are less clear and the out comes not as definitive. This may in part be due to the fact that the p er nephron st ress of maintaining acid/base balance is reduced, either decreasing the renal risk of acidification below a critical threshold, or by reducing the power necessary to measure an effect. Addi tional ly, stud ies that alter NEAP by changing diet ary composi tion a re confounded by other variables, su ch as amino acid load and quality. One of the outcome variables measured was urinary albumin excretion. Net urine albumin excretion w as not dif ferent among the th ree groups in CKD Stage 1 patients (p>0.05). However, in CKD S tage 2 patients, f ruits and v egetables had greater decrease in net urine albumin excretion than both HCO3 and control (p<0.05) and HCO3 group had greater decrease in net u rine albumin excretion than control (p <0.05).200 It should be noted th at a change in diet towards hi gher intake of fruit and vegetables is a different and more complex intervention than change in NE AP since the amino acid load and composi tion is changed. This may affect urin ary protein loss and have an effect on progression that is indep endent of NEAP if the patient popu lation has significant proteinu ria. Hospital ization The effects oral bicarbonate suppl ements on h ospitalization in CKD patients w ere mixed, though evidence is limited. In adults with ch ronic kidney disease, two RCT s410, 411 examined the effects of o ral bicarbonate suppl ements on h ospitalization. Among CKD Stage 5D (peritoneal dialysis), compared with p lacebo group, intervention group h ad lower hospital Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 166 admission (t rend) and hospital length of stay (p=0.07 and 0.02, respectively).411 In CKD Stages 4-5; pr e-dialysis, there was no s ignificance difference in hospi talization for heart failure b etween the two groups (p=N/A).410 Nutritional Status In CKD patients Stages 3-5 including ones on maintenance dialysis, oral bicarbonate suppl ements ed nutritional p realbumin) studies. bicarbonate suppl ements increased overall scores (de Brito-Ashu rst -~1800 m g/day).410 Except for Koom an et al. ,412 (dialysate bic arbonate and oral sodium bicarbonate (1500 -3000 m g) if pre-dialytic bicarbonate did not r each desired level), the other three studies obs erved posit ive effects of o ral bicarbonate suppl ements on se rum a Brito-Ashurst -~1800 m g/day;410 2.7\u00b10.94 g/day;413 suppl ements also had no measurements.412 Brito-Ashu rst et al. , (~1 800 m g/day)410 noted si gnificant increases in mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC) measurements with o ral sod ium b icarbonate, while Koom an et al. did not.412 Two RCTs410, 411 and thr ee non-controll ed studies412-414 examined the effects of o ral bicarbonate supp lements on nutrition al status in adults with CKD. In CKD Stage 5; periton eal dialysis, the or al bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 w eeks (p- value <0.0003 ).411 In CKD Stages 4-5; pre-dialysis, the or al sod ium b icarbonate group had significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (p <0.05) and the o ral sod ium bicarbonate group h ad significant higher serum album in at 12 and 24 months (p <0.05).410 In contrast, in a group of CKD Stage 5; hemodialysis patients, there was no significant difference in serum albumin among time points (p >0.05).412 In CKD CKD pr sod ium b icarbonate increased both s erum albumin and p realbumin levels betw een before and after intervention (p<0.05).414 Among Guid eline on Nut rition in 1-2 compa red to cont rol and HCO3, fruit and vegetable group had significantly greater decrease in bo dy weight at the end of the intervention for both individuals with CKD stage 1 and st age 2 (p<0.05 for both). No difference between HCO3 and control .200 Thus the re does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NE AP on nutritio nal status in patients with CKD 1-2. In CKD Stage 4 compa red to HC O3 group, FV group had lower weight at 1- year follow up (p<0.01) - baseline weight did not d iffer between the two groups (p=0.24).198 In CKD Stage 3, fruits and vegetables had greater net body weight loss than both HCO3 and control (p <0.05) and control group had greater net body weight loss than HCO3 group (p<0.05).199 Special discussions In Stage 5 MHD patients, higher bicarbonate in t he dialysate bath is associated with inc reased mort ality in epid emiological studies .418 In an analysis of the DOPPS data, it w as reported MHD patients wi th either very low bi carbonate (< 17) or very high predialysis bicarbonate (>27) concentrations are at the greatest mortality risk.419 Paradigms that may apply to patients with r esidual r enal function or those und ergoing continuous th erapy, such as periton eal dialysis, do not d irectly apply to hemodia lysis patients who are experiencing large changes in acid base equilibrium r apidly and/or discontinuou sly. Higher bicarbonate concentration in hemodialysis patients may also be reflective of lower protein in take. Research on th is top ic is complicated by the fact that the effect of acidosis differs with the l evel of residual kidn ey function. With advanced CK D, net acid load has a higher potential to contribute to loss of kidn ey function. Dietary intervention is more complex, since the effects of sp ecific amino acids or other dietary consti tuents on both r enal outcomes as well as vascular and bo ne pathophysiology (Calcium /Phosphorous) may play a role that is i ndependent from t heir effect on a cid base physiology. Implementation considerations Acid load is a consequence of protein load and is inve rsely associated with potassium Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 168 intake. The estimation of n et acid intake is (NEAP (mEq/d) = -10.2 + 54.5 (protein [g/d]/potassium [mEq/ d]). NEAP c an be reduced by administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium or potassium citrate or by reduction in d ietary acid content by changing the dietary pattern to increase fruits and vegetables. of fruit and vegetables. The latter can be accomplished by reduction in d ietary protein intake and changing its composi tion. Low p rotein in take may have the added benefit of slo wing the rate of progression of kidney disease through other mechanisms (See Section 3.1). In the MDRD stu dy, patients random ized to low prot ein intake exhibited a significant increase in serum bic arbonate,420 so that there is an interaction between intake of protein and net acid. Separating the effect of reduction in acid load and the effect of change in dietary protein amount and composi tion on outcom es is challenging. When increasing fruits and vegetables intake to correct acid load please use caution and monitor potassium levels. Monitoring and Evaluation Clinical trials have demonstrated compliance with e xpected changes in a cid base status as evaluated by measurement of s erum bic arbonate: Consuming fruit and vegetable in the amount that could r educe dietary acid by 50% generally had posit ive effects on acid-base biomarkers.198-200 Fruit and vegetable inc reased plasma tot al CO2 (though not s ignificant in one study)200 and decreased potential r enal acid load and 8h N AE. Except for by inc reasing plasma total CO2 or bicarbonate levels and d ecreasing potential renal acid load and 8h N AE in s ix studies with d ifferent su pplem ent combinations and dos ages. No hyperkalemia events were noted in the studies of Goraya et al. who provided a diet rich in fruits and vegetables to patients with advanced CKD .198 However, we note that inclusion criteria in those studies considered patients at low hyperkalemia risk not consuming RAS inhibitors . While no studies have formally evaluated the contribution of dietary potassium to hyperkalemia risk in these patients, we recommend caution if a fruit and vegetable rich diets is to be recommended to control metabolic aci dosis. A close monitoring of serum/plasma Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 169 potassium levels is encouraged, and fruit/vegetable consumption should be temporarily limited if the patient is considered at risk of hyperkalemia. Monitoring of circulating potassium is specially recommended in pa tients with CKD stage 4 or more, including those on dialysis, as this is the kidney function range where inabilities to compensate dietary potassium occur. Future research Research is needed to identify the contribution of NEAP to that of protein intake to progression of kidney disease as well as to increase urinary protein excretion. It is unknown what if any of the injurious effect of p rotein is contribut ed by acid load. Increased diet ary acid intake is beli eved to con tribute to loss of kidney function and sarcopenia. Further understanding of the optimal thr eshold for translation of these b enefits to morbidi ty and mortali ty is necessary. With regard to the effects of fruits and vegetables, it is import ant to separate the effect of other aspects of dif ferences in diet ary composi tion; amino acid compos ition, carbohydrate composi tion from the control di et from the effects of acid load. Increasing pH du ring intermittent hemodialysis does not i mprove clinical outcom es. It is import ant to establi sh optimal in tradialytic bicarbonate concentration and dia lytic bicarbonate delivery to patients receiving MHD, as well as to und erstand the contribution of reduced protein intake to higher serum bic arbonate in HD patients. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 170 6.2 Statements on Calci um Total Calcium Intake 6.2.1 In adults with CKD 3-4 not taking active vitamin D analogs, we suggest that a total element al calcium intake of 800-1,000 mg/d (including dietary calcium, c alcium suppl ement ation and calcium-based phosph ate binders) be prescribed to maintain a neutral calcium balance (2B). 6.2.2 In adults with CKD 5D, it is reasonable to adjust calcium intake (dietary calcium, calcium supplements or calcium -based binders) with consideration of concurrent use of vitamin D analogs and calcimimetics in order to avoid hypercalcemia (OPINION). Rationale/Back ground Calcium is a multivalent cation important for many biologic and cellular functions. Approximately 99% of total bo dy calcium is fou nd in the skeleton and the remaind er is p resent in the extracellular and intracellular spaces. In addition to its role in mainte nance of bone health, calcium s erves a vital role in ne rve impulse tr ansmission, mus cular contraction, blood coagulation, hormone secretion, and in tercellular adhesion. Calcium bal ance is tightly regulated by the concerted action of calcium ab sorption in the intestine, reabsorption in the kidn ey, and exchange from bone, which are all under the control of calciotropic hormon es triggered by demand for calcium. Serum calcium con centrations are maintain ed in the norm al range until very late in CKD when it decreases slightly.421 However, calcium bal ance in CKD is poor ly understood. C alcium deficiency due to de creased intestinal calcium ab sorption is a stimulus for the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant bone disord ers. On the ot her hand, calcium excess may promote extra-osseous calcification contributing to increasing the risk of cardiov ascular disease and mort ality of these patients.422 In kidn ey transpl ant, calcium b alance is even more complex and depends on sev eral factors su ch as the pos t-transplant renal function, the p ersistence of hyperparathyroidis m, the p revious bone disease and the immunosuppr essive the rapy.423 Detailed Justification Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 171 Serum calcium levels do not reflect the overall body calcium bal ance and may not be very informative except at extremes. The mainte nance of serum calcium in the norm al range in CKD depends on se veral factors su ch as bone turnover, mineral regulating hormon es, degree of kidney function, use of vitamin D analogues, dialysate calcium co ncentration and calcium intake especially from s upplem ents. A careful m edical and nut ritional histo ry may provide some ins ight into the adequacy of calcium intake. However, due to the multifactorial causes of altered calcium metabol ism in CK D, the establi shment of adequate amount of di etary calcium is challenging and depends on the investi gation of calcium bal ance. The eviden ce review included thr ee small short -term clinical trials in pre-dialysis CKD patients that investi gated the effect of calcium intake in food or suppl ements on mine ral bone biomarkers and on calcium bal ance. No ot her outcomes were investigated in these studies. Calcium Balan ce and other Lab Measures In an NR CT, 51 p atients in the early stage of CKD (creatinine clearance: 66 to 82 mL/min) were placed in a low protein (40 g/d) and low pho sphorus (600 m g/d) diet supplem ented with or without 0.5 g/d of elemental calcium for 10 days.424 A decrease in intact parathyroid ho rmone (iPTH) was obse rved only in the group receiving calcium supplem entation and no changes in serum calcium, phospho rus and calcitriol w ere found in the other groups. In a crossover study, six p atients with CKD stages 3 and 4 consum ed controlled high (2,000 mg/d) and low calcium diets (800 m g/d) for 9 days.425 Calcium bal ance was slightly negative to neut ral in both patients and healthy controls on the low calcium d iet (- 91\u00b1113 and - 144\u00b1174 m g/d respectively, p>0.05) and more positive in p atients than in cont rols on the hi gh calcium d iet (759\u00b1120 and 464\u00b1225 m g/d respectively, p<0.05). Serum calcium and phosph ate concentrations w ere unchanged and iPTH and 1,2 5-dihydroxivitamin D decreased in the high calcium d iet. In a 3-week random ized cross-over balance study, eight patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were random ized to a controll ed calcium intake of 2457 mg/day (1,500 mg of element al calcium from c alcium carbonate used as phosphate bind er + 957 m g/day of dietary calcium) v ersus placebo (957 mg/day of dietary calcium).426 The calcium bal ance was neutral in the pl acebo Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 172 and posit ive in the calcium carbonate groups (508 vs. 61 m g/d, respectively, p=0.002). Serum calcium, phosph ate and iPTH concentrations w ere un changed in bo th groups. Despite the sm all numb er of patients investigated, these well performed balance studies show ed that a dietary calcium intake of approximately 800 to 1,000 mg/d may be adequate to maintain calcium bal ance in patients CKD stages 3 and 4 who are not receiving active vitamin D analogs, at least at short term.427 These values are close to the current estimat ed average requirement (EAR-800-1000 mg/d) and the recommended diet ary allowance (RDA- 1000-1200 mg/d) for healthy individuals propos ed by the Institute of Medicin e. Special Discussions In mainte nance dialysis patients, c alcium bal ance is more complex. In addition to diet ary calcium load and use of vitamin D analogs, calcium con centration in the dialysate and mode of dialysis also det ermine the m ass bal ance of calcium. Studies using a math ematical modeling have shown a posit ive calcium bal ance mass in p atients on MH D.428, 429 According to estimates and assumptions m ade, extracellular fluid calcium increased with an elemental d aily calcium intake >1.5 g and was numerically more posit ive when patients are given active vitamin D analogs.428 The excess of extracellular calcium is deposi ted in either osseous or extraosseous sites. The extensive soft t issue calcification hi ghly prevalent in MHD patients suggests that extraosseous si tes seem to be the repository for this c alcium .430 Althou gh calcium bal ance studies are demandi ng, they are essential to pro vide d ata to make conclusive recommendation for calcium intake from diet or supplem ents for patients on mainten ance dialysis. Notably in KDIGO (CKD-MBD) 2009 and 2017 there is no recommendation regarding calcium intake for patients on m aintenance dialysis or with k idney transplantation.333, 431 Implementation considerations Hypercalcemia is relatively common in patients on mainten ance dialysis. Evidence has been accumulated link ing higher serum calcium con centrations to inc reased nonfatal cardiovascular on in CKD Page 173 events432 and mort ality.433-436 In the event of hypercalcemia the followi ng adjustments are recommended:334 In patients taking calcium-based phosph ate bind ers the dose should be reduced or therapy switch ed to a non-calcium phosphate binding. In patients taking active vitamin D analogs the d ose should be reduced or therapy discontinu ed unt il serum con centration of calcium return to norm al. If hypercalcemia persists, consid er using low dialysate calcium (1.5 to 2.0 mEq /L). This should be done with c aution because observational studies h ave linked this approach with increased risk for arrhythmia and heart failure.437, 438 Future research Adequate dietary management of calcium can contribute in the control of mineral and bon e- related complications in CK D. However, there is an u rgent need of research to cov er the existing gap in this area. Calcium bal ance studies are needed to provi de data for recommendation of a safe calcium intake threshold for patients with CKD in the different stages of the disease includi ng maintenance dialysis (MHD and PD) and kidn ey transplant. The effect different sourc es of calcium (dairy foods, fortified foods and calcium suppl ements) on serum calcium concentrations shou ld be studied. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 174 6.3 Statements on Phosphorus Dietary Phosphorus Amount 6.3.1 In adults with CKD 3-5 and on MHD, we recommend adjusting dietary phosphorus int ake to maintain serum phosph ate levels in the no rmal range (1B). Dietary Phosphorus Source 6.3.2 In adults with CKD 1-5D and post-transplant, it is reasonable when making decisions about phospho rus restriction treatment to consid er the bioavailability of phosphorus sou rces (e.g. animal, vegetable, additives) (OPINION). Phosphorus Intake with Hypophosphatemia 6.3.3 For adult kidney tra nsplant recipients wi th it is reasonable to prescribing high-phosph orus intake (diet or r eplete serum phosph ate (OPINION). Rationale/Backg round Phosphorus int ake is necessary for bone growth and m ineralization, as well as for regulation of acid-base homeost asis. Phosphorus is an essential nutri ent, oc curring in most foods both as a natural compon ent and as an approved ingredient added during food processing. Because of difficulties of p ersons with CKD (CKD) to cle ar excess phosphor us, additional me ans of s erum phosph ate control is n ecessary to avoid hyperphosphatemia, which could lead to bone and mineral metabolism d isorders of CKD. There are physiologic adaptations in the early stages of CKD that p revent excessive phosphorus retention, so the in ability to promote phosphorus excretion to avoid phosphorus accumulation and hyperphosph atemia is enerally seen wh en estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level decreases below 45 mL/min,439 being less common in e arlier CKD stages. In the setting of anuria in patients on mainten ance dialysis, hyperphosph atemia risks are particularly heightened,440 with a p revalence as high as 50%.441 Detailed Justification How much should di etary phosphorus/phosphate be restrict ed in adult patients with CKD is not Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 175 well establi shed. Traditionally, CK D-specific recommendations suggest maintaining phosphorus int ake between 800-1000 mg/day in patients with CKD stages 3-5 and those in mainten ance dialysis in order to m aintain serum phosph ate in the no rmal range.147, 333, 33 4, 442 - 444 The wo rkgroup notes, ho wever, that the efficacy of this recommendation has not been establi shed. Further, such diet ary phosphorus int ake range is higher than current recommend ed diet ary allowance for phosphor us in the adult general population (700 m g/d).445 While dietary intake influences serum phosph ate in CKD patients, f actors other than intestin al phosphorus/phosphate absorption (n amely exchange with bone and excretion by the kidn eys in patients with r esidual r enal function) m ay be major determinants of s erum phosph ate levels. Thus, the workgroup prefers not sugg esting specific dietary phosph ate ranges, and inste ad emphasi ze on the n eed to individuali ze treatments bas ed on p atient needs and clinical judgment, taking into conside ration natural sou rces of o vegetal phosphorus use of phosphorus additives in pro cessed foods .446-448 With the goal to better understand the effect of d ietary phosph ate control, the workgroup decided in th is eviden ce analysis to focus on r eports that addressed di etary phosphorus intake/output/balance. This resulted in the exclusion of studies reporti ng solely on serum phosph ate lev els. Phosphorus Control Limiting dietary phosph orus intake (per se or in combination with dietary protein restrictio n- the m ajor sou rce of dietary phosph orus) may be recommended to pr event / treat compl ications related to h igh phosph ate load p atients with CKD stages 3-5 and mainte nance dialysis. This p atient edu cational str ategies ence review included 5 sho rt-term clin ical trials that evaluated the effect of reduced dietary phosphorus on p hosphorus int ake, phosph ate levels and u rinary phosphorus Phosphate r r egimes in no n-dialysis CKD: Two R CTs144, 424 examined the effects of reduced dietary phospho rus in p atients with CKD not unde rgoing dialysis.

All five stud ies reported statistically significant134, 141, 154, 163 or borderline-significant133 reductions in s erum phosph ate levels at the end of intervention. The interested r eader can find more in formation on th is topic in the evidence analy sis of dietary protein r estriction in these guidelines . Phosphate r maintenan ce dialysis: Two RCT examined effects limiting dietary phosph orus in p atients with CKD undergoing MHD. Lou et al. tested the effect of 3 -month intensifi ed diet ary couns eling in order to achieve 800 - 900 m g/d of diet ary phosphorus and observed a greater decrease in serum phosph ate concentration compa red to stand ard care. 123 Sullivan et al. tested the effect of patient edu cation on ide ntifying foods with phosphorus additives and observed, compared to standard care, a significant reduction in serum phosph ate lev els after 3 months.450 No stud ies were identifi ed that included PD p atients. Althou gh diet ary phosp horus restriction may be valid stand-alone str ategy in patients with CKD-stage 3-4, the working group notes th at, collectively, the s erum phos phate reductions achieved sol ely by limiting dietary intake are modest (especially for dialysis patients) and recommend th is strategy as one in the armament arium of inte rventions to maintain s erum phosph ate levels in the normal range. For oth er non-dietary phosph ate management str ategies, the inte rested reader can consult recent guidelines on the m anagement of mineral and bo ne disord ers of CKD.147, 333, 334, 442 -444 Aligning with those guidelines, we recommend decisions to restrict dietary phosphorus be based on the presence of progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate (that is, trends rather than a single laboratory value), and after consideration of concomitant calcium and PTH levels. Clinical consequences of dietary phosphorus control Whereas many studies have explored the out come associ ations with s erum phosph ate levels rition Page 177 throu ghout the spectrum of CK D, the clinical con sequences of restricting dietary phosphorus are not w ell studied. CKD progr ession Three observational studies evaluated t he effects of diet ary phosph ate restriction on CKD progression. R esults were mixed and eviden ce was limited. Williams et al. studied impact of a dietary phosphorus restriction (alone or in comb ination with protein restriction) on creatinine clearance among 90 C KD patients of un reported etiology or CKD stage over a medi an intervention time of 19 mon ths. 144 Compa red to routine care, diet ary protein and phosph ate restriction or phosph ate restriction on ly did not show any significant difference in the mean rate of fall of creatinine clearance. In an obs ervational analysis from the Modifi cation of Diet in Renal ase (MDRD) study, greater 24-hr urinary phosph ate excretion (taken in this study as an estimate of dietary phospho rus intak e) was not asso ciated with the future risk of ESRD.451 We note th at in this study baseline phosphate levels were well controll ed and no rmal on average, whi ch may not be the case of real-world settin gs. A small r etrospective observational analysis from Japan including CKD patients stages 2-5 obs erved that ated with a higher 3-year risk of CKD progression (defined as the composi te of ESKD or 50 % reduction of eGFR).452 It has been propos ed that hyperphosph atemia in non-dialysis patients stages 2-5 may reduce the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inh ibition453 or of VLPDs.454 In a post hoc observational analysis from the Ramipril E fficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, Zoccali et al. evaluated the relationships b etween serum phosph ate concentration at b aseline, dise ase progression, and response to ACE inh ibition among 331 patients with proteinuric nephropathies.453 Independent of treatment, patients wi th higher phosph ate progressed si gnificantly faster either to ES RD or to a composi te endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD compa red with patients with phosph ate levels below the medi an, and the renoprotective effect of ramipril decreased as serum phosph ate increased (P 0.008 for interaction). In another post hoc study from a non- random ized, stu dy in wh ich 99 p roteinu ric CKD patients who sequ entially underwent low- (0.3 g/kg/day) suppl emented with keto-analogues, each for periods lo nger than 1 year, Di Lorio et al. observed that 24 -h proteinuria was reduced modest ly in patients who maintain ed relative ly higher serum phosph ate levels or relative ly Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 178 higher phosph aturia to be maximal in those who achieved the lo west level of serum and urine phosph ate.454 Mortality In observational studies involv CKD patients, the associ ations of di etary phosphorus int ake on mort ality are mixed, impacted by residual con founding and probably pointing to a null associ ation. Th ree studies evaluated the cross-sectional associ ation between me asures of dietary phosphorus and CKD.451, 455, Murt augh et al.455 evaluated the association between 24-h dietary recall estimation of ph osphorus int ake in particip ants with e GFR<60 m l/min/1.73m2 from the community-based U.S survey National Health and Nut rition E xamination Survey III, and observed no association betw een dietary phosphorus and mort ality. Palomino et al. examined myocardial infarction patients from the Heart and Soul Study, the majo rity of which with norm al kidney function, and obs erved no associ ation between higher urinary phosph involved gy referred patients with CKD from the M DRD stu dy and failed to obs erve in MHD patients that examined the associ ation between dietary phosph ate (as estimated from 3-day food recalls) and mort ality.457 Patients with h igher dietary phosph orus intake ated risk (p-trend across te rtiles=0.04). Lynch et al.458 explored the b etween prescribed dietary phosphorus restriction a nd mort ality in a post hoc analysis of the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, which includ ed 1751 MHD patients. exposure was ascertained by the serum pho sphate targets that the dietitians from the clinical dialysis centers settled annually to prescribe their dietary recommendations. A more restrictive p rescribed dietary phosph ate was associated with poo rer indi ces of nutritional status on baseline analyses and a persistently greater need for nutritional suppl ement ation but not longitudinal changes in caloric or protein in take. There was a stepwise trend tow ard greater surviv al with more liberal phosph ate prescription, which reached statistical significance among subjects prescribed 1001 to 2000 mg/d and those with no sp ecified phosp hate restriction: hazard ratios (95% CIs) 0.73 and (0.55 respectively. Guid eline on Page hatemia in k idney transplant patients: Hypophosp hatemia is a relative ly common complication after kidn ey transplantation, esp ecially during the first months, and ibly leading alacia and ost eodystrop hy. pathogen esis has been attributed to increased renal phosph ate excretion due to elevated levels of phosphaturic hormon es, the effect of glucocorticoid, pe rsistent elevated PTH l evels, subopt imal recovery of vitamin D activation, and imbalance in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).459-461 It has been propos ed that dietary intensific ation of phosphorus can solve complication; one small r andom ized controll ed trial154 examined diet ary phosphorus suppl ement ation by means of a neutral phosp hate salt (disodium phosph ate) in patients with early post-transplantation hypophosph atemia. The authors obs erved that, suppl ement adenosine triphosph ate in the mus cles and the acid excretion capacity of the kidney. No adverse effects on serum calcium and P TH concentrations w ere noted du ring intervention. The serum phosph ate level be consid ered in these patients or the dose of replacement to be given is, how ever, not well studied, and should be decided based on patient ne eds and clinical judgment. Implementation considerations Recommendations to low er dietary phosph orus intake in patients with CKD have been met with concerns, often relating to the risk of limiting the intake of oth er nutrients, p articularly protein, which is the main sour ce of phosphate in the di et.458, 462, 463 These concerns are particularly relevant to patients treated with dia lysis because of protein losses in di alysate and greater protein catabolism f rom hypermetabolic stress.205 Dietary couns elling that includ es information on not on ly the amount of phosph ate but also on the source of protein from which the phosph ate derives and sug gestion on methods of cooking phosph ate-rich foods can achieve phosphorus int ake without compromising dietary quality or protein status.464 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 180 Advise choosing natural foods that are lower in b ioavailable phosphorus. Anima l- and plant -based foods contain the o rganic form of phosph ate. While animal-based phosph ate is absorb ed in the GI tract by 40-60%, the absorption of plant -based phosphorus is lower (20-50%).465 In line with this, a small c rossover trial including CKD patients' st age 4 found that a 7-day vegetarian diet led to low er serum phosph ate lev els and decreased FGF23 lev els than a 7-day meat-based diet.185 Furthermore, foods with only organic phospho rus typically are more nutri ent dense and have a higher nutritional value compared with processed foods containing phosph ate additives, which tend to h ave a lower nutritional valu e, and are often paired with sodium and potassium additives.466 Advise choosing commercial food items prepar ed without phosphoru s-containing food add itives. Phosphorus additives are increasingly being added to pro cessed and fast foods to pr eserve moisture or color, to emuls ify ingredients and enhance flavor, and to stabil ize foods. Phosphorus additives contain, how ever, ino rganic phosphorus with a close to 100% intestinal abso rption.464, 465 Meat and poult ry products that report the use of additives h ave an average phosp hate-protein ratio much hi gher than additive-free used phosphorus additives in food indust ry can be found, for instance, in bakery prod ucts, enhanced meats, and p rocessed cheeses.467 Advise choosing natural foods that have low amount of organic phosph orus v ersus high amount of protein. The content of organic phosphorus p er gram of p rotein varies wid ely among foods. Nutri ent composit ion tabl es reporti ng on phosphorus/prot ein ratio content can be used to r ecommend food substitutions that can consid erably reduce the daily intake of organic phosphorus while ensuring adequate dietary protein intake.465, 468 -470 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 181 Advise pr eparing foods at hom e, using w et coo king methods su ch as boil ing (and discard the wat er). These methods are able to remove about 50% of phosp horus content from foods .471, 472 Slicing the m eat prior to boiling and the use of a pressure cooker has been shown more effective in terms of achieved protein to ph osphorus content.471 At the s ame ti me, these methods m ay remove oth er min erals (e.g. potassiu m) of concern for patients with CKD.473 Such practices, how ever, result in reduced palatability and texture of the food. The work group emphas izes to individualize recommendations after appropriate evaluation of the p atient dai ly intake. It requires nutrition expertise (preferably consultation wi th a renal dietitian) and should take into consid eration culturally appropriate food substitutions. Nutrition al couns elling sessions shou ld evolve, from the simple concept of phosph ate restriction to oppo rtunities of educating the patient on d ifferentiation between organic and inorganic sources of ph osphate and avoidance of phosph ate additives.124 Simple educational programs on how to read food labels and look for phosph ate additives p roved to be su ccessful in helping dialysis patients reduce their serum ph osphate levels.449, 450 A meta-analysis suggested t hat nutrition al couns elling based on a structured behavioral change are, in general, successful in controlli ng hyperphosph atemia in t hese patients.124 In this meta -analysis, however, only about half of the studies were random ized controll ed interventions with a short duration ranging from 1 to 6 mon ths, whi ch calls for a need of mo re dedicated lo ng-term interventional stud ies on this topic. Future research Dietary management of phosphorus is an import ant strategy for serum phosph ate control in CKD. Ho wever, as compared to the many studies exploring pharmacological management of this electrolyte disord er (e.g. use of phosph ate binde rs), the amount of evidence on the effectiveness of die tary control is low. The workgroup recommends future studies to b etter define the effect of this s imple and cost-effective strategy. Examples of still unanswered questions are: Study if diet ary phospho rus restricti on is able to no rmalize serum phosph ate levels in PD patients. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 182 Research if diet ary phos phorus intake level is associated with wo rse clinical outcomes such as cardiov ascular events, prog ression of kidney disease or m ortality.

Dietary Potassi um in Hyperkalemia 6.4.2 In adults with CKD 3-5D and post-transplant who exhibit hy perkalemia, it is reasonable to consid er lowering dietary potassium intake as a therapeutic strategy (OPINION). Potassi um Intake for Hyperkalemia or Hy post-transplant (OPINION) with either or hypokalemia, we suggest that dietary or suppl emental potassium intake be based on a n eeds and clinician As the main in tracellular cation potassium plays a major role medi ating cellular electrophysiology, vascular function and BP, and neuromus cular function. High or low serum potassium levels have been associ ated with muscular weakness, hypertension, v entricular arrhythmias, and death. The influ ence of dietary potassium consumpt ion on serum potassium content is therefore of great clin ical relevance. Because the m echanisms involved in potassium homeostasis and excretion (i. e. adrenergic system, insulin, aldost erone, and urinary clearance) are commonly impaired in patients with CKD and ESRD hyperkalemia is an especially salient concern. Dietary potassium is the focus of these recommendations (potassium binders were outside the scope of the current guideline). Detailed Justification There is a scarcity of studies on this top ic and we found no clinical trials on how modi fying diet can influ ence serum potassium in patients wi th CK D. The work group emphasi zes that factors oth er than diet ary intake influ ence serum potassium levels. These include medi cations, kidney function, hydration status, a cid-base status, glycemic control, a drenal function, a catabolic st ate, or gastrointestinal ( GI) problems l ike vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and bleeding. All these factors should be consid ered when formulating a strategy to keep the s erum Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 184 potassium within the no rmal range. The consequences of dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD are not known. Indeed, no clinical trials were identifi ed that dir ectly examined the relationship b etween diet ary potassium consumpt ion and either serum lev els or clinical outcomes. However, several studies us ed urine potassium excretion or other surrogates for dietary intake to ass ess the following outcom es. While we acknowl edge that u rine p otassium excretion m ay not n ecessarily represent dietary potassium in these patients, the studies show ed: Mortality Data on the association betw een die tary and urinary potassium excretion and mort ality in adults with CKD were mixed. A stu dy in MHD (stage 5), found that comp ared to the low est quartile of dietary potassium intake (879 mg or 22.5 mEq/24hr) as measured by the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, higher quartiles of intake were associated with a ste pwise increase in risk of 5 -year mort ality (p-trend=0.03).474 Anoth er study in pre-dialysis (Stage 2-4) ignificant associ all-cause to the highest quartile of (m ean 3600 mg or 92.1 mEq/2 4hr) persons in the three lowest quartiles h ad higher all-cause mortali ty (hazard ratio (95% of 1.53 (1.15-2.02), 1.7 (1.25-2.31), 1.71 (1.23-2.38) for quartiles 3, 2, and 1, respectively). Results remain ed sim ilar even after using time-updated average urine potassium excretion.476 CKD Progr ession Data on the association betw een uri nary potassi um excretion and CKD progression in adults with CKD were mixed. In Stage 2-4; pre-dialysis urinary potassium excretion in the highest quartile (67.1 or 2617 m g/24 h) was significantly associ ated CKD (defined as incid ent from bas eline) (1.59, 95% CI: 1.25-2.03) compared to levels in the est qua rtile (<39.4 mmol or 1541 m g/24 h) .475 In another study in Stage 2-4; pre-dialysis, baseline urinary potassium e xcretion w as not si gnificantly associ ated with k idney failure (defined as dialysis therapy or transplantation) even when using time- updated average urine potassiu m.476 Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 185 Nerve Function One random ized stu dy examined the effects of d ietary potassium restricti on on p rogression of peripheral neu ropathy in CKD patients. In 42 p atients random ized to either dietary potassium restriction vs. u sual diet (change in d ietary potassium -854 vs. -343, p =0.35), pot assium restriction w as associated with stabil ization of a neuropathy score (difference 0.4 \u00b1 2.2, p<0.01) and several other nerve-related or general health scores over 24 m onths.477 Special Discussions Research on th is top ic is complicated by the fact that potassium handling by the kidn ey will vary by disease state and CKD stage. In patients with pre-dialysis CKD the acute and chronic effects of diet ary potassium loading are not cons istent ly reflected in serum potassium levels due to comp ensatory mechanisms that are triggered to maintain ho meostasis .478-480 Research and evidence on this area is also limited b ecause of difficulties in obt aining reliable data on dietary potassium intake and absorption. Potassium binders bind potassium in the gut and prevent hyperkalemia. In theory, these medications could lead to a more liberalized diet in terms of potassium (i.e. fruits and vegetables). However, none of the pivotal trials examining potassium binders eva luated dietary potassium intake, and currently there is no known study that investigates how potassium intake should be modified when taking potassium binders. Since the focus of this guideline was dietary intake, rather than pharmacological treatments, po tassium binders were outside the scope of this guideline. Implementation considerations Potassium is wide ly distributed in foods, but the main sour ces are fruits, veg etables, legumes and nuts. As th ese foods are major sources of fiber, vitamins, mine rals and oth er important nu trients, e fforts should be m ade to avoid restricting dietary potassium. In particular reduced fib er can lead to constip ation which could lower potassium e xcretion. For th ese issues, consult the guideline sta tements on fib er and fruit/v egetable intak e. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 186 When treating hyperkalemia clinicians are advised to first t ry and identify contributing factors that can be corrected su ch as a hypoinsul inemic state or certain medications. This is true in light of the physiological benefits h igh pot assium intake may confer, such as putative antihypertensive effects.481 If hyperkalemia cannot be reversed, the next step is to identi fy the most i mportant dietary sources of pot assium by interviewing the patient and dietary recalls. Clinicians pr eferably assisted by a renal dietitian should educate patients about hyperkalemia regarding fruits, vegetables, and other foods with low potassium content that ide ally still contain hi gher levels of fiber and oth er micronut rients. Published food composi tion tables can be helpful in th is regard.482 In addition, po tassium content in vegetables can be lowered by boiling and reductions in fo od taste and palatability associ ated with this strategy can be partially improved with the use of aromatic h erbs.409,410 Future research It will be n ecessary to approach pre-dialysis and dialysis populations separately in light of the great differences in pota ssium handling. There is a need for studi es on what constitu tes an opt imal diet ary potassi um intake and how di etary potassi um intake influ ences blo od potassium content and clinical outcom es. There is a need for studies investigating optimal means of adjusting dietary potassium intake when taking potassium binders. In addition, in patients on MHD the effect of t he potassium bath con centration on cardiov ascular risk, mor tality, and oth er out comes needs fu rther elucidation. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 187 6.5 Statements on Sodium Sodium Intake and Blood Pressure 6.5.1 In adults with CKD 3-5 (no n-dialyzed) (1B), maintenance dialysis (1C), and post-transplant (1C), we recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 100 mmol/day (or <2.3 g/day) to reduce blood pr essure and improve volume control. Sodium Intake and Proteinuria 6.5.2 In adults with CKD 3-5 (no n-dialyzed), we suggest that reduced sod ium intake (100 mmol/day or <2.3 g/day) be prescribed to reduce proteinuria (2A). Sodium Intake and Dry Bo dy Weight 6.5.3 In adults with CKD 3-5D, we suggest reduced sodium intake as an adjunctive lifestyle modifi cation str ategy to achieve better volume control and a more desirable bo dy weight (2B). Rationale/Backg round Sodium is an extracellular cation ho meostasis in the body.483 Normovo lemia is maintained th rough the action of the renin-angiotensin al dosterone system. This system acts to adjust the qu antity of sodium e xcreted by the body, and thereby ECF volume and arterial BP. Excess sodium intake is excreted in the u rine and serum lev els are tightly controll ed. requiring norm al kidney and blood vess el fun ction.484 However, this system may be compro mised with excessive sodium intake, and/or in adequate excretion, which may occur with chronic kidney disease. Chronic high sodium intake may impact on a nu mber of physiological functions r elating to the vasculatu re, heart, kidn eys and sympat hetic nervous system .485 Excessive sodium intake is thou ght to exert toxic effects on blood vess els through medi ating factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.486 Of particular interest in CKD is the role of sodium r eduction in improving the ph armacological effect of antihypertensive m edication thereby the lation, shor t-term intervention studies show si gnificant reductions in BP (hypertensive su bgroup, reductions of 5.8 mm Hg systolic BP and 2.82 m mHg diastolic BP) with 100 mmol/d reduction in sodium intake.487 Indications f rom a sm all number of long-Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 188 term studies (>6 mon ths) sugg est a b enefit for CV-morbidity and mort ality, although the studies w ere underpowered to adequately examine these outcom es.488 The following will explore the eviden ce within CK D. Detailed Justification Overall, the evidence for reducing sodium intake comes from random ized controll ed trials of short du ration and typically small s ample size. As a result, there is a focus on clinical markers such as BP, infl ammation, bo dy weight, fluid and proteinu ria. There is limited evaluation of h ard outcom es, whi ch thereby rely upon obs ervational evid ence. In addition, the certainty of eviden ce for sodium r eduction is l imited by imprecision and risk of bias, particularly selection, attribution and performance bias. Five randomized controll ed trials, 1 p arallel489 and 4 cross-over studies490-493 examined the effects of reduced die tary sodium intake in CKD (Stage 2 to 5, no n-dialysis). The cross- over stud ies utilized suppl ement al ium491-493 or provided m eals490 on the b ackground of a low sodium d iet to generate consistent intake in the high (180 mmol to 200m mol/d, with ~100-120m mol/d suppl ement ed) vs low sodium in take group (placebo, to tal 50 to 0 m mol sodium p er day). The parallel RCT was the lo ngest study duration (six months) conducted in a sample of Bangladeshi immigrants in the UK (n=48).489 Participants w ere random ized to a t ailored intervention including cooking classes modi fying traditional cultural recipes together with regular telephone calls with a di etitian. From a baseline sodium intake of approximately 260m mol, the intervention group achieved 138m mol/day (a reduction of over 120mmol), whilst usual care stayed largely stable (to 247 m mol/d). Two more recent studies build upon th is eviden ce base and include a parallel494 and a crossov er trial.495 Meulem an and cted month open-label RCT, n =138 adults with CK D, hypertension, and high urin ary sodium e xcretion (120 mmo l/day).494 The intervention fo cused on s elf-management advice to reduce sodium (goal <100mmo l/day) and BP monitorin g, or usual care. In the most recent cross-over trial, Saran et al. evaluated the effect of sodium r estriction <2 g/day vs us ual diet for 4 weeks (with a 2-week washout in- between) in Stage 3 and 4 CK D.495 This study improved upon previous cross-over trials as it used diet ary couns elling, rather than sodium suppl ement ation, to difference Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 189 between usu al and sodium r estrict ed intakes. Four trials were condu cted in the mainten ance dialysis population. One RCT in p eriton eal dialysis (PD),496 and two RCTs in MHD497, 498 and one non-randomized trial in both PD and MHD.499 In the MHD study, there was no significant reduction in BP.498 The difference with this study, compa red to all others in dia lysis, is that dietary prescription (rather than suppl ement al sod ium) was used to achieve a modest reduction of intake (goal 34 mmol/d lower than usu al intake). This compa res to the other interventions in mainten ance dialysis using sodium supplem entation, which achieved a much larger gradient of difference in sodium intake between low and hi gh intake groups (100m mol.d or 2.3g sodium d ifference). One RCT was und ertaken in patients post kidney transplantation .500 This was a parallel RCT of a 12-week intervention that included couns elling by a dietitian for a target intake of 80- 100m mol/day compa red with usu al care. This trial demonstr ated a significant reduction in sodium intake in the intervention group (from 19 0\u00b175 m mol/d to 106\u00b148 mmol/d) through dietary couns elling, with no si gnificant change in the usual care group (191\u00b1117 m mol/d to 237\u00b1113 m mol/d) In the vast majority of trials, the target sodium r estriction w as 80-100 m mol/day (or 2- 2.3g/day). However, there was a lack of consensus as to wh at constitu tes a high sodium intake, whi ch was either based on usu al intake, or provid ing suppl ement al sod ium to ensu high sodium intake, around 200m mol or 4g sodium p er day. Mortality, CKD Progression and Cardio vascular Ev ents There is insufficient evidence to make a statement on reduced sodium intake and kidn ey disease progression, mort ality and cardiov ascular events. The evidence for clinical endpoints is derived from ob servational studies as there were no RCTs in sodium reduction in CKD that reported CKD progression cardiov ascular events, mort ality outcom es. This is attribu table to the small sample sizes and the long est trial duration only six months.489 The post-hoc analysis of two obs ervational coho rt studies show ed mixed results invest igating Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 190 the associ ation between sodium intake (measured by dietary recall) and subsequent mortality in MHD501 and PD patients.502 The retrosp ective cohort stu dy in 303 PD patients in Japan indicated th at low sodium in take was significantly associated with h igher overall and cardiov ascular mo rtality. However, this study was open to indication bias as sodium intake was also associ ated with higher LBM , younger age and higher BMI. In contrast, in a post-hoc analysis of a prospective cohort of 1770 MHD patients, McCausland et al. found hi gher dietary sodium intake associ ated with increased mor tality.501 More consistent r esults were demonstr ated from a large high-quality prospective cohort (CRIC stu dy) of predialysis Stage 2-4, using urinary sodium e xcretion. In He et al. 24-hour urinary sodium w mortali as or halving of eGFR as CVD (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke).503 Blood pressure Overall, sodium r eduction probably reduces BP in kidney disease (mod erate certainty eviden ce). This evid ence review s mall (n=20 to n=52) random ized clinical trials (6 were cross-over trials) of short du ration (1 week to 6 months), evaluating the effect on reducing sodium intake (typically to a l evel of <2g or 90mmol/d) on BP. In fact, lower sodium in take significantly decreased systolic BP in all but one study,498 which reduced intake by only 34mmol/d, compa red with >90 mmo l/d from the other trials. How ever, the certainty of eviden ce was limited by risk of bias, p articularly risk of s election, attribution and performance bias. When evaluating the eviden ce across s tages of CK D, the v ast amount of eviden ce exists in pr e-dialysis CKD, however the BP benefits w ere also ap parent in trials in dialysis496, 498, 499, 504and transplantation popu lations.500 Althou gh this review was unable to d erive a summa ry estimate, a Cochrane review on this top ic published in 2015 show ed diet ary sodium r eduction (MD -105.9, 9 5% CI - 119.2 to - 92.5m mol/day) resulted in si gnificant reduction in systolic BP (MD -8.76, 95% CI -11.35 to - 3.80 mm Hg). These short-term studies showing clinically meaningful systolic BP reductions r anging from 2-12mmHg systolic rition in CKD Page 191 diastolic BP in trials one week to six months in dur ation.505 Inflam matory Markers Sodium reduction m ay make little to no dif ference to inflammation (low certainty evidence). Two RCTs, a parallel RCT in MHD ,498 and a crossover in Stage 3 and 4,491 investi gated the impact of sodium restriction on inflammation, me asured by CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha. In the Telini study there was a significant reduction in all inflammatory markers within the intervention group, how ever not reported between group differences (and no difference within control group ).498 The single crossov er study in Stage 3-4 sho wed no dif ference in inflammation compa ring hi gh and low sodium intake.491 Body weight and f luid Sodium restriction may slightly reduce body weight and total bo dy fluid in non-dialysis CKD (low certainty eviden ce). However, it is uncertain whether sodium r estricti on reduces body weight and bo dy water in dia lysis. The evidence from no n-dialysis CKD comes f rom two r andom ized-crossov er trials, one using sodium s upplem entation to compa re intake of 60-80mmol/d to 18 0-200mmol/d for 2 weeks491 together with a mo re recent investigation by Saran et al. evaluating the effect of sodium r estriction < 2g/day vs usual diet f or 4 weeks (with a 2-week washout i n-between).495 Both trials demons trated a reduction in extracellular volume. Furthermore, in mainten ance dialysis, two RCTS d emonstr ated no significant difference in bo dy weight wi th salt restriction in periton eal496 or both hemodialysis and periton eal dialysis.506 In one non-randomized study in hemodia lysis, the group advised to r estrict sodium (<3 /day) and fluid ( <1 L/d) intake demonstr ated within group decrease in interdialytic fluid gain, but there was no change in the control group, and between group difference was not si gnificant.497 Kidney function (including prot einuria) Restriction of sodi um intake may slightly reduce kidney function ma rkers of creatinine clearance490, 492, 493, 504 and eGFR507 demonstr ated in short -term cross-over trials in the st age 1-5 non -dialysis population (low certainty evidence). In the single parallel RCT ov er 6 months of sodium r estriction, de Brito-Ashu rst found no dif ference on Nut rition in CKD Page 192 inconsisten cy in results may be due to the short-term cross-over trials demons trating acute hyper filtration response to low sodium intake, compared with the longer-term parallel trial, reflecting a more clinically stable circumstance. Restriction of sodium intake may reduce proteinuria as demonstr ated in 3 random ce studies. et al. demonstr ated a reduction in prot einuria over 3 months s elf- management in tervention using a sodium intake <100m mol/d that reversed to baseline proteinuria after cessation of the dietary sodium restriction .494 In addition, in a post-hoc analyses of clinical trials (R EIN I & II) in proteinu ric patients w ith est ablished CKD h ave demonstr ated participants consuming a higher sodium d iet was associ ated with an inc reased risk of progressing to ESKD compared to a low er sodium d iet <100m mol/d.508 Implementation considerations Achievi ng a reduced sod ium intake in CKD is recommended, how ever can be particularly challenging to achieve.509 This is a result of the need to nav igate a complex interplay between ind ividual food choice and food supp ly, together with a range of other dietary recommendations th at come with CKD. As sodium is consumed l argely from pro cessed foods, the World Health Organization has initiatives for reducing sodium cont ent in manu factured foods among the top priorit ies to combat non- communicable dis eases.510Consuming a low sodium d iet generally requires education and skill development (cookin g, label reading) and explicit choice to consume a low sodium d iet. Th erefore, a concerted and mu lti- faceted inte rvention str ategy is required chievi ng this intake in clin ical practice. This includes t argeting individual b ehavior change for dietary choices, together with a wider public health strate gy to reduce availability of sodium in the food supp ly.510 The interventions und ertaken in clin ical trials of sodium reduction have limited applicability when translating into practice. Many trials to date have used sodium suppl ement ation or provided foods to enhance adherence in shor t-term effectiveness studies.510 Investigations of efficacy and behavioral interventions to Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 193 adopt low sodium in takes in r eal-life settings a re limited in the li terature. Of those that exist, the eviden ce is either short te rm (< 6 months) or demonstr ate that achieving a reduced sodium intake is on ly apparent whi lst receiving active intervention.494 The challenge for the future is to dev elop an evidence-base to inform suc cessful strategies to support lon g-term adherence to dietary sodium reduction. Issues with sodium intake assessm ent: Measuring sodium intake and the reby accurately evaluating adherence to recommendations is extremely challenging in practice. Sodium in take can be measured in objective (urine collection over 24 hours or spot sample) and self-report (dietary recall) or a combination of methods. U rinary sodium e xcretion as a sur rogate measure of intake assumes 1) a stable intake reflected in a sin gle 24hour collection, 2) sodium e xcretion is a direct reflection of intake. It is this latter assumption whi ch has been recently challenged by Titze and colleagues, who have identifi ed a sodium s torage pool in the skin and a wide dispa rity between sodium intake and excretion day to day.511 Increasing the number of 24 -hour urinary collections m ay improve the accuracy to partially overcome these concerns, h owever it is not pr actical in clin ical practice. Self-reported diet ary assessm ent methods are prone to reporting bias and can be time consuming to colle ct and require technical expertise in the analysis. A panel of m ethods is the refore recommended, as no one method is ideal to adequately assess adherence.510 Sodium r elative to po tassium intake: Recent obs evid ence suggests that the ratio of sodiu m-to-potassium intake may be as important, if not more i mportant than lower sodium intake alone in CK D.475 This is the p remise of the DASH- Sodium trial, and h as demonstrated b enefits in the general popu lation, with sodium r eduction providing additive b enefit in BP reduction to the DASH diet.512 In hypertensive adults, pos t-hoc analysis of clinical trials ind icate sodiu m-to-potassium r atio may be more effective in lowering BP than lowering sodium or in creasing potassium as single interventions.513 However, there are unknown safety aspects in CK D, particularly with the risk of hyperkalemia. Investigating the relative benefit of sodium r eduction compa red to po tassium intake is beyond t he scope of the current guidelines ho wever warrants fu rther research. Ev idence for Potassium recommendations is addressed within these guidelines. Guid eline on Nut rition in CKD Page 194 Currently, there is too much uncertainty in the evidence to advice on the effectiveness of sodium restriction based on specific thresholds of proteinuria. However, this intervention appears to be effective over a large range of proteinuria. Future research Clinical trials to investi gate behavioral interventions, uti lizing approa ches that are patient-centered and su pport the adoption of long-term strategies for reducing sodium intake. In the d esign of behavioral interventions, in corporating less p rocessed foods, including cooking skills, lab el reading, and provision of interventions whi ch tailor to a range of lit eracy levels. Clinical trials investi gating the safety and effectiveness of low sodium relative to increased potassium intake on CVD and CKD outcomes.
