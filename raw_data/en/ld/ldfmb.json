Many people ask, how does Acupuncture work? While Acupuncture has been scientifically proven to be effective in treating maladies ranging from pain to seasonal allergies to insomnia, the mechanisms by which it works are still subject to debate and may be described differently by different providers. The simplest answer, from a modern Western medical perspective, is that tiny Acupuncture needles (less than 1/10th the size of a sewing needle) inserted into the skin promote blood circulation to targeted areas. This in turn activates your body's immune and nervous systems, reducing inflammation and releasing endorphins to alleviate pain. Acupuncture is rooted in a history that spans more than 2,000 years, and Eastern-based practitioners would probably describe Acupuncture's effectiveness differently. Acupuncture helps to correct imbalances in the body caused by external factors such as stress, toxins, and injury. Once restored to proper balance, the body can better heal itself. Acupuncture Tools Acupuncture Small hair-thin needles are inserted into specific points of the body to activate the nervous system and promote blood flow. Chinese Herbs Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs are prescribed to support the healing process. Cupping Therapy Through a suction technique, glass cups are placed on the body in specific areas to separate the muscles and fascia to promote blood flow and to release toxins in areas of distress. Moxibustion The Chinese herb Ai Ye (mugwort) is burned over acupuncture points to stimulate their functionality and improve circulation. Gua Sha A tool is used to scrape and stimulate specific areas of the body to improve circulation and break up scar tissue. Infrared Therapy Infrared lamps (heat therapy) are used in conjunction with treatment to increase circulation and support the healing process. Electrical Stimulation Certain points might receive a small electrical stimulation to help reset your muscles and support neurological conditions.

Frequently Asked Questions [How long does it take for Acupuncture to work?](#) Benefits are often felt immediately after the first treatment, although the best results are cumulative (as Acupuncture builds on itself as the body returns to a state of health). As treatment progresses, so too does the length of time that its effects last. [How often will I need to come in?](#) Frequency of treatment is dependent on the nature and severity of your condition. Our practitioners are happy to meet with you for a free 15-minute consultation to assess your individual situation and offer a suggested course of treatment. [What does Acupuncture feel like? Does it hurt?](#) Acupuncture needles are sterile and as thin as a human hair. They are used only once then disposed of. Most insertions are completely painless, although sometimes patients experience a mild sensation that only lasts a brief moment. Many patients are surprised to find treatments to be very pleasurable, often bringing them into a state of deep relaxation. [Is acupuncture covered by insurance?](#) Our Acupuncturists are currently in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna insurance. If your plan provides coverage for Acupuncture out of network, we are more than happy to verify your coverage details for you and provide you with all of the documentation needed to submit to your carrier for reimbursement.
