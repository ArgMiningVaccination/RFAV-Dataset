The Growing and Harvesting of Banyan's Guduchi Banyan's guduchi is sourced from plants that are cultivated on three different farms, all based in the Northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. The vines are grown on neem trees and other boundary trees on the farms, which create an ideal environment for the plants to thrive. The farmers plant the guduchi roots near an existing tree, and being a natural climber, it takes care of the rest by itself. After one and a half to two years, the stem has matured and is ready to harvest. At this point, the entire stem is cut, and the roots are left to regrow for the next season. The harvested stems are chopped into smaller pieces and naturally sun-dried. Sustainability of Guduchi Because we cultivate our own plants, there are no sustainability concerns for our guduchi. However, this doesn't necessarily apply to all guduchi on the market. Because of commercial demand, there could be sustainability issues in the future for other sources of guduchi. This is something to watch\u2014and it makes sourcing transparency all the more important. As a part of a larger conversation regarding the [sustainability of Ayurvedic herbs](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/blog-the-banyan-insight/details/why-sustainability-matters-to-the-future-of-ayurveda/), it is important to understand where and how plants are grown and harvested. We ensure sustainability by sourcing botanicals that are either cultivated and harvested on privately owned, organic farms, or are harvested from legal wild-craft sourcing. Our herbs and ingredient-producing plants are harvested at optimal times, using environmentally [sustainable practices](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/farms-sourcing/sustainably-sourced/) sensitive to the long-term health of the plants.
