History: Effective May 1, 1994; amended effective July 1, 1996; September 1, 2000: July Law Implemented: NDCC 38-08-04 43-02-03-15. Bond and transfer of wells. 1. Bond requirements. Prior to commencing drilling operations, any person who proposes to drill a well for oil, gas, or injection shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond in a form approved by the commission, conditioned as provided by law. The operator of such well shall be the principal on the bond covering the well. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. 2. Bond amounts and limitations. The bond shall be in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars when applicable to one well only. Wells drilled to a total depth of less than two thousand feet [609.6 meters] may be bonded in a lesser amount if approved by the director. When the principal on the bond is drilling or operating a number of wells within the state or proposes to do so, the principal may submit a bond conditioned as provided by law. A blanket bond covering ten wells or less shall be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars provided the bond shall be limited to no more than five of the following in aggregate and a blanket bond covering more than ten wells shall be in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, provided the bond shall be limited to no more than ten of the following in aggregate: a. A well that is a dry hole and is not properly plugged and the site is not pFopeFiy Feelaimed; aftd b. A well that is plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed: and c. A well that is abandoned pursuant to section 43-02-03-55 and is not properly plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed. 49 If this aggregate of dry holes afld abaFidOFied wells is reached, all well permits, for which drilling has not commenced, held by the principal of such bond are-suspended. No rights may be exercised under the permits until the aggregate of dry holes and abaFidoFied wells drops below the required limit, or the operator files the appropriate bond to cover the permits, at which time the rights given by the drilling permits are reinstated. A well with an approved temporary abandoned status shall have the same status as an oil, gas, or injection well. The commission may, after notice and hearing, require higher bond amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for bonds must be related to the economic value of the well or wells and the expected cost of plugging and well site reclamation, as determined by the commission. The commission may refuse to accept a bond or to add wells to a blanket bond if the operator or surety company has failed in the past to comply with statutes 8ftti.._ rules, or orders relating to the operation of wells;~ if a civil or administrative action brought by the commission is pending against the operator or surety company;~ or for other good cause. 3. Unit bond requirements. Prior to commencing unit operations, the operator of any area under unitized management shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond in a form approved by the commission, conditioned as provided by law. The operator of the unit shall be the principal on the bond covering the unit. The amount of the bond shall be specified by the commission in the order approving the plan of unitization. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. Prior to transfer of a unit to a new operator, the commission, after notice and hearing, may revise the bond amount for a unit, or in the case when the unit was not previously bonded, the commission may require a bond and set a bond amount for the unit. 4. Bond terms. The bond herein required shall be conditioned upon full compliance with North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-08, and all administrative rules and orders of the commission. It shall be a plugging bond, as well as a drilling bond, and is to endure up to and including approved plugging of all oil, gas, and injection wells as well as dry holes. Approved plugging shall also include practical reclamation of the wel.l site and appurtenances thereto. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, then the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. 5. Transfer of wells under bond. Transfer of property does not release the bond. In case of transfer of property or other interest in the well and the principal desires to be released from the bond covering the well, 50 such as producers, not ready for plugging, the principal should proceed as follows: a. The principal must notify the director, in writing, of all proposed transfers of weH wells at least thirty days before the closing date of the transfer. The director may, for good cause, waive the this requirement of at least thirty days' notice prior to transfer. The principal shall submit to the commission a form 15 reciting that a certain well, or wells, describing each well by quarter-quarter, section, township, and range, is to be transferred to a certain transferee, naming such transferee, for the purpose of ownership or operation. The date of assignment or transfer must be stated and the form signed by a party duly authorized S'O to sign. On said transfer form the transferee shall recite the following: \"The transferee has read the foregoing statement and does accept such transfer and does accept the responsibility of such well under the transferee's one-well bond or, as the case may be, does accept the responsibility of such wells under the transferee's blanket bond, said bond being tendered to or on file with the commission.\" Such acceptance must likewise be signed by a party authorized S'O to sign and the transferee's surety. b. When the commission has passed upon the transfer and acceptance and accepted it under the transferee's bond, the transferor shall be released from the responsibility of plugging the well and site reclamation. If such wells include all the wells within the responsibility of the transferor's bond, such bond will be released by the commission upon written request. Such request must be signed by an officer of the transferor or a person authorized to sign for the transferor. The director may refuse to transfer any well from a bond if the well is in violation of a statute. rule ... or order eHI;e commission. c. The transferee (new operator) of any oil, gas, or injection well shall be responsible for the plugging and site reclamation of any such well. For that purpose the transferee shall submit a new bond or, in the case of a surety bond, produce the written consent of the surety of the original or prior bond that the latter's responsibility shall continue. This section shall apply to transfers of any such wells made prior to the effective date of this section as well as thereafter. The original or prior bond shall not be released as to the plugging and reclamation responsibility of any such transferor until the transferee shall submit to the commission an acceptable bond to cover such well. All liability on bonds shall continue until the 51 plugging and site reclamation of such wells is completed and approved. 6. Treating plant bond. Prior to the commencement of operations, any person proposing to operate a treating plant must submit to the . commission and obtain its approval, of a surety, or cash bond conditioned as provided by law. The person responsible for the operation of the plant shall be the principal on the bond. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. The amount of the bond must be as prescribed in section 43-02-03-51. It is to remain in force until the operations cease, all equipment is removed from the site, and the site and appurtenances thereto are reclaimed, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, then the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. 7. Bond termination. The commission shall, in writing, advise the principal and any sureties on any bond as to whether the plugging and reclamation is approved. If approved, liability under such bond may be formally terminated upon receipt of a written request by the principal. The request must be signed by an officer of the principal or a person authorized to sign for the principal. 8. Director's authority. The director is vested with the power to act for the commission as to all matters within this section.

Application for permit to drill and recomplete. Before any person shall begin any well-site preparation for the drilling of any well other than surveying and staking, such person shall file an application for permit to drill {form 1) with the director, together with a permit fee of one hundred dollars. Verbal approval may be given for site preparation by the director in extenuating circumstances. No drilling activity shall commence until such application is approved and a permit to drill is issued by the director. Permits to drill or recomplete may contain such terms and conditions as the director deems necessary. The application must be accompanied by the bond pursuant to section 43-02-03-15 or the applicant must have previously filed such bond with the commission, otherwise the application is incomplete. An incomplete application received by the commission has no standing and will not be deemed filed until it is completed. 52 The application for permit to drill shall be accompanied by an accurate plat certified by a registered surveyor showing the location of the proposed well with reference te the nearest lines of a governmental section. The plat shall also include latitude and longitude of the proposed well location to the nearest hundredth tenth of a second. Information to be included in such application shall be the proposed depth to which the well will be drilled, estimated depth to the top of important markers, estimated depth to the top of objective horizons, the proposed mud program, the proposed casing program, including size and weight thereof, the depth at which each casing string is to be set, and the proposed amount of cement to be used, including the estimated top of cement. The director may request additional information, if deemed necessary. Prior to the commencement of recompletion operations or drilling horizontally in the existing pool, an application for permit shall likewise be filed with the director. Included in such application shall be the notice of intention (form 4) to reenter a well by drilling horizontally. deepening ... or plugging back to any source of supply other than the producing horizon in an existing well. Such notice to recomplete any weH shall include the name and file number and exact location of the well, the approximate date operations will begin, the proposed recompletion procedure, the estimated completed total depth, the casing program to be followed, and the original total depth and the total depth at \u00b7which the w\u00b7ell is to be recompleted with a permit fee of fifty dollars. The director may request additional information, if deemed necessary. The applicant shall provide all information. in addition to that specifically required by this section. if requested by the director. The director may impose such terms and conditions on the permits issued under this section as the director deems necessary. The director shall deny an application for g_ permit to drill if a vvell drilled in the location applied for under this section if the proposal would cause, or tend to cause, waste or violate correlative rights. The director of oil and gas shall state in writing to the applicant the reason for the denial of the permit. The applicant may appeal the decision of the director to the commission. Unless a \u00b7well is drilling, or has been drilled, below surface casing on the first anniversary of the date of issuance of the permit for the well, the permit shall in all things terminate and be of no further force and effect. Recompletion operations must commence within one year of the date of approval or permission to recomplete shall terminate and be of no further force and effect. A permit to drill automatically expires one year after the date it was issued. unless the well is drilling or has been drilled below surface casing. A permit to 53 recomplete or to drill horizontally automatically expires one year after the date it was issued. unless such project has commenced.

After cementing. the casing shall be tested by application of pump pressure of at least one thousand five hundred pounds per square inch [1 0350 kilopascals]. If. at the end of thirty minutes. this pressure has dropped one hundred fifty pounds per square inch [1 035 kilo pascals] or more. the casing shall be repaired. Thereafter. the casing shall again be tested in the same manner. Further work shall not proceed until a satisfactory test has been obtained. The casing in a horizontal well may be tested by use of a mechanical tool set near the casing shoe after the horizontal section has been drilled. All flowing wells must be equipped with tubing and a tubing packer. The packer must be set as near the producing interval as practicable, but in all cases must be above the perforations.

Incremental production determination for a secondary recovery project. 1. a. In a unit where there has not been a secondary recovery project, the commission will establish a primary production decline curve. In such instance, incremental production is the production above the established primary production decline curve which production is a result of the secondary recovery project. b. The total amount of primary production from the unit will be determined by the commission through the use of a computer-generated production decline curve developed by software 73 used by the commission at the time of certification. The decline curve will be a production versus time plot. The oil production and the time 1:1sed to develop the curve will be that production occurring and period of time from the latest peak in production through the last month of oil production prior to the month in which secondary recovery project operations commence. However, the director shall have discretionary authority to select a different period of time to establish the decline curve if deemed necessary to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ultimate primary production. c. The production decline curve established in subdivision b of this subsection is projected from the end of the last month in which production was used to develop the primary decline curve to a producing rate of one barrel of oil per well per day. but no projection shall be made greater than fifty years in duration. All production above the projected decline curve is incremental production and production below the decline curve is primary production. The total projected primary production, on a monthly basis in numerical form, is derived from the projected primary production decline curve. A copy of the projected monthly primary production, in numerical form, will be furnished to the unit operator and the tax commissioner. d. For purposes of determining the primary production provided for in this subsection, where practices and procedures used by the commission cannot be used because production has been restricted due to the prolific nature of the reservoir (such as a Lodgepole reservoir), where unitization is accomplished early in the life of the reservoir, and sufficient primary production history does not exist for decline curve analysis, the commission will have the authority to determine an alternate method using fundamental reservoir engineering principles. One example the commission might use is a pressure decline versus cumulative production plot to estimate the ultimate primary production. Based on available data and reservoir characteristics an initial rate and decline percent would be extrapolated to match the estimated ultimate recovery. In this case the operating company would be required to monitor the reservoir pressure and production and coordinate all activities and measurements with the commission. 2. In a unit which commences a new secondary recovery project where a secondary recovery project was in existence prior to July 1, 1991, and the commission cannot establish an accurate production decline curve, incremental production will be determined pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision c of subsection 5 of North Dakota Century Code section 57-51.1-03. 74 3. a. In a unit which commences a new secondary recovery project where a secondary recovery project was in existence before July 1, 1991, and where the commission can establish an accurate production decline curve, incremental production is the production above the established production decline curve which production is a result of the new secondary recovery project. b. The total amount of oil that would have been produced from the unit if the new secondary recovery project had not been commenced will be determined by the commission through the use of a computer-generated production decline curve developed by software used by the commission at the time of certification . The decline curve will be a production versus time plot. The oil production and the time used to develop the curve will be that production occurring and period of time from the latest peak in production through the last month of oil production prior to the month in which the new secondary recovery project operations commence. However, the director shall have discretionary authority to select a different period of time to establish the decline curve if deemed necessary to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ultimate production that would have been produced if the new secondary recovery project had not been commenced. c. The production decline curve established in subdivision b of this subsection is projected from the end of the last month in which production was used to develop the decline curve to a producing rate of one barrel of oil per well per day. All production above the projected decline curve is incremental production and production below the decline curve is production which would have occurred in the absence of the new secondary recovery project. The total projected production below the curve, on a monthly basis in numerical form, is derived from the projected production decline curve. A copy of the projected monthly production below the curve, in numerical form, will be furnished to the unit operator and the tax commissioner . 4. The commission will hold a hearing to establish a decline curve and a projection of the curve from which incremental production can be determined. At the hearing the project operator of a secondary recovery project or a new secondary recovery project must introduce evidence regarding the work proposed or accomplished which will result in incremental production, and evidence showing that the project is a qualifying project. Application for the hearing may, at the discretion of the project operator, be made prior or subsequent to the commencemen t 75 of a secondary recovery project or commencement of a new secondary recovery project.

An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or benefits under this chapter must show that a desire to receive medicaid or benefits under this chapter played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 3. The fact, if it is a fact, that the person individual would be eligible for medicaid or benefits under this chapter had the person's individual's spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or benefits under this chapter. 5. If the transferee of any income or asset is the child, grandchild, brother, sister, niece, nephew, parent, or grandparent of the person individual or the person's individual's spouse, services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the person individual or the person's individual's spouse may not be treated as consideration for the transferred income or asset unless the transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services. 6. A transfer is complete when the person individual, or the person's individual's spouse, making the transfer has no lawful means of undoing the transfer or requiring a restoration of ownership. 7. For purposes of this section: a. Fair market value is received: (1) In the case of an asset not subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, such as cash, bank deposits, stocks, and fungible commodities, when one hundred percent of apparent fair market value is received; (2) In the case of an asset subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, when seventy-five percent of estimated fair market value is received; and (3) In the case of income, when one hundred percent of apparent fair market value is received. b. \"Uncompensated value\" means the difference between fair market value and the value of any consideration received. 212 8. This section is applicable to all transfers whenever made. History: Effective May 1, 1995: amended effective June 1. purposes of this chapter: 1.

Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is to define the requirements imposed on taxpayers for the maintenance and retention of books. records. and other sources of information. It is also the purpose of the regulation to address these requirements where all or a part of the taxpayer's records are received. created. maintained. or generated through various computer. electronic. and imaging processes and systems. History: Effective June 1. 2002. General Authority: NDCC 28-32-02 Law Implemented: NDCC 57-01-02 81-01.1-04-02. Definitions.

History: Effective June 1. 2002. General Authority: NDCC 57-01-02 81-01.1-04-03. Recordkeeping requirements -General. 1:. A taxpayer shall maintain all records that are necessary to a determination of the correct tax liability under North Dakota Century Code title 57. All required records must be made available on request by the tax commissioner or its authorized representative. Such records shall include any original and nonidentical copy of any communication or other transmission of information that has been reduced by any means into any tangible form or medium or is electronically stored information. including written. electronic. magnetic. or photographic form. of any kind or description and including all records. reports, papers. accounting schedules, books. letters, notes. memoranda. e-mail. and other correspondence. reports and recordings of telephone and other conversations. tape recordings, contracts. evaluations. ledgers, journals. books or records of accounts. summaries of accounts. desk calendars. minutes, drawings. photographs, inspection reports. test reports. diaries. notebooks. sketches. graphs, charts. and press releases. all whether in the taxpayer's possession or under the control of any other individual or entity with knowledge of the information requested. 2. If a taxpayer retains records required to be retained under this regulation in both machine-sensible and hard-copy formats. the taxpayer shall make the records available to the tax commissioner in machine-sensible format upon the tax commissioner's request. 3. Nothing in this regulation shall be construed to prohibit a taxpayer from demonstrating tax compliance with traditional hard-copy documents or 228 reproductions thereof. in whole or in part. whether or not such taxpayer also has retained or has the capability to retain records on electronic or _other storage media in accordance with this regulation. However. this subsection shall not relieve the taxpayer of the obligation to comply with subsection 2. History: Effective June 1. .L General requirements. a. Machine-sensible records used to establish tax compliance shall contain sufficient transaction-level detail information so that the details underlying the machine-sensible records can be identified and made available to the tax commissioner upon request. A taxpayer has discretion to discard duplicated records and redundant information provided its responsibilities under this regulation are met. b. At the time of an examination. the retained records must be capable of being retrieved and converted to a standard record format. c. Taxpayers are not required to construct machine-sensible records other than those created in the ordinary course of business. A taxpayer who does not create the electronic equivalent of a traditional paper document in the ordinary course of business is not required to construct such a record for tax purposes . 2. Electronic data interchange requirements. a. When a taxpayer uses electronic data interchange processes and technology. the level of record detail. in combination with other records related to the transactions. must be equivalent to that contained in an acceptable paper record. For example. the retained records should contain such information as vendor name. invoice date. product description. quantity purchased. price. amount of tax. indication of tax status. and shipping detail. Codes may be used to identify some or all of the data elements. provided that the taxpayer provides a method which allows the tax commissioner to interpret the coded information. b. The taxpayer may capture the information necessary to satisfy subdivision a at any level within the accounting system and need not retain the original EDI transaction records provided the audit 229 trail. authenticity. and integrity of the retained records can be established. For example. a taxpayer using electronic data interchange technology receives electronic invoices from its suppliers. The taxpayer decides to retain the invoice data from completed and verified EDI transactions in its accounts payable system rather than to retain the EDI transactions themselves. Since neither the EDI transaction nor the accounts payable system captures information from the invoice pertaining to product description and vendor name (i.e .. they contain only codes for that information). the taxpayer also retains other records. such as its vendor master file and product code description lists and makes them available to the tax commissioner. In this example. the taxpayer need not retain its EDI transaction for tax purposes. 3. Electronic data processing systems requirements. The requirements for an electronic data processing accounting system should be similar to that of a manual accounting system. in that an adequately designed accounting system should incorporate methods and records that will satisfY the requirements of this regulation. 4. Business process information. a. Upon the tax commissioner's request. the taxpayer shall provide a description of the business process that created the retained records. Such description shall include the relationship between the records and the tax documents prepared by the taxpayer and the measures employed to ensure the integrity of the records. b. The taxpayer shall be capable of demonstrating: ill The functions being performed as they relate to the flow of data through the system: ill The internal controls used to ensure accurate and reliable processing: and Q.l The internal controls used to prevent unauthorized addition. alteration. or deletion of retained records. c. The following specific documentation is required for machine-sensible records retained pursuant to this regulation: ill Record formats or layouts: ill Field definitions. including the meaning of all codes used to represent information: 230 .Q} File descriptions (e.g .. data set name); and .(1). Detailed charts of accounts and account descriptions. History: Effective June 1. 2002. General Authority: NDCC NDCC 57-01-02 81-01.1-04-05. Records maintenance requirements . .1. The tax commissioner recommends but does not require that taxpayers refer to the national archives and record administration's standards [36 CFR, part 1234. July 1. 1995. edition]. for guidance on the maintenance and storage of electronic records. such as the labeling of records. the location and security of the storage environment. the creation of backup copies. and the use of periodic testing to confirm the continued integrity of the records. 2. The taxpayer's computer hardware or software shall accommodate the extraction and conversion of retained machine-sensible records. History: Effective June 1. records . .1. The manner in which the tax commissioner is provided access to machine-sensible records as required in subsection 2 of section 81-01.1-04-03 may be satisfied through a variety of means that shall take into account a taxpayer's facts and circumstances through consultation with the taxpayer. 2. Such access will be provided in one or more of the following manners: a. The taxpayer may arrange to provide the tax commissioner with the hardware. software. and personnel resources to access the machine-sensible records. b. The taxpayer may arrange for a third party to provide the hardware. software. and personnel resources necessary to access the machine-sensible records. c. The taxpayer may convert the machine-sensible records to a standard record format specified by the tax commissioner. including copies of files. on a magnetic medium that is agreed to by the tax commissioner. 231 d. The taxpayer and the tax commissioner may agree on other means of providing access to the machine-sensible records. History: Effective June 1. law Implemented: NDCC 57-01-02 81-01.1-04-07. Taxpayer responsibility and discretionary authority. ~ In conjunction with meeting the requirements of section 81-0t1-04-04. a taxpayer may create files solely for the use of the tax commissioner. For example. if a data base management system is used. it is consistent with this regulation for the taxpayer to create and retain a file that contains the transaction-level detail from the date base management system and that meets the requirements of section 81-01.1-04-04. The taxpayer should document the process that created the separate file to show the relationship between that file and the original records. 2. A taxpayer may contract with a third party to provide custodial or management services of the records. Such a contract shall not relieve the taxpayer of its responsibilities under this regulation. History: Effective June 1. 2002. General Authority: NDCC 28-32-02 law Implemented: NDCC 57-01-02 81-01.1-04-08. Alternative storage media. ~ For purposes of storage and retention. taxpayers may convert hard-copy documents received or produced in the normal course of business and required to be retained under this regulation to microfilm. microfiche. or other storage-only imaging systems and may discard the original hard-copy documents. provided the conditions of this section are met. Documents that may be stored on these media include general books of account. journals. voucher registers. general and subsidiary ledgers. and supporting records of details. such as sales invoices. purchase invoices. exemption certificates. and credit memoranda. 2. Microfilm. microfiche. and other storage-only imaging systems must meet the following requirements: a. Documentation establishing the procedures for converting the hard-copy documents to microfilm. microfiche. or other storage-only imaging system must be maintained and made available on request. Such documentation must. at a minimum. contain a sufficient description to allow an original document to be followed through 232 the conversion system as well as internal procedures established for inspection and quality assurance. b. Procedures must be established for the effective identification. processing. storage. and preservation of the stored documents and for making them available for the period they are required to be retained under section 81-01.1-04-10 . c. Upon request by the tax commissioner. a taxpayer must provide facilities and equipment for reading. locating. and reproducing any documents maintained on microfilm. microfiche. or other storage-only imaging system. d. When displayed on such equipment or reproduced on paper. the documents must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. For this purpose. legibility is defined as the quality of a letter or numeral which enables the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognizable as words or complete numbers. e. All data stored on microfilm. microfiche. or other storage-only imaging systems must be maintained and arranged in a manner that permits the location of any particular record. t There is no substantial evidence that the microfilm. microfiche. or other storage-only imaging system lacks authenticity or integrity. History: Effective June 1. 2002. General Authority: recordkeeping requirements. 1.:. Except as otherwise provided in this section. the provisions of this regulation do not relieve taxpayers of the responsibility to retain hard-copy records that are created or received in the ordinary course of business as required by existing law and regulations. Hard-copy records may be retained on a recordkeeping medium as provided in section 81-01.1-04-08. 2. If hard-copy records are not produced or received in the ordinary course of transacting business (e.g .. when the taxpayer uses electronic data interchange technology). such hard-copy records need not be created. 3. Hard-copy records generated at the time of a transaction using a credit or debit card must be retained unless all the details necessary to 233 determine correct tax liability relating to the transaction are subsequently received and retained by the taxpayer in accordance with this regulation. Such details include those listed in section 81-01.1-04-04. 4. Computer printouts that are created for validation. control. or other temporary purposes need not be retained. 5. Nothing in this section shall prevent the tax commissioner from requesting hard-copy printouts in lieu of retained machine-sensible records at the time of examination.

A change of ownership includes transfer of a partnership interest, a stock interest in a subchapter S corporation ... or a membership in a limited liability company . 235 6. The income tax exemption may not be claimed by an individual taxpayer on North Dakota individual income tax form ND-1 or form 37-S. 7. A taxpayer with both exempt and nonexempt activities shall prorate its income pursuant to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code chapter 57-38.1. EXAMPLE: a. If the taxpayer has only North Dakota activity, exempt income must be determined by multiplying income from all activities, exempt and nonexempt, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of its exempt property, sales, and payroll factors and the denominator of which is three. Facts: Total North Exempt Plant Other North Dakota Activity Dakota Activity Property Payroll Sales Apportionable income Federal exempt income: (1) Compute apportionment factor of exempt activities. Property factor= $5,000,000/$15,000,000 = Payroll factor= $750,000/$1,750,000 = Sales factor= $20,000,000/$55,000,000 = (2) Compute exempt income. Apportionable income Federal tax liability 1.125540/3 = North Dakota income after federal tax deduction Apportionment factor of exempt activities the taxpayer has multistate business activity, North Dakota income must first be determined by including all exempt and nonexempt activity in apportionable income and in the apportionment factor. North Dakota exempt income is then determined as in subdivision a. 236 EXAMPLE: Multistate corporation Facts: Utilize the same facts in the prior example, and add: Total activity within and without North Dakota Property $100,000,000 Payroll $5,000,000 Sales $200,000,000 Determine North Dakota exempt income: (1) Compute the North Dakota apportionment factor, including tax-~xempt activity. Property factor= $15,000,000/ Payroll .775000/3= .258333 (2) Compute the apportionment factor of the North Dakota exempt activities. For this example, the computation would be the same as that in paragraph 1 of subdivision a and would yield a factor of .375180. (3) Compute exempt income. Apportionable income $50,000,000 North Dakota apportionment ., .258333 factor Income apportioned to North $12,916,650 Dakota before federal tax deduction Federal tax liability $17,500,000 North Dakota apportionment .258333 factor Federal tax deduction $4,520,827 North Dakota income after $8,395,823 federal tax deduction Apportionment factor of .375180 exempt activities Exempt income $3,149,945 237 c. When a partial exemption on a project or plant has been granted, the percentage of the project's nonexempt property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota taxable activity's factors. For instance, a twenty percent exemption would mean eighty percent of the project's property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota factors creating a taxable activity. d. When a company has only one operating facility which has been granted a partial exemption, North Dakota taxable income shall be computed based on total income of the operation, and a percentage of the income which is equal to the percentage of the exemption shall be deducted from the total.

If a North Dakota resident is paying income tax to more than one jurisdiction other than North Dakota, on income which is also taxed by this state, a separate computation must be made to determine the amount of the tax credit available from each jurisdiction. These separate tax credits must be added together to determine the total tax credit which may be reported on the taxpayer's North Dakota tax return. 3. A taxpayer who is a part-year resident of North Dakota may claim a credit for taxes paid to another state only if the income taxed by North Dakota and the other state was earned or received during the time the taxpayer was a North Dakota resident. A copy of the income tax return filed with the other state must be filed with the North Dakota income tax return. The tax commissioner may require a certified copy of the other state's return. 4.

An individual who moves into this state and who claims moving expenses as a deduction on that individual's federal income tax return for the year -in which the move was made may deduct those expenses for the purpose of computing North Dakota taxable income on individual income tax form ND-2 or form 37. History: Effective July 1, 1985: amended effective June 1, Implemented: NDCC husband and wife. Requiremen ts for a husband and wife who file a joint federal income tax return and who efeet are required to file separate North Dakota income tax returns include: 1. Income from nonbusiness property owned by one spouse cannot be divided between husband and wife, but must be reported only by the spouse with the ownership interest. 2. Nonbusiness income from jointly or commonly owned real estate, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, and other nonbusiness income must be reported by each spouse on the separate tax return as if their federal adjusted gross income was determined separately. Reporting of this income depends on the nature of the ownership interest and is subject to the following : a. A husband and wife owning property as joint tenants with a right of survivorship must each report one-half of the income from the property on their separate North Dakota income tax returns. b. Income from property held by husband and wife as tenants in common must be reported in proportion to their legally enforceable interests in the property. 3. Salary and wages earned by each spouse must be reported by each spouse as if their federal adjusted gross income was determined separately . Reporting of wages and salary by each spouse depends upon the nature of the employment relationship and is subject to the following: a. Wages or compensation for services or labor performed by one spouse with respect to a business or property owned by the other spouse may be reported on a separate North Dakota income tax return if the payment is reasonable for the labor or services actually performed . It is presumed that compensation or wages paid by one spouse to the other are unreasonable and disallowed for separate reporting unless a bona fide employer-employee relationsh ip exists. Evidence of the relationship includes actual services performed , 243 adherence to regular working hours and standards, and compliance with workers' compensation and unemployment compensation laws. b. Wages or compensation for services or labor performed pursuant to an employment agreement with a non spousal employer is income which may be reported only by the spouse earning the wages. 4. Business income derived from property owned by both spouses, as evidenced by recognized methods of establishing legal ownership, may be allocated between spouses and reported on separate North Dakota income tax returns. The interest of each spouse must be allocated according to the capital interest, the management and control exercised, and the services performed by each spouse according to the following rules: a. Allocation of partnership income between spouses is valid only if current partnership information returns have been filed with this state and the federal government and there has been compliance with federal self-employment laws. b. When a business is owned by a husband and wife but one spouse claims all of the income for federal self-employment tax purposes, it is assumed that the claim was made with the full consent of the other spouse. Therefore, all of the income must be claimed for North Dakota income tax purposes by the spouse claiming such income on the federal return. The presumption of consent may be overcome by presentation of evidence sufficient to negate the presumption. c. In order to determine the amount of capital contribution by each spouse, only invested capital which is legally traceable to each spouse is considered. Capital existing under the right, domain, and control of one spouse which is invested in the business is presumed to be a capital contribution of that spouse. Sham transactions that do not effect any real change in ownership of capital between spouses are disregarded in determining capital contribution of the recipient spouse. d. Contribution to management and control of the business must be substantial to be given weight in allocating income. Substantial participation involves legitimate consultation with respect to major business decisions, familiarity with the operations, problems, and policies of the business, and sufficient background and maturity to understand the various demands of the business. General statements as to family discussions are insufficient to demonstrate consultation. 244 e. Services which make a direct contribution to the business are given weight in determining the proper allocation of income between spouses. Services performed for the family are not considered rendered for the benefit of the business.

To determine \u00b7whether oil has been reported at its fair market value, the commissioner will compare the reported value of the oil with the price prevailing for comparable oil in the field in which the oil \u00b7was produced. If purchases of oil in a field are limited to or dominated by a single purchaser, the commissioner may test the reasonableness of the reported value by comparing it with the price of 295 comparable oil in other fields in the state. The commissioner may also use any other method 'Nhich is reasonable to determine \u00b7whether the reported value is indicative of fair market value, including, but not limited to, comparing the reported 'v'alue with the oil's value upon disposition at downstream points. To determine whether gas has been reported at its fair market value, the commissioner may use a workback methqd, a comparable sales method, or any other method which \u00b7would reasonably ascertain fair market value at the time of production. In applying the workback method, reasonable expenses incurred in gathering and processing the gas, excluding hoovever any expenses relating to exempt gas products that are returned to the lease, \u00b7will be deducted from the market value of the gas products derived ffom the wet gas and the resulting value 'Nill be compared to the reported gas value. In applying the comparable sales method, the reported gas value w\u00b7ill be compared to the sales value of comparable gas in the field in which the gas was produced. If purchases of gas in a field are limited to or dominated by a single purchaser, the commissioner may test the reasonableness of the reported value by comparing it \u00b7with the price of comparable gas in other fields in the state. If the commissioner determines pursuant to any reasonable method that the reported value of oil or gas is not equivalent to fair market value, an assessment \u00b7vo\u00b7ill be levied for additional tax on the basis of the fair market value of the oil or gas. This rule is only effective for taxable periods prior to July 1, 1991. History: Effective March 1, 1990; amended effective June 1, 1992. Authority: Condensate recovered from a gas stream. 1. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: a. \"Condensate\" means all liquid hydrocarbons recovered from a gas stream in a gathering system after the custody transfer meter but before processing at a gas plant. Condensate is otherwise referred to as\"pigging liquids\", \"drip\". b. \"Gross value\" of condensate at the point of recovery means the price paid under an arm's length contract for the sale of oil as defined in North Dakota Century Code section 57-51-02.3. c. \"Processing\" means any process designed to remove elements or compounds, hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons, from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes that normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural 296 pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression are not considered processing. 2. Gross value at the well includes the value of condensate from associated and nonassociated production. There may be deducted from the gross value of condensate certain costs incurred to recover the condensate from a gas stream after the custody transfer meter. Effective January 1, 1995, the costs of recovery must be calculated and deducted from the gross value of condensate under either of the following methods: a. By multiplying fifteen percent times the gross \u00b7value of the condensate, as using a gross value that is finally determined by the commissioner. This method establishes conclusively the costs of recovery of the condensate from a gas stream; or b. By using reasonable actual costs incurred to recover the condensate from a gas stream after the custody transfer meter. Actual costs do not include proceeds retained under a gas sales or gas . processing agreement between a producer and a purchaser or processor. If the method under this subdivision is elected, the costs of recovery must be fully substantiated upon request and are subject to audit by the commissioner. The value of condensate is included in gross value regardless of the point at which it is recovered. This includes condensate recovered at the lease site, gas gathering lines, compressor station, and inlet separator of a processing plant. The commissioner shall review the cost of recovery methods under subdivisions a and b of subsection 2 after the cost of recovery provision has been in effect for two years.

An oil purchaser that has realized a volume gain resulting from differing measurements of the oil-; must report and pay tax on the volume gain. An oil purchaser that has incurred a volume loss resulting from differing measurements of the oil-; may utilize the volume loss on a first-in first-out basis to offset a volume gain in subsequent periods as follows: e-: Fer a volume less carried ferovard after December 31, 1996, an oil purchaser may utilize the less te offset a gain at any trunl<line measurement point. A volume less carried forward . after 297 December 31, 1996, must be utilized on a first in-first out basis before January 1, 2000. lT. For a volume loss \"<Vhich is incurred after December 31, 1996, an_. An oil purchaser may utilize the loss to offset a gain at another trunkline measuring point. A volume loss which is incurred after December 31, 1996, may be carried forward for three years after the due date of the return for the production month in which the loss was incurred. 2. The amount of volume gain and volume loss must be calculated for each month and reported. The amount of volume gain must be reported on the oil return in the month succeeding production. 3. A volume gain or volume loss is calculated by subtracting the total amount of oil received by the purchaser as measured at the well from the total amount of oil delivered by the purchaser as measured at the trunkline. If this calculation results in a positive number, there is a volume gain. If this calculation results in a negative number, there is a volume loss. A volume gain or loss may be adjusted for a volume gain or loss attributable to production outside North Dakota. 4. A volume gain cannot be decreased and a volume loss cannot be increased by oil lost due to spillage, leakage, fire, theft, or any other event resulting in a physical Joss of oil.

Method for calculating the tax rate on gas. The gas tax rate for fiscal years beginning July 1, 1992, and subsequent years, will be calculated by the following method: 1. An annual average of the gas fuels producer price index, commodity code 05-3, as published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, will be calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly gas fuels producer price index for January through December of the previous calendar year by the denominator of twelve, with the resultant rounded to one place after the decimal. 2. The gas base rate adjustment will be calculated by dividing the annual average of the gas fuels price index by the denominator of 75.7, with the resultant rounded to six places after the decimal. 3. The gas tax rate will be calculated by multiplying $.04 times the gas base rate adjustment ... with the resultant rounded to four places after the decimal.

If the purchase of oil at the well is an arm's length transaction, the first purchaser must file the oil purchaser's report. b. If the first purchase of oil at the well is a non-arm's length transaction and the oil is resold at the well to an arm's length purchaser, the second purchaser must file the oil purchaser's report. c. If the first purchase of oil at the well is a non-arm's length transaction and the oil is not resold at the well but is sold downstream, the purchaser at the well must file the oil purchaser's report. d. The term arm's length transaction as used in this section is defined in section 81-09-02-09. 299 2. The purchaser is primarily responsible for remitting tax due on all oil purchased from an operator or working interest owner when delivery is made at the well. The commissioner may accept payment of the tax from the operator or working interest owner but failure of the operator or working interest owner to pay the tax will not relieve the purchaser of liability for the tax. 3. =Fhe Unless the operator and working interest owner have received a waiver of the filing requirement. they shall report as follows: a. The operator of a property must report one hundred percent of production volume each month. The operator must also report the sales volume and the gross value at the well of the oil the operator actually sold. b. The working interest owners who take oil in kind must report the sales volume and the gross value at the well of the oil taken in kind. 4. The operator ef a producing property must file a monthly oil producer's report unless a vvritten exception is granted allcrwing a working interest owner to assume the reporting responsibilities of an operator who does net have a \u00b7working interest in production. 5:-The operator must report and remit the tax on all oil not sold at the well ... including any oil used, lost, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for after it has been produced. 6:-5.

All tax due on oil sold from a producing property, for which the filing requirement has been\u00b7 waived, must be reported and paid on the .purchaser's monthly report. A waiver does not release a producer from any responsibility to remit tax due. A producer's period of obligation will be determined by the filing date of the purchaser's return. A producer must continue to maintain production records for inspection by the commissioner. 3. A producer must continue to report and remit the tax on all oil not sold at the well._ including any oil used, lost, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for after it has been produced even though a waiver has been received. 4. The commissioner may terminate the waiver at any time by providing written notice to the producer. The producer will be required to file a return effective for the production month following the month in which the notice of termination is issued.

If the permanent impairment is due to organic deficits of the brain and results in disturbances of complex integrated cerebral function, emotional disturbance, or consciousness disturbance, then chapter 4 13, \"central and peripheral nervous system\", must be consulted and may be used, when appropriate, with chapter 14, \"mental and behavioral disorders\". The same permanent impairment may not be rated in both sections. The purpose is to rate the overall functioning, not each specific diagnosis. The impairment must be rated in accordance with the \"permanent mental impairment rating work sheet\" incorporated as appendix A to this chapter. c. The permanent impairment report must include a written summary of the mental evaluation and the \"report work sheet\" incorporated as appendix A to this chapter. d.

General A \"sports pool\" is comprised of wagers paid by players for a line or square that will determine which player wins. The maximum cost per line or square is five dollars. The conduct of a sports pool is the selling of chances on the board and award of a prize. Only cash prizes can be awarded. No sports-pool board with the state gaming stamp affixed may be conducted off of a site. 1. A sports-pool board must be a ten or twelve line or twenty-five or one hundred square board and be acquired from a distributor. 2. An organization shall complete the cost per play, date of sports event, ideal prizes, and method of prize payout on a board.

A sports pool must be conducted for a professional sporting event only. An organization shall designate one opponent along the vertical columns of numbers and the other opponent along the horizontal rows of numbers. However, if the opponents are unknown when the board is being sold, an organization shall designate identifiable conferences, divisions, or games. A purehaser of player who buys a square or line or an employee shall write the player's full name in that square or on that line. Only one player may buy a specific square or line. Except for a calendar sports pool, no tapes may be removed until all the squares or lines are sold and the opponents are designated. All the squares or lines must be sold before the sports event begins. If all the squares or lines are not sold, an organization may advance the board to another game or refund the players' money. If opponents were designated but the board is advanced to another game, an organization shall keep the same opponents or designate new opponents. When an unsold board is advanced to another game, an organization shall post a notice on a site disclosing its policy of advancing the board. Gross proceeds must be separately maintained for each board. 4. An organization may conduct a calendar or master sports pool for two or more games of the same sport.

For example, if a sports pool involves sixteen games, an organization shall buy sixteen boards. A player buys the same square on each board for all the games for a maximum price of five dollars per square per game. If all the books of a calendar sports pool or all the squares of a master sports pool are not sold before the first game, an organization shall refund the players' money and void all the boards. The voided boards must be reported on the tax return as \"no activity\". 484 Otherwise, each board is reported separately on a tax return for the quarter in which the game was held. 5. A calendar sports pool must be conducted as follows: a. The tapes covering the numbers assigned the horizontal rows and vertical columns of the boards must be removed to reveal the numbers. One opponent must be designated along the vertical columns of numbers and the other opponent designated along the horizontal rows of numbers. The board must state the game and its date; b. Each square of each board must be assigned a consecutive number starting with number one. The numbering must be in sequence, left to right; c. Each board must be printed and may be reduced in size. The quantity printed is based on the type of board. For example, for a one hundred square board, each board must be printed one hundred times. A printed board for each game and a receipt comprise a book; d. A receipt must contain: (1) A consecutive receipt number starting with one. A statement that the receipt number is the player's assigned square for all the boards in the book; (2) Name and address of organization and name of site; (3) For a licensed organization, print \"office of the attorney general\" and site license number. For an organization that has a teeat permit, print the name of the city or county and teeat permit number; (4) Price of the book, method of prize payout and prize; and (5) A detachable section containing a player's full name, address, telephone number, and matching receipt number which is retained by an organization; e. An employee may not sell a book on a site where another organization is licensed or has a teeat permit unless the employee is granted permission by the lessor and other organization; f. A player may not choose a particular book to buy. When a book is sold, a receipt's detachable section is completed. After a player 485 buys a book, the player may see the numbers assigned that player's square on the boards; and g. A board must be posted at the site on the day that the related game is held. 6. A master sports pool must be conducted as follows: a. An organization shall post a twenty-five or one hundred square master board at a site. Each square must be assigned a consecutive number starting with number one. The numbering must be in sequence, left to right. A master board must include: (1) Name of organization; (2) The games; (3) Price of participating, number of games, method of prize payout and prize; and (4) A statement that the scores assigned to the players' squares for each game will be posted at the site five days before the game. b.

For a ten line board, by determining the line that is assigned the last number (one's position) of the combined score of both opponents. b. For a twelve line board, by determining the line that is assigned the number of the round in which the boxing match ended. c. For a twenty-five and one hundred square board, by determining the square at the juncture of the horizontal row and vertical column which relate to the numbers (one's position) of each opponent's score. 8. An organization shall make a good-faith effort to contact a winning player to award a prize.

A wager that exceeds the maximum wager is valued at a table's maximum wager and the excess must be returned to a player. An organization shall post and announce a change in the maximum wager at a table with adequate notice to a player. 2. An original wager is the amount bet per hand before the first card is dealt and excludes tip betting. After the first card has been dealt, no original wager or tip bet may be changed. A separate wager may be a split, double-down, insurance bet, and tip bet. 3. Splitting is permitted on any pair or any two 1 0-count value cards. A player is allowed a maximum of four hands per betting space. A player's 498 right-hand card in a split must be played to completion before the adjacent split hand is dealt a second card. A player shall take at least _one card on a split hand. A wager on each hand must equal the original wager. Split aces draw only one card each.

A doubled-down tip bet must equal the original tip bet. If a player's hand wins, a tip bet is paid off at an equal amount and the tip bet and payoff are placed in a dealer's tip receptacle. If the dealer's hand wins, a tip bet is placed in the chip tray. If a player's and dealer's hands tie, a tip bet is a standoff (push). 7. If a player's wager consists of two or more values of chips, a player shall neatly stack the lowest value chip on top of the highest value chip. If the chips are improperly stacked, a dealer shall tell the player and either the dealer or player shall properly stack the chips.

A dealer shall reposition the chip below the lower right-hand corner of the first card dealt and to the immediate right of the second card dealt, from the 499 dealer's perspective. A dealer shall then announce \"insurance bets are closed\". However, if a player who has been dealt a natural twenty-one (blackjack) desires to make an insurance bet and does not desire to double-down, a dealer may, at an organization's option, do an even money payoff rather than having the player place an \"insurance\" bet. To exercise this option, a dealer shall state \"even money\" and \u00b7 immediately do a chip payoff to a player equal to the player's original wager. This even money payoff must be done according to subdivision a of subsection 16. A dealer shall then place the player's cards in a discard holder. For this option, a tip bet is a standoff (push). This rule does not apply if an insurance bet is not permitted. 2. A dealer may announce the dealer's faceup card one time to all the players at a table. =Ffleft If the dealer is using the hole-card-no-peek method of dealing, the dealer's faceup card is an ace or a ten-count card. the dealer is using a mechanical or electronic hole card reader and special cards. and the dealer's hand is a natural blackjack, the dealer shall play the dealer's hand as prescribed by subdivision c or d of subsection 10. Otherwise, a dealer shall, beginning from the dealer's left and for each player's hand, prompt a player to indicate whether the player desires to split or double-down, or both. As a prompt, a dealer may announce the point total of each player's hand. For splitting a hand, a player shall place an additional wager, equal to an original wager, horizontal to the original wager. For doubling-down on an original wager or tip bet, a player shall place a chip vertical to the wager. A player may not double-down on a tip bet unless the player also doubles-down on the original wager. If a dealer is unsure of a player's intent, the dealer shall ask the player and properly reposition a chip. 3. If a player has split or doubled-down, or both, a dealer shall play each hand as follows: a. When a player places a wager for a split, a dealer shall split the cards side by side. If a player has also placed a tip bet, a dealer shall assign and reposition the tip bet to the split hand located at the foremost left of a betting space, from the dealer's perspective. Each split hand must be played separately. If aces are split, one additional card must be dealt face upwards to each of the hands and placed at a right angle to the first card dealt. b. A doubled-down hand must be dealt one additional card face upwards and placed at a right angle to the first two cards dealt. However, if a table does not have a video surveillance system, the card may be placed beneath a player's original wager. 500 4. A dealer may not take a hit card from a dealing shoe nor may a dealer bypass a player unless the player has first indicated the player's request .for a hit card or to stand by a distinct hand signal. 5. As a player indicates to stand or draw a hit card, other than on a hand that has split aces or a double-down, a dealer shall deal face upwards an additional card or cards as the player requests. A player is responsible for correctly computing the total card count of the player's hand. 6. If a player did not split, double-down, or place an insurance bet, and busts (a player's total card count exceeds twenty-one), the player loses an original wager and any tip bet. A dealer shall immediately collect and place a player's chips, including any tip bet, in a chip tray and the cards in a discard holder. 7. If a dealer's faceup card is not an ace or a ten-count card and a player split or doubled-down and busts, the player loses the wager for that split or double-down hand and any tip bet (including any double\u00b7dO'ifiln bet) assigned to it. A dealer shall immediately collect and place a player's chips, including any tip bet and double do\u00b7wn bet, in a chip tray and the cards in a discard holder. 8. If a dealer's faceup card is an ace or a ten-count card and a player split, doubled-down, or placed an insurance bet and busts, the dealer shall gather the cards of that hand and place them outside the betting space. Then, a dealer shall reposition the player's split and or doubled-down wagered chips, in the same betting position, on top of the player's cards of that hand. A tip bet for such a split or double-down hand that busts is lost. A dealer shall immediately place the tip bet chips in a chip tray. 9. If a dealer's faceup card is not an ace or a ten-count card and all players bust, a dealer shall end the round. If a dealer's faceup card is an ace\u00b7 or a ten-count card and all players bust, and no . player split, doubled-down, nr placed an insurance wager, a dealer shall end the round. 10.

Then, a dealer shall announce the total card count of the two cards. A dealer shall play the dealer's hand as follows: a. If a dealer's faceup card is an ace and the dealer's hand is not a natural twenty-one, the dealer shall immediately, starting with the 501 player to the dealer's right and moving left around the table, collect all the players' insurance bet chips, with the dealer's right or left hand, in a sweeping motion, and place them in a chip tray.

Then, for all the players' busted hands that have been split, doubled-down, or both, a dealer shall immediately, starting with the player to the dealer's right and moving left around the table, collect the chips of busted hands, with the dealer's right or left hand, in a sweeping motion. A dealer may not use the right and left hand at the same time. When no other busted hand remains, a dealer shall place the collected chips in a chip tray, collect those players' busted hands, and place the cards in a discard holder. A dealer may, at an organization's option that is consistently applied at a site, collect each player's insurance bet chips and busted hands and related chips with only the dealer's right hand, on a hand-by-hand basis, and place the chips in a chip tray and the cards in a discard holder. Then, for all the players who have been dealt a natural twenty-one, the dealer shall immediately, starting with the player to the dealer's right and moving left around the table, do the payoff according to subsection 15 or 16, and collect and place those players' cards in a discard holder. If a player's hand remains in play, a dealer shall proceed according to subdivision for g, and do the payoff procedure on any winning hand according to subsection 15 or 16. b.

A dealer shall do the payoff procedUre according to subsection 15 or 16. However, if a player's original hand also is a natural twenty-one, subdivision d also applies. d. If a dealer's faceup card is an ace or a ten-count card and the dealer's hand is a natural twenty-one, the organization wins all original wagers and original tip bets, unless a player's original hand also is a natural twenty-one which results in a standoff. All other players lose. e. If a player has doubled-down or split against a dealer's faceup card of an ace or a ten-count card and the dealer's hand is a natural twenty-one, only the player's original wager is lost unless the player's original hand also is a natural twenty-one which results in a standoff. All separate splitting and doubling-down wagers are voided. A dealer shall return the chips of the separate wagers to the players. f. If the count of a dealer's hand is sixteen or under, the dealer shall draw a hit card until the count exceeds sixteen.

A dealer shall repeat this procedure for each separate winning hand. b. After the payoff procedure has been done on all winning players' hands and the tip bet chips and any double\u00b7dawn chips have been fanned, a dealer shall, with the dealer's right hand, take a chip from a chip tray of the same value as the tip bet chip and any double dovm chip, place the payoff chip in a stacked manner beside the fanned chips, and fan the payoff chips.
