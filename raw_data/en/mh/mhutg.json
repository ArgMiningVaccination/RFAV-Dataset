DRAFT by Greg Lundstedt 12/2015 PLEASE NOTE: The following is based on an email response I gave to someone at the church I pastor regarding their involvement in Naturopathy. Hi ________ , Thank you for your willingness to look at these things. Now unfortunately as I begin, I have to admit I am very spiritually concerned f or you both after just briefly re -examining Naturopathy and the evil religious paradigm it is based on. Please understand although I am exhorting you both, I am here to help you and care for you. Pro 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But dece itful are the kisses of an enemy. Also please understand I have a spiritual responsibility to look out for your souls and this is what I'm doing . Heb 13:17 NAS 17 Obey your leaders, and submit to them ; for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you. In light of His Word and the evidence I will share below , I am praying for you both to trust the Lord to illumine your hearts , so that you will do what is right and confess and turn from your involvement with Naturopathy . In Christ, Greg SHOULD CHRISTIANS SEE A NATUROPATH OR A \"CHRISTIAN NATUROPATH\"? As we look at this issue , I intend to show three things: First of all, Naturopathy is inseparable from its core false religious New Age paradigm and therefore must not be associated with, learned, or practiced by believers. Secondly, there' s no possible way for so -called Christian Naturopaths to separate the New Age false religious paradigms from naturopathy they practice. Third, whether you understand it or not , if you have been involved in Naturopathy, that which God prohibits, you must repent and repudiate it. To begin, believers are in no way to ever be associated, mingle with, learn or participate in the wicked spiritual practices of those who have rejected the Lord. The following are some verses that give us helpful reminders of God's view toward such things and what we are to do in re sponse. 2 Deut. 18:9-14 9 \"When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations. 10 \"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fi re, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. 12 \"For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD; and because of these detestable things the LORD your God will drive them out before you. 13 \"You shall be blameless before the LORD your God. 14 \"For those nations, which you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so. Psalm 106:32 -41 32 They also provoked Him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, So that it went hard with Moses on their account;33 Because they were rebellious against His Spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips.34 They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them,35 But they mingled with the nations, And learned their practices,36 And served their idols, Which became a snar e to them.37 They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons,38 And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with the blood.39 Thus they becam e unclean in their practices, And played the harlot in their deeds.40 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people, And He abhorred His inheritance. 41 Then He gave them into the hand of the nations; And those who hated them ruled over th em. 2Cor. 6:14-7:2 14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbel iever? 16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, \"I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 17 \"Therefore, come out from their mid st and be separate,\" says the Lord. \"And do not touch what is unclean; And I will welcome you. 18 \"And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,\" Says the Lord Almighty. 7:1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us clean se ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. James 4:4-10 4 You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: \"He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us\"? 6 But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, \"Go d is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.\" 7 Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double -minded. 9 Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and 3 your joy to gloom. 10 Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you. To begin the world apart from Christ understands the spiritual reality underlyin g Naturopathy. Indeed, the underlying paradigm that all naturopathic medicine is based on is not hidden, It's actually quite clear. Just a simple Internet search reveals this fact. For example, Wikipedia (See paragraph below) lays forth the common under standing concerning Naturopathy \"Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine employing a wide array of \"natural\" treatments, including homeopathy , herbalism , and acupuncture , as well as diet and lifestyle counseling. Naturopaths favor a holistic approach with non -invasive treatment and generally avoid the use of surgery and drugs . Naturopathic philosophy is based on a belief in vitalism and self -healing , and practitioners often prefer methods of treatment that are not compatible with evidence -based medicine \" \"Naturopathic practice is based on a belief in the human body's ability to heal itself through a special vital energy or force guiding bodily processes internally. Diagnosis and treatment concern primarily alternative therapies and \"natural\" methods that naturopaths claim promote the body's natural ability to he al\" Now admittedly, Wikipedia is not in and of itself the gold stand ard for factual information, yet it takes not much research to see that what was spoken above is exactly the religious paradigm in which naturopathy is completely based. Even nonbelieving physicians such as Stephen Barrett, M.D. , who rightly see naturopathy as quackery , also clearly understand and relay the basis of naturopathy which is commonly understood and accepted : \"Naturopathy, sometimes referred to as \"natural medicine,\" is a largely pseudoscientific approach said to \"assist nature\" \"suppor t the body's own innate capacity to health\", and \"facilitate the body's inherent healing mechanisms.\" Naturopaths assert that diseases are the body's effort to purify itself, and that cures result from increasing the patient's \"vital force .\" They claim to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by ridding it of waste products and \"toxins.\" At first glance, this approach may appear sensible. However, a close look will show that naturopathy's philosophy is simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery. The notion of a \"vital force\" or \"life force\" \u2014a nonmaterial force that transcends the laws of chemistry and physics \u2014originated in ancient times. Historians call it the doctrine of vitalism. No scientific evidence supports this doctrine, but a huge body of knowledge, including the entir e discipline of organic chemistry, refutes it. 4 Vitalistic practitioners maintain that diseases should be treated by \"stimulating the body's ability to heal itself\" rather than by \"treating symptoms.\" Homeopaths, for example, claim that illness is due to a disturbance of the body's \"vital force,\" which they can correct with special remedies, while many acupuncturists claim that disease is due to imbalance in the flow of \"life energy\" ( chi or Qi), which they can balance by twirling needles in the skin. Many c hiropractors claim to assist the body's \"Innate Intelligence\" by Medicatrix Naturae. \" Ayurvedic refer \"prana.\" And so on. The \"energies\" postulated by vitalists cannot be measured by sc ientific methods.According to a comprehensive report presented to the United States Congress in 1970 by the now -defunct National Association of Naturopathic Physicians (NANP): Naturopathy . . . is the technique of treatment of human disease which emphasiz es assisting nature. It can embrace minor surgery and the use of nature's agencies, forces, processes, and products, introducing them to the human body by any means that will produce health -yielding results. Naturopathy is based upon the tendency of the body to maintain a balance an d to heal itself. The purpose of naturopathic medicine is to further this process by using natural remedies . . . as distinct from \"orthodox\" medicine (allopathy and osteopathy), which seeks to combat disease by using remedies w hich are chosen to destroy the causative agent or which produce effects different from those produced by the disease treated. . . Again the world understands what vitalism is: From Wiki \"Vitalism is the doctrine that \"living organisms are fundamental ly different from non-living entities because they contain some non -physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things\". Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the \"vital spark\", \"energy\" or \"\u00e9lan vital\", which some equate with the soul.\" We as Christians understand this as relating to the spiritual sphere. Wiki continues ... \"Although now rejected by mainstream science, vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies: most traditional healing practices posited that disease results from som e imbalance in vital force s. In the Western tradition founded by Hippocrates, these vital forces were associated with the four temperaments and humours; Eastern tradition s posited an imbalance or blocking of qi (or prana). \" Now Christians use d to understand these energies were based on demonic spiritual principles. That these things are in the spiritual sphere. Indeed, these very same principles are at the core of acupu ncture. And Christians in the past had certainly rejected this rightly because of its wicked spiritual content. Now concerning naturopathic training and colleges, I challenge you to find a Naturopathic college that does not teach and train these spiritua l paradigms as 5 foundational. Also, I challenge you to find a naturopathic practice that does not implement in some way or another these principles, no matter whether they say they're Christian or not, because Naturopathy at its core is based on these pri nciples. It is impossible to become a doctor of naturopath and not be immersed in a nd taught these wicked underling spiritual principles Let me share some examples. The following information is from the National College of Natural Medicine in Portland ( NCNM) . It is considered to be the premier and foundational college concerning Naturopathy. On a side note, _____ and _______ your Naturopath graduated from this college. Their picture on there \"ABOUT NCMN\" page certainly gives us some shocking insi ght also Although as the sa ying goes 'a picture relays a thousand words ,' let's take a look at the words from NCMM' website. The following is a description of the program completed from the college itself: \"The program emphasizes a distinctive approach to health and healing - an approach that considers the whole person when treating specific conditions, one that seeks to diagnose and treat causes wherever possible. Naturopathic medicine is heir to the vitalis tic tradition of medicine in the Western world. This is evidenced by its emphasis in treating disease through the stimulation, enhancement, and support of the inherent healing power of the body . Chosen methods of treatment respect this natural healing proc ess.\" Indeed just click the link and look at the NCNM Alignment Model, especially in the middle of the hourglass where it says \"point of balance in which heaven and earth merge in the human being , Vis need to understand in God's eyes this is wickedness and nothing we should partake or associate with. One needs to go no further than to look at articles on their website, to see how deep naturopathy is steeped in a false spiritual religious paradigm. The quotes below ar e from NCMN's section \"About Naturopathic Medicine \" http://www.ncnm.edu/academic - programs/school -of-naturopathic -medicine/about -the-medicine.php 6 Naturopathic Principles of Healing The practice of naturopathic medicine emerges from six principles of healing. These principles are based on the objective observation of the nature of health and disease and are examined continually in light of scientific analysis. These principles stand as the distinguishing marks of the profession: The healing power of nature \u2014 vis medicatrix naturae The body has the inherent ability to establish, maintain, and restore health. The healin g process is ordered and intelligent ; nature heals through the response of the life force . The physician's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to identify and remove obstacles to health and recovery, and to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. History of Naturopathic Medicine The roots of naturopathic medicine go back thousands of years , drawing on the healing wi sdom of many cultures including Indian ( Ayurvedic) , Chinese (Taoist) , Greek (Hippocratic), Arabian, Egyptian , and European (monastic medicine) traditions. With the age of scientific inquiry, medicine took on exciting dimensions and developed new tools for fighting disease. In fact, many older time -tested healing and health maintenance methods were discarded at a rapid rate as doctors began treating disease almost solely with surgery and drugs. Some practitioners in Europe and America, however, perceived tha t valuable, empirically proven natural therapies were being lost, and struggled to retain the practice of promoting health through stimulation of the vital force and the rational use of natural agents . If a Christian, following the Lord, was to loo k up Taoism and A yurveda, they would be appalle d and certainly not associate with such wickedness. Now at this point there may be Christians who say \"well my Naturopath is a Christian and doesn't buy into this stuff. \" I would say that's impossible. One cannot have a doctor of Naturopathy and have not graduated from an accredited school which teaches these wicked principles. One cannot practice naturopathy apart from foundational elements that underpin, no matter how Christianized they sound. Let me illustrate with information found in relation to your so -called Christian Naturopath . Indeed your naturopath got their schooling and phony doctor title at NCMN. We ha ve already seen very clearly they teach the wicked principles of the vitalistic force. Indeed, as you look , I believe you will see their 'philosophical perspective' on which the naturopathic clinical approach is based on cannot be disconnected from religi ous and New Age philosophy called \"vitalism.\" Now although the website has a fish on it, if you were to do some digging you would find out that those who run the practice are Naturopath's and whether they understand it or not, embrace a false spiritual religious paradigm and New Age philosophy. 7 Concerning the so-called doctors at \"A Natural Choice,\" it's very clear they are proud of their Naturopathic college training at NCMN one need not go very far in their examination of the college they attended (NCMN) and the program that they completed that th eir education is completely based in this false religious view and is completely immersed in New Age philosophies and religious paradigms, as with all Naturopathic colleges . This should've been a red flag from the beginning to stay away. Yet even if one did not understand the spiritual dangers of naturopathy and the wickedness associated with the training , it would not take much discernment to notice there are some things on their website , in which a discerning believer should see as wrong. First of all , notice, many of the buzzwords and phrases they use on their website and podcast are very clearly New \"out of balance\" \"Your symptoms are part of you and you have a body, a mind and a spirit. We look at all thre e.\" All of your symptoms are in one body, so they are connected But more shockingly, If you do a little hunting on their website into the techniques that they clearly are proud of and use, as do other naturopaths , you should be alarmed . Notice , even in their explanations, they do not hide the clear wicked spiritual and New Age connections. For example, take for instance their portion on the allergy treatments they use. The following is from their website: http://www.anaturalchoice.org/Natural_Choice_Nature_Path_Doctor_Therapies_Treatm ents_Info.asp?ID=23 \"Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique (NAET) combines various effective healing techniques from different disciplines of medicine (allopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic, kinesiology and nutrition) to permanently eliminate allergies of all kinds from the body. NAET is a completely natural, non -invasive, and drug -free holistic treatment for reactions to substances ranging from anaphylaxis to environmental allergies such as hay fever to food sensitivities.\" How Does NAET Work? Chinese medicine identified thousands of years ago that people have a network of energy pathways that fl ow through their body, like rivers of energy. Western scientists have been able to prove that these energy pathways or electrical circuits exist and that the energy can be measured . These pathways are called meridians, and they pass through each of the org ans in your body. We could compare it to the electrical wires in your home that supply energy to the different parts of the house. In order for your body to function at an optimal level, you need to have the proper amount of energy flowing through each of your electrical circuits (meridians) . As a person moves away from health, that energy level is one of the first things to be affected. There's a certain range in which the energy should fluctuate. When it remains within that range, then we 8 say the meridian is balanced. But the energy can drift outside of the optimal range; and as that happens, the organ function associated with that meridian becomes impaired. Allergens can affect the way energy flows through your meridians . In some cases allergens can even block the flow all together. Once this energy flow becomes impaired symptoms can start to develop. NAET works by reestablishing a healthy balance within the meridian network. During the treatment, specific spots along the spine are stimulated. These point s are a compilation of acupuncture points and nerve root points that innervate the vital organs of the body. When these points are stimulated manually, the fl ow of electrical energy is reestablished , the allergen is eliminated, and the symptoms caused by t he interference are alleviated. I have to interject at this time. One need s to understand, the idea of meridians and energy flow is completely connected to Eastern Chinese medicine which was and is at its core religious and spiritual. There is no way a believer should be involved with anything that is connected to or related to wicked spiritual religious practices . These so -called Christian Naturopaths have learned the practices of the wicked and they are propagating them . And again I say, there is no way a believer should be involved with anything that is connected to or related to wicked spiritual religious practices So then does the fact that many naturopaths call themselves Christians , mean it is ok for one to be in such wickedness? Ab solutely not. Would you see a Christian acupuncturist? Why not? Because acupuncture is based on a false spiritual religious paradigm. The reality that someone would claim to be Christian does not j ustify the practice they are in and/or sanctified i t. The same is true for Naturopathy. It is impossible to disconnect t he spiritual paradigms underpinn ing Naturopathy and thus no Christian should ever be involved in such and if one does find themselves involved they need to repent and repudiate such wi ckedness. Deu 18:9 -14 NAS 9 \"When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations. 10 \"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist , or one who calls up the dead. 12 \"For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD; and because of these detestable things the LORD your God will drive them out before you. 13 \"You shall be blameless before the LORD your God. 14 \"For those nations , which you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so. 9 After being reminded how evil Naturopathy at its core is, I must exhort you both. This is evil religious stuff no believer should be associated and yoked with or listen to. Dear brother and sister, you need to confess, repudiate and separate. I pray you will do so. Again I remind you , although I am exhorting you both, I am here to help you and care for you. Pro 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy. Also please remember I have a spiritual responsibility to look out for your souls and this is what I'm doing . Heb 13:17 NAS 17 Obey your leaders, and submit to them ; for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you. In light of His Word and the evidence , I am praying for y ou both to trust the Lord to illumine your hearts , so that you will do what is right and confess and turn from your involvement with Naturopathy . In Christ, Greg 2Co 6:14 -7:2 NAS 14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, \"I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 17 \"Therefore, come out from their midst and be separate,\" says the Lord. \"And do not touch what is unclean; And I will welcome y ou. 18 \"And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,\" Says the Lord Almighty. 7:1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of Go d.
