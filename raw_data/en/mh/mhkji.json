However, a chiropractor can help with many functions, such as the immune system, mental health, and physiological stress relief. Let's explore how chiropractic care can boost your immune system. Your nervous system communicates directly with your entire body through the spinal cord. So when your spine is misaligned, the rest of your body can suffer. When this happens, you become susceptible to more stress, pain, and illnesses because your body doesn't have the strength to fight off those symptoms. When a patient receives regular chiropractic care, however, the medical professional helps them perform specific stretches and exercises that help the spinal cord return to its natural state. Let's face it: any dysfunction that occurs in your body can disturb the immune system and make it easier for you to catch an illness. This is because your body sees the dysfunction, or misalignment, as a threat and may begin to go into overdrive to rid the body from the additional stress.

Stress can decrease the effectiveness of your immune system, leaving you vulnerable to catching the sniffles.
