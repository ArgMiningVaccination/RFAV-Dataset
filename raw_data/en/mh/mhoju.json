Of the 1.34 million people currently living with HIV in Zimbabwe, it is estimated that 146,824are children and adolescents (MOHCC, 2014). The national Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme is playing a critical role in the national effort to reduce the incidence of HIV in children. However, children and adolescents continue to be infected with HIV, either at birth or later in childhood and adolescence. During 2014 it was estimated that 9,086 children and adolescents below the age of 15 years were newly infected with HIV (MOHCC, 2013). The national scale up of Paediatric HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment has had a dramatic impact on the prognosis for children and adolescents infected with HIV in Zimbabwe. However, children and adolescents lag behind adults in terms of access to treatment. At the end of 2014 there were 55,061 children on ART across the country resulting in treatment coverage of 38% of all children (0-14 years) (MOHCC Estimates 2014). Similarly, only 33,434 adolescents (15-19 years) living with HIV were accessing treatment in 2014, accounting for 34% of the total population of adolscents living with HIV (MOHCC Estimates, 2014). In light of this treatment gap, the Government of Zimbabwe is committed to accelerating access to HIV treatment and care for this age group and ensuring they have access to adequate treatment. HIV Testing Services (HTS) are the critical entry point to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. Access to HTS promotes early identification of HIV infection in infants, children and adolescents. Those testing HIV positive may then be referred for treatment, care and support, including sustained counselling which is responsive to their evolving needs as they grow up into adulthood. HIV-exposed infants or older children and adolescents who are uninfected may benefit from intensified follow-up, care and prevention measures that will help to ensure they remain uninfected. Children and adolescents requiring Post Exposure Prophylaxis can also be identified using HTS. As part of its commitment to ensuring universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support for children and adolescents the Government's Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) has set out clear guidelines to ensure that this age group have access to quality HIV testing services (HTS). In line with global initiatives the MOHCC is committed to ensuring that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. By 2020, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. By 2020, 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will be virally suppressed (UNAIDS). In addition, the MOHCC under its commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as well as its appreciation of the framework for the Sustainable Development Goals, is working to ensure that children and adolescents have access to the requisite HTS they need. Such services depend on the availability of quality counselling services. The MOHCC has developed the HIV Testing Services for Children and Adolescent Training Course for Counsellors to ensure that counsellors are trained to effectively deliver quality HTS services for children and adolescents. This standardised national training will ensure access to high quality HTS services for children and adolescents and their families across Zimbabwe.

It is to be used both in the initial training and also as a self-assessment reference and supervision tool once back in the workplace. It contains course content material and worksheets. The manual should be used in conjunction with the national guidelines on HIV Testing Services as well as other national training curricula (e.g. HIV Integrated Training (HIT), and Primary Counselling Training Curriculum). Those trained should then receive continued supervision from the designated supervisors in their facilities. All the modules in this manual have been re-aligned to the 2014 National Guidelines for HIV testing and Counselling for Children and Adolescents, as well as the WHO HIV Testing Services Guidelines for 2015.3 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 3 Day Course Schedule24 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 2 All practicals, as well as case studies will be conducted as part of the module sessionsTime Session Day 1: 08:00 - 08:30 Registration & Welcome 08:30 - 08:45 Getting to know each other 08:45 - 09:00 Pre Course Assessment 09:00 - 10:00 HTS for Children and adolescents in Zimbabwe 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Self-awareness, values, attitudes and beliefs 11:30 - 13:00 Understanding Children and adolescents 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 16:30 Understanding the impact of HIV on Children and adolescents Models of HIV Testing Services Delivery for Children and adolescentsLegal and Ethical Issues in HTS for Children and adolescents Day 2: 08:00 - 09:00 Brief overview of day 1 Principles of counselling children and adolescents 09.00 - 10.00 Skills and techniques for counselling children and adolescents 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Skills and techniques for counselling children and adolescents cont. 11.30 - 13.00 Pre and post HIV test counselling for children and adolescents 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 16:30 Post-test follow up counselling and support for children and adolescents with HIV Day 3: 08:00 - 09:00 Brief overview of day 2 Post course assessment and evaluation 09:00 - 10:00 Disclosure counselling for children and adolescents with HIV 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Adherence counselling for children and adolescents on ART 11:30 - 13:00 SRHR counselling for adolescents with HIVSupport 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 15:00 Counsellor Self Care and Supervision Quality Assurance 15:00 - 16:00 Action Planning for HTS that is responsive to child and adolescent needs 16:00 - 16:30 Dismissal5 Day Course Schedule3 Time Session Day 1: 08:00 - 08:30 Registration & Welcome 08:30 - 08:45 Getting to know each other 08:45 - 09:00 Pre Course Assessment 09:00 - 10:00 HTS for Children and adolescents in Zimbabwe 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Self-awareness, values, attitudes and beliefs 11:30 - 13:00 Understanding Children and adolescents 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 16:30 Understanding the impact of HIV on Children and adolescents Day 2: 08:00 - 09:00 Brief overview of day 1 Models of HIV Testing Services Delivery for Children and adolescents 09.00 - 10.00 Legal and Ethical Issues in HTS for Children and adolescents 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 13:00 Principles of counselling children and adolescents 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 16:30 Skills and techniques for counselling children and adolescents Day 3: 08:00 - 10:00 Brief overview of day 2 Pre and post HIV test counselling for children and adolescents 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 13:00 Pre and post HIV test counselling for children and adolescents cont. 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 15:00 Post-test follow up counselling and support for children and adolescents with HIV Day 4: 08:00 - 10:00 Brief overview of day 3 Disclosure counselling for children and adolescents with HIV 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Adherence counselling for children and adolescents on ART 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 16:30 SRHR counselling for adolescents with HIVSupport group formation Day 5: 08:00 - 9:00 Brief overview day 4 Post course assessment 9:00 - 10:00 Counsellor Self Care and Supervision 10:00 - 10:30 TEA 10:30 - 11:30 Quality Assurance 11:30 - 13:00 Action Planning for HTS that is responsive to child and adolescent needs 13:00 - 14:00 LUNCH 14:00 - 15:00 Course wrap up 15:00 - 16:00 Dismissal 3 All practicals, as well as case studies will be conducted as part of the module sessions5 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Case Scenarios These scenarios will be used throughout the course to role play and workshop different issues in HIV counselling for children and adolescents: Case Scenario 1 Chengetai is 5 years old. He has been unwell for the past year with recurrent ear infections, diarrhoea and herpes zoster. His mother was advised by her local clinic that she should bring Chengetai to you for HIV testing. During the pretest information session, Chengetai's mother informs you that she has changed her mind and does not want him to be tested. Case Scenario 2 Thabani is 10 years old. He has been sick on and off for the past 4 years with septic sores, chronic cough and two admissions to hospital with pneumonia. He is also short for his age. Thabani's uncle has brought him for HIV testing. When you call them in to your counselling room, the uncle tells Thabani to stay behind in the waiting room. The uncle explains that he would like Thabani to be tested for HIV but does not want Thabani to be told the reason for the blood test today as he will not be able to cope with the results if they are positive. Case Scenario 3 Eunice is 17 years old. She has just been diagnosed HIV positive. During your counselling session, she tells you her family do not want her to start ARVs but that she should go for faith healing.6 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 20156Case Scenario 4 Tadiwa is 9 years old. She lives with her paternal uncle and his family following the death of her parents. Tadiwa's aunt has brought her to see you because Tadiwa was sexually abused by the neighbour two nights ago. Case Scenario 5 Thembani is 15 years old. She has a 19 year old boyfriend and she discloses to you that they are having a sexual relationship. She feels that it is important that she has an HIV test but does not want her mother to know about her boyfriend or that she is having the test. Case scenario 6 Rose is 14 years old. She has come to you asking for an HIV test. During your counselling, you inform her that she needs to bring a caregiver who must give informed consent before she can be tested for HIV. She tells you she cannot bring her caregiver. Case scenario 7 Tanaka is 17 years old. He is a patient in your clinic and is HIV positive. He is on ARVs but poorly adherent. You have seen him in the community with his girlfriend. When he comes for his review, you ask him whether he has disclosed his HIV status to his girlfriend. He tells you that he cannot tell her as she will leave him.7 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts71 This module introduces the participants to the HIV Testing Services (HTS) for children/adolescent training course.

Early access to HTS for infants, children and adolescents promotes early identification of HIV infection and those confirmed HIV positive may then be referred for HIV treatment, care and support. Those who are uninfected or HIV-exposed may benefit from intensified follow-up, care and prevention measures that will help to ensure they remain uninfected. Children and adolescents requiring Post Exposure Prophylaxis can also be identified and managed appropriately. Exposed infants requiring more specialized follow-up care to prevent infection are managed according to guidelines laid out in the HIV Integrated Training curriculum. However, in contrast to service delivery for adults, there has been limited attention to the need for child and adolescent-focused HTS and follow up counselling services, both nationally and internationally. The unique needs of both children and adolescents and the legal and ethical issues surrounding HTS for this age group present a challenge for policy makers and service providers. Yet, as part of its commitment to ensuring universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support for children and adolescents, the MOHCC has set out clear guidelines to ensure that this age-group also has access to quality HTS, follow up treatment, care and support services. These services are reliant on the availability of quality counselling services. Counsellors providing HTS and follow up support services for children and adolescents encounter clients at varying ages, developmental stages, with different life circumstances, experiences and vastly different needs. Quality counselling meets these different needs and has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of both HIV infected and uninfected children and adolescents and their families. Counsellors have a central role to play in the delivery of quality HTS and follow up care and support services for children and adolescents and their families. The MOHCC has developed this training course to ensure that counsellors are trained to effectively fulfil this role.

This is having a devastating impact on the nation's children and adolescents. Of the 1.3 million people living with HIV, approximately 11% (146,824) are children and adolescents (MOHCC, 2014).

In 2014, the MTCT rate was estimated to be 4.69% (MOHCC 2014 Estimates) 3. Older children and adolescents infected through horizontal transmission - Although national prevention strategies are being implemented, older children and adolescents continue to be infected through horizontal transmission such as child sexual abuse and early sexual debutThe rate of HIV infection in children and adolescents is the result of: 214 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Infants and young children have an exceptionally high risk of poor outcomes from HIV infection. Up to 52% of children die before the age of two years in the absence of any intervention (Newell et al, 2004). In order to simplify and expand treatment in children, WHO revised its treatment guidelines in 2013 to include initiating ART in all children up to five years and to increase the CD4 count threshold for ART initiation to 500 cells/mm\u00b3 in children 5 years and older, aligning with the new threshold in adults (WHO, 2013). In the revised 2015 Treatment Guidelines the WHO went on to recommend that all people, regardless of CD4 count, be initiated on treatment as soon as they have a positive diagnosis of HIV. According to the 2014 HIV estimates 1,168,451 adults and 86,128 children (aged 0-14) were in urgent need of ART in 2014 (MOHCC, 2013) Of those in need, 55,061 children (aged 0-14) and 732,919 adults were on ART at the end of 2014, (MOHCC 2014). 5 WHO HIV and Adolescents: Guidance for HIV Testing and Counselling and Care for Adolescents Living with HIV2 MODES OF TrAnSMISSIO n More than 90% of HIV-infected children (aged 0-14) acquire their infection through mother to child transmission of HIV, also known as vertical transmission. However children and more so adolescents can also acquire HIV through horizontal transmission. Horizontal transmission can occur through either sexual transmission, which includes sexual activity, coerced sex or sexual abuse, or parental transmission which refers to non-sexual transmission most commonly found among adolescents involved in injecting drug use, traditional practices (e.g. female genital mutilation), unsafe medical procedures and blood transfusions 5. CHIlDrEn, ADO lESCE nTS A nD HTS The child and adolescent counsellor encounters children and adolescents across a broad age range, at varying developmental stages, with different life circumstances and experiences and with vastly different needs. Many are particularly vulnerable with demanding counselling needs. For example, one child presenting for HIV testing may be an HIV-exposed infant while another may be a sexually active adolescent. Children and adolescents presenting may be sick and symptomatic for HIV, whereas others may be well. They may be orphaned, living with extended family members and grieving multiple losses and trauma in their lives. 15 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsOthers may have little or no support network, such as children and adolescents living on the street or those living in child headed households. Children and adolescents may be physically well but may have been sexually abused. In addition, some minors may attend HTS but without a parent/caregiver. HTS CO unSEllIng r EquIrEMEnTS FO r HTS FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The provision of optimal HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents requires that: Relevant policies, procedures and services are in place which are responsive to the needs of children and adolescents Services be delivered by skilled personnel trained in conducting HIV counselling and/or HIV testing in these age groups Services have an uninterrupted supply of HIV test kits and related commodities Trained personnel to provide services are available Appropriate referral systems for follow up care, support and treatment are established ADDrESSI ng THE n EED FO r HTS FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS Various strategic documents have been developed on the acceleration of HIV services in order to meet the national targets towards attaining universal access to prevention, treatment and care services in line with the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals. In line with its commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Government of Zimbabwe has committed itself to undertaking all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that children and adolescents have access to HIV Testing Services. The HIV Testing and Counselling Strategic Plan, in line with the ZNASP II and III, as well as the Accelerated Action Plan for Paediatric HIV call for the expansion of testing and counselling services for children and adolescents. This has been followed by National Guidelines for HTS for children and adolescents in 2007 and a revised edition in 2014. In line with global initiatives the MOHCC is committed to ensuring that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. By 2020, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. By 2020, 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression (UNAIDS). The purpose of these guidelines is to provide national standards that must be adhered to by all institutions, organizations and individuals for the provision of high quality HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents in Zimbabwe. The guidelines provide a guide on how to expand and increase access of HTS for children and adolescents whilst at the same time maintaining quality.216 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015quAlITy HTS FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS DEPE nDS O n qu AlITy COunSE llOrS Quality counselling has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of children, adolescents and their families infected and affected by HIV. Children and adolescents testing HIV positive can be helped to understand and cope with events in their lives and, when they are ready, to understand the implications of their result, in order to help them look forward to a meaningful life ahead and feel accepted, valued and loved. Families can be helped to come to terms with the implications of their child's status and to access appropriate post-test support services. Children and adolescents who test HIV negative can be assisted to implement prevention strategies. Central to the delivery of appropriate, effective services for children and adolescents accessing HIV testing is the need for well trained, committed child and adolescent counsellors. Quality counselling addresses the needs of individual children and adolescents. Child and adolescent counsellors therefore require: Knowledge and understanding of growth and development of children and adolescents Skills in assessment of the needs of individual children and adolescents Skills in communicating effectively with children and adolescents Skills and techniques for sharing appropriate information in a way which children and adolescents can understand Skills in assisting children and adolescents to cope with difficult situations Skills in working with families Attitude and beliefs which are responsive to the needs of individual children and adolescents Whilst some younger children may not know the details of the HIV test and its 2 implications, older children and adolescents will be able to be fully involved in the HTS process. All the children and adolescents have extensive counselling needs and these must be met appropriately.17 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts2MODE l OF SE rVICE DE lIVEry THAT IS r ESPO nSIVE TO THE n EEDS OF CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS When discussing models of HTS service delivery for children and adolescents, it is important to ensure that services are responsive to the needs of children and adolescents, as this is central to ensuring that children and adolescents have access to appropriate care and support. Components of Services that are r esponsive to Child and adolescent n eeds Services that are responsive to child and adolescent needs recognise the physical, emotional, social, mental and spiritual needs of individual children and adolescents and their families. Services are planned and implemented in a way that addresses their different needs, minimises any potential negative impact on the child and adolescent and encourages children, adolescents and their families to access the service.

Every individual has different sets of values, attitudes and beliefs. What do we feel is important? What is right? What is wrong? How should one behave? These are influenced by a variety of factors, as shown in the diagram. SElF-Aw ArEnESS All counsellors need to be aware that their values, attitudes and beliefs can influence the way they approach a child and family's situation, the way they react to their needs and the approach they take in counselling the child and family. Quality counselling therefore requires counsellors to be self-aware . This is defined as an awareness of one's own personal values, beliefs and attitudes. As in the diagram above, these are all influenced by a variety of factors and every individual is different. SElF-Aw ArEnESS AnD THE rESPOnSIbIlITIES OF THE C OunSEll Or Every individual is entitled to their own personal values, beliefs and opinions. However, the role of the counsellor is a privileged one. Children and adolescents and families attending HTS, follow up care and support, are extremely vulnerable and as such need to be assisted as objectively as possible. They have placed themselves in your care to receive accurate information, to seek support and to help them find ways of dealing with their experiences. Quality counselling meets the needs of the child, adolescent and family , taking into account their own situation and experiences. Counsellors need to understand and acknowledge the potential impact that their personal values, attitudes and beliefs can have on their role. Counsellors will then be equipped to recognise when the child's/adolescent's and/or family's issues conflict with their own values and beliefs and to then ensure that this does not affect their role in providing quality HIV counselling for children and adolescents.3EmploymentLife Experiences GenderAge Culture Education ReligionSocial Circumstances Marital Status Friends, familyParental status25 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts SCEnArIOS CA uSIng POSSIbl E COnFlICT HIV counselling for children and adolescents is associated with numerous potentially sensitive issues and difficult scenarios. There are therefore a variety of situations which may cause potential conflict for the counsellor and challenge their values, attitudes and beliefs. Examples include: Belief that children and adolescents are too young to hear about sensitive issues (e.g. death, HIV, sex) Fear of talking about difficult issues with children and adolescents and of their responses Over-identification with the child and adolescent and family's situation (e.g. the counsellor would not want his/her own child and adolescent to be exposed to such information; the counsellor's child may be HIV positive) Strong disagreement with the family's approach to the situation Fears for own health and exposure to HIV infection Inadequate skills in controlled emotional involvement, coping with stressful situations and handling conflict Exposure of the child and adolescent and family to the counsellor's religious beliefs3 STrATEgIES FOr DEAlIng wITH C OnFlICT Strategies to assist counsellors to deal with situations which conflict with their own values, attitudes and beliefs include: Identification of his/her own values, attitudes and beliefs towards working with children and adolescents and providing HTS for this age group Acknowledging the influence of their personal values, beliefs and attitudes on their role Adherence to an impartial, non- judgmental approach Referring the child and family to another counsellor in the event that the counsellor is unable to fulfil his/her role Accessing support and counselling from colleagues and supervisors Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 201526ACTIVIT y 3: grOuP wOrk Refer to the Case Studies Section at the beginning of the manual,in small groups, review one of the cases, using the following questions to guide your discussions: 1.

Adults are independent beings who are in a position to make independent decisions and choices about issues affecting them. They are able to articulate what they think and how they feel. They have had opportunities to develop coping mechanisms and to establish support systems to help them through difficult experiences. In contrast, children and adolescents are vulnerable and are dependent on adults to assist them in meeting their needs. If these needs are not met, their healthy development and survival is threatened. Children and adolescents may not be able to articulate what they think and how they feel and they may be unable to cope with the different experiences they are faced with. In contrast to children, adolescents are maturing and have an increasing desire for independence and autonomy. They may be more able to articulate the way they are thinking and feeling. However, they remain reliant on adults to assist them in meeting their basic needs and for love, safety and support. As such, children and adolescents infected and affected by HIV are particularly vulnerable. Their experiences are commonly multi-faceted and complex. Counselling can assist children and adolescents with these challenges but it requires that the counsellor understands the needs of children and adolescents; the way children and adolescents think, feel and behave; the way they communicate their needs; and the way they cope with difficult situations. Understanding children and adolescents helps us to: Understand their needsACTIVIT y 2: u nDE rSTAnDIng CHI lDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTSWrite down one memorable experience from when you were a child that describes your experience of childhood.

Within these broad age bands, children and adolescents have very different needs. For example, the way a 2 year old thinks, feels, behaves and responds to events is considerably different to that of a 9 year old. Yet they are both children. One 10 year old child may think, feel and behave very differently from another 10 year old. Furthermore, the normal developmental needs of adolescents may often be neglected or misunderstood. By definition, they are still considered a child, yet they are in a transitional stage between childhood and adulthood with evolving physical, developmental, emotional and social needs. In order for children and adolescents to develop healthily, they have a variety of different needs which must be met. These will now be discussed. THE n EEDS OF CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The needs of children and adolescents can be considered in 4 dimensions: physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. Physical: to have shelter, food, physical care, clean water, clothing Psychological: to feel loved, valued and cared for; to feel accepted and respected; to be supported and understood; to be given choice; to have hopes and goals; to be able to trust; to have honest communication Social: to have a supportive home environment; socialisation with peers; access to educationSpiritual: to have peace of mind; sense of belonging; sense of purpose If these needs are not met then the healthy development and survival of the child/ adolescent is at risk.330 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015CHAllEngES In MEETI ng THESE n EEDS These needs are threatened by considerable challenges. Examples of these include: Poor health and disease Inadequate access to appropriate health care Death of family members Poverty Physical, emotional and sexual violence and neglect Cultural and societal attitudes towards children/adolescents, including gender issues Conflict of any form within and outside the home OblIgATIO n TO MEET THE n EEDS OF CHIl DrEn/ADO lESCE nTS Adults have a moral and social obligation to meeting the needs of children/adolescents, but they also have a legal obligation to do so. In 1990 the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child set out clear policy on the rights of the child in which it recognises the various needs of children/adolescents. wHy CHIl DrEn/ADO lESCE nTS ArE DIFFE rEnT All children/adolescents are different. The needs of children/adolescents, the way they think, feel and behave, the way they communicate their needs and the way they respond to difficulties in their lives is influenced by various factors, including: 1. Age and Developmental Stage 2. Understanding of Events 3. Past Experiences 4. Sense of control 5. Resilience 6. Support Systems 3 These different factors will be discussed in detail in the following pages.31 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts1. Age and Developmental Stage Children and adolescents are on a journey of great change, from the day they are born right through to adulthood. Importantly on this journey, it is not only the child's/ adolescent's physical abilities that develop but the way they think, understand and behave. At different points in this journey, a child and adolescent will: Think differently about the world around him/her Have different understanding about events affecting him/her Respond differently to events affecting him/her Communicate his/her needs differently It is important to note that these stages of development maybe be affected by chronic diseases. Therefore the counsellor must try and assess the stage of development at which each child and adolescent is operating. The following section has been taken from the International HIV/AIDS Alliance's Publication building b locks: Africa wide briefing notes, 2006 0 to 1 year: Consistency and Continuity At this stage, children learn about the world through their senses. They respond to faces, voices and bright colours, discover their hands and feet, smile, start to understand and say a few words, sit up, crawl, stand and start to explore and to play with objects. They need: Consistent parents/caregivers who respond to them Physical affection, including being held close and cuddled to help them feel secure Talk, things to look at, touch, hear and play with Physical protection and a safe environment to explore 1 to 3 years: Encouragement, Enthusiasm and Independence At this stage, children learn to walk and run, understand and speak words, communicate ideas and feed themselves. They become more independent and develop friendships but prefer familiar people. They like to help, can solve simple problems, enjoy learning new skills and show pride in accomplishments, but get frustrated if they cannot do things. They need: Opportunities to play with other children and adolescents and develop independence Encouragement and praise Someone who listens to and talks to them332 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 20153 to 5 years: Initiative and Inspiration At this stage, children talk a lot, ask questions, like to play with friends, learn to share, feel angry or guilty if they think they have failed; and become competitive, especially with their siblings and playmates. They also become more adventurous and start to imitate adults. They need: Opportunities to participate in activities, explore and make choices Help to learn to use language well through reading, talking and singing Praise when they try new things and do things well. 6 to 8 years: Curiosity and learning At this stage, children show increased interest in the world, people, letters and numbers. They become more physically confident, start to take responsibility, play cooperatively and build trust with friends, and use words to express feelings. They need: Support to develop additional language, physical and thinking skills Encouragement with school work Opportunities to learn cooperation and self-control, to take responsibility and complete tasks 8 to 10 years: Exploration and understanding At this stage, children have increased ability to understand things clearly, and need to put meaning to the events affecting them. They want to learn more about why things are as they are. They need: Explanations about why things are the way they are Encouragement to learn new things Opportunities to boost their self-esteem and confidence Lots of acknowledgement, constructive criticism and praise 10-19 years: Adolescence According to the World Health Organization (WHO): \"adolescents\" are individuals in the 10-19 years age group \"youth\" are individuals in the 15-24 years age group \"young people\" combine both adolescence and youth and include the 10-24 years age group. Adolescence has physical, psychological, emotional and socio-cultural dimensions. It is a phase in an individual's life, rather than a fixed age band, and is perceived differently in different societies. It is a period of exceptionally rapid growth and development. The rate of growth and development during adolescence is only exceeded by the rate of growth during fetal life and infancy. The body develops in size, strength and reproductive capabilities and the mind becomes capable of more abstract thinking. There is also an increase in emotional control.333 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsHowever, in comparison with infancy (when the milestones occur at a similar time for most infants), there is much greater individual variation both in:i) the timing of developmental milestones and ii) the timing and degree of changes in rates of growth during adolescence. This means that there can be great variations in development among adolescents of the same age and there are often significant differences between girls and boys. The individual's capacity for abstract and critical thinking also develops, along with a sense of self-awareness. The prefrontal cortex of the brain grows during adolescence, which affects social and problem solving skills. During adolescence, social relationships move from a family base to a wider network in which peers, other respected adults in the community, and also adults in the media (such as pop music and film stars) come to play more significant roles. The adolescent experiences change in social expectations and perceptions, which require an increased level of emotional maturity. Physical growth and development are accompanied by sexual maturation, often leading to intimate relationships. Adolescence is usually the time when sexual activity is initiated, as adolescents with little experience explore relationships and look for emotional and physical intimacy. Globally, puberty is occurring earlier and in many countries adolescents are having sex for the first time at a younger age than the previous generations. Worldwide, people are having sex for the first time at an average age of 17.7 years. Stages of Adolescence Adolescence can be grouped into three overlapping developmental stages, ages 10-15, 14-17 and 16-19 years. The overlap of ages is important because the changes are not fixed and happen at different ages for different adolescents. The stages provide a basic framework to understand adolescent development. The characteristics at each stage are normal and part of healthy development The first stage, early adolescence (10-15 years), is characterized by separation from family and identification with a peer group. Patterns of healthy behaviour are best established at this time, before health-risk behaviours develop. The second and third stages - middle stage (14-17 years) and late stage (16-19 years) of adolescence involve moving towards social and economic independence, including exploring livelihood options and secondary education. Staying in school past the primary years involves challenges for those adolescents who must pay fees or help support a family. brain Development Brain development continues in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence and well into early adulthood. This area of the brain contributes to the development of social and problem solving skills, regulating emotions and moderating moods. This is why adolescence is an important time to learn life skills. Life skills complement this phase of brain development, and can help adolescents to deal with the emotional changes and other challenges that they are experiencing and help in the transition to adulthood.334 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 20152. u nderstanding of Events Adults generally cope better with difficult events in their lives if they understand more about them. Similarly, children and adolescents need to be helped to understand the world around them so that they cope better. However, this need is often overlooked due to the common belief that they are either too young to understand certain information or that we as adults want to protect them from information which may hurt them or that we do not know how to talk with them about difficult issues. Whilst this may be true in many circumstances, there is ALWAYS something that can be said to young people to help them understand more, whatever their age or developmental stage. For example, a 5 year old child may not yet be ready to be told that they have HIV. However the child may be helped to understand more about his/ her situation with an explanation like the example below. Understanding children and adolescents' need for developmentally appropriate in - formation and their need to be involved in issues affecting them is an important part of understanding children and adolescents and meeting their needs. 3. Past Experiences It has been shown that even very young children and adolescents remember traumatic events. The past experiences of young people have a direct impact on the way they feel about current and future experiences and the way they cope and respond to them. Distressing, traumatic experiences in the past may lead to difficulties coping with similar events in the future.3 For example, a child and adolescent who has been traumatised whilst having blood taken in the past is very likely to be anxious and afraid of having blood taken in the future. Similarly, a child and adolescent who has been treated in an unfriendly, aggressive manner by counsellors in the past may be fearful of counsellors in the future. Conversely, a child and adolescent who was approached in a welcoming, friendly manner and was encouraged to share how they were feeling is more likely to feel that counsellors are there to listen to their problems and to help them. Understanding children and adolescents involves identifying their negative and positive experienc - es and recognising the impact they had on them.35 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts4. Sense of Control Another factor which influences the way children and adolescents think, feel and respond to the world around them is their sense of control. If children and adolescents feel they do not have control over something affecting them, this may lead to feelings of helplessness, fear and anxiety. Every effort must be made to involve children and adolescents, to listen to their views, to give them choices and to make them feel important. This can help them to cope better. This is particularly important for adolescents who are becoming increasingly autonomous and independent. Creative strategies are required to help increase children and adolescents' sense of control. Such strategies may appear to be simple to us but can have significant impact on children and adolescents when all decisions are usually made for them. 5. resilience Resilience is the term used to describe the child's ability to 'bounce back' (Mallman, 2002), and cope with the changing environment around them. In the same way that all children and adolescents are different, some are more resilient than others. Resilient children and adolescents are better equipped to cope with stressful events. All children and adolescents have the potential to be resilient but it must be developed. Therefore resilience must be encouraged in all children and adolescents to help them cope with the stressful events in their lives. Developing resilience Resilience can be encouraged and developed using different strategies. a) Assist the child to feel loved, secure and cared for Many of the emotions which children and adolescents experience when faced with difficult situations can be alleviated if they know they are loved and cared for.3 b) Spend time with the child Adults need to invest time and energy into understanding the child and adolescent and making him/her feel important, valued and heard. If a trusting, open relationship can be established, the child and adolescent is more likely to feel he can ask questions or ask for help and support. These questions must be answered honestly. In this way he will be helped to cope better due to a better understanding and sense of self-worth.36 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015c) Create opportunities for children and adolescents to express themselves Adults tend to express themselves through direct talk with others. However, children and adolescents require other means of expressing themselves. Creative activities often enable children and adolescents to express themselves in greater depth than through speech and are powerful tools to help children and adolescents express themselves. These are particularly helpful for younger children but also for older adolescents who are helped to share information and emotions not previously shared. Creative approaches for young people are often therapeutic in themselves. They can be adapted for each individual child and adolescent and their individual needs. Examples will be discussed later in Module 4. 6. Support systems The support systems available to a child and adolescent have a significant impact on the way he/she will respond to events in his/her life. If the child and adolescent lives within a strong, loving, supportive environment in which he/she feels secure, he/ she will be better equipped to deal with difficult events. However, if the environment is not supportive, the child and adolescent will be less able to cope with these difficulties. Support systems may take many different forms and include parents, parents/caregivers, other relatives, clinic staff, peers, church members, teachers, social welfare officers and community members. In the case of adolescents, for whom peer engagement is so supportive, it is often peer networks which are so helpful. The need for an individualised approach All children and adolescents are different in the way that they think, feel and behave, the way they communicate their needs and the way they respond to difficulties in their lives. An individualised approach to assessing and understanding each child and adolescent is therefore essential. This requires commitment and skill but ensures that appropriate measures can then be implemented to effectively meet the needs of each individual child and adolescent.337 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsSuMMAry A child is any individual under the age of 18 years An adolescent is any individual between 10-19 years of age The experiences of adolescents today are different from those faced by adolescents 10-20 years ago. Children and adolescents have a variety of physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs which must be met for their healthy development All children and adolescents are potentially vulnerable as they are dependent on others for realisation of these needs Understanding children and adolescents helps us to understand their needs and the way they think, feel and respond to events in their lives Adolescents living with HIV differ from adults and children living with HIV because of the rapid changes that occur during this stage of development. Adolescence is a period in which an individual undergoes tremendous physical, psychological and emotional changes. There is rapid growth and development of the body and brain, causing physical changes and changes in thinking, problem solving, social skills and relationships. It is important for health workers to understand the normal developmental changes in adolescence because they influence how adolescents behave and respond to information that they are given. All children and adolescents are different - there are a variety of factors which influence the way different children and adolescents think, feel, behave and respond to difficult situations in their lives, which has implications for their needs and capacities Knowing the changes that occur during childhood and adolescence can help health workers deal with difficult situations and understand their behaviour in the context of the individual's phase of development Understanding children and adolescents assists us to develop appropriate responses to effectively meet the needs of individual children and adolescents338 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Session 3: understanding the impact of HIV infection on children and adolescents Objectives At the end of the session participants should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of the physical, emotional and social impact of HIV on children and adolescents Explain and appreciate the wide range of emotions which children and adolescents with HIV may experience Activity 1: Discussion - Understanding the impact of HIV infection on children and adolescents Activity 2: Group work- Body mapping: The impact of HIV on children and adolescentsOverview of Activities:339 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsACTIVIT y 1: u nDE rSTAnDIng THE I MPACT OF HIV I nFECTIO n On CHIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS CHIl DrEn AnD ADOl ESCEnTS, HIV AnD VulnEr AbIlIT y Any child is vulnerable as th ey have not yet acquired the physical, emotional and social abilities required to adjust and cope independently with life. Children and adolescents with HIV are even more vulnerable due to the wide range of stressors impacting on them. These can dramatically affect the children and adolescents' quality of life. In order to effectively meet the needs of the children and adolescents they encounter, counsellors need to have an understanding of the range of physical, emotional and social stressors which make children and adolescents with HIV vulnerable. If counsellors are able to recognise and understand these, they may then help to alleviate their impact, thus improving the quality of life of those children and adolescents. PHySICAl STrESSOrS A child with HIV is faced with overwhelming physical stressors. Although the prognosis for children and adolescents with HIV has dramatically improved, HIV remains a chronic, lifelong condition for which there is currently no cure. In the absence of treatment with ART, the child becomes progressively weaker as the immune system and other parts of the body are damaged. The child is more susceptible to opportunistic infections. The symptoms of these infections and conditions are commonly painful and debilitating and dramatically affect quality of life. Children and adolescents require love and support from their parents or parents/caregivers to help them cope with the physical impact of HIV. Even on ART, children and adolescents may still become sick and require medical investigations and treatment. EMOTIOnAl STrESSOrS Children and adolescents with HIV have significant emotional needs. Whilst these may be more difficult to identify than the more obvious physical needs, they are just as significant. Children and adolescents with HIV face tremendous emotional challenges as a result of their own diagnosis but also commonly that of their loved ones. When a child should be playing and enjoying childhood, he/she commonly faces recurrent illnesses, the need to care for sick relatives, grief for the loss of relatives, fear of the future and stigma and discrimination. Adolescents are in a period of tremendous change. Some of the typical developmental needs of young people include the need to identify with their peers and to consider relationships and families of their own in the future. In addition to these needs, adolescents with HIV face difficult decisions and fears relating to disclosure of their HIV status to friends and partners and concerns around their future relationships and families. This can lead to overwhelming psychological distress for young people growing up with HIV and the risk of depression and anxiety is being increasingly recognised in this age group.340 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Importantly, a child and even adolescents may be unable to make sense of the many traumatic events happening around them, particularly when disclosure has not taken place or counselling has been inadequate. The impact of HIV may result in a variety of emotions in children and adolescents. These emotions significantly impact on their quality of life and include: Loss of Control / Helplessness Confusion Fear and Anxiety Anger Loneliness Abandonment Sadness Mistrust Each emotion will now be discussed in turn, addressing the potential causes and effects of each. Loss of Control / Helplessness Children and adolescents with HIV may frequently experience feelings of helplessness due to the range of events which occur beyond their control. Examples include: Loss of parents / siblings Recurrent illness and frequent medical investigations Drop out from school Child abuse Frequent change of residence Fear and Anxiety Numerous events occur in the lives of children and adolescents with HIV which may make them feel afraid or anxious. These usually result from not understanding what is happening to them. Common fears are: Will my mother/father die? Who will look after me then? What is happening to me? Will I keep having painful tests? Will I die too? What happens when I die? Will people find out that I am HIV positive? What happens if my ARVs stop working? Will I be able to get married and have children? What will happen to me?341 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsLoneliness All children and adolescents need to feel safe and loved by others. However, in addition to this need, children and adolescents living with HIV commonly face circumstances which lead them to feel lonely. These include: One or both parents may be dead Other family members or friends may not be in a position to provide the love the child needs Will they be stigmatised and discriminated against by friends , family, communities Sadness Children and adolescents with HIV may be grieving the loss of parents, siblings, other relatives and friends. They may also be feeling intense sadness about their own health and social circumstances. They may realise that they too, like their relatives who were also sick, may die. Confusion Confusion often arises from an inability to make sense of things. Children and adolescents with HIV commonly face a variety of situations which they are unable to make sense of or understand. This is then exacerbated when adults do not explain events appropriately as a result of being unsure of what to say to them. Adults often think children and adolescents do not need to know what is happening in their lives. But children and adolescents DO need to be helped with the many questions they may have. For example:3 Why did my mother/father die? Why do they ask me to leave the room while they talk about me? Why do I keep getting sick, even though I take the antibiotics? Why does everyone I love get sick? Why do I have to carry on taking this medicine if I am feeling better? But I have never had sex, so why am I HIV positive? Why am I sick more often than my friends? Why do I have to take lots of medicines/blood tests? Why do I have to miss so much school? What have I done wrong? Why do people talk about me / tease me?42 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Abandonment All children and adolescents need a great deal of love and a sense of security, yet children and adolescents who have lost parents or loved ones may feel a sense of abandonment as a result of questions including: Where is our mother/father? Why does he/she not want to take care of us anymore? Why have we been sent to live here? They don't want us Who will look after us now? Mistrust Understandably, adults have a strong desire to protect children and adolescents which leads them to sometimes withhold information that may hurt the child. However children and adolescents can be extremely perceptive and quickly sense when they are not being told something. Children and adolescents need to be able to trust adults in their lives. Mistrust can be very damaging - if children and adolescents are not told the truth, they may imagine or fantasise something that is far worse. Changes in Behaviour All these different emotions may be expressed in different ways, which may be misunderstood. When caring for children and adolescents with HIV, we need to be aware of the way some of these may be expressed. We can then try to understand why a child and adolescent may be behaving as he/she is, how he/she may be feeling and how we may help him/her. For example, an aggressive child and adolescent may be extremely afraid and that maybe his/her way of expressing this fear.3Anger One stage of the grief process is anger. Like adults, children and adolescents may experience this anger, particularly as they may not have been given any explanations for the death of their loved one(s). They may feel that someone is to blame for the death of their parent(s) or sibling(s). A child may not know how to express this anger. They may also feel anger surrounding their own HIV status.43 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsSadness, anxiety and fear are often expressed in behaviour changes, which may include: Withdrawal Bed wetting Aggression Self-harm Clinging Regression Abnormal behaviour Changes in sleep pattern It is increasingly recognized that adolescents with HIV are at risk of common mental disorders including anxiety and depression. It is vital that these adolescents are identified early and referred for appropriate psychological assistance. Social Stressors Finally, children and adolescents with HIV commonly face extreme social stressors and these in turn influence their physical and emotional needs. For example: May not be cared for properly as parent is sick May be cared for by elderly relatives, siblings or people who do not want to be caring for them Living in poverty Inadequate nutrition Poor access to health services Unable to attend school Frequent change in residence Unable to interact and socialise with peers SUMMAR y Children and adolescents living with HIV infection are exposed to numerous physical, emotional and social stressors and these are often recurrent as they continue to grow up into adulthood. Understanding these and the emotions they may generate is fundamental to understanding the children and adolescents counsellors are working with. The key to truly understanding children and adolescents is to listen and learn from the children and adolescents themselves. 344 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015ACTIVIT y 2: u nDE rSTAnDIng THE IMPACT OF HIV O n CHI lDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS In your small groups, take a large sheet of flipchart and draw the outline of a child and adolescent living with HIV.

Then present your map to the whole group, using it to describe the impact of HIV on the child and adolescents 314Module 4: Delivery of HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents HIV Testing Services in Zimbabwe are being provided in ways that maximize the accessibility of services for everyone. Children and adolescents in particular are being reached through facility based approaches (provider-initiated, client- initiated), as well as community based testing. In future, children and adolescents may be reached through home-based testing. In addition, if HTS are to be effective for children and adolescents and their families, they must be responsive to child and adolescent needs. This module discusses why this is important and the different components required for HTS that is responsive to the needs of children and adolescents. Legal and ethical considerations are subsequently discussed. Module Objectives: At the end of this module participants should be able to: Describe the different models of HTS delivery in Zimbabwe Describe the different components of services that are responsive to child and adolescent needs Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of services that are responsive to child and adolescent needs in the delivery of quality HTS for children and adolescents and their families Understand the legal and ethical framework within which HTS are provided for children and adolescents in Zimbabwe Session 1: Delivery of HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents Session 2: Legal and ethical considerations when providing HTS for children and adolescentsOverview of Sessions: Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Session 1: Delivery of HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents Objectives At the end of the session participants should be able to: Describe the different models of HTS delivery for children and adolescents in Zimbabwe Activity 1: Presentation -HTS delivery for children and adolescentsOverview of Activities:447 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts ACTIVIT y 1: D ElIVEry OF HTS SE rVICE FO r CHI lDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The Vision - what is the source? The Ministry of Health and Child Care remains committed to and focused on halting the spread of HIV and AIDS in line with the SDGs as well as achieving the 90.90.90 universal global targets by 2020 and ending AIDS by 2030. HTS remains a critical entry point to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. It is MOHCC's aim that all children and adolescents in Zimbabwe receive quality HTS services that provide them with correct HIV test results, counselling, and linkage to care, treatment and support. MODE lS OF HTS D ElIVEry In ZIMbAbwE 1. Provider-initiated HIV Testing Services (PITC) In the provider-initiated approach, health care workers should recommend HIV testing for all children and adolescents, attending health facilities as a standard part of medical care. Active implementation of this strategy increases access to HTS for children and adolescents, facilitates earlier diagnosis of HIV infected children and adolescents and early entry to treatment, care and support. It is also designed to reduce the number of children and adolescents presenting in the late stages of their illness. However, the adolescent or parent/caregiver has a right to decline or defer the test. Depending on the child's age and special circumstances, informed consent is obtained during the normal process of consultation between the health care worker and the child or parent/caregiver. It is important that the \"5Cs\"of HTS; Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct and accurate test results, Connections to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services are always observed. It is imperative to utilize all opportunities to offer HTS to children and adolescents. Common opportunities for providing these services can be found in the following PITC Settings: Antenatal, childbirth and postpartum health services Immunization visits Nutrition screening Inpatient and outpatient facilities (adults, children and adolescents, surgical, medical) STI services Health services for most-at-risk populations Reproductive health services Youth Friendly corners (manned by a trained service provider) Family and child health services (well-baby clinics )448 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 OI/ART clinic (for family centred-counselling) TB services Index testing Private facilities Services for OVCs Under 5s clinics NB: A \"routine\" offer of HIV Testing Services DOES NOT mean that testing is compulsory, mandatory or involuntary. PITC provides a simple way to improve access for children and adolescents to HTS. However, in order to achieve this, it is necessary to provide good group education offering pre-test information, efficient rapid HIV testing, quality post-test counselling and ensure provision or referral for other services. NB: Data on HTS collected from all these entry points must still be consolidated into comprehensive facility tallies for reporting at your facility 2. Client-initiated HIV Testing Services In the client initiated approach - also referred to as Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT), the client voluntarily makes a decision to know his/her HIV status and proactively seeks HTS at a site providing the service. S/he receives pre-test information to help him/her make an informed decision about whether to get tested or not. These are typically stand-alone sites supported by non-governmental organisations. VCT is also offered in public health institutions.4 The primary emphasis of VCT has been on adults - identifying HIV negative individuals and encouraging behaviour change and primary prevention of HIV infection. Conversely, VCT for children and adolescents has generally been used as a means of identifying HIV infection in symptomatic children and adolescents and those who have possibly been exposed to HIV through MTCT or sexual abuse. In VCT sites there is need to emphasise and encourage on index testing as well as family-centred HTS. 49 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 3. Other HTS approaches In some settings, both provider-initiated and client-initiated approaches can be utilized to provide HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents e.g. in the private sector or through outreach services. Where HTS are provided by health facilities, the services should be offered as an integral part of the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and nutrition screening services. Key Principles of HTS are retained in ALL approaches The 5Cs: Maintain Confidentiality Only to be conducted with informed Consent , meaning it is both informed and voluntary Be accompanied by Counselling Provide Correct and accurate test results Provide adequate Connections to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services COMM unITy PArTICIPATIO n Community members are important for creating demand for services and providing post-test support Community based service providers, such as trained community based and peer counsellors can create demand for these services and provide post-test care and support for children, adolescents and families Peer counsellors provide information, education and emotional support for children and adolescents who have undergone HTS. Peer counsellors can be particularly supportive to children and adolescents living with HIV who are on treatment. They can also encourage and support adolescents who are HIV negative to prevent acquisition of HIV later Support groups for children and adolescents who have undergone HTS and tested positive should be formed at community level so as to provide emotional and psychological support. This will be discussed in Module 7 SUMMAR y HTS for children and adolescents is offered through two service delivery models for both facility-based and community based approaches o Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling o Client Initiated/Voluntary Counselling and Testing The \"5 Cs\" of testing services should be retained in all approaches It is important that all four dimensions of policies and procedures, services provided, staff competence, attitudes and behaviour and environment be considered in order to provide HTS that is responsive to child and adolescent needs. 450 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Session 2: legal and Ethical Issues Pertaining to HIV Testing Services for children and adolescents Objectives At the end of the session participants should be able to: Describe the legal and ethical principles guiding HTS for children and adolescents Demonstrate an understanding of common legal and ethical issues encountered in HTS for children and adolescents Define the age of consent as applied to children and adolescents and HTS Define informed consent as applied to children and adolescents and HTS Ensure that consent for HTS for children and adolescents is applied in compliance with national policy and guidelines Manage difficult legal and ethical issues appropriately Activity 1: Presentation - Legal and Ethical Issues related to HTS for Children and adolescents Activity 2: Case Scenarios / Role PlayOverview of Activities:451 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsACTIVIT y 1: lE gAl AnD E THICA l ISSuES rE lATED TO HTS FO r CHIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS lEgAl AnD ETHICA l Pr InCIPlES In HTS FO r CHIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS Counsellors providing HTS for children and adolescents are commonly presented with various ethical and legal dilemmas. The Government of Zimbabwe has established clear policies and guidelines to ensure that children and adolescents have access to HTS which adhere to both national and international legal and ethical standards. Counsellors have a responsibility to ensure that they have accurate knowledge and understanding of these principles in order to protect the best interests of children and adolescents at all times. Five main legal and ethical principles guiding HTS for children and adolescents will be discussed. These are: Rights of the Child, Age of Consent, Best Interests of the Child, Informed Consent and Confidentiality. 1. rights of the Child ( un Convention on the r ights of the Child, 1990) Zimbabwe is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is therefore committed to upholding the rights of the child. Child rights are ethical principles that bind all service providers to do all that is necessary and available to provide the best possible care for children and adolescents. Every child has an inherent right to: Life Freedom of expression Protection Participation Provision for basic needs Access to adequate health care Adequate standard of living Refer to Definitions of Terms for HTS Section The Government has declared that it is every Zimbabwean's right to know his or her HIV status regardless of the individual's age. Therefore HTS should be made available to children and adolescents when indicated, ensuring that their rights are not violated and post-test treatment, care and support services are available. Furthermore, HTS must be provided in an environment where child rights are respected. 2. Age of Informed Consent Age of Informed Consent refers to when a child and adolescent is considered legally competent to agree to an action. The age of informed consent for HTS recognizes that children/adolescent may require an HIV diagnosis in order to receive optimum 452 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015health care. Children and adolescents who require an HIV test may also require life- saving antiretroviral treatment. If a parent/caregiver is not available to give consent for the child, denying that child an HIV test is tantamount to denying that child a right to life. The age of informed consent for HTS further recognizes that children below the age of 16 have the mental capacity to understand the consequences of HIV Testing Services. A Caregiver is a person who is providing day-to-day care for the child and adolescent which may include: Providing the child with a place to live Providing financial support to the child Protecting the child from harm Guiding and directing the child's education and upbringing Guiding the child in decision-making Taking care of the best interests of the childwho is a Caregiver? The Ministry of Health and Child Care's National Guidelines for HTS for Children and Adolescents recognizes that children and adolescents be active agents in their own lives but they also need to be afforded appropriate protection in accordance with their relative immaturity and youth. While most parents act in the best interests of the child, this is not always the case. Therefore, the HTS guidelines provide health workers with a mechanism for ensuring that children/adolescent's rights are upheld. They clearly define age of consent for children and adolescents accessing HTS as follows: 16 years or Above: Any child aged 16 years or above, or is married, pregnant or a parent, who requests HIV Testing Services is considered able to give full informed consent for HIV Testing Services. Below 16 years of age: The consent of a parent/caregiver is required before providing HTS for a child who is below 16 years of age. A child below the age of 16 years who is considered a mature minor or emancipated minor is able to give informed consent453 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsWho is a Mature Minor? A mature minor is a child and adolescent who can demonstrate that he or she is mature enough to make a decision on their own. A counsellor should consider the following factors in determining whether a child and adolescent should be treated as a mature minor: The minor's ability to appreciate the seriousness of HTS and the test result and to give informed consent The minor's physical, emotional and mental development The degree of responsibility the minor has assumed for his or her own life, such as heading a household or living independently from a parent/caregiver If a parent/caregiver will not or cannot give consent for a child and adolescent below 16 years of age, yet the health worker believes HTS to be in the best interest of the child and adolescent, the health workers can exercise the 'best interest of the child' principle and seek approval from the person in charge of the clinic or hospital to provide HTS. Age of consent for children and adolescents below the age of 16 years must be handled with extreme care in order to ensure that the rights of the child and adolescent and the family are upheld. Counsellors must be equipped with accurate knowledge and skills to deal with these scenarios. 3. The b est Interests of the Child The second guiding principle is that: \"The best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration\" This principle applies when: A child and adolescent is ill and diagnosis will facilitate appropriate care and treatment A child and adolescent is a survivor of sexual abuse A child and adolescent has been exposed to HIV through vertical or sexual transmission A child and adolescent expresses concern that, given an HIV positive result, he or she will be denied access to care and treatment by a parent/caregiver A child and adolescent concerned about MTCT This principle may be used under these circumstances in order for the provider to ensure that the child and adolescent is provided with adequate care and support, sometimes in conflict with the parent/caregiver. When counsellors face legal and ethical dilemmas, this principle guides the counsellor in how to manage the situation. If the counsellor acts in the best interests of the child and adolescent at all times, the child and adolescent will be protected and legal and ethical principles upheld.454 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 4. Informed consent \"Informed consent\" refers to a child and adolescent or parent/caregiver being given an opportunity to: Consider the benefits and potential difficulties associated with having access to information regarding the child and adolescent's HIV status Express an understanding of the testing procedure Take a decision for the child and adolescent to be tested (or not to be tested) for HIV. The child and adolescent and parent/caregiver should be able to consider the implications of a positive HIV test result on the child and adolescent's life and the life of his/her family The welfare of the child and adolescent must be the primary concern when considering testing a child and adolescent for HIV. When a child and adolescent is brought to a facility providing HTS, the counsellor should meet with the parent/ caregiver to determine the reason for testing. If the counsellor feels that testing is not in the best interest of the child and adolescent, then the counsellor may use his or her discretion to postpone testing. However, counselling should be provided to both the child and adolescent and the parent/caregiver even if the counsellor does not carry out testing of the child and adolescent. The counsellor or other service provider should also use this opportunity to discuss and encourage HIV testing for the parent/caregiver so that they can also benefit from knowing their HIV status. HIV testing must be voluntary, with the child and adolescent or parent/caregiver making an informed decision about taking an HIV test. The counsellor should explain the procedure and make sure that the child and adolescent or parent/caregiver is requesting HIV testing without coercion. While approaches to obtaining informed consent can be flexible, the fundamental value to be applied is respecting the needs of the child and adolescent and what is ultimately within their best interests. Elements of Obtaining Informed Consent (MOHCC, 2014) The three crucial elements in obtaining truly informed consent in HIV testing are: 1. Providing pre-test information on the purpose of testing 2. The prevention, treatment, care and support available once the test result is known 3. Ensuring understanding by the child and adolescent (if of an appropriate age) and parent/caregiver, while respecting their autonomy It is only when these elements are in place that a child and adolescent and/or parent/ caregiver can make a fully informed decision on whether or not the child and adolescent should be tested for HIV.455 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Informed Consent for children and adolescents presenting with a parent/caregiver The application of the term \"informed consent\" varies according to the child's/ adolescent's age as detailed below. In all cases, the overriding consideration should be the best interests of the child and adolescent. However, it is critical that an assessment of the child's/adolescent's development and understanding is carried out. Below is a general guide for different age groups and their capacity to give consent. 0 to 6 years The child and adolescent at this stage is totally dependent on the parent/caregiver and therefore incapable of giving consent. The decision for the child and adolescent to be tested is solely the parent's or caregiver's responsibility unless otherwise determined by the counsellor in the child's/adolescent's best interests. Nonetheless, the child and adolescent should still receive age-appropriate information that addresses their psychological and emotional needs. Thus young children benefit from having a simple but accurate explanation of what is happening and having their parent/caregiver present in a supportive role during testing. 7 to 15 years At this stage the child and adolescent may have the capacity to understand the implications of the test and hence be able to agree (assent) or not agree to the test. However, the guidelines require that consent for HIV testing be obtained from the parent/caregiver, unless the child and adolescent is a mature or emancipated minor. The child and adolescent should, however, demonstrate both understanding and consent to be tested. 16-18 y ears The adolescent can give his or her own informed consent for HIV testing Informed Consent Consent to an HIV test must be provided voluntarily. Although HIV testing may be initiated by a service provider, as in PITC, the counsellor should ensure that consent has been given freely and that a child has not been unduly influenced by adults written or Verbal Consent There is no distinction at law between written or verbal consent as both can be binding. Therefore it is acceptable for counsellors to have verbal consent only, before providing HTS. Informed Consent for children and adolescents in Special Circumstances There are children and adolescents in special circumstances where Informed Consent presents particular challenges, including sick children and adolescents, orphans and vulnerable children and adolescents and sexually abused children and adolescents.456 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Sick children and adolescents In Zimbabwe HIV testing for sick children and adolescents is part of the standard of care for optimum management of the child's/adolescent's condition, in cases where HIV testing will result in better care for the child and adolescent. Both the child and adolescent and the parent/caregiver must receive appropriate counselling on the importance of knowledge of the child's/adolescent's HIV status for better management and care of the child and adolescent. Orphans and vulnerable children and adolescents Children and adolescents who do not have a caregiver pose a challenge to providers of HTS as they do not have a support system in place. Children and adolescents should be encouraged to identify someone who can provide them with appropriate support. HIV testing services cannot be provided before ensuring that consent has been obtained from a caregiver and that the child and adolescent has adequate support systems in place. In the case of children and adolescents living in institutions, the head of the institution should give informed consent. The head of the health facility is able to give consent on behalf of minors presenting without a parent/caregiver. Children and adolescents living with disabilities Children and adolescents living with disabilities, such as hearing, visual impairments and mental health concerns, have the right to access HTS. This includes appropriate materials and counselling to ensure full understanding of the HIV test, test results and linkages to HIV prevention, care and treatment. In the case of children and adolescents with mental health concerns, regardless of age, a parent/caregiver should provide informed consent. Sexually abused children and adolescents Since knowledge of the child's/adolescent's HIV status will assist in the management of the child and adolescent, an HIV test should be carried out as part of the standard of care for sexually abused children and adolescents. Management of the HIV positive child and adolescent should be in accordance with the MOHCC's ART guidelines. All children and adolescents who have been sexually abused must have access to HIV testing and PEP as soon as possible after the incident, but within 72 hours, in accordance to the National ART Guidelines (2013) on PEP. 5. Confidentiality Confidentiality is an agreement between a service provider, child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver. Therefore, information revealed by the child and adolescent or parent/caregiver in trust will not be disclosed to others without the permission of the child and adolescent or parent/caregiver.457 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Confidentiality is one of the guiding principles for the provision of HTS and must be protected at all times. The child's/adolescent's privacy should be respected. It is important to remember that a child's/adolescent's positive HIV status at any age may be assumed to mirror that of the parents and can result in the family being stigmatized. Shared Confidentiality is when a child and adolescent or parent/caregiver attending a health facility involves significant others in the HTS process, including receiving the HIV test result. These others may include family members, friends, relevant health workers involved in the medical care in clinical settings, or court officials. Shared confidentiality has been shown to help people living with HIV and those affected by HIV to reduce stigma and denial. It also helps them to be accepted and supported by the community. Confidential Record Keeping All records of provision of HTS for the child and adolescent must be managed in accordance with appropriate standards of confidentiality, as prescribed by the MOHCC. Only persons with a direct role in the management of the child and adolescent should have access to these records. POSTPO nIng An HIV TEST During the pre-test information session, if the counsellor feels that testing is not in the best interest of the child and adolescent, then the counsellor may use his or her discretion to postpone testing. HIV testing is generally in the best interests of a child and adolescent if it promotes the child's/adolescent's physical and emotional welfare, for example, by permitting access to appropriate care and treatment, or encouraging risk reduction. However, it is necessary to assess whether there are any reasons why testing may not be, at a particular time, in the best interests of the child and adolescent. The following are some reasons that could justify a decision to postpone or not test a child and adolescent: Significant emotional distress (to the extent that the child and adolescent cannot, even with support, participate meaningfully in the assessment process, or would be unlikely to cope with a positive result) Imminent risk to the safety of the child and adolescent where the child and adolescent has indicated or the counsellor has determined, that a positive result could provoke a harsh or abusive response from a member of the child's family or social unit, including stigma and discrimination Lack of social support to assist the child and adolescent to cope with a positive result and its implications There is evidence that the child and adolescent has been coerced to come for testing. It is important that any decision to refuse the child and adolescent testing on a particular occasion should be taken with care and after careful consultation with the child, bearing in mind: 458 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 The need to respect and promote the child's sense of urgency and control The barriers that the child and adolescent will have had to overcome in coming for testing The likelihood of the child and adolescent having been exposed to HIV transmission (and possibly the risk of continued HIV exposure) The fact that refusing testing will block or delay access to treatment if required To encourage careful and consistent decisions, assessments should, if possible, be discussed with a senior colleague before the child and adolescent is informed of the outcome. Difficult cases and decisions to refuse testing should always be discussed with a registered professional colleague (e.g. nurse) before the child and adolescent is informed of the outcome. Where a decision is made to refuse to allow a child and adolescent to be tested on a particular occasion, the reasons must be conveyed to the child and adolescent honestly and respectfully, using an approach appropriate to the child's level of development and emotional state. A decision not to allow the child and adolescent to be tested should be accompanied by a referral for further counselling and, if appropriate, provision of a new date for HTS. SuMMAry HTS for children and adolescents commonly present ethical and legal dilemmas. HTS for children and adolescents is guided by seven main legal and ethical principles - Rights of the Child, Age of Consent, Best Interests of the Child, Informed Consent, Postponing an HIV test, Confidentiality and disclosure. Every Zimbabwean has the right to know his/her HIV status regardless of age. The best interests of the child and adolescent shall be a primary consideration. In Zimbabwe, the law states that any child and adolescent who is aged 16 years or above and is requesting HIV testing should be considered able to give full informed consent. The consent of a parent/ caregiver is required before performing an HIV test on a child and adolescent who is below 16 years of age. Mature or \"emancipated minors\" should not be denied access to HIV Testing Services. A mature minor presenting on his/her own is therefore able to consent for testing. The application of \"informed consent\" varies according to the child's age and development.4 ACTIVIT y 2: C ASE S CEnArIOS: lEgAl AnD E THICA l ISSuES Discuss the legal and ethical considerations of the case studies presented Case Studies section59 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts15Module 5: Counselling children and adolescents Counselling for children and adolescents shares many of the underlying principles and approaches used when counselling adults.

( THE AIM OF CO unSEllIng FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS What is the purpose of counselling for children and adolescents? What are we aiming for? Counselling is important for children and adolescents in a variety of different situations. It is intended to: Help them to cope with the situations they face, challenges they experience and their emotions Help them to develop coping strategies to minimise the negative impact of the situations they face562 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Help them to make choices and decisions that will improve their quality of life Equip them with accurate and appropriate information in a way that they can understand Empower them by involving them in their care Assist them to develop goals and to recognise and build on their own strengths Promote their sense of self control, self-esteem and reduce anxiety COrE Pr InCIPlES OF CO unSEllIng C HIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The aims of counselling children and adolescents are achieved by adhering to a variety of core principles. Many of these principles also apply when counselling adults. These will now be discussed in detail. Confidentiality Counselling for children and adolescents is confidential. According to their level of understanding, children and adolescents are informed that the information they choose to share with the counsellor is private and will not be shared with others. However there may be specific circumstances when the information may be shared if it is in the best interest of the child. The child and adolescent will be informed whenever such circumstances arise. Acceptance Counselling for children and adolescents involves an attitude of positive regard, unconditional warmth and understanding towards the child, adolescent and his/her family's circumstances. When the child and adolescent and/or family feel accepted they are able to be more open about themselves and their situation. Individualism Counselling for children and adolescents acknowledges each of them as a unique individual, with their own experiences and concerns. It involves careful, skilled assessment of the needs of each individual child and adolescent and their family and a flexible approach to counselling in order to meet those needs and concerns. The requirement for such individualised care and support is one of the most challenging yet most vital parts of counselling for children and adolescents. Non-judgmental Counselling for children and adolescents is non-judgmental. It respects the individual opinions, thoughts and behaviour of children and adolescents and their families, even when these conflict with the views of the counsellor. The counsellor is genuinely interested in the child and adolescent and family without prejudice. It also avoids negative \"labelling\" of the child and adolescent.563 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsSelf Determination Counselling for children and adolescents acknowledges that children and adolescents have the right and need to be involved in their own care and decisions which affect them. According to the age and development of individual children and adolescents, the counsellor uses different skills and techniques to involve the child and adolescent in decision making where possible. Controlled Emotional Involvement Counselling for children and adolescents involves a genuine care and emotional concern for the child and adolescent and family. The counsellor empathises with the child, adolescent and family in a controlled and objective way. Purposeful Expression of Feelings Counselling for children and adolescents ensures that the child and adolescent, and/ or family are given opportunities to express their emotions. It utilises child-friendly techniques and ensures that the child and adolescent and family have space and time to verbalise or demonstrate how they feel about events in their lives. Open and honest Counselling for children and adolescents is open and honest. It never involves lies or deceiving the child and adolescent. It respects the needs and rights of children and adolescents for accurate, honest information. Where it is considered inappropriate to share all information with the child and adolescent until a later date (e.g. disclosure of HIV status) then the counsellor is committed to sharing appropriate information in a way that the child and adolescent can understand and cope with (e.g. \"Unfortunately your body is not as strong as it should be which is why you are getting sick. But we have medicines which will help to make your body stronger again so that you do not become so sick\" ). The nature and content of this information is discussed and agreed beforehand with the family.564 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Consistent Counselling for children and adolescents is consistent. It does not involve providing the child and adolescent with different information and confusing messages. It acknowledges that information shared in the wrong way, at the wrong time by people not trained to do it could be harmful to the child and adolescent and family. Where possible, children and adolescents are counselled by the same counsellor - this encourages the development of trusting, open relationships in which the child and adolescent feels able to share information and avoids the need for the child and adolescent to continually repeat his/her experiences and concerns to different people. Voluntary Counselling for children and adolescents is voluntary. Counselling is typically sought by a family member or caregiver, but depending on the age and development of the child and adolescent, the child and adolescent may seek counselling themselves. Regardless of who seeks the service, neither child and adolescent nor family is to be coerced into counselling. Conducive Environment Counselling for children and adolescents aims to help children and adolescents feel safe and secure. A child and adolescent friendly environment is essential and assists children and adolescents to feel comfortable and relaxed in a non-threatening environment. For adolescents, the involvement of peers can also be a useful way an accommodating environment that allows adolescents to seek care. Adolescents may find that their peers are better able to give them support and offer practical and appropriate advice on living with HIV. Health workers should assist in the training of peer educators, and help peer educators to start support groups for adolescents living with HIV. bArrIErS TO HTS FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The Ministry of Health and Child Care has made significant efforts to improve access to HTS for children and adolescents, through the revision of the guidelines for HTS for children, training of child and adolescent counsellors across the country and the implementation of HTS campaigns targeting children and adolescents. However, children and adolescents continue to face barriers when accessing HTS, including: Legal and ethical issues surrounding age of consent Inadequate number of health care workers trained to provide HTS services for children and adolescents Inadequate laboratory infrastructure for early infant diagnosis of HIV Inadequate child and adolescent friendly organisational structures and procedures Lack of perceived benefits of testing children and adolescents by society, communities and families, leading to: o Negative attitudes towards testing children and adolescents o Reluctance of families to have their children and adolescents tested o The need for innovative HTS strategies that reach out to the adolescent age group565 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts quAlITIES OF A g OOD C HIlD AnD ADO lESCE nT COunSEllOr Quality counselling for children and adolescents relies on good counsellors.

Vacation Excusing one member while the other remains in session can be used in couples counselling to facilitate disclosure. Core Counselling Skills Questioning skills - closed and open ended Listening skills Empathizing Affirming Summarising Counselling requires a variety of skills and techniques for adults, children and adolescents. However when counselling a child and adolescent, the process is enhanced when we use certain skills that take into account the child's/adolescent's developmental stage, current needs and context. Some of these skills and techniques include: 1. Establishing a relationship Establishing a relationship with the child and adolescent at the beginning of the counselling session is essential. Children and adolescents need to feel safe, secure and confident that they can trust the counsellor in order for them to communicate what they are thinking and feeling. This process of establishing a relationship is also known as 'joining'. Joining is also an important part of counselling for adults but joining with children and adolescents involves a variety of different techniques, including: Welcoming the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver in a warm friendly manner Stand up to greet the child and adolescent and the parent/caregiver. Get down to the child's level to greet him/her where necessary Offer the child and adolescent the seat nearest you, indicating you are interested in him/her Acknowledge the child and adolescent , showing them clearly that you are interested and happy to see him/her, not just the parent/caregiver Introduce yourself so that the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver can get to know you For children and adolescents who can talk, take time to ask the child and adolescent to introduce himself/herself. Show the child /adolescent you want to know from him/her, not just the parent/caregiver. This is important even for very young children and adolescents Talk with the child and adolescent about something they are interested in, that they like to do, that they have done that day or play a game with them570 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Use positive body language at all times, such as leaning towards them, looking directly at the child and adolescent , and use of friendly facial expressions Explain to the child and adolescent that your role is to talk with children and adolescents to find out what problems they are having so that you can try to help with those problems. 2. Open Ended q uestions Children and even adolescents are often ignored - rather than talking with them, adults tend to talk about them. They are commonly left to sit quietly and are not engaged in conversations. Counselling for children and adolescents requires that they are asked questions, providing them with an opportunity to tell their own story and to describe how they are feeling. This may well be the first time in their life when they have been given such an opportunity and is an extremely important part of understanding and assessing the child and adolescent's needs. Asking questions involves: Asking open ended questions, such as \"Can you tell me about....?\" Asking simple, straightforward questions Using words that they will understand A non-threatening, sensitive and caring approach Looking at things from the child's point of view Patience. Do not rush the child and adolescent - he/she may need time to gain the confidence or words to reply to your question 3. reflective listening In the same way that children and adolescents are often not asked questions, they are often not listened to. Effective counselling requires that children and adolescents are not only asked questions but that they are listened to. This may be an unusual experience for the child and adolescent and the role of the counsellor is to show the child and adolescent that you really want to hear what they have to say: Use positive body language to show the child and adolescent you are really listening and that you are interested (e.g. maintain eye contact, lean forward, positive facial expressions) Make the child and adolescent feel that she/he is the most important person to you at that time Encourage the child and adolescent that you are listening by responding with \"Yes\", \"OK\" etc. Do not interrupt - wait for the child and adolescent to finish talking Do not judge what the child and adolescent is saying or show shock, anger or other negative emotions Observe the child's verbal and nonverbal behaviour571 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 4. Clarify and Summarise Children and adolescents may find it difficult to articulate clearly what they are thinking and feeling. Counsellors therefore need to regularly clarify and summarise what the child and adolescent has been saying in order to ensure that they have gained an accurate understanding of what the child and adolescent is saying. Summarise what you have been saying at the end of the counselling session, and when you are moving from sub-session to sub-session Occasionally summarise what the child and adolescent has been saying Ask the child and adolescent to confirm that this is what he/she meant? If it is not clear what the child and adolescent is saying, encourage the child and adolescent in an open, friendly manner to explain further what he/she meant so that you really understand. Avoid discouraging them from talking further. 5. Empathy Use of empathy in counselling children and adolescents is an important technique for showing the child and adolescent that he/she has your support. It helps to give them strength. Show the child and adolescent that you understand what they have been/are going through Do not pity or sympathise with the child and adolescent as this can make the child and adolescent feel more helpless Help the child and adolescent to realise their strengths 6. Providing Opportunities for Children and adolescents to Express Themselves As stated earlier, children and adolescents may find it very difficult to articulate or share how they are thinking and feeling. Creative, visual strategies are powerful tools for providing children and adolescents with an opportunity to express them. In turn, these assist the counsellor to understand more about the child. These techniques require time, commitment and the right attitude. However, if children and adolescents are provided with these opportunities, the results are very rewarding. Examples include Drawing, Story Telling, Drama and Play COunSE llIng T ECH nIquES Acknowledgement: The following section is from \"Guidelines for counselling Children and adolescents who are infected with HIV or Affected by HIV\", SAT, 2003. Drawing Drawing can be a powerful activity for opening 'hidden cupboards' in a child's/ adolescent's life. It enables children and adolescents to communicate their emotional 572 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 state without having to put it into words. Most children and adolescents enjoy drawing and it is a useful practical tool for counselling When using drawing as a counselling tool, it is helpful to: Give the child and adolescent different materials to use (e.g. pencils, pens, paints, crayons ) Ask the child and adolescent to draw something related to what you would like them to explore (e.g. ask them to \"Draw a picture of your family having fun\" or \"Draw a picture of something that makes you angry\") Gently follow up by asking the children and adolescents to describe what is happening in their drawing Use 'open' questions to encourage them to talk more about what they have drawn and why (e.g. how do the people in the drawing feel about what is happening?) Story TellingChildren and adolescents tend not to like lots of direct questions or long lectures. When they are finding it difficult to talk about painful issues, listening to a story about someone in a similar position can be very comforting. It can give the child and adolescent a sense of being understood, and it can help them to recognise that they are not alone. A story can also serve as a useful tool for problem solving around their own situation. When using story telling as a counselling tool, it is helpful to: Use a familiar story, fable or folktale to convey a message to the child, perhaps using animals to represent humans Avoid using real names or events At the end of the story, encourage the child and adolescent to talk about what happened e.g. ask about the message of the story to confirm that the child and adolescent has understood its relevance If helpful, ask the child and adolescent to make up a story, based on a topic that you give them e.g. Tell me a story about a little girl who was very sad Drama Drama or role play is an excellent way for children and adolescents - and friends, siblings and other family members to raise issues they want to communicate with others, but find difficult to discuss directly. When using drama as a counselling tool, it is helpful to: Give the children and adolescents a topic to perform - such as \"A Day in my Life\" - that is related to issues you want to explore with them After the performance, encourage each child and adolescent to discuss what happened in the drama and what issues came up Ask questions to explore specific areas such as \"What was the happiest / saddest part of the day?\"573 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Play Adults often think play serves no serious purpose. Yet play is an important way that children explore their feelings about events and make sense of their world. When children play, much of their activity involves imitation or acting out, which helps us to begin to understand what type of emotions they are experiencing. When using play as a counselling tool, it is helpful to: Give the child and adolescent a variety of play materials including simple everyday objects and toys Ask the child and adolescent to show you parts of their life using the play materials e.g. \"Show me what you like to do with your family\". While the child and adolescent is using the objects to show you, you can ask him or her also to tell you what is happening Follow and observe what the child and adolescent is doing and do not take over the play. If you want to check that you have understood what the child and adolescent is communicating, make comments e.g. \"I see the mummy doll is so sick she cannot get out of bed\" and see if the child and adolescent agrees If the child and adolescent gets stuck and cannot proceed further ask him or her questions such as \"What is going to happen next?\" or \"Tell me about this person\". Such questions can help them to continue. CHAllE ngES In COunSEllIng CHIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS Effective counselling requires assessment and understanding of the way an individual is thinking, feeling and coping with events in their life. When counselling children and adolescents, there are various factors which make this process difficult and thus act as challenges in effective counselling. These include the following: The age, developmental stage, prior and current experiences of the child and adolescent may make it difficult for children and adolescents to articulate their thoughts and feelings Children and adolescents may find it difficult talking with strangers Children and adolescents may find it difficult to trust adults or strangers Children and adolescents are commonly not given the opportunity to talk or be listened to Counsellors may have inadequate training or experience in counselling children and adolescents Counselling children and adolescents may require more frequent/regular sessions than counsellors may be able to commit to Attitudes and beliefs of counsellors may affect their willingness or commitment to engage children and adolescents in counselling574 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015SuMMAry Good communication is an essential component of counselling. Effective counselling requires assessment and understanding of the way an individual is thinking, feeling and coping with events in their life. When counselling children and adolescents, there are various factors which make this process difficult and thus act as challenges in effective counselling. One of the most important skills required of child and adolescent counsellors is the ability to overcome challenges in communicating with children and adolescents. This then enables the counsellor to accurately assess and understand what the child and adolescent is thinking and feeling and identify how best to meet their needs. This is achieved with the use of child and adolescent friendly counselling skills and techniques which are adapted according to the age, development and individual needs of each child and adolescent. As with all people, adolescents need to be treated with respect so that they act on the information given to them. Adolescents may find that their peers are better able to give them support and offer practical and appropriate advice on living with HIV. Health workers should assist in the training of peer educators, and help peer educators to start support groups for adolescents living with HIV.

The counselling process will depend on the special circumstances and developmental stage of the child and adolescent and needs to be adjusted accordingly. It is important to remember that when a child and adolescent is living with HIV, the whole family is affected and will need counselling. There are particular times when HIV counselling is required for children and adolescents and their families, which include: Pre and post HIV testing Disclosure of HIV status to the child or adolescent Loss of family members and/or friends The child and adolescent's own illness ART initiation and adherence counselling Disclosure by the child and adolescent child and adolescent to others Sexual and Reproductive health and rights issues Psychological distress, mental health disorders Difficult situations such as stigmatisation, change in social circumstances and specific concerns of the child The purpose of this training is to focus on the counselling involved when providing HIV testing and follow up care and support for children and adolescents.

It is a useful tool for counsellors as it helps to guide them through the different stages of counselling. However, it should not be applied too rigidly - a flexible, individualised approach is required for every child and family. The different stages of the counselling process for children and adolescents and their families are: Preparing clients for testing Welcoming and building relationships Gathering and providing information Problem solving, decision making and planning (MOHCC, 2006)78 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015POTE nTIAl bA rrIErS TO q uAlITy CO unSEllIng FO r CHIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS There are various barriers to the delivery of quality counselling for children and adolescents.

IMPACT OF n OT CO unSEllIng CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS By not counselling children and adolescents in difficult circumstances, we make them even more vulnerable: They are unable to understand events in their lives They may experience a range of emotions which may negatively impact on their quality of life They cannot be assisted to develop coping strategies to reduce the impact of events in their lives They may not be equipped with correct information regarding their situation COunSE llIng C HIlDrEn HTS for children and adolescents requires an assessment and understanding of the way an individual is thinking, feeling and coping with events in their life. Various factors make this process of understanding the way or child and adolescent is thinking difficult with children and act as barriers. For example: 679 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Tso Age and developmental stage of the children commonly makes it difficult for them to articulate thoughts and feelings. o Children may find talking with strangers difficult. o Children may find it difficult to trust adults or strangers. o Children are commonly not used to being given the opportunity to talk or to be listened to. o Counsellors may have inadequate training or experience in counselling children. o Counsellors may not have the time required for quality counselling for children. o Attitudes and beliefs of counsellors may affect their willingness or commitment to engage children. COunSEllIng ADO lESCE nTS Part of the normal adolescent development is \"breaking loose\" from adults in general, and parents in particular. This need for separation and independence may interfere with the relationship and good communication between the health worker and the adolescent, especially if the health worker treats the adolescent in a manner that reminds the adolescent of a dominating parent. As children enter adolescence, their parents are still largely responsible for all aspects of their health, and the main communication is often between the health worker and the parent/caregiver. By the end of adolescence, health issues will be almost entirely the responsibility of the adolescent. The challenge for the health worker is to maintain an effective and consistent clinical relationship, when the primary responsibility for issues such as adherence shifts from the parents to the adolescent. It may be important to meet adolescents alone, as well as with their parents or guardian. Health workers need to consider how they will communicate with accompanying adults in a manner that is respectful both to the rights of the adolescent and to their parent or other caregiver. Do not exclude parents/caregivers, but make it clear that the adolescent is the centre of the consultation. Do this routinely as a way of respecting the adolescent's rights and maintaining their trust. Each situation needs to be managed and assessed individually in light of the circumstances and the legal situation in the country. Practical guidelines should be made available to health workers, which provide information about national policies and legislation relating to the provision of services to adolescents, including issues of consent. 680 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 ACTIVIT y 2: Pr E-TEST I nFO rMATIO n FO r CHI lDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS Pre-test information giving for children and adolescents shares many of the aims of pre-test information giving for adults. However, the circumstances of each individual child and family attending for pre-test information vary considerably. The aim and content of the counselling session is determined by the child and adolescent's age, development, current level of understanding, ability to cope with information about HIV and the caregiver's readiness to share information with the child and adolescent. Whilst ideally, a child and adolescents would be informed that the test is to determine whether they are infected with HIV or not, it is acknowledged that some children and adolescents and/or their families will not yet be ready for open discussion about HIV with the child and adolescent. In this case, the child and adolescent still requires developmentally appropriate explanations to help them understand more about the process, without directly referring to HIV. However, adolescents should be informed that the test they are undergoing is for HIV. Pre-test information giving is a process which takes place in partnership with the child and adolescent child and adolescent and the child's parent/caregiver, unless particular circumstances exclude the need for the parent/caregiver to be present (e.g. 16 year olds can consent for testing themselves if they are an emancipated minor or mature minor). AIMS OF PrE-TEST InFOrMATIO n gIVIng FOr CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The aims of Pre-test information giving for children and adolescents are to: Establish who can give consent for HIV testing Assess the child and adolescent child and adolescent 's age, developmental stage, current level of understanding, ability to communicate their thoughts and ability to cope with new information Confirm with the caregiver what information will be shared with the child about HIV, the HIV test and the test results. Stress that adolescents should be fully informed Equip the child and adolescent and caregiver with appropriate information in a way that he/she can understand and cope with Assist the child and adolescent , where appropriate, and the caregiver to consider the possible implications of the test result Prepare the caregiver for any possible reactions from the child and adolescent to the test results Inform the child where appropriate or adolescent, and parent/ caregiver of any limitations in the test results (e.g. the 'window period' or rapid tests for infants) Assist the child and adolescent, where appropriate, and the parent/caregiver to make a decision about whether to proceed with the HIV test or not681 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 6COunSE llIng A PPrOACH There are two approaches to counselling: the client centred approach, and the systemic therapy (systems theory) approach. Client Centred Counselling The client centred approach was adapted for the VCT program in Zimbabwe. It is designed to decrease the emphasis on education, persuasion and test results, but rather, increase the emphasis on personalized risk assessment and the development of a personalized risk reduction plan. It takes into account the client's emotional reactions, interpersonal situation, socio-cultural context, specific risk reduction behaviour and readiness to change. The goals of this approach are to: Develop an individualized risk reduction plan Facilitate the client in enacting the plan Help the client cope with emotional reactions Help client cope with interpersonal and familial consequences of HIV counselling and testing Systemic approach This approach views people and problems within a wider context and not in isolation. The problems are considered as part of a wider social system and not in isolation. Furthermore, diagnosis of an individual is considered to be part of a wider social network that includes family, friends and the community. Principles of systemic/family counselling include: No individual exists in isolation Individual changes require a change in the reciprocal relationship of man in his context Approaches human beings as members of social groups which govern their behaviour Pre-test information giving provides an opportunity for discussion with the child and adolescent and the parent/caregiver about HIV and AIDS, including the risk of infection, and allows them to think about the implications of a negative or positive test result, as well as what strategies they will use to cope with the test result. This session can be directed to the parent/caregiver if the child is below 7 years or to the child and adolescent if he/she is 7 years and above. Regardless of age, all children and adolescents must receive pre-test information. The counsellor's assessment of the child's/adolescent's current understanding, experiences and maturity will guide the conduct of the pre-test information session. The guiding principle is that the service provider should answer honestly all questions raised by the child and adolescent, using age and developmentally appropriate language and techniques.82 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Steps to be followed in providing Pre-test information for children and adolescents The aims of pre-test information for children and adolescents are achieved through four different steps. These steps and their content are a guide to assist counsellors in the delivery of quality counselling. However, counsellors should adopt a flexible approach which ensures that the specific needs of children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers are met. Whilst the context for each child and adolescent, /parent/caregiver might differ, the role of the counsellor is the same: To equip the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver with appropriate information in a way that will help him/her to understand and cope with events affecting him/her. This is influenced by the counsellor's skills in the prior assessment of the child's age and development, understanding and ability to cope with new information. Two scenarios will now be discussed: 1) When HIV is to be named 2) When HIV is not to be named While counsellors may develop their own approach and methods, the important issue is to ensure that the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver are equipped with all the information they require in a manner which they can understand and cope with.683 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 1. ASSESSME nT key Issues rationale Helpful q uestions What is the child's/ adolescent's age and developmental stage? Why does the child and adolescent think they have come to see you? Is the child and adolescent ready to be told that he/she has been brought for an HIV test?The age and development of the child will give you a broad indication of the child's / adolescent's ability to understand what is happening and his ability to communicate his thoughts and feelings. This will influence both the content of information provided and the way it is shared. This question needs to be answered as early as possible in the counselling session in order to avoid accidental disclosure and to establish existing understanding between the parent/caregiver and the counsellor. If the parent/caregiver states that the child is ready then HIV should be discussed openly. All adolescents from 10 years should be told that the test is for HIV. An assessment of readiness takes into accounts the child's age, development and ability to understand and cope. Note that even if you think the child is ready, the parent/caregiver may not be ready. It is then important to keep counselling the parent/caregiver at another time when the child is not there. This provides an opportunity for the counsellor to explore the parent's/caregiver's reasons behind not informing the child and adolescent about the HIV test and to counsel about the disadvantages and advantages of involving the child and adolescent fully in HTS. From the age of 10 years, adolescents should know that the test is for HIV but this will need to have first been agreed to by the parent/caregiver.Can you tell me what has been happening to you? Have you been unwell? Can you tell me anything that is worrying you? Do you know why you are here today? What sort of problems have you been having? Does the parent/ caregiver think the child should be told? (This should have been discussed beforehand) Is there anything you would like us to help you with? Is the parent/ caregiver able to give consent?If the child and adolescent is under 16 years of age, informed consent is required from a parent/caregiver, unless the child is an emancipated or mature minor.How old are you? Who is your parent / caregiver? Who do you live with?684 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 1.1 Information Sharing The Child who Does not know that the test is for HIV In such a situation, the counsellor does not talk about HIV directly. but the counsellor still gives accurate information which can then be slowly built upon as the child becomes closer to the time for full disclosure, if they are confirmed HIV positive.

They are not actually soldiers or warriors but we find it helpful to think of them like that. They are extremely small but very clever parts of the body. Unfortunately, these \"warriors\" sometimes become weak which means the person becomes sick. We think it might be a good idea to find out if your soldiers are weak. If they are, we can then give you medicine to help them become strong\" \"Your parent /caregiver has brought you here to the clinic because she/he cares about you and wants to make sure you are well taken care of. We all want to make sure you are well and taken care of. If the blood test shows that you need medicine to help you, we can give that to you\" Is there anything that you would like to ask?

How could an HIV test help him/her? What is involved in the test? What would a negative result mean? What would a positive result mean? What would they expect? What could be done then?If the child is unwell, explain that if people become sick with lots of illnesses, it is a good idea to find out what is causing this. This helps health workers to ensure that the person will get the very best treatment and care available. Otherwise the person may not get the right medicines or treatment and remain sick. If the child is well, explain that it is always a good idea to be sure that the body is healthy and that there are no problems which we can't see. Ask if the child and adolescent has heard about HIV and what they understand by HIV. Correct any myths and misconceptions. Explain that it is possible to determine whether the child is living with HIV by taking a blood test. The counsellor should explain the specific procedure within their own facility, including who takes the blood, where it is done, how long it takes and when the results would be available Explain to the child and parent /caregiver that if the child is confirmed as having HIV infection, health workers would then know exactly what to do to take good care of him. The child should be informed that he would require medication and that the medication helps to make the body stronger again. The child would need to attend a clinic regularly and that this would ensure he/she was well taken care of. Reassure the child and adolescent that the only people who would need to know their status are their parent /caregiver and the health workers who help to take care of them. Ask the child if he/she knows about antiretroviral medicine, or ARVs. Explain that these medicines are able to make the body stronger by controlling HIV- when someone is taking ARVs, the CD4 cells are protected from too much damage by HIV. The CD4 cells therefore become stronger and the Immune System can become strong again. In this way, as long as the person takes the medicines regularly, they can remain strong like other people who do not have HIV infection. Stress that there are children and adolescents all over the world who were born with HIV but are now grown up and enjoying their own families. They take medication every day and they are strong. Ask if there is anything else that they would like to know or whether they have any questions or worries.1.2 Information Sharing 686 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 2. Decision Making The third step in pre-test information giving involves a discussion with the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver regarding how they feel about the test. Again, the content will depend on the age, development, understanding and specific circumstances of individual children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers. The child and adolescent should be encouraged to express themselves openly, ask questions and voice any concerns they might have. These concerns must be responded to honestly and accurately. The role of the counsellor is to assist the child and adolescent where appropriate, and assist the parent/caregiver to make a decision about whether to proceed with the test by equipping them with the information they require. The counsellor is to remain neutral and non-judgmental. Having established whether the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have any further issues they would like to consider or discuss, an informed decision regarding whether to proceed with the HIV test can be made. Legal consent for HIV testing will depend on the age of the child and adolescent. For children and adolescents less than 16 years, a decision to proceed with HIV testing will ultimately be made by the parent/caregiver. However, this does not mean that a child demonstrating the ability to understand the implications of the test should not be included in discussions regarding the decision to proceed with HIV testing. 3. Implementing the decision If the child adolescent and/or parent/caregiver refuse or decide to postpone the test, accept their decision and reassure them. Inform them that their decision will not compromise the management of the child's/adolescent's current condition, but emphasise that the health workers will miss the opportunity to plan for the child's/adolescent's optimum support and future wellbeing. Encourage the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver to return for further counselling and review the decision at subsequent visits. In the event that the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have further counselling needs, need referral for medical care or there are legal and ethical issues to resolve, discuss this with them and ensure that a plan of action is agreed upon. If the child and adolescent and /or parent/caregiver consent to the HIV test, proceed with the test. SuMMAry The circumstances of each individual child and adolescent and family attending for pre-test information giving vary considerably.687 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts The aim and content of the counselling session is determined by the child's age, development, current level of understanding, ability to cope with informatio n about HIV and the parent's/caregiver's readiness to share information with the child and adolescent. When HIV is not to be openly discussed in front of the child and adolescent, a skilled counsellor will utilise skills and techniques for ensuring that the child and adolescent is involved in the process and has an understanding of events in a way which he can cope with, whilst not naming HIV directly.

These steps and their content are a guide to assist counsellors in the delivery of quality counselling. However, they must not be considered too rigidly at the detriment of meeting the particular needs of individual children and adolescents and their families. Where necessary, counsellors should adopt a flexible approach which ensures that the specific needs of children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers are met. The Three Steps to be followed in Post-test Counselling for children and adolescents Giving the Test Result Discussion Planning the Way Forward 1. Giving the Test Result Take time to assess whether the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have any further questions or concerns that need to be addressed. It is important to remember that although the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have consented to the test and the test has been carried out, they may not be ready or willing to receive the results.690 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 If the child has not been informed that the test is for HIV, the parent/caregiver may need an opportunity for further counselling in the absence of the child and this need should be met. Counsellors may have understandable fears about giving a child and adolescent and/or their parent/caregiver HIV test results. Although it is never an easy task, the counsellor requires skills and coping strategies for fulfilling this role in a manner that meets the needs of the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver. The Child who Does know that the test is for HIV SEE VIDEO On POST-TEST COunSEllIng FOr Children and adolescents gIVIng A POSITIVE rESul T If the child and caregiver have confirmed that they are ready to receive the test results, the counsellor must state clearly: \"The test result is positive. This means that you have HIV infection\" Give the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver time to absorb the information and time to respond. It is extremely important to help the child and adolescent feel that he/she can react as he/she wishes. If the child and adolescent wishes to cry, reassure him/her that he/she may do so. Be prepared for different responses. Whilst some children and adolescents may remain quiet, withdrawn or shocked, others may react by crying or becoming angry. Whatever the response, the child and adolescent is extremely vulnerable and needs immense support. Positive body language, such as sitting next to the child, holding the child's hand, and talking directly to him/her, is vital at this point as it clearly demonstrates to the child that you are there to support and care for him/her. Equally, whilst the parent/caregiver will have his/her own emotions he/she should be encouraged to support the child and adolescent at this moment. Do not rush the child and adolescent by moving on with more information and discussion - give him/her time. When the child and adolescent has had time to think about the test result and time to respond, gently move on to the third step of post-test counselling, the \"Discussion\". gIVIng A nEgATIVE rESul T If the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver have confirmed that they are ready to receive the test results, the counsellor must state clearly: \"The test result is negative. This means that HIV infection has not been found in your blood today\" It is then extremely important to explain that a repeat test may be required for those in the window period or at risk of continued exposure to HIV (e.g. children and adolescents who have been sexually abused or sexually active adolescents). Where there is risk of HIV exposure, counselling should then focus on HIV risk prevention and referral to support services. 1. gIVIng THE TEST rESulT 691 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts gIVIng THE TEST rESul T The Child who Does n OT know that the test is for HIV SEE VIDEO On POST-TEST COunSEllIng FOr Children and adolescents gIVIng A POSITIVE rESul T For children and adolescents who have not been informed that the test was for HIV infection, the test result is usually given to the caregiver alone at first. This provides the counsellor with an opportunity to post-test counsel the parent/caregiver, informing him/her of the result and to ensure that he/she understands what this means. An important part of this discussion is to confirm with the parent/caregiver exactly what the child and adolescent should be told about the results. When the parent/caregiver is ready, the child and adolescent can then be invited and the test result is then given in an appropriate manner, as determined by their age, developmental stage and level of understanding. Remind the child and adolescent of your discussion during the pre-test information giving. Use the same explanations so as not to confuse them. Inform the child and adolescent that the blood test was extremely helpful as it has helped to explain why they have been getting sick. Now the doctors will know which medicine to give in order to help to make them stronger again. Thank and congratulate the child and adolescent for helping you to know what was making them sick, so they can now help him/her. Follow up counselling should then focus on helping the child and adolescent to understand the importance of the medicines, as discussed in the next module. Post-test counselling should be arranged with the parent/caregiver, including support for disclosure to the child and adolescent when the parent/caregiver is ready. gIVIng A nEgATIVE rESul T Remind the child and adolescent of your discussion during the pre-test information giving. Use the same explanations so as not to confuse them. Inform the child and adolescent that the blood test was extremely helpful as it has confirmed that there is no problem. Thank and congratulate them for helping you to know that there is no problem. NB There are two exceptions: When children and adolescents are sick and need referral for further investigations into the cause of their illness, they will need to be counselled about the need for further investigation elsewhere. When children and adolescents are in the \"window period\" they will need to be informed that the blood test has confirmed there is no problem at the moment but to be absolutely certain, it should be repeated in four to six weeks. After the window period has passed, recommend HIV testing every six months, on an on-going basis. To assist the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver to cope with the implications of the test result To assist the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver to make decisions regarding appropriate follow up care and support692 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 STEPS TO FO llOw In POST-TEST C OunSEllIng FO r CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS The aims of post-test counselling for children and adolescents are achieved through three different steps.

However, they must not be considered too rigidly at the detriment of meeting the particular needs of individual children and adolescents and their families. Where necessary, counsellors should adopt a flexible approach which ensures that the specific needs of children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers are met. The Three Steps to be followed in Post-test Counselling for children and adolescents Giving the Test Result Discussion Planning the Way Forward 1. Giving the Test Result Take time to assess whether the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have any further questions or concerns that need to be addressed. It is important to remember that although the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have consented to the test and the test has been carried out, they may not be ready or willing to receive the results.

Although it is never an easy task, the counsellor requires skills and coping strategies for fulfilling this role in a manner that meets the needs of the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver. 2. Discussion The second step in post-test counselling involves a discussion with the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver regarding how they feel about the test result and assisting them to come to terms with the result. Again, the content will depend on the age, developmental stage, level of understanding and specific circumstances of individual children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers. If the child and adolescent had not been informed that the test was for HIV, this discussion may be held with the parent/caregiver alone first. Remember, adolescents should have been told that the test was for HIV. The post-test discussion will therefore be open with them. The child and adolescent and/or the parent/caregiver should be encouraged to express themselves openly, ask questions and voice any concerns they may have. These must be responded to honestly and accurately.693 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts The child and adolescent that now knows his/her HIV Status a. Positive Result: Ask the child and adolescent whether he/she understands what the positive HIV test result means. Encourage them to express themselves and be sure to clarify any misunderstandings. The child and adolescent may now have many questions and these should all be encouraged. Common questions include: Does this mean that I am going to die? What will happen to me? Who else is going to know I have HIV? How did I get it? Always respond openly and honestly. Be careful what you promise. Answer questions by reinforcing the explanations you used in the pre-test information giving. Remind them of what you talked about then. In particular, reassure them that they are not alone, that they are loved and will be taken care of. Remind them that there are many other children and adolescents their age who also have HIV infection and that they are strong and well because they are taking medication. A challenge for counsellors at this stage is the time involved in meeting the child's/ adolescent's needs. Some children and adolescents may require considerable time according to their need for immediate emotional support. This is a difficult dilemma as the counsellor will know that there are other children and adolescents waiting to be seen who also have considerable needs, yet do not want to turn the child and adolescent away at this crucial time when the child and adolescent is vulnerable. In such cases counsellors should use their discretion to ensure that they are providing the necessary support needed by the child and adolescent who has tested positive. b. Negative Result Ensure the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver has further opportunities to discuss the meaning of the negative test. In particular, address the on-going counselling needs of exposed children and adolescents, including infants and their parents/caregivers, and those in the window period. 3. Planning the Way Forward The final stage of post-test counselling involves planning the way forward for the child and adolescent and their parent/caregiver. HIV negative children and adolescents may not need any follow up counselling regarding HIV infection. However, counselling may have identified that the child and adolescent has other significant physical, social, emotional, spiritual and mental needs. The counsellor has a responsibility to ensure that these are addressed through follow up care and support and appropriate referral. Adolescents will also need counselling for HIV risk reduction.694 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015For children and adolescents testing HIV positive, this final step of post-test counselling represents the first step in ensuring that the considerable follow up care and support for the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver is planned. This follow up, care and support for HIV infected children and adolescents is addressed in Module 7. SuMMAry The circumstances of each individual child, adolescent and family attending for post-test counselling vary considerably. The aim and content of the counselling session is determined by the child's/ adolescent's age, development, current level of understanding, ability to cope with information about HIV and the parent's/caregiver's readiness to share information with the child and adolescent. Adolescents should be aware that the test they have taken is for HIV and informed of the results. When HIV is not to be openly discussed in front of the child, a trained counsellor will utilise skills and techniques for ensuring that the child and adolescent is involved in the process and has an understanding of events in a way which he can cope with, whilst not naming HIV directly.

It is only the beginning. Whether the child and adolescent has tested HIV positive or negative, the child and adolescent and the family now have considerable needs. This module now addresses the follow up counselling, care and support needs of children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers following HTS and the role of the counsellor in providing for those needs. In particular, it addresses key counselling areas of disclosure and ART counselling for children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers. It also addresses the need for strengthening of referral linkages for children and adolescents requiring follow up care and support services. Module Objectives: At the end of this module participants should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of the role of follow up counselling, care and support for children and adolescents who have accessed HIV testing Ensure the provision of appropriate follow up counselling, care and support through counselling and or referral to appropriate services Anticipate and recognise common challenges which children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers face following HIV testing Plan and implement strengthening of referral linkages within their own facility Demonstrate an understanding of the key principles of disclosure for children and adolescents Disclose HIV status to a child and adolescent using appropriate counselling skills and techniques Demonstrate a general understanding of ARVs and adherence issues in children and adolescents Refer to ART services and assist with adherence counselling for children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers Session 1: Follow Up Counselling, Care and Support Session2: Disclosure Counselling Session 3: ART and Adherence CounsellingSession 4: Sexual and Reproductive Health Counselling Session 5: Support Group FormationOverview of Sessions:7 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 Session 1: Follow u p Counselling, Care and Support Objectives At the end of the session participants should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of the role of follow up counselling ,care and support for children and adolescents who have accessed HIV testing Ensure the provision of appropriate follow up counselling, care and support through further counselling and/or referral to appropriate services Anticipate and recognise common challenges which children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers are faced with following HIV testing Plan and implement strengthening of referral linkages within and beyond their own facility Activity 1: Presentation - Follow Up Counselling, Care and Support Activity 2: Worksheet - Planning for Strengthening of Referral NetworksOverview of Activities:797 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Post-test counselling concludes the process of informing a child and adolescent and/ or family of the HIV test result and provides immediate emotional support. But the essential role of counselling does not stop there. Whether the child and adolescent has tested HIV positive or negative, the child and the family now have considerable needs following the HIV test result. Follow up counselling, Care and Support is required by three main groups of children and adolescents: 1. Children and adolescents who have been confirmed HIV negative 2. Children and adolescents who have tested HIV negative yet remain HIV exposed or within the window period for infection 3. Children and adolescents who have been confirmed HIV positive 1. C HIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS w HO HAVE b EEn CO nFIrMED HIV n EgATIVE Children and adolescents, including infants, who have been confirmed HIV negative may well have a need for follow up counselling, care and support services. For example, many children and adolescents who have been brought for HIV testing live within difficult social circumstances and referral to social welfare services is necessary. Other children and adolescents may be negative but remain at potential risk of HIV infection in the future e.g. HIV exposed infants or sexually active adolescents. These children and adolescents have a critical need for continued counselling around issues relating to post-test HIV prevention, family planning counselling, referral for VMMC, post-exposure prophylaxis where indicated and access to reproductive health services for adolescents 16 years and older, such as condoms or other contraceptive methods. In addition there will also be legal issues to address for sexually active minors or those that have been sexually abused. 2.

Counselling should assist parents in understanding the results of the test, how to care for their baby including issues of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, infant feeding choices and the need to repeat the HIV test to identify whether the baby has remained uninfected. Children and adolescents who have been sexually abused and tested for HIV within the window period will need to be counselled about the need for further testing to confirm whether they remain HIV negative or not. Importantly, the children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers must be referred to specialist child sexual abuse counsellors in order for their counselling needs to be met appropriately. During this time they must receive the post exposure prophylaxis and appropriate treatment to reduce risk of infection.ACTIVIT y 1: F OllOw uP C OunSEllIng, C ArE AnD Su PPO rT 798 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 3. C HIlDrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS w HO HAVE b EEn CO nFIrMED HIV POSITIVE The follow up counselling needs of children and adolescents who have tested HIV positive vary considerably, depending on each child's age, development, understanding, experiences and ability to cope with events in their lives. Furthermore, an individual child's needs will evolve with time as they grow and develop through childhood and experience new challenges. Follow up counselling, care and support must therefore be adapted according to their needs at any point in time. This session will now focus on the follow up counselling, care and support required by children and adolescents who have been confirmed as infected with HIV. Common issues faced by children and adolescents testing HIV positive Module 2 discussed the different needs of children and adolescents and the impact of HIV on the realisation of those needs. The way in which a diagnosis of HIV impacts on the realisation of these needs provides an indication of the counselling, care and support required by HIV positive children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers. The issues faced can be considered in terms of physical, social, emotional, spiritual and mental issues but in reality, they are all interrelated. Not all children and adolescents will experience the same developmental concerns, and the way children and adolescents respond to these issues will depend on their age, development, level of understanding, sense of control, resilience and existing support networks. However, listed below are some of the more common concerns requiring follow up counselling, care and support for children and adolescents testing HIV positive. These issues may require immediate attention after HIV testing or they may emerge in the weeks, months or years after HIV infection has been confirmed. The diagnosis of a chronic, incurable condition involving recurrent illnesses might distress the child and adolescent. An HIV positive diagnosis will be associated with delayed growth and development in children and adolescents. Effective management of condition will depends on: Regular medical monitoring and follow up Positive living (good nutrition, hygiene, exercise) Adherence to life-long medication Recurrent medical procedures Provision of adequate accommodation for the child and adolescentPhysical Issues 799 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts An HIV positive diagnosis in a child and adolescent might result in the following challenges/ or fears: Difficulties coming to terms with knowledge of HIV status and coping with emotions (e.g. grief, sadness, fear, anger) Fear and uncertainty about the future (e.g. fear of death, fear of ill health, uncertainty about future relationships) Difficulties coming to terms with the mode of infection (e.g. MTCT, sexual abuse, consensual sex) Difficulties coping with past and current traumatic events (e.g. loss of parents and siblings, medical procedures, change in residence, stigma and discrimination, disclosure, coping with illness) Fear of disclosure to others Lack of loving, supportive, accepting, caring relationships Lack of acceptance and sense of feeling valued Fear of not being able to attain normal physical and emotional relationships Fear of dropping out /falling behind at school due to ill health or inadequate resources within the home Lack of opportunities for expressing thoughts and feelings Lack of appropriate responses which adequately address these thoughts and feelings Social considerations about the following will be important to take into account for a child and adolescent diagnosed as HIV positive: Availability of adequate resources within the home i.e. nutritional, hygiene, clothing, schooling, transport to clinic, medication, physical space Frequent change of residence Desire to be like their peers and to socialise with peers A child and adolescent diagnosed as HIV positive might also face spiritual challenges such as: Fear for the future Feelings of abandonment by a higher powerPsychological Issues Psychological Issues Psychological Issues 7100 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 FOllOw uP C OunSEllIng, C ArE AnD Su PPO rT Follow up Counselling, Care and Support aims to reduce the impact of stresses such as those listed above by: Equipping the children and adolescents and parents/caregivers with accurate, honest information in a way that they can understand and cope with. Assisting the children and adolescents and parents/caregivers to develop coping strategies to reduce the impact of the challenges that they face. Ensuring that children and adolescents receive the most appropriate care and support in order to meet their complex, evolving physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual needs. Protecting the best interests of the child at all times. Psychosocial Support (PSS) Follow up Counselling, Care and Support is an essential component of the psychosocial support required by children and adolescents with HIV. Psychosocial Support is defined in the following way: (REPSSI, 2006)Psycho : about thoughts, feelings and emotions Social: about the environment in which the child live, including family, friends, community, school Support: the way that children and adolescents are helped to cope with problems and traumas and to build resilience PSS: \"Caring\" \"hanya\" \"ukunakekela\" Psychosocial Support can be defined as an on-going process which aims to meet the physical, emotional, social, mental and spiritual needs of children and adolescents and their families. role of the Counsellor in Follow u p Counselling, Care and Support The role of the counsellor is to assess the different needs of the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver at any given time or point of contact and to ensure that these needs are addressed through appropriate follow up counselling or referral to other care and support services as required. The role of counsellors in follow up counselling, care and support will depend on each facility's scope of work. Some facilities may provide pre and post-test counselling services and then refer all follow up counselling, care and support to other facilities. Other facilities may have integrated HTS with other services and the counsellor will therefore be involved in follow up counselling.7101 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Children and adolescents who have tested HIV positive have considerable counselling needs and it is essential that their need for follow up counselling, care and support is met. It is the role of the counsellor to ensure that follow up care is provided within their own facility or through referral elsewhere. Follow up Counselling, Care and Support Strategies In order to adequately address the follow up counselling, care and support needs of children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers, a variety of strategies are required. These involve the multidisciplinary team and depend on effective referral systems and multidisciplinary liaison. The counsellor has a pivotal role to play in each strategy. Follow Up Counselling, Care and Support Strategies 1. Continued counselling, throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood 2. Referral for HIV treatment and care 3. Integration with other services (e.g. TB, ASRH, social welfare) 4. Referral for social welfare support and assistance 5. Peer support groups 6. Multi-disciplinary liaison between different counselling, care and support networks 1. COnTInuED CO unSEllIng, TH rOugHOuT CHIl DHOOD , ADO lESCE nCE AnD InTO ADul THOOD Continued counselling throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood is an essential component of comprehensive care and support for all young people growing up with HIV. As they progress through childhood and adolescence, their counselling needs will change as they face new situations and new challenges, but the aims of counselling remain the same - it is intended to assist young people by: Equipping them with accurate and appropriate information in a way that they can understand Equipping them with skills to adjust and cope with the situations they face, challenges they experience and their emotions. Assisting them to develop coping strategies to minimise the negative impact of the situations they face Helping them to make choices and decisions that will improve their quality of life Empowering them through involving them in their care Assisting them to develop goals and to recognise and build on their own strengths Promoting their sense of self control, self-esteem Common counselling areas are now discussed.7102 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 The need to equip children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers with accurate information about their condition and the implications of living with HIV A recurring theme throughout this training is the need for children and adolescents to have access to appropriate information with which they can understand and cope as a means to assist them to adjust and eventually cope better with the implications of their HIV status. Follow up counselling continues to provide the child and adolescent with greater knowledge and understanding. Children and adolescents may have been told their HIV status but their need for more information at each point of contact remains vital. It is important to clarify what the children and adolescents have understood each time and to identify any new questions or concerns the child may have. 2. rEFE rrAl FO r MEDICA l CA rE, TrEATME nT AnD SuPPO rT The course of HIV infection varies between different children and adolescents. Some children and adolescents may progress very quickly and become sick with opportunistic infections within the first few months of life. These children and adolescents are sometimes known as 'rapid progressors.' Other perinatally or vertically infected children and adolescents may remain relatively well for several years, only becoming unwell in early childhood or adolescence. Where children and adolescents have acquired HIV infection later in childhood (i.e. not through MTCT) they may remain well and only present with opportunistic infections in their adolescent years. At whatever stage the child and adolescent starts becoming unwell, he/she commonly has to endure painful and recurrent, debilitating illnesses. This not only has a physical impact on the child and adolescent but leads to immense emotional stress on the child and adolescent and their parent/caregiver. Similarly, frequent medical procedures can cause physical and emotional stress. All HIV positive children and adolescents require referral for medical care and treatment. This includes assessment of their current condition, the need for cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, management of opportunistic infections and other illnesses, counselling and treatment with antiretroviral medicines when necessary. When children and adolescents present for HTS, they may be in varying conditions of health. Some may require urgent referral for assessment, medical investigations and treatment. Others may not require such urgent attention but will require that the counsellor follows up the referral to ensure that the child and parent/caregiver have accessed the necessary treatment and care. Antiretroviral medicines have had a dramatic impact on the prognosis for children and adolescents with HIV. However, their effectiveness is dependent on strict adherence to the medicine regimen. The need to adhere to these medicines has major psychosocial implications for children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers. Children and adolescents taking ARVs require extensive counselling by counsellors who have been trained in Antiretroviral Therapy for children and adolescents.7103 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 3. rEFE FO r SOCIA l wElFArE, SuPPO rT AnD ASSISTA nCE It is important that counsellors have established links with social welfare and other support services. Very commonly the HIV positive child and their family will have significant social challenges. The child's/adolescent's family may lack sufficient resources to provide the care that the child and adolescent needs including the costs associated with transport to the clinic, medication and medical fees. Even basic needs such as adequate nutrition may not be met. Furthermore, frequent illness and hospitalisation commonly results in HIV positive children and adolescents falling behind at school or dropping out of school completely. This not only has profound effects on the child's/adolescent's educational needs, but also affects their emotional need to feel like their peers and to realise their own potential. It is often very difficult to 'solve' the child's social difficulties but with appropriate referral, it may be possible to alleviate some of the stressors on the children and adolescents and families. Health service providers need to establish strong referral pathways with the Department of Child Welfare and Probation Services to ensure that children and adolescents can be linked to services as required. 4. PEE r SuPPO rT grOuPS As children and adolescents grow and go through childhood, they develop a strong need to be like their peers. An HIV diagnosis can lead children and adolescents to feel that they are different, to feel isolated and afraid. Peer support groups are a powerful follow up counselling, care and support strategy for any HIV positive child. The groups provide children and adolescents with an opportunity to socialise with others who share similar experiences and difficulties in life in a safe, supportive, trusting environment. Depending on the activities of the support group, children and adolescents can benefit from group and /or peer counselling and learn essential skills for living positively. As children grow and go through adolescence, they develop a natural desire for normal physical and emotional relationships. Adolescents with HIV therefore become increasingly aware of the implications of their HIV status and begin to develop fears about the future. How will they meet a boyfriend/girlfriend? What will they tell him/ her about their HIV status? Can they have an HIV negative partner? Will they be able to have children? At a time when the adolescent should be planning and looking forward to the future, the future is full of uncertainty and fear. Again, peer support groups provide a safe environment in which these issues can be explored.7104 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 20155. Mul TIDISCIP lInAry lIAISO n Due to the diversity of the needs of HIV positive children and adolescents, multidisciplinary teamwork is essential. Principles of confidentiality and the need to protect the child's best interests at all times must be adhered to. However, professional, sensitive multidisciplinary teamwork has the potential to significantly impact on the child's quality of life through addressing their different needs through a variety of approaches, and these approaches will ultimately apply to all children and adolescents who receive a test, regardless of the test result. SuMMAry Post-test counselling concludes the process of informing a child and adolescent and/or family of the HIV test result and provides immediate emotional support. Children and adolescents, including infants, who have been confirmed HIV negative may well have a need for follow up counselling, care and support services. Counselling is extremely important for parents of infants who have tested HIV negative yet remain exposed to HIV through breastfeeding. Children and adolescents who have been sexually abused and tested for HIV within the window period will need to be counselled about the need for further testing to confirm whether they remain HIV negative or not. Follow up Counselling, Care and Support is an essential component of the psychosocial support required by children and adolescents with HIV. Important follow up counselling, care and support strategies include: continued counselling, throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood, referral for HIV treatment and care, integration with other services (e.g. TB, ASRH, social welfare), referral for social welfare support and assistance, peer support groups, and multi-disciplinary liaison between different counselling, care and support networks.7105 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsIn your facility, what follow up care and support services exist for children and adolescents testing HIV positive ACTIVIT y 2: wO rkSHEET - Pl AnnIng FO r STrEngTHE nIng OF rEFE rrAl nET wOrkS In your facility, what gaps are there in follow up care and support services for children and adolescents testing HIV positive?

Activity 1: Film - Testimonials of children and adoles - cents living with HIV, and how they disclosed their status Activity 2: Discussion, with case studies on disclosure counsellingOverview of Activities:All children with HIV need information about their own HIV status at different stages in their lives. Whether the child has been disclosed to or not, the multidisciplinary team has a collective responsibility to ensure that every child and adolescent with HIV receives on-going information and counselling, at the right time and in the right way. The quality of information and counselling which children and adolescents receive will directly impact on their clinical and psychosocial well-being and must therefore form the foundation of HIV treatment, care and support for children and adolescents. In addition, as children and adolescents with HIV grow up, they will face decisions in their lives about with whom, when and how to share information about their own HIV status. The multidisciplinary team needs to understand the rights and needs of children and adolescents and to have developed skills to assist each individual in the right way. 7107 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsACTIVIT y 1: F IlM ACTIVIT y 2: DISC uSSIOn - DISC lOSurE Disclosure is the process of informing the child and adolescent of his or her own HIV status or informing someone else about the child's/adolescent's HIV status. It is determined by the readiness of the parent/caregiver to talk about the HIV test results and readiness of the child and adolescent to understand his or her own HIV status. A thorough assessment of the child's/adolescent's ability to understand HIV and AIDS issues and level of maturity is essential for planning the disclosure process. Adolescents need to know their HIV status. Disclosure is an on-going, gradual process of sharing information with the child and adolescent about his/her own HIV status in a way which helps them to understand and cope with events in their life at that time. The information shared and language used is based on an individual child's/adolescent's needs and the wishes of the family. The HTS provider assesses what children and adolescents already know and gives them age-appropriate information in a way that they understand and which helps them to understand and cope with events in their lives. Partial Disclosure: Young children (usually up to 6 years of age) need to understand that they have a chronic illness that can be treated and what is involved in their care. In partnership with the parent/caregiver, the child and adolescent is provided with accurate, honest information in a way that the child and adolescent understands but without naming HIV or AIDS. Full disclosure is when the child and adolescent is given all the information pertaining to his/her positive HIV status and the words \"HIV\" and \"AIDS\" are used. Full disclosure includes a full understanding of what HIV is, how it affects the body and what is involved in his/her care. Full disclosure is not just telling a child and adolescent that he/she is HIV positive. It is taking the time to discuss the many facets of living with HIV. Again, this is not a one-time discussion. It is an on-going conversation that continues as the child and adolescent matures. The main advantages of disclosure include the following, that it: Reduces the child and adolescent's anxiety, fears and suspicion while also promoting their capacity to cope and improve their psychological well being Empowers the child and adolescent with knowledge and understanding of his/ her condition Enables the child and adolescent to be in charge of his/her medical management leading to greater adherence to antiretroviral therapy Increases the likelihood of the child and adolescent receiving appropriate care, treatment and psychosocial support Reduces the burden on the family of carrying a \"secret\" 7108 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Some parents/caregivers find it difficult to disclose HIV status to the child and adolescent. Therefore, an important part of the counselling process is helping parents/caregivers to deal with their own fears and concerns about how the child and adolescent will react to learning that he or she is HIV positive. They should also be counselled on the negative impact of delaying disclosure. 'Concealing HIV status may lead to or exacerbate depression, worry and other negative mental health outcomes, potentially interfering with treatment and affecting family life' - World Health Organisation 2011 It is important to remember that many children, even quite young ones, may have a clear idea that something is wrong with them, that the adults are worried and that they may have HIV infection. Reassurance only, without disclosure, may just make the child more anxious and prevents the child and adolescent from being an active participant in his/her own health care. Disclosure should be done early, before the child and adolescent gets to know his/ her status through other sources. However, it should be noted that in some cases, accidental disclosure can take place and the child and adolescent needs support during this time. Since disclosure is a process, not an event, a number of sessions may be needed to complete the process. Age-appropriate language should be used at all times. Child and adolescent-focused techniques are also important such as the use of drawings, cartoons and games which explain the way HIV works, how it affects the body and how ARV medicines work to control HIV in the body. If a parent/caregiver refuses to have the results disclosed to a child and adolescent below 16 years of age, (who is also not an emancipated minor), then the health worker may disclose to the child and adolescent if it is determined that the child and adolescent is a mature minor. The decision should be to act in the best interests of the child and adolescent. Specifically, the counsellor should determine whether: The child and adolescent is mature enough to cope with the results of the HIV test The child and adolescent has other people who can provide him or her with psychological and emotional support Knowledge of the results will benefit the child's/adolescent's care and treatment Case Study: Tadiwa Tadiwa, 11 years, has been admitted to your ward with meningitis. He lives with his father. His mother died 5 months ago. She was HIV positive but Tadiwa doesn't know why she died. Tadiwa is also HIV positive but he has not been told his HIV status. His last CD4 count was 102. How would you manage this case?7109 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TswHy SHA rE InFOrMATIO n w ITH CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS? Sharing information about HIV with children and adolescents has a number of benefits. Quality, child-focused information and counselling: 1. Equips children and adolescents with accurate, appropriate information in a way that they understand. 2. Assists them to cope with the implications of their HIV status through greater knowledge and understanding of the diagnosis. 3. Helps to prevent or minimise negative emotions in children and adolescents such as fear, anxiety, mistrust, confusion and loss of control. 4. Empowers them through involving them in their own care and promotes self- control, self-esteem and reduces anxiety. 5. Assists children and adolescents to make choices and decisions about issues which affect them and improve their quality of life, including adherence to ART. wHAT DO w E MEA n by SHA rIng I nFOrMATIO n AbOuT HIV? Sharing information about HIV with children and adolescents does not just refer to the process of 'disclosure'. It is a journey in which the child and adolescent moves from having little or no understanding of what is happening through to a full, accurate understanding of HIV and how it affects him/her. Not all younger children and adolescents will be ready to know their HIV status but they still require accurate, appropriate information which helps them to understand what is happening, even if HIV is not named. When it is time to fully disclose to the child and adolescent, he/she needs much more than to just be told he/she has HIV. A child and adolescent who is fully disclosed to should have a clear understanding of what HIV is, how it affects the body, how he/she was infected and what is involved in his/her own care. More often than not, children and adolescents are reportedly 'disclosed to' and as a result lack understanding and confidence around what is happening to them and what to expect. This leaves the child and adolescent with unanswered questions, causing feelings of uncertainty, fear and confusion. wHE n SHO ulD wE SHA rE InFOrMATIO n w ITH CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS AbOuT THEIr O wn HIV STAT uS? The decision around when to inform a child that he/she is HIV positive involves many different factors. But it begins with a very careful assessment of each individual child and adolescent as every child and adolescent is different. In your daily work, you make clinical assessments and management plans. The process of disclosure 7110 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 requires one to make psychosocial and developmental assessments for each child and adolescent. Factors considered in this assessment include: What is in the best interests of the child and adolescent? What are the wishes of the family? What support will be available for the child and adolescent after disclosure? What developmental stage is the child and adolescent? What are the child's/adolescent's current needs and experiences? What is the child's/adolescent's personality like? What previous experiences has the child and adolescent had (e.g. parental illness, death, own illness)? What is the child's/adolescent's current knowledge and understanding about HIV? What coping strategies does the child and adolescent have? Zimbabwe's national guidelines on HIV testing services for children and adolescents state that the process of sharing information with children about their HIV status can begin from 6-7 years of age. This process involves the gradual provision of developmentally appropriate explanations which help the child and adolescent to cope with the events in their lives, until full disclosure. THE rOlE OF PArEnTS/CArEgIVEr S In SHAr Ing InFOrMATIO n wITH THEIr CHIlD The child's parents/ are central to the process of sharing information about HIV with the child and adolescent. They must be involved in discussions about what is in the best interests of their child and adolescent. A child and adolescent may not be informed of his/her HIV status without their consent. If the parent/caregiver is ready to disclose, it is important to discuss and confirm with the parent/caregiver exactly what will be said to the child and adolescent. Parents/ caregivers need to be helped to prepare for possible reactions and questions from the child and adolescent. In the event that a health professional feels it is in the best interests of the child and adolescent to be informed of his/ her HIV status, yet the parent/caregiver does not want the child and adolescent to be told, the health work with the parent/caregiver to ensure that the benefits of consent are clearly articulated and advocate for whatever is in the best interests of the child. Counselling should continue at each contact with the family. However, it is important to inform parents/caregivers that you will not lie to the child and adolescent. Plan together with the family what you will say if the child and 7111 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts adolescent asks you questions such as \"Why am I coming to this clinic? Why do I need these medicines?\" In this way, the parent/caregiver and health professional are able to plan for this scenario and minimize difficulties. Adolescents with HIV share their experiences of disclosure Questions, Answers and Discussion (testimonials) wHO SHO ulD SHA rE InFOrMATIO n wITH THE CHI lD AnD ADO lESCE nT AbOuT HIV? Information shared with children and adolescents in the wrong way or by different people in different ways can do more harm than good to the child and adolescent. Every child's/adolescent's situation is different. Some families may choose to disclose to the child and adolescent at home whilst others may prefer to be assisted by someone such as a health professional, counsellor or social worker. Wherever disclosure takes place, it is important that the parent/caregiver should disclose and be present to support the child and adolescent. It is important that whoever is informing the child and adolescent of his/her HIV status has the knowledge and skills to provide supportive, helpful disclosure. If the disclosure is carried out at home, it is important at the next clinic review to ask the child and adolescent what he/she understands about his status. This allows the child to ask further questions and for the health professional to assess what the child understands and how he/she is coping. IT DOESn' T STOP THE rE - DISC lOSurE IS A P rOCESS ! Disclosure of HIV status to a child and adolescent is just the beginning. Following disclosure, they now need continued access to accurate, evidence-based information about HIV, their own health and the management of their condition. Great care should be taken to ensure that they have on-going access to the right information, provided in the right way. This may come from different sources but should be accurate and evidence-based. As children and adolescents grow, their need for information and counselling is constantly evolving. A 10 year old will have different needs and experiences compared with a 17 year old. So it is important to be continually asking and reflecting on the information and counselling needs of individual children and adolescents. In reality, there is often minimal time available during clinic appointments for addressing the variety of information and counselling needs of all children and adolescents. It is therefore very helpful to refer children and adolescents to support groups where they can access additional information, counselling and peer support which complements the clinic-based treatment, care and support. 7112 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 wHAT DO w E SAy? H Ow IS IT DO nE? A major barrier to the disclosure process is that adults commonly do not know what to say to a child and adolescent or how to say it. There are a few helpful principles to remember when thinking and planning for disclosure. These include: Assess each individual child and adolescent and provide explanations which they will be able to understand, remember and cope with Make the child feel that they are the most important thing to you at that time Child and adolescent-friendly tools and approaches really work. Be creative! Show that you care and understand what they are saying Look at things from the child's/adolescent's point of view Never judge, look bored or shocked Do not interrupt or disagree.

It also includes child-friendly explanations about HIV, the way HIV affects the body and the role of antiretroviral medicines in controlling HIV. This book is available to you through this course and is a useful tool to assist in sharing information about HIV with children and adolescents. A card game is also available for your use. Demonstration Demonstration by a peer counsellor showing use of the Our Story game when counselling a child and adolescent about HIV The way children and adolescents respond to hearing about their HIV status differs. The child and adolescent may have already suspected his/her diagnosis or may be completely shocked. It is difficult to predict a child's/adoelscent's response and the family must be prepared for different reactions. For example: Quiet and withdrawn Crying Accepting, matter of fact Asking lots of questions Relief as they can now make sense of their experiences Wanting to get on with other things Anger, surprise, shock All responses are appropriate and the child and adolescent must be given time to absorb what he/she has been told and to then express how he/she is feeling. 7113 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts bE Pr EPArED FO r quESTIO nS AbOuT HIV F rOM THE CHI lD AnD ADO lESCE nT It is important that the child and adolescent has opportunities to express himself/ herself and to ask questions. These may include questions like: Does this mean that I will die? How did I get it? Who else has got it? Why did no one tell me before? Who else knows I have HIV? Why did my mother not get Nevirapine? Will I be able to get married? The general principles of counselling of children and adolescents apply. Always respond openly and honestly. Remember, a quiet child and adolescent does not mean they have no questions or have understood everything. Children and adolescents ask \"Why?\" but they may not feel able to verbalise this. Our role is to help children and adolescents to feel safe and comfortable asking questions or sharing their concerns so that we can help them with appropriate responses. In addition, some children and adolescents may have questions that they do not feel comfortable asking with the parent/caregiver present. This is not necessarily a reflection on their relationship. For example, children and adolescents are often very protective of their parents/caregivers and withhold certain questions as they fear upsetting their parent/caregiver. Adolescents in particular may need other opportunities to ask questions without their parent/caregiver present. SO THE CHI lD nOw kn OwS THE y ArE HIV POSITIVE . wHAT n ExT? At the time of disclosure, children and adolescents may not have questions. Or they may feel unable to share what they are thinking and feeling. It is essential that a clinic visit or home visit be scheduled shortly after disclosure to assess how the child and adolescent and the family are coping. Reassure the child and adolescent and their family that the team is there to help them stay healthy and to cope with their HIV status. Continued counselling for the child and adolescent and family following disclosure is vital. The needs of children and adolescents change over time so it is important to provide opportunities for the child and adolescent and family to gather more information, gain further understanding and to express their difficulties. In partnership with the family, help the child and adolescent to identify to whom he/she can talk. Regularly assess the child's/adolescent's understanding of his/her condition and any difficulties he may be having in coping (e.g. behaviour change or adherence difficulties). 7114 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 It is also important that the child and adolescent be informed about other support available such as support groups, spiritual support or other programmes in the community which the child and adolescent may benefit from.

D ISClOSurE TO O THE rS Supporting adolescents with decisions around if, when, how and to whom to disclose their HIV status to others As children and adolescents continue to grow up with HIV, they are increasingly encountering scenarios in which they are faced with the decision of whether to disclose their own HIV status to others. For example, this may involve a decision whether to disclose to partners, friends, at school or in church. The decision whether to disclose or not must be considered very carefully and children and adolescents need considerable support and counselling so that they can make their own informed decision about if, when, how and to whom to disclose their HIV status. The role of the counsellor is to assist the child and adolescent and family to make informed decisions about disclosure to others. Every child'adolescent's situation will be different and an individualized counselling approach is essential. Their fears and anxieties must be acknowledged, valued and respected. It is important to consider the situation from the adolescent's perspective and to guide the adolescent with the following questions: Is disclosure to others in the best interests of the adolescent? Will it help them to access care and support? Will it assist in protecting their partner or child from HIV transmission? The goal of sharing information about HIV with children and adolescents is that each individual child and adolescent has full knowledge and understanding of his/her condition after a process of sharing information over a number of years in partnership with the family.

There is no one-size-fits all approach but children and adolescents need non-judgmental, supportive counselling which helps them to make their own informed decision about if, when, how and to whom to disclose to others. It is important that children and adolescents who are considering disclosure to another person are reassured that you are there to provide support. If they do disclose to someone else, encourage them to return to see you afterwards so that you can assess how they are coping and provide counselling and support. SuMMAry The process of sharing information with children and adolescents about their HIV status is based upon the following principles of disclosure: The best interests of the child Respect for the views and wishes of the family, parent/ caregiver A process, beginning with the first contact with the child and planned together with the family/caregiver Each child's individual needs, understanding and maturity but the process may begin from 6-7 years The child's need for honest, accurate, consistent information Child friendly techniques and participatory approaches7116 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Session 2: ArT and Adherence Counselling Objectives At the end of this session participants should be able to: Describe the role of antiretroviral medicines in the management of children and adolescents living with HIV Define adherence Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of adherence to ART Describe potential challenges with adherence for children and adolescents Provide adherence counselling for children, adolescents and their parents/caregivers Activity 1: Discussion and Film - ART and Adherence Counselling Activity 2: Presentation - Adherence Counselling Activity 3: Case Scenarios / Role PlayOverview of Activities:7117 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsACTIVIT y 1: A rT AnD A DHE rEnCE C OunSEllIng ARVs have had a dramatic impact on the prognosis for children and adolescents living with HIV. Children and adolescents born with HIV or who have acquired it after birth are now growing up through adolescence and into adulthood. However, their survival is dependent on optimal adherence to the ARV medicines. DEFInIng A DHE rEnCE Adherence is \"the act or quality of sticking to something, steady devotion; acceptance of an active role in one's own health care.\" ADHE rEnCE TO C ArE Central to the appropriate management of children and adolescents with HIV is the need for adherence to care. This includes: Entering into and continuing in a management and treatment programme Attending appointments and undergoing tests as scheduled Taking medications as prescribed (adherence to treatment) - ARVs, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and TB treatment Adherence to A rV medicines What is meant by adherence to ARV medicines? Taking the correct ARV medicine In the correct dose At the correct time Under the correct circumstances (e.g. food restrictions) Importance of Adherence So why is adherence so important for children and adolescents taking ARVs? Adherence is key to achieving viral suppression and preventing medicine resistance. The overall outcome of adherence to treatment is the improved health of the child and adolescent living with HIV. Outcomes of poor adherence Outcomes of poor adherence include: Clinical progression of disease Emergence of resistant virus Risk of spreading medicine resistant virus when adolescents become sexually active. Risk of transmitting medicine resistant virus to an infant if adolescent girls become pregnant7118 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 ADHE rEnCE In CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS Adherence to ARV medicines is well known to be challenging, but particularly so in the paediatric and adolescent group. Studies on chronic disease show that adolescents with chronic disease are less adherent to treatment than adults and young children. Similarly, HIV infected adolescents and young adults consistently have disproportionately higher rates of poor medicine adherence and virological failure compared with younger children and adults (Lowenthal et al, 2014). Furthermore, a study conducted by Africaid, in Harare, among 229 adolescents with HIV demonstrated that self-reported adherence to ART was sub-optimal (Mavhu et al, 2013). A study at Parirenyatwa Hospital found that 40% of adolescents on ART had virological failure. Perinatally infected adolescents will commonly have been taking ARVs for long periods of time. Together with the adherence challenges associated in this age group, the emergence of medicine resistance virus in this group is of considerable concern. This is particularly so in countries like Zimbabwe where future medicine choices are limited. FACTO rS AFFECTI ng A DHE rEnCE There are numerous factors affecting adherence and thus the outcome of care for the child and adolescent. An understanding of these different factors and their impact on adherence is central to the provision of quality ART and adherence counselling for children and adolescents and their parents/caregivers.

ART Counselling for the child and adolescent and family is an essential component of antiretroviral treatment, both: PrIOr to commencing treatment - to ensure that the child and adolescent and family are ready for ART and to assess potential barriers to adherence. THrOug HOu T treatment, at every visit - to ensure continued adherence and identification of difficulties the child and adolescent and family may be having Effective ART counselling is an invaluable investment and directly influences treatment outcomes but it requires: Time Commitment Trained counsellors in issues relating to HIV and ARVs Assessment and understanding of each child and adolescent and family's needs or difficulties Multidisciplinary team approach Non-judgmental, open approach Information shared and explanations given will depend on each individual child's: Parental/ caregiver readiness Developmental stage Current knowledge/understanding Previous explanations (Take time to hear and assess what they already know and understand) Ability to absorb new information Level of support Be careful what you promise! Be consistent and honest with regard to what the child and adolescent may expect when on treatment.

Give the Child and adolescents choices (e.g. time of dosing)7120 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 ART Counselling for BOTH child and adolescent and parent/caregiver together in the same room helps to promote a common understanding and shared vocabulary about the medicines and a supportive child and adolescent and parent/caregiver relationship Don't rush to start treatment: ensure child AND family are ready and committed. Use creative, visual strategies such as games and drawings to explain ARVs Counselling should also address practical issues: e.g. storage of medicines, building medicines into daily routine, Can the child swallow tablets? Can the care-giver accurately measure syrups? Can the medicines be mixed with food? What strategies does the adolescent in boarding school need? Will adherence charts help? Would a mobile phone reminder help? STEPS In ACHIEVI ng A DHE rEnCE There are various steps involved in achieving adherence and the counsellor has a vital role to play in each step. Assess readiness Education Preparation On-going monitoring/assessment of adherence Support, including from peers Addressing Barriers Assess Readiness Adherence to care should be established before ARVs are prescribed. The multidisciplinary team must explore barriers to adherence to care and attempt to address them. This often poses ethical dilemmas for health workers. It is not always possible to resolve some barriers to adherence and the child and adolescent may consequently not be commenced on ARVs. Common barriers include lack of dedicated caregiver, transportation difficulties and financial constraints. Assessing readiness involves the following questions: Is there a consistent caregiver that can administer or supervise ARVs? Is the family adherent to clinic appointments? Has the child and adolescent been adherent to cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or other regimens such as INH prophylaxis/TB treatment? Does the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have good understanding of the child's/adolescent's condition and need for treatment? Does the child and adolescent and/or family want to commence ARVs?7121 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Education Ensuring that the child and adolescent and/or parent/caregiver have appropriate knowledge and understanding about the role of the medicines, is central to promoting adherence. If medicines are merely handed over without the necessary counselling, adherence will be poor and treatment will fail. Children, adolescents and their families require access to treatment literacy and adherence counselling services as they continue to grow and develop in to adulthood. HElPIng CHIl DrEn AnD ADO lESCE nTS TO un DErSTAnD An TIrETrOVIr AlS AnD ADHE rEnCE Children and adolescents require information about ARVs in a way that they can understood and can remember. This information should not be complex or confusing but provided in a clear, consistent manner. Interactive, visual counselling tools are being used across Zimbabwe, e.g. the Zvandiri \"Our Story\" game. Tools such as this provide a participatory, flexible, visual tool for helping children and adolescents of all ages to understand more about ART and adherence. This provides a simple means for explaining how ARVs work, how they control HIV in the body, and why adherence is important. 7122 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 FIlM: DEMO nSTrATIng A rT AnD A DHE rEnCE C OunSEllIng In the same way that children and adolescents who have not been informed that they have HIV can gain enormous benefit from partial disclosure (i.e. honest, accurate information in a way which helps them to understand more but does not involve naming HIV), non-disclosed children and adolescents must have appropriate explanations regarding the need for medication. It is the role of the counsellor to assist the child and adolescent to understand that the medication is to help his/her body to become strong again so that he/she can stay well. Points to be covered include: Define adherence Never miss a dose Keep to specific medication times Method of administration Lifelong treatment even when feeling well Acknowledge difficulty of taking medicines \"for life\" Explain importance of strict adherence Emphasize need for communication with health care team Trust, partnership, honesty \"You are not alone!\" Link to peers Preparation Preparing the child and adolescent and family is essential. ART is rarely a medical emergency - 'rushing in' commonly leads to poor adherence as the child and adolescent and family are not adequately prepared. Although health workers and family may be understandably eager to start treatment in order to help the child and adolescent, this preparatory stage is an important 'investment' for the future success of treatment. Take time to prepare the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver with the following information and assist them to formulate a plan for adherence to the medicines within their own home and personal circumstances: Medication administration should be done as consistently as possible - routines should be established early. Consistent routines are often reassuring for children and adolescents and will aid adherence. What regimen is being used? The parent/caregiver should be able to describe the medicines and doses as well as know what side effects to monitor. When will medicines be given? Establish convenient times with the family that take into consideration family, school, and work schedules. Involve the child in preparation of the medicine Will tablets be crushed or swallowed?7123 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Will medicines be mixed with liquids, or be given with food? How will liquids be measured? Who will give the medications? Will they be given every day? Who is the \"back-up\" - who will give the medications if the parent/caregiver can't? This person should be trained by clinic staff if possible. What should the parent/caregiver do if problems arise? Methods for contacting clinic when closed Parent/Caregiver should demonstrate medication preparation (measuring accurately using syringe, crushing, mixing). Problems with administration can be identified early. Continued A rT Counselling The importance of continued ART Counselling cannot be over emphasised. It does not stop once the child and adolescent starts treatment. It is essential to re-assess the child's/adolescent's and parent's/caregiver's understanding of the medicine, any problems they may be experiencing, the impact of the medicine on their life The child's/adolescent's height, weight and blood results are a powerful adherence tool when counselling the child and adolescent. Height and weight are something they can visibly see changing and is a result of their own action i.e. taking the medicine. This can really encourage the child to continue taking their medicine regularly. Like adults, when children and adolescents are very sick, adherence may be good as they want to get better. However, as they get well, adherence to the medicine may not seem so important and ART counselling becomes even more vital Assessing Adherence Ask the child and adolescent AND the parent/caregiver the following questions to assess their understanding of the medicine they are taking and evaluate their adherence to their treatment: Can he/she describe the medicine he/she takes? Can he/she tell you how often he/she takes it? Is he/she able to swallow the tablets? / Can he/she tolerate the syrups? Why does he/she take it? Does he/she remember to take them? What does he/she do to help remember?7124 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 On-going Monitoring and Assessment of Adherence There are no perfect measures to monitor and assess adherence. However, the following measures can be taken to encourage continued adherence to treatment: Emphasize the importance of honest reporting Importance of multidisciplinary approach to monitoring Parent/Caregiver/Child's/Adolescent's reports Medication counts Biological markers Pharmacy records Parent/Caregiver/Child's/Adolescent's r eport Skilled counselling with the child and adolescent can provide important information regarding the child's/adolescent's adherence to ARVs. Some non-judgmental questions that can be asked at each clinic visit include can you tell me how many doses you have missed this week, are you having any difficulties with taking the medicines etc. Note however that: Parent/caregiver, child's/adolescent's report on taking medicines for 3 days, 1 week, 1 month or alternatively the most recent recall of missing a dose tends to overestimate adherence The reliability of self-reporting is dependent on a trusting, non-judgmental relationship between the counsellor and child and adolescent/parent/caregiver These questions provide a simple and easy tool to assess adherence in a setting Always ask \"how many doses did you miss\" rather than \"did you miss doses?\" This gives the message that it is OK to report missing doses Medication Counts Providers often count the remaining medication during clinic visit. However, the problem with this approach is that it relies on the child and adolescent, parent/caregiver bringing the remaining medicines to clinic. Furthermore, the child and adolescent, parent/caregiver can hide pills prior to the visit. Unannounced pill counts tend to be more effective in assessing adherence. biological and Clinical Markers Additional methods for encouraging adherence include, reminding the client that, adherence to treatment can: Improve their clinical status - growth, developmental milestones, school performance, less illnesses Improve CD4 count Decrease their viral load, implying good adherence However, it is important to note that in some patients viral load may remain high even with good adherence due to potential viral resistance or poor absorption of the medicine.7125 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Pharmacy r ecords Pharmacists keep a record of medicines dispensed to each child and adolescent. These can inform the relevant doctor of lapses in children and adolescents collecting their medicines. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is not a measure of ingestion and it requires children and adolescents to always use the same pharmacy Support: Promoting Adherence Involve the child and adolescent in a plan of care. Don't rush to initiate ART. Both parent/caregiver and child and adolescent must be ready Provide on-going counselling, both to the individual and/or their family group Link child and adolescent to a peer counsellor or Community Adolescent Treatment Supporter (CATS) Be sure to provide clear and simple writing informational, educational, and communication materials on ARVs, e.g. in the form of a booklet, pamphlet, or cartoons. Warn the child and adolescent and parent/caregiver about common side effects of taking ARVs Ensure the same adherence message is communicated by all health workers Directly observe therapy whenever possible Support: Family and Community Involvement Identify a dedicated, consistent family parent/caregiver or treatment supporter for the child Familiarize them with ART and adherence Involve them during medical consultations and counselling sessions Use home based care where possible to educate family caregiver to recognize side effects and refer to hospital if needed Community involvement and understanding of ARV therapy is important. Recognise multiple caregivers for children and adolescents in institutions Adherence Fatigue Do not assume that once a client is adherent, they will always be adherent - things change! When children and adolescents improve clinically they may begin to feel that medications are not needed. In addition, potential new stressors may arise - e.g. death, change in caregiver, that cause a child and adolescent to begin less adherence to treatment. Over time, it is very common for children and adolescents to tire of taking medications, parents/caregivers to tire of administering/supervising medications or providers to tire of monitoring/supporting adherence. This is why, treatment adherence assessments are necessary at every point of contact, and health workers must continuously encourage children and adolescents to remain adherent on treatment.7126 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015Support: r ecognising Challenges in Adherence Health workers must also be aware of the following challenges to help children and adolescents address that can be significant barriers to treatment adherence: Misunderstanding/misinformation/misconceptions around HIV Low literacy if written materials are given Lack of social support from family Lack of disclosure, if child and adolescent does not know their status Financial barriers Competing priorities (e.g. work) Stigma and denial Alcohol and medicine use by the parent/caregiver Mental and/or physical illness of the parent/caregiver Testimony \"They kept handing me more and more medicine, saying take this. So I just used to flush them down the toilet. Then they told me why I needed them - now I take them\" (Tafadzwa, 11 years) SuMMAry Adherence is defined as the act or quality of sticking to something, a steady devotion and an acceptance of an active role in one's own health care Adherence to care is central to the appropriate management of children and adolescents with HIV Adherence to ARVs is one of the major counselling issues in the follow up care and support for children and adolescents with HIV Adherence to ARVs is key to successful outcomes by achieving viral suppression and preventing medicine resistance There are many factors which make adherence to ARVs difficult for children and adolescents Counsellors have a vital role to play in the provision of adherence counselling for children and adolescents and their families ACTIVIT y 3: C ASE S CEnArIOS / rO lE Pl Ay - A DHE rEnCE C OunSEllIng Using case studies in the Case Studies Section to conduct role plays on adherence counselling.7127 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen TsSession 4: Sexual and r eproductive Health Counselling Objectives At the end of this session participants should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of the challenges HIV positive adolescents face when discussing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) Ensure the provision of appropriate sexual and reproductive health counselling for adolescents in your context Activity 1: Presentation - Adolescents Living with HIV and Sexual Reproductive Health Activity 2: Group discussion -Providing SRH services in your contextOverview of Activities:7128 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015ACTIVIT y 1: A DOlESCE nTS lIVI ng w ITH HIV A nD S ExuAl rEPrODuCTIVE HEAlTH Adolescents with HIV are growing up and looking forward to relationships and families of their own.

There may be an existing group which children and adolescents could be referred to, once referral pathways are established or strengthened.7132 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 2. If there is no existing group, the first step is to engage local stakeholders, including children and adolescents themselves to introduce your plans to establish a support group. Young people should be at the centre of the planning and development of the group from the beginning. 3. A Skilled Support group facilitator is required. This leader must be committed, knowledgeable and experienced in working with children and adolescents with HIV. Ideally, this leader would come from the local community. 4. Identify a meeting venue. If the venue is cost-free, this will ensure sustainability of the group. The venue must be acceptable, private and safe for young people to access without fear of accidental disclosure and stigmatisation. 5. Establish referral pathways with local clinics, department of child welfare and social services, schools, churches and with community leaders. 6. Develop a programme for when the support group will meet and the activities to take place. 7. Utilize existing tools developed by other partners or develop additional tools to facilitate discussions with the children and adolescents. Always make sure to ask the children and adolescents what they want to focus on in the meetings. 8.

Although this type of counselling can be extremely rewarding, it is a difficult, demanding task, even for highly experienced counsellors. It can be a sad, frustrating and challenging role. These frustrations can lead to physical and emotional stress, which if not addressed can result in burnout. Burnout affects counsellors on a personal level but also impacts on their ability to fulfil their role effectively. This module reviews possible causes, signs and symptoms of stress and burnout when working with children and adolescents in the context of HTS. It discusses self-care and support strategies and the development of stress management plans. It then describes the role of supervision in ensuring the delivery of quality counselling for children and adolescents accessing HTS and the provision of appropriate follow up care and support services.

It is imperative that counsellors have the knowledge and skills required for recognising potential sources of stress, their effects and self-care strategies to avoid stress that leads to burnout. what is Stress? Stress refers to \"physical, mental, emotional strain or tension on the body and/or heart. This strain or tension causes a number of symptoms\" (MOHCC, 2005). Caused by overworking the mind, physical, emotional and mental stress often originates from an external event or circumstance that places a demand on an individual's inner or external resources. Determining how stressful an event is, depends partly on the individual's resources. If the demands on the person (e.g. disclosing an HIV-positive test result to a child and his/her family) exceed his or her ability to cope with them, the person experiences stress (MOHCC, 2006). \"Stress is an inevitable part of life. As a positive influence, stress can help compel us to action - it can result in a new awareness and an exciting new perspective. As a negative influence, it can result in negative feelings which in turn lead to health problems. It is not possible to eliminate stress from our lives. Our goal is to learn how to better manage stress and to use it as a positive force in our lives\" (MOHCC, 2006). Signs and Symptoms of Stress Stress can present itself in different ways in different people but some of the common signs and symptoms include: Physical or mental exhaustion causing general body weakness Irritability Lack of concentration or forgetfulness Loss of appetite / eating too much Palpitations Restlessness Inability to sleep Whilst stress is inevitable for HIV counsellors and needs appropriate management, burnout is not. Stress Management is important in order to prevent stress leading to burnout. what is burnout? If the counsellor faces prolonged exposure to stress, this can result in burnout. \"Burnout\" has been described as \"a physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual 8ACTIVIT y 2: C OunSEllOr SElF CArE, SuPErVISIO n136 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 phenomenon, characterized by progressive loss of idealism, energy and purpose experienced by people working in helping professions\" (MOHCC, 2006). A person is identified as having burnout when the stress is: Persistent - It does not easily go away Unprovoked - It does not have an immediate cause Excessive - It goes beyond an appropriate reaction to a particular cause Disruptive - It compromises your ability to work Involuntary - You feel it even though you don't want to Generalized - It spills over to feelings about your personal life Signs and Symptoms of burnout When a counsellor reaches \"burnout\", he/she may experience a number of the following symptoms: Pessimism, helplessness and hopelessness Anger and prejudice Chronic fatigue Emotional numbness and indifference; social withdrawal Emotional hypersensitivity Impulsiveness, acting out and addictive habits Chronic and nonspecific physical aches and pains, with no medical explanation Grief, sadness and depression Self-righteous heroism and withdrawal from people outside of HIV and AIDS work Potential Sources of Stress and burnout when working with children and adolescents and HTS All HIV counsellors face recurrent stressful situations. This is particularly so when working with children and adolescents in the context of HIV. There are numerous potential sources of stress, some of which include: Sense of being overwhelmed by the number of children and adolescents affected by HIV infection. Excessive workload due to number of children and adolescents requiring your services A strong sense of commitment to the needs of children and adolescents and their families in your care Identification with the child and adolescent and their family (e.g. fears for your own children and adolescents or similarities with your own family situation) An overwhelming desire to protect the child and adolescent Sense of helplessness and desire to do more to assist the child and adolescent8137 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts Fear of discussing sensitive issues with the child and adolescent (e.g. HIV, MTCT, death, coping with HIV) Powerful emotions of anger, frustration, sadness for child's/adolescent's situation Fear of HIV infection Coping with the emotions and responses of both the child and adolescent and their family The need to 'hide' the diagnosis from the child as the child and/or family are not ready Fatigue, monotony (repeatedly saying the same messages, same explanations) Strong emotions about teenagers' risky behaviour Witnessing and responding to the strong emotions of children and adolescents dealing with challenging legal and ethical dilemmas Child's/adolescent's behaviour / family's behaviour towards you Not enjoying the counselling role of informing children and adolescents of bad news Insufficient access to supportive and experienced supervisors Inadequate training to perform a counselling role Inadequate resources to assist in fulfilling your role Not being realistic about your limits, understanding and level of experience Inability to express your feelings, particularly anger and grief Lack of effective ways of coping with stress SElF-CArE STrATEgIES It is important that counsellors implement self-support strategies in order to help alleviate the stress encountered in their work and to prevent it from leading to burnout. Various strategies should be implemented and these are as follows: 1. know y ourself Knowing yourself is the starting point of taking care of oneself. If counsellors are able to understand their own needs and capabilities, this can assist them in anticipating stressful situations, recognising how they respond to stress and then managing the stress. 2. Take Care of y ourself In their efforts to care for others, it is important that counsellors do not neglect themselves. This includes eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, exercise and use of relaxation techniques.8138 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 3. Enjoy y ourself Counsellors should develop boundaries between professional and personal life. This emotionally demanding role requires that counsellors take regular time out of work to relax, spend time doing the things they enjoy and socialise with family and friends outside of work. 4. know y our l imits Counselling children and adolescents and their families is a challenging role, even for the most experienced counsellor. Knowing your limits involves recognising and accepting the limits of your knowledge and expertise so that you are not stressed by the feeling of being unable to cope or manage. Knowing when to ask for help and when to refer to others is an important part of preventing stress. Furthermore, while children and adolescents commonly have a variety of needs it is important to be realistic and accept what you can and cannot do. 5. Express y ourself Sharing your feelings, emotions and experiences with a trusted friend or colleague provides counsellors with an important opportunity to release stress. SuPPO rT STrATEgIES In addition to Self Care strategies, all counsellors need formal support strategies in the workplace to prevent or mitigate the effects of stress and burnout. This is especially true for child and adolescent counsellors who have to deal with HIV positive children and adolescents and their affected families. Support strategies include debriefing, support groups, training, mentorship and supervision. These will be discussed in turn. 1. Debriefing Debriefing provides an opportunity for counsellors to share challenging experiences about their role with their peers. In this way counsellors can provide support for one another and share stress management strategies. 2. Support g roups Sharing of problems with other counsellors is an important strategy for minimising stress and burnout. Support groups provide an informal environment where counsellors can support and assist each other. Both social and work related issues can be discussed. This also assists in the development of a strong team in which colleagues understand and support one another.8139 HIV Tes TIng s erVIces for cHI ldren and a dolescen Ts 3. Training HTS for children and adolescents requires specialist skills in order to fulfil this challenging role. If counsellors feel inadequately equipped to fulfil their role, this can be immensely stressful. It is essential that counsellors have opportunities for professional development, training and skills development. 4. Mentorship A mentor is an experienced professional who provides support to another less experienced member of staff. An available and accessible mentor is an important source of support and training for counsellors. 5. Supportive Supervision Supervision is an essential support strategy for counsellors. It is defined as \"a working alliance between a supervisor and counsellor in which the counsellor gives an account or record of his/her work, reflects on it, and receives feedback and guidance\". This helps the counsellor develop ethical competence, confidence, and creativity, which enhances the quality of services offered to clients (FHI, 2005). Supervision may be conducted either in one-on-one meetings or group sessions and should be held regularly. During these meetings the counsellor and supervisor can discuss challenging cases, share experiences and develop strategies for managing difficult situations. Counselling supervision is neither a privilege nor a reward; it is a necessity.

Action Planning is an important process in the overall monitoring and evaluation of services. It assists us to improve the quality of services through: Identifying areas which are not being addressed properly Identifying ways in which they could be addressed better Identifying time frames for doing this Identifying key responsible people for doing this Identifying what resources are needed The process of developing and implementing an action plan also encourages the team to work together in identifying challenges and finding solutions. This promotes a shared sense of responsibility and ownership of the need to ensure that services are child and adolescent friendly and thus implementation of the action plan.

A false result may irrevocably damage the reputation of HTS and cause untold suffering to the patient or client. TwO COMPO nEnTS OF qu AlITy ASS urAnCE M uST b E rECO gnIZED : 1. Internal quality control: Internal quality control includes good laboratory practices with set standards of practice for performing HIV tests, checking rapid HIV test kits storage and expiry dates. Quality control calls for periodic inclusion of previously tested blood samples in order to identify problems with competency of the personnel performing the HIV tests and identifying problems with the test kits. On all test kits there is always an internal quality assurance control line. If this control line is absent, the test is invalid. If it is present, this is an indicator that the test is working. Below are important considerations for ensuring the internal quality of HIV testing: All personnel conducting Rapid HIV Testing should have undergone the standard training in Rapid HIV Testing and have been examined and certified competent by the Medical Laboratory Clinical and Scientist Council. Always use the Rapid HIV Testing Standard Operating Procedure when conducting tests. Test kits should be stored in a cool dry place away from the sun. Always check expiry date and packaging before use so as to never use test kits that have expired, have damaged packaging, or test with kits that should not be used if the control line is absent. Run controls of known negative and known positive samples every morning before conducting tests and when opening a new kit (pack). (Where possible the samples are prepared and distributed by the District/Mission Laboratory Scientist in collaboration with the District Nursing Officer ,Community Health Nurses and other members of the district team (for transport and other logistics) Always follow the manufacturer's instruction regarding volume of sample, chase buffer and reading time. Always use Chase Buffer from the same kit. Follow the proper procedure for DBS collection. Always ensure accurate documentation at all times. 9144 Par TIcIPanT's Manual // second edITIon 2015 2. External quality assurance: Lot testing: When new batches of kits arrive in the country, lot testing to validate the kits should take place at the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL) before use in the country. Proficiency testing: All facilities providing HTS should receive HIV proficiency sample panels at least once a year from the Zimbabwe National Quality Assurance Programme (ZINQAP). Arrangements should be made by the NMRL to ensure that proficiency testing sample panels are distributed to facilities that are registered with ZINQAP. The Laboratory Scientists at these facilities should then distribute these sample panels to facilities that are conducting Rapid HIV Testing, but are not registered with ZINQAP. Blinded rechecking: 5-10% of all blood samples must be sent to the NMRL for re- testing. If this is not sustainable as a result of high numbers of patients or clients, the percentages can be reduced with guidance from the NMRL. Remedial actions: All facilities failing the proficiency tests need to receive additional technical supervision and support from district, provincial and national support teams. Support teams should include laboratory scientist or HIV testing focal person. lAbOrATO ry S AFET y rulES Strict laboratory safety precautions must be followed based on recommendations adopted by the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (as indicated in the \"Safety Module\" during rapid HIV test training). Each facility must have on hand a site-appropriate guide on laboratory safety precautions. All precautions to protect against blood contamination should be observed. In case of an accident during testing, the national PEP policy should be followed. 9 SuMMAry Internal quality control includes good laboratory practices with set standards of practice for performing HIV tests, checking rapid HIV test kits storage and expiry dates.
