It is literally the beginning and end of life. Without trees, we'd have no air to breathe. The lush forests or beckoning waters of nature can calm us, make us feel secure, and even help us seek answers to questions we have. Just as quickly as nature can sooth you, it can blast in and destroy everything in its path within minutes. If you find peace in nature and want to connect with it further, we suggest using healing crystals. These crystals come from the earth and they have a close connection with nature.

As spring continues to warm the earth's crust, a frenzy of growth converts barren landscapes into lush glades, and the leaves of plants and trees emerge in a thousand shades of green. Like their counterparts in the plant kingdom, the green gems and minerals are the growth crystals. They are powerful conduits of the earth's Life Force of birth, development, and creation, and of the power of nature's constant renewal. Use Green Crystals Green Crystals Bring You Renewal, Success in New Ventures, and Good Health Crystals of pure green are potent aids in nurturing, whether of fledgling family relationships or new business ventures.
