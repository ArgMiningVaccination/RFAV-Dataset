This year marks a new beginning not only for those of you who are stepping onto campus for the first time, but for all of us. It's even more poignant that we are starting this journey after one of the most challenging periods any of us have ever faced. The COVID-19 pan - demic changed our world as we know it. And while it forced us to physically distance ourselves from each other, in many ways it brought this campus community even closer together. Furthermore, University of Bridge - port joined Goodwin University and Paier College in May 2021 in a part - nership that builds on the legacy of the Purple Knights and creates new opportunities for our students. One thing that has not changed as we move forward is our dedication to providing you with career-oriented programs and flexible degree options that prepare you to succeed in life. I promise that at UB we will continue to offer an educational experience grounded in academic excellence, personal responsibility, and commit - ment to service. No matter your degree program or area of study, we are here to support you every step of the way on your path to a successful career and an amazing future. This will be a year of many firsts for all of us. As your new president, I hope you are as excited as I am to start. Sincerely, Danielle Wilken Ed.D.

The University promotes academic excel - lence, personal responsibility and commit - ment to service. Distinctive curricula in an international, culturally diverse supportive learning environment prepare graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly inter - connected world. The University is indepen - dent and non-sectarian. History The University of Bridgeport was founded in 1927 as the Junior College of Connecti - cut \u2014 the first junior college chartered by any legislature in the northeastern states. The college had as its purpose, in the words of the founders, to develop in students a point of view and a habit of mind that promotes clear thinking and sound judgment in later professional and business experience. Al - though UB has changed in many ways since then, this commitment to student preparation and community service remains central to its mission. The Junior College of Connecticut became the University of Bridgeport in 1947, when the State of Connecticut chartered the institu - tion as a four-year university with authority to grant the baccalaureate degree. By that time, the former Barnum estate at Seaside Park had been purchased and growth in students, fac - ulty, programs and buildings was rapid. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business were added at once, and the col - leges of Nursing, Education, and Engineering soon after. The Junior College expanded its offerings through a merger with the Weylister Secretarial Junior College of Milford, Connect - icut, and through the addition of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene (at its inception in 1949 the only such school in Connecticut and the second in New England). By 1950, the University had moved from the original Fairfield Avenue location to the pres - ent Seaside Park campus, which has since grown from 22 to 53 acres. Enrollment was nearly 3,500 students, including a number of international students, taught by a faculty of 183 men and women. In 1951 the University awarded its first Master's degree. In 1953 the University expanded its pro - grams when Arnold College, the oldest co - educational school of physical education in the United States, merged with and was incorporated into the College of Education. In January 1979 UB inaugurated its first doc - toral degree program, Educational Leader - ship; and in 1991 the College of Chiropractic was established, representing the first affili - ation of a chiropractic school with a univer - sity in the United States. In 2005 the Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering was added and further doctoral and masters level degrees followed. University of Bridgeport Today The University today continues its commit - ment to excellence as it maintains its tradi - tion of responding to the changing needs of society through the liberal arts and its pro - fessional programs. Programs are focused so that students receive the kind of personal advising and attention usually found only at small colleges. Furthermore, the Univer - sity takes full advantage of its location in a progressive urban setting, using regional resources as \"living laboratories\" to supple - ment the traditional academic instruction of - fered on the campus. Through co-operative education programs, students can learn from experience by integrating classroom studies on campus with supervised employment in industrial, service, and government sectors. The University through its schools and colleg - es offers a variety of undergraduate and grad - uate degree programs from associate through doctoral levels. In addition, the University's College of Chiropractic awards the Doctor of Chiropractic degree; College of Naturopathic Medicine awards the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and Acupuncture awards the Mas - ter of Science in Acupuncture. UB Online has both undergraduate and graduate degree programs entirely online. The University sees its student body as a valuable resource. Approximately 5,000 stu - dents were enrolled in 2012-2013, sixty per - cent of whom are full-time, coming from 45 states and 86 foreign countries and repre - senting a rich diversity of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Faculty The UB instructional staff consists of 121 full- time faculty, and nearly all hold doctoral or terminal degrees in their fields. The regular faculty is augmented by approximately 370 adjunct faculty. Faculty honors include Fulbright Schol - ars, National Science Foundation Fellows, Ford Fellows, National Endowment for the Humanities Fellows, American Council for Learned Societies Scholars, Phi Beta Kappa Scholars, Phi Kappa Phi Scholars and Sigma Xi Scholars.

Campus and Campus History The University of Bridgeport is located fifty- five miles from New York City. Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, borders the 53-acre campus to the north. Seaside Park and the Long Island Sound, with some of the fin - est sandy beaches between New York and Cape Cod, mark the southern boundary. The unique location of the campus offers a variety of advantages to the University community. The Sound and the Park are settings for stud - ies in marine biology and for the enjoyment of sun and recreation. The city and county provide opportunities for becoming involved in work-study programs with schools, gov - ernment and some of the country's largest Fortune 500 and multi-national corporations. The architectural diversity of UB's dozens of buildings, from stately homes as well as newer structures of modern design, reflects the origins and progress of the university and also embodies its twofold commitment to so - lidity and change. The entrance to Marina Dining Hall , was once the entrance arch to the estate of Phineas Taylor Barnum, who served as Mayor of Bridgeport from 1875 to 1876 and played a crucial role in the city's cultural and economic development. Bryant Hall, with its inlaid mosaic entryway and ornately carved banisters and ceilings, was built in 1895 for inventor Waldo C. Bryant. The Carstensen Hall is a facsimile of a pavil - ion at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. It was designed in 1899 for the chemist George Ed - wards, whose research led to improving the durability of silver plate. Between the cam - pus and Seaside Park is the Perry Arch , de- signed by Henry Bacon, who also designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. The more modern buildings house academic and student life on campus: The Carlson Building , prominently located on the main quad of the University, was built by the generosity of William and Phil - lips Carlson in 1955. Until the completion of Wahlstrom Library in 1974, Carlson served as the University's first standalone library. Today it houses the School of Education on its first floor and the School of Public and International Affairs on it second floor. The building also houses the language laboratory and the film and video facility. The John J. Cox Student Center provides so - cial, recreational, and extracurricular cultural programs. It has a social hall with a seating capacity of 400; lounges and meeting rooms; a games room and bowling alley; the office of The Scribe (the campus newspaper); the studio and transmitter of WPKN (an indepen - dent non-commercial FM radio station); and offices of the Student Congress and student clubs and organizations, as well as offices of the Student Development division.The Charles A. Dana Hall of Science is de - signed for study and research in biology, chemistry, physics, health sciences, medical laboratory science and geology. There is a 285-seat lecture auditorium, and the unique Science Wall of Honor commemorating thir - ty-seven of the world's \"Immortals of Sci - ence.\" It is also the home of the School of Arts and Sciences. Eleanor Naylor Dana Hall provides facilities for the Physician Assistant Program and the graduate program in Human Nutrition. The UB Health Sciences Center houses the UB Clinics in Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Dental Hygiene, and Naturopathic care. It is also the home to the Administration for the Acupuncture Institute, School of Naturopath - ic Medicine and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene. The Harvey Hubbell Gymnasium is the center for intercollegiate sports programs. It seats 2,500 spectators. Ernest C. Trefz School of Business houses the School of Business and a major computer laboratory. The College of Chiropractic Building has class and conference rooms, offices, a labo - ratory, and an auditorium seating two hun - dred people. It is equipped with the modern facilities necessary for the professional pro - grams offered by the Chiropractic faculty. The Technology Building provides the engi - neering disciplines with the special capabili - ties and equipment needed for programs in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and com - puter engineering. The Magnus Wahlstrom Library is the aca - demic and physical heart of the campus. The nine-story building is home to many differ - ent types of information resources, collec - tions, and services. The \"Garden Level\" houses the Office of the Registrar, The Bursar and Financial Aid, Ca - reer Services and UB Online. The Sixth floor the Office of Admissions. The Seventh floor houses the Division of Administration and Finance and the Office of the Provost. The Eighth floor houses the Office of the Presi - dent.Introduction12The Wheeler Recreation Center offers op - portunities for students to enjoy recreational sports. Wheeler has a 25-meter pool with one-meter and three-meter diving boards and adjacent steam room and sauna facilities. The field house has a multi-purpose area for tennis, basketball, and volleyball, with a jog - ging track around the perimeter. In addition, there are courts for racquetball and handball. Security Services The University offers a combination of secu - rity services that include a Securitas Security Service USA managed public safety force, escort services, and twenty-four-hour moni - tored access to all residence halls.

NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EVALUATIONS FOR CREDIT RECOMMENDATIONS UB accepts evaluations of non-university sponsored instruction as part of a student applicant's transfer evaluation. UB accepts evaluations of non-university sponsored in - struction from the following nationally rec - ognized institutions: American Council on Education College Credit Recommendation Service: ACE CREDIT recommends academic credit for formal courses or examinations offered by various organizations, from businesses and unions to the government and military. o ACE CREDIT includes evaluations on military credits, DSST exams, ALEKS Exams (McGraw-Hill) and many more non-university organizations. o The ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI), the ACTFL Writing Proficiency (WPT), the ACTFL Reading Proficien - cy Test (RPT), the ACTFL Listening Proficiency Test (LTP) and the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview Computer Test (OPIc) are recommended for col - lege credit by the American Council on Education (ACE). National College Credit Recommendation Service (formerly National PONSI), under the auspices of the State University of New York, Board of Regents, evaluates training and education programs offered outside of the traditional college classroom setting and recommends them for college credit equivalencies. National CCRS coordinates teams of college faculty evaluators and subject matter experts to conduct extensive reviews of education and training programs offered by corporations, unions, religious organizations and proprietary schools. CREDIT FOR LIFE WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAM (CLWEP) Some students acquire mastery over course subject matter through prior work or training experience. UB values the university-level knowledge that student's may have acquired outside the traditional university classroom. In the CLWEP portfolio assessment, students demonstrate that what they already know is equivalent to what they would have learned in an equivalent college course. A student may have acquired this knowledge through past work, independent reading and study, training programs or in-service courses, vol - unteer service, cultural or artistic pursuits, hobbies and recreational pastimes, com - munity or religious activities, organizational memberships, adult education, non-credit courses, study abroad, military training not evaluated for credit by ACE, or other expe - riences. A portfolio enables the student to identify and articulate this knowledge, and potentially earn credit for it. Students learn the process of identifying ar - eas of course-equivalent learning and port - folio development skills through the CLWEP guidelines and assessment plan. CLWEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency re - quirement. CLWEP credit is included in the student's semester hours earned at the Uni - versity and also in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for gradu - ation honors. However, such credit is not computed in the student's quality point ratio at the University.

Since students are admitted solely on the ba - sis of their academic and personal qualities, without regard to their financial circumstanc - es, the University offers a variety of financial aid and scholarship programs to provide fi - nancial assistance to qualified students. The University of Bridgeport subscribes to the policy that eligibility for scholarship aid should depend on the student's achievement and promise, but that the amount of aid should depend on the relative financial need of the student and his or her family. The financial need of most students at the University can be met in the form of scholar - ships, grants, loans and student employment. Funds are available to the student through the University of Bridgeport from federal and state governments, private foundations and University resources. The University of Bridgeport awards merit scholarships recognizing outstanding aca - demic achievement and student leadership. In addition, there are a number of other pay - ment assistance programs that include non- University tuition plans. Students enrolled in tuition discounted pro - grams and Distance Learning programs are not eligible to receive institutional scholar - ships or grants. The Office of Student Financial Services de - termines the amount and combinations of aid for which the student is eligible. Finan - cial aid decisions are made after a student has been admitted and requests for financial assistance will not influence a candidate's consideration for admission. Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis and continuing students must apply each year for aid. Application Procedures New domestic students are encouraged to begin to apply for financial aid at the same time they are seeking admission. Applicants for financial aid need to: 1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to www. studentaid.gov. Be sure to include the University's school code, 001416, on the FAFSA. 2.

Satisfactory Academic Progress In order to maintain eligibility for financial aid a student must maintain satisfactory aca - demic progress. Financial aid recipients are expected to make reasonable progress as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive aid. Students' academic progress is assessed according to qualitative and pace measures as they apply. The qualitative measure (grades) is similar to the academic standards applied to all UB students. The pace measure (number of credit hours com - pleted successfully/maximum timeframe) is used to monitor progress toward degree completion.

Cox Student Center, Room 116 244 University Ave., Bridgeport, CT 06604 Telephone: (203) 576-4392 or 4393 E-mail: deanofstudents@bridgeport.edu The contribution of the Division of Student Affairs to the University of Bridgeport and its students arises out of the special perspec - tive which members of the student affairs staff have about students and their growth and development, their experiences, and their campus environments. This perspec - tive draws on research about teaching and learning, which emphasize the importance of community, diversity, and individual dif - ferences to the educational experience. The Student Life program is administered through the Division of Student Affairs by the Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students. It includes campus activi - ties and civic engagement, community stan - dards, counseling services, health services, housing and residential life, interfaith center, international center for students and schol - ars, student accessibility services, as well as Title IX. The Division of Student Affairs enhances and supports the mission, goals, and objectives of the University of Bridgeport as an interna - tional, culturally diverse supportive learning environment, preparing graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly interconnected world. In this role, the staff of the student af - fairs division has a diverse and complicated set of responsibilities: to advocate for the common good while championing the rights of the individual; to encourage intelligent risk-taking while setting limits on behavior; and to promote independent thought while teaching interdependent behavior. The extent to which the University is suc - cessful in creating a climate in which these contradictory ends can coexist is reflected in how well students are able to recognize and deal with such contradictions both during and after their college experience. The Divi - sion of Student Affairs is committed to assist - ing students and the University of Bridgeport community as they seek to meet the chal - lenges inherent in balancing these complex and often competing goals. \u2014Adopted from A Perspective on Student Af -fairs, National Association of Student Person - nel Administrators, 1987. Students are encouraged to take an active role in the life of the campus community, where there are many opportunities to con - tribute to group decisions, practice leader - ship, sort out priorities and make personal choices. Students at the University of Bridge - port are responsible for making their own decisions and forming their own judgments concerning personal, social and academic activities. They share the responsibility for maintaining the educational climate needed for learning and for personal growth. The University retains high expectations of ap - propriate behavior and expects that when students decide to enroll they will abide by all the rules of the University. When the University deems it necessary it reserves the right to notify the parent or guardian to whom a student is financially dependent regarding the health, academic or disciplinary status of the student. (Depen - dency is defined by Section 152 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code). Services STUDENT INVOLVEMENT The Office of Student Involvement is dedi - cated to community success through chal - lenging students to become engaged in student organization membership and partic - ipation, leadership development, and com - munity service. Through active participation, students contribute to making a difference for the community by creating and executing diverse programs. The Office provides guid - ance and mentorship for all student clubs and organizations as well as offers friendly services and inviting facilities for the total learning experience. Events and activities approved by the Office are designed to motivate, challenge, intro - duce and create opportunities for education \u2014 both inside and outside the classroom. The Office of Student Involement employs workers that support the transformation of campus culture through hands-on experi - ences in project management, workshop de - velopment, club training, project implemen - tation, student advisement, event planning, budgeting, student supervision, and the de - velopment of leadership skills. The Office is located in the John J. Cox Student Center, Rm 231.

PROVISIONAL A student who has met the general require - ments for admission, but not those for full standing because the promise of achieve - ment in the area of intended study cannot be accurately appraised at the time of admis - sion, is admitted provisionally subject to con - ditions stated on the Certificate of Admission. STUDENT STATUS Only matriculated students carrying at least twelve semester hours are eligible for elec - tion to class and other offices (with the ex - ception of the Part-time Student Council, and University Senate) A full-time student is defined as someone accepted to the University pursuing an aca - demic program, registered for at least 12 semester hours of credit each semester (ex - cluding co-op terms). A part-time matriculated student has been accepted into a degree program and regis - ters for 1-11 semester hours of credit each semester. An applicant admitted with permission to take courses for which he or she is qualified (met the prerequisites), but not as a degree candidate, is a special student. Special Stu - dents may later apply for matriculation and are subject to any changes in graduation re - quirements instituted prior to actual matricu - lation. CLASS STANDING Students are classified according to the num - ber of college hours satisfactorily completed: Freshman 0-29 semester hours Sophomore 30-59 semester hours Junior 60-89 semester hoursSenior 90 and above THE MAJOR All matriculated students are expected to declare their major before the end of their sophomore; however, some majors require earlier declaration if the student plans to complete within four years. The student must earn a grade of \"C-\" or better in every major course. However, the student's overall quality point ratio in major courses must be at least 2.0. In some cas - es, departmental requirements may exceed these minimums. If a student earns a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a course in the major field, he or she retake that course and earn a \"C-\" or better. THE MINOR The University offers the option of selecting a second area of specialization. Like the ma - jor, the minor was conceived to provide a unified, coherent program in a discipline or area of knowledge. While requiring a second focus for the student's intellectual interests, it enables him or her to investigate the im - portant concepts of a specific area and to acquire a firm basis for further study. In terms of career preparation, the minor op - tion can complement a regular major pro - gram or it may add an entirely new dimen - sion to the traditional curriculum. A minor is a minimum of 18 credits to be defined by the School and Department. Students who wish to pursue a minor should obtain the Minor Request Form in the Dean's or Director's office of the College or School in which the minor is offered. Any student seeking more than one minor requires the Dean's written permission. The following minors are currently available at the University of Bridgeport: Accounting (Accounting Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Applied Music- (Music Program, College of Science and Society) Arabic- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Biology- (Biology Program, College of Science and Society) Chemistry- (Chemistry Department, College of Science and Society) Chinese- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Computer Engineering- (Computer Engineering Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Computer Science- (Computer Science Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Criminal Justice and Human Security- (Criminal Justice and Human Security Program, College of Science and Society) Education (Education Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Electrical Engineering- (Electrical Engineering Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) English and Professional Writing - (English Program, College of Science and Society) Film, Television, and Digital Media (English Department, College of Science and Society) Finance (Finance Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) French- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) History- (Contact the Chair of the General Studies: Humanities Program, College of Science and Society) Human Services- (Human Services Program), College of Science and Society) Industrial Organizational Psychology - (Psychology Program, College of Science and Society) Japanese- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Korean- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Management (Management Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Academic Regulations and Procedures32 Mathematics- (Mathematics Program, College of Science and Society) Mechanical Engineering- (Mechanical Engineering Program, College of Engineering, Business, and Education) Multicultural Studies- (General Studies: Social Science Program, College of Science and Society) Music- (Music Program, College of Science and Society) Philosophy- (General Studies: Humanities Program, College of Science and Society) Physics- (Physics Department, College of Science and Society) Pre-medicine- (Biology Program, College of Science and Society) Psychology- (Psychology Program, College of Science and Society) Russian- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Spanish- (Modern Languages program, College of Science and Society) Theater- (Music Program, College of Science and Society) SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE Students who wish to earn a second Bach - elor's degree must fulfill all College/School and major requirements for the second de - gree and must earn a minimum of 30 ad - ditional credits beyond the number required for the first Bachelor's. DOUBLE MAJORS Students who wish to earn a double major must complete all major requirements for both majors which might involve completing additional credits above those required for a single major. If the degrees are from dif - ferent colleges, additional requirements may apply as well. UNDECLARED MAJORS All students who have not declared a ma - jor program of student will continue to work with their professional advisor to identify ap - propriate curriculum plans through general education requirements and elective options. By the end of sophomore year, all matriculat - ed students are expected to have a declared major. The Advising System The University provides academic and per - sonal services to support each student's ef - fort to gain the best possible undergradu - ate education. Selecting a course of study, choosing a major, and deciding upon a ca - reer are crucial decisions for every student. The Advising System functions to assist stu - dents in designing their programs according to their individual interests and needs. Students are assigned a professional advisor upon acceptance to the University. Profes - sional advisors are available for consultation throughout the student's tenure for purposes of academic advisement and assistance with course selection. As a student transitions from first to second year, s/he will be as - signed a faculty advisor in the selected ma - jor; however, undeclared students will con - tinue to work with their professional advisor until a major is declared. Advisors approve registrations for traditional undergraduates and program or major changes for all stu - dents. For assistance with non-academic concerns, professional counselors are avail - able through the University's Student Affairs Division. Registration for Courses The student must formally register for cours - es during the regular or early registration pe - riod. All charges for the semester are payable in full before or during registration unless the student has applied for the deferred pay - ment plan. A program of fifteen or sixteen semester hours constitutes a normal load. No student will be permitted to register for more than eighteen semester hours in any one semester without the prior written ap - proval of the appropriate College Dean or School Director. CHANGE OF REGISTRATION All changes of registration are coordinated through the professional center. Students shall refer to the published course schedule and Key to UB to determine additional ap - proval procedures and requirements for all program changes. The student must submit all approved changes of registration, includ - ing course withdrawals, to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines. ADD / DROP Undergraduate students may withdraw from any course with advisor approval. Course withdrawals may be requested up to the last date to withdraw from courses as published in the course schedule book or academic cal - endar. To withdraw from a course, obtain a Schedule Adjustment Form from the Office of the Registrar and take it to your advisor. Advisor's signature is required to withdraw from any course. Return the signed with - drawal form to the Office of the Registrar for processing. If a student officially withdraws from a course by the add/drop deadline, no grade will be reported and the course will not appear on the student's transcript. On occasions a with - drawal is granted after the first 20 days for reasons beyond the student's control as deter - mined by the student's advisor. In these cases, a \"W\" will be posted on the student's tran - script for the course. When a student registers for a course, but ceases to attend class without filing an application for withdrawal a grade of \"F\" shall be posted to the student's tran - script. Tuition refunds for course withdrawals will be calculated according to the Univer - sity's official refund policy. Federal Financial Aid awards are subject to adjustment when a student withdraws from the University. Ces - sation of attendance, notice to instructors, or telephone calls to the University, do not con - stitute official withdrawal from the University. CLASS ATTENDANCE Undergraduate students are expected to at - tend their classes regularly. The instructor shall specify in the course syllabus at the be - ginning of the semester the extent to which the attendance factor will be taken into ac - count when grades are calculated. Due al - lowance, however, will be made for such factors as illness, inclement weather, and se - vere personal or family problems. UNIVERSITY POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH UNERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE PROGRAMSAcademic Regulations and Procedures33INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE POLICY International students must pursue a full- time course of study to maintain status and are required by the conditions of their visa to attend scheduled classes. Failure to at - tend classes may lead to termination of SE - VIS records. Before making changes to their schedules, International students must speak with an academic advisor and consult with International Student Services. ISS is located on the Garden Level of Wahlstrom Library. UNIVERSAL ENGLISH All student papers submitted to any instruc - tor at the University must be of University standard in form, spelling, punctuation and literary organization. Instructors may refuse to read or to correct papers that are not in keeping with the standards of good English usage. Grades and Quality Points Grades are an indication of the standard of academic work performed. Throughout their program of study, students will be continu - ally apprised of their academic progress. Students' grades are provided at the end of each course. Requests for official transcripts must be made in writing, accompanied by a $10.00 administrative fee which is submitted to the Accounting Office. Official transcripts are released by the Registrar's Office only af - ter all other offices have issued clearances for the student. The University of Bridgeport uses the follow - ing academic grading system. The chart also describes the impact of each grade on a stu - dent's academic progress. GRADE QUALITY PTS EXPLANATION INCLUDED INCLUDED IN CREDITS IN CREDITS EARNED ATTEMPTED A (93- 100) 4.0 Excellent Yes Yes A - (90 -92) 3.7 Excellent Yes Yes B+ (87 -89) 3.3 Good Yes Yes B (83 -86) 3.0 Good Yes Yes B - (80 -82) 2.7 Good Yes Yes C+ (77 -79) 2.3 Satisfactory Yes Yes C (73- 76) 2.0 Satisfactory Yes Yes C- (70 -72) 1.7 Below Yes Yes D+ (67 -69) 1.3 Poor Yes Yes D (63- 66) 1.0 Poor Yes Yes D- (60 -62) 0.7 Poor Yes Yes F (below 60) 0.0 Fail No Yes Grades followed by an \"R\" on transcripts in - dicate that the course has been repeated. Grades not used in the calculation of Grade Point Average: GRADE QUALITY PTS EXPLANATION INCLUDED INCLUDED IN CREDITS IN CREDITS EARNED ATTEMPTED P N/A Pass Yes Yes TR N/A Transfer Credit Yes Yes DP N/A Dropped Course No No NS N/A No Start No No UG N/A Ungraded No Yes CBE N/A Credit by Yes Yes Examination AU N/A Audit No No W N/A Withdrawn No Yes INC N/A Incomplete No Yes EC N/A Credit Awarded Yes Yes Experiential Learning EXT N/A Continuing No No Education Credit AP N/A Advance Placement Yes Yes Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of quality points of each grade total by the total number of assigned credits for that course. The GPA is obtained by divid - ing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credits attempted. A student's transcript identifies two different Grade Point Averages (GPA). The first is the Semester GPA, which is based on the courses taken only for that semester and the second is a Cumulative GPA (CGPA) that consists of all the courses a student has taken at the University and the grades received for those courses. REPEATED COURSES Students may repeat any course at any grade level below \"A\". The grade from the first re - peat of a given course will replace the first- time grade for the computation of the QPR, the original grade however, will remain on the transcript. The grade for a course repeat - ed more than twice will be the average of all of the grades earned each time the course was taken. All repeated courses will be so indicated on the transcript. PASS/FAIL OPTION (FREE ELECTIVES ONLY) Undergraduate students may elect to take up to 6 courses in an academic degree program on the pass/fail basis. Only free electives may be chosen for the pass/fail option, and no more than two courses may be on that basis in a given semester. Request to take a course on the pass/fail basis must be made in writing on the appropriate form after reg - istration in the course, but absolutely no later than the tenth day of scheduled classes in a regular semester, the fifth day for a ten- week course, or the third day for a five-week course. Students should review the com - plete regulations with their advisors before requesting the pass/fail option through the Registrar's Office. INCOMPLETE WORK Incomplete grades (\"I\" or \"R\") must be re - corded by the date stipulated by the Regis - trar at the end of the semester. No incom - plete will be so recorded by the Registrar unless it is accompanied by a clear indica - tion from the course instructor of the nature of the work to be made up. The Registrar will provide appropriate forms with grade sheets. This information will be placed in the student files. a. An \"I\" (incomplete) grade designates in - complete work in a course at the time of grading for reasons beyond the student's control and determined to be bona fide by the instructor. These would include absence from a final examination or in - ability to complete terminal assignments due to illness, employment conflicts, etc. In such cases where the \"I\" grade is awarded the incomplete will revert to a failing grade if the unfinished work is not satisfactorily completed by the end Academic Regulations and Procedures34of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted, exclusive of the summer ses - sions. b. A grade of \"R\" indicates incomplete work in thesis, research, or undergradu - ate or graduate student project courses. The \"R\" grade must be removed within a period of time specified by the instruc - tor/mentor/project advisor or director. It must be within the maximum time allowable for degree completion in the academic program where the degree is being sought. \"W\" GRADE No student may withdraw from a course without the knowledge of his/her academic advisor, as indicated by that advisor's signa - ture on the change of schedule form or ap - proval via the Drop/Add Web Form. With - drawal \"W\" grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the official change of registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period in a given semester or summer session, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with the grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR but do count toward \"hours attempted.\" 2. The names of students who have officially withdrawn from a course and received the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 3. Withdrawals are not permitted beyond the course withdrawal deadline. After the deadline, students will receive an earned grade as determined by the instructor. If a student submits a withdrawal after the withdrawal deadline but prior to the semester ending, the student will have an automatic grade of \"F\" entered for their grade. Academic Status of Students Undergraduate The following policies and standards define the minimum requirements for maintaining good academic standing in the undergradu - ate degree programs of the University. High - er requirements may be established by the faculty for specific programs, subject to ap - proval by appropriate College committees, the appropriate senior administrator of the College or School and the Provost. Such re - quirements are described in the appropriate section of this catalog. GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING Good Academic Standing: A student whose Term GPA and Cumulative GPA are 2.0 or above. The student who is not maintaining good ac - ademic standing will be permitted to remain in a degree program while attempting to re - establish normal academic progress, unless and until the student is subject to academic separation as described below. A student may be awarded a degree only when all degree requirements have been satisfied. In particular, a student who has failed to maintain normal academic prog - ress at some point, must have reestablished normal academic progress before a degree is awarded. ACADEMIC WARNING Academic Warning: A student whose term GPA is below 2.0 but the cumulative GPA is 2.0 or above. ACADEMIC PROBATION When a student's Cumulative GPA is below 2.0 but above the threshold for Academic Separation. Academic Separation The following policies and procedures apply to all students, both matriculated and special.

NOTIFICATION A student will be notified of his/her separa - tion before the beginning of the following semester. It is, however, the student's re - sponsibility to be aware of his or her aca - demic status at all times. APPEALS Actions taken under the regulations pertain - ing to Academic Separation may have an im - mediate impact on a student's eligibility for financial aid. Students may appeal actions taken pursuant to these regulations. Appeals must be submitted via online form one week after appeal notifications are sent. An ap - peal of separation from the University that is granted places the student in a conditional probationary status. The conditions of this status, including its maximum duration, will be specified in the Committee decision grant - ing the appeal. Students are able to appeal Academic Separation decision up to 2 times. Must wait a minimum of two semesters prior to resubmitting appeal. An appeal of separation from the University that is granted places the student in a condi - tional probationary status. The conditions of this status, including its maximum duration, will be specified in the Committee decision granting the appeal. CONDITIONAL PROBATION Conditional Probation: When a student's ap - peal is granted, he or she is placed on Condi - tional Probation status until their cumulative GPA reaches 2.0 or better, or until they are dismissed. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student will be academically dismissed if: They do not appeal their separation Their appeal is not grantedAcademic Regulations and Procedures35 They fail to achieve the requirement s for conditional probation They have committed a third academic dishonesty offense A student who has been separated from the University under the above provisions may apply for readmission to the University no sooner than two semesters after separation. READMISSION A student who has been separated from the University under the above provisions may apply for readmission to the University no sooner than two semesters after separation A readmission form is available from the Of - fice of the Registrar. No course work at the University of Bridgeport is permitted during the period of separation. Official transcripts of any colleges attended while the student has been away from Uni - versity of Bridgeport must be provided. The Office of Admissions, the Office of Student Academic Success, the Dean of Students Of - fice, and the Provost Office will determine the student's eligibility for readmission. A student who is granted readmission to the university may not be guaranteed readmis - sion to the major in which they were en - rolled at the time of academic withdrawal. All students who are readmitted after an aca - demic withdrawal must comply with degree program requirements in effect at the time of readmission. GRADUATE PROGRAM REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES *Refer to programmatic handbooks for the regulations and procedures pertaining to graduate professional programs in the health sciences, counseling and education. General Regulations 1. The mere completion of courses and requirements does not guarantee continuation in the graduate program or advancement to degree candidacy. 2. Every student must consult with his/her assigned advisor to ensure a carefully planned program of studies. 3. A graduate student is expected to complete his/her degree program within seven years of admission. A student may, for sound and valid reasons, request his/her Dean for an extension of this time limit. Such a request must have the approval of the student's advisor, and Department. 4. The amount of graduate work transferable to a graduate degree is limited to two graduate courses. Courses applied to one degree or diploma normally are not transferable to a second degree or diploma. Courses presented for transfer credit must be graduate level study completed with a grade of \"B\" or above at an accredited institution. The transferred courses should have been completed within the past seven years. The approval of additional transfer credit and waivers of the course time limit may be granted based on the approval of the Department Chair, School Director, and College Dean. 5. The requirements for a master's degree shall include at least one of the following: a comprehensive examination, a written thesis based on independent research, or completion of an appropriate special project. 6. Graduate programs require that all grades applied toward the degree be \"C\" or better. The grade of \"C- \"cannot be used to satisfy degree requirements. Probation and Separation Policy 1. The minimum cumulative grade point average necessary to continue graduate studies is 3.0 and the minimum semester grade point average to continue graduate studies is 2.0. 2. A student who does not meet either the semester or cumulative grade point average will automatically be placed on probation for the next semester of study. 3. A student placed on probation must meet the standard for continuation at the end of the probationary semester. Failure to meet the standard will result in automatic separation. 4. Separation from the Program of Study may be appealed to the Academic Appeals Committee of the Graduate Council. The appeal must be in writing and must be submitted within 15 days of notification of separation. 5. A student separated from a Program of Study may apply for re-admission to the Program after 1 semester from the date of separation from the Program. 6.

Failure to maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average or a semester grade point average of 2.0 a third time will result in automatic, non- appealable separation. Application for re-admission cannot be made sooner than 1 year after the date of separation. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES Consent To Plagiarism Screening Students are expected to be familiar with and to comply with the University's policies prohibiting plagiarism as set forth in the Key to UB-Student Handbook. Some courses utilize electronic screening to detect plagia - rism, e.g., Turnitin. These plagiarism screen - ing programs analyze the extent to which students' submitted assignments constitute original content and compare students' sub - missions to an extensive network of web pages, articles, and other student work in their databases. Using these resources, these programs produce originality reports which categorize submission content, determining what percentage of each assignment matches text found in their databases. By enrolling in course(s), students consent to the above-described plagiarism screening programs and may also be required to ap - prove specific terms and conditions of use when submitting an assignment. Students also consent to retention of their submission in Turnitin or other plagiarism screening platforms, but retain full copyright of their submission. Change of Status FROM FULL-TIME TO PART-TIME Students wishing to transfer from full-time to part-time status must secure the necessary forms from the Registrar's Office.Academic Regulations and Procedures36FROM PART-TIME TO FULL-TIME Students wishing to transfer from part-time to full-time status must secure the necessary forms from the Registrar's Office. Interruption Of Studies WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY Students who withdraw from all courses and thus from the University, must file an Appli - cation to Withdraw at the Office of the Reg - istrar. Students must meet with the Dean of Students prior to submitting the withdrawal form to the Registrar. If a student fails to register for a semester without being granted a leave of absence, or the leave of absence has expired, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the University. Several University of Bridgeport's Schools, Institutes and Programs have policies gov - erning leaves of absence from the particular school, institute or program, and students should refer to the relevant student hand - book for more information. REGULAR READMISSION A student who officially or unofficially with - draws from the University must apply for readmission. Readmission is necessary with any break in attendance for full-time stu - dents and after a break of more than one se - mester for part-time students. A student who withdraws officially, or unofficially, and sub - sequently applies for readmission is required to meet the degree requirements and condi - tions current at the time of readmission. Stu - dents who have attended another accredited institution in the interim must present com - plete official transcripts with their application for readmission. Applications for readmission are available from the Registrar's Office. READMISSION IN CASES OF DISCIPLINARY EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION Disciplinary expulsion and suspension may be incurred as a result of unacceptable con - duct. See the Key to UB for rules, regulations and procedures for readmission.LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who must discontinue enrollment for less than one academic year and who have a commitment to return to the Univer - sity must submit a written request for a Leave of Absence to the Office of the Registrar. A copy of this request must also be sent to the Dean or Director of the student's program. Students who are in good academic stand - ing and who have met all University require - ments may return to the University at the be - ginning of any semester within the one-year Leave of Absence period. A leave of absence may be extended for an additional year upon approval of the pro - gram Dean or Director. A written request is required for consideration of an extended leave of absence and the leave will be noted on the student's permanent record. Several University of Bridgeport's Schools, Institutes and Programs have policies gov - erning leaves of absence from the particular school, institute or program, and students should refer to the relevant student hand - book for more information. FIVE YEAR RULE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Students who interrupt their studies for a pe - riod exceeding five years must obtain written permission from the Dean of their College or Director of the School to apply previously earned credits toward their degree. CARNEGIE UNIT OF CREDIT Note: The application of the Carnegie unit of credit has implications for graduation requirements, transfer credit policy, faculty load and for measuring program hours/in - come. The Carnegie Unit of Credit provides a guideline on the amount of time that a student is expected to dedicate to a one se - mester hour course in order to receive one semester hour of academic credit. The Uni - versity of Bridgeport calibration of the Carn - egie Unit of Credit is as follows: Onsite Lecture Classes: To receive one semester hour of academic credit, the stu - dent is expected to attend a 50 minute lecture class per week and spend approxi - mately two hours on assignments and study outside of the classroom throughout a fifteen week semester.Online or Blended Learning Classes: Through Canvas or other online tools and blended learning, students would be ex - pected to complete 2.5 hours of activities per week over fifteen weeks to receive one se - mester hour of academic credit. This would include activities such as reading and re - sponding to posted course materials, discus - sion board postings, and Canvas discussions. Onsite Activity-based Classes: One hour and forty minutes of engagement in discipline-based activity and fifty minutes of study per week throughout fifteen weeks. Clinics, Studios and Laboratory-Based Class: 2.5 hours of laboratory, clinical or studio activity per week for 15 weeks. Independent Study: 2.5 Semester hours of Study per week over a 15 week Semester. Other Forms of Learning: Academic credit based on a demonstration of compe - tency in defined academic outcomes will be the exception and will be based on accept - ed instruments approved by the Deans and Program Chairs. These can include CLWEP, CLEP tests, or examination of a portfolio by trained academics in the discipline in which the student seeks credit. In all of these learning formats, contact hours and/or study/assignment hours would be in - creased each week in a summer or concen - trated session to assure compliance with unit of credit guidelines. Approved by University of Bridgeport Sen - ate, November 30, 2010. Off-Campus Study Matriculated students are expected to take the courses for their degrees at the Univer - sity of Bridgeport. Permission to take courses at other institutions for transfer credit will be given only for good and valid reasons and must be approved in advance and in writing by the student's advisor. Permission will not be granted for courses currently offered by the University or courses within the last thir - ty semester hours before graduation, or for courses previously failed at the University. Matriculated students may not take courses at junior or community colleges for transfer credit at the junior or senior level toward their degrees.Academic Regulations and Procedures37CREDIT FOR LIFE WORK EXPERIENCE (CLWEP) Some students acquire mastery over course subject matter through prior work or train - ing experience. Many departments have de - veloped examination and other assessment procedures to provide the possibility of credit for those experiences which correlate to specific course offerings in the University Catalog. CLWEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency re - quirement. CLWEP credit is included in the student's semester hours earned at the Uni - versity and also in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for gradu - ation honors. However, such credit is not computed in the student's quality point ratio at the University. Information on subject mat - ter and evaluation procedures is available in the office of the Provost. COLLEGE LEVEL EQUIVALENT PROFICIENCY EXAM (CLEP) The University of Bridgeport participates in the Educational Testing Service's College Level Equivalent Proficiency Exam program. The basic purpose of this program is to give the student and non-traditional learner a means for assessing their levels of achieve - ment and for requesting college credit for such achievement. Undergraduate students may earn up to 30 semester hours of credit (one year's studies) by demonstrating subject area competence through testing. CLEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency requirement. CLEP credit is not in - cluded in the student's credit hours earned at the University of Bridgeport and is not com - puted in the student's quality point ratio at the University. CLEP credit is not considered in the total number of UB hours used to de - termine eligibility for graduation honors. Information on subject matter and testing procedure is available in the office of the Provost. ADVANCED PLACEMENT A student may enter the University of Bridge - port as a freshman, but with advanced stand - ing toward a degree. Advanced standing may be achieved by taking the Advanced Place -ment examinations administered by the Col - lege Entrance Examination Board. A score of three or above allows the student to earn up to eight credits in one subject area. Well qualified students may also earn advanced placement by taking courses for college credit while in secondary school. Informa - tion regarding Advanced Placement is avail - able in the Office of Admissions. Academic Honors PRESIDENT'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semester, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Presi - dent's List at the end of that semester. A part- time student who is matriculated and who, during a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the President's List at the end of the academic year. DEAN'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semester, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that semester. A part-time student who is matriculated and who, dur - ing a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that academic year.

Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees The stipulations in the list immediately be - low are only those which are common to the awarding of the Bachelor's degree. Howev - er, requirements specific to each College or School and to individual curricula and disci - plines within each College or School also ex - ist. The student must be especially careful to note all of these, since fulfillment of gradua - tion requirements is the individual student's responsibility. No permission for deviation from published requirements is official un - less it is made in writing and signed by the senior administrator of the College or School from which the degree is sought. It is recog - nized that the requirements for graduation in individual Schools may change. A student must meet the requirements for graduation which are current at the time of graduation, and consistent to the greatest extent pos - sible with the degree requirements in exis - tence at the time of the student's entry into the major. However, whenever a program is altered it is the University's responsibility to translate the student's previously completed work into the new program requirements so that the continuously enrolled student is not penalized for the adaptation. The only ex - ception would be when the state or other li - censing agency imposes a new requirement. The common requirements for awarding the Bachelor's degree follow. A student must: 1. Have been admitted as, or have achieved the status of, a matriculated student in the College, and must have attained upperclass or major status. 2. Have completed the last thirty semester hours of work toward his or her degree under the direct auspices of the University. Under exceptional circumstances, the senior academic administrator may slightly modify this requirement. 3. The student must earn a grade of \"C-\" or better in every major course. However, the student's overall quality point ratio in major courses must be at least 2.0. In some cases, departmental requirements may exceed these minimums. If a student Academic Regulations and Procedures earns a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a course in the major field, he or she retake that 38course and earn a \"C-\" or better. The student must have earned the number of semester hours of credit required by the College or School and must not deviate from the curriculum as displayed in this catalog without the written approval of the appropriate senior academic administrator or his/her designate. UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATION HONORS Candidates for graduation who have com - pleted at least sixty semester hours of ac - ademic course work at the University of Bridgeport in their junior and senior years are eligible for honors upon recommenda - tion of the appropriate College faculty. The following standards are used: 1. The Bachelor's degree cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.40. 2. The Bachelor's degree magna cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.60. 3. The Bachelor's degree summa cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.80. The Associate's degree may be awarded cum laude to a candidate with a minimum quality point ratio of 3.2 and magna cum laude to those with 3.5. A minimum of 45 semester hours must have been earned at the University of Bridgeport. Commencement Participation Form for Graduation (both Undergraduate and Graduate) The University of Bridgeport holds one Commencement Ceremony in May. Stu - dents who have completed all degree re - quirements are eligible to participate in the May Commencement Ceremony. Students do not have to apply to graduate but must confirm their interest in participating in the ceremony after being pre-certified by facul - ty. Designated faculty within each academic program will pre-certify a student's eligibil - ity to graduate prior to the mid-point of the semester from which a student is graduating. A graduation fee of $150 per degree is as - sessed upon per-certification, whether or not a student participates in the ceremony. Diplomas are mailed to the confirmed ad - dress by the student within 30 days after the certification of degree has been com - pleted at the end of the term for which a student is graduating. Release of diplomas is dependent on all graduation requirements and financial obligations to the University of Bridgeport (including Perkins Loans) being satisfied. If you have a change of address during the course of the graduation process, please completed the Change of Address webform via the student UB portal, so that your records can be updated. However, an email will be sent out to your UB email ad - dress asking the confirmation of the mailing address on file before the diploma and com - plimentary transcript are mailed.

Order updates will be emailed to you. You can also track your order online.Academic Regulations and Procedures39The University holds that professional and applied studies, and later success in careers, require a sophisticated and learned grasp of the artistic, communicative, cultural, social, historical and scientific achievements of the world; and that all learners and professionals should be able to interpret these domains and to communicate about them clearly and persuasively. All colleges and universities in the State of Connecticut are required by the Office of Higher Education to mandate that General Education courses compose \"33 percent of the minimum requirements for the baccalaureate degree.\" The University of Bridgeport fully supports the educational philosophy behind this mandate. The University of Bridgeport also believes that General Education should reflect the University's educational mission. The Gener - al Education's Core Curriculum draws upon the best traditions of American education and seeks to stimulate creativity, intellec - tual growth, and development of analytical thinking; but it also advances UB's distinc - tive educational outlook, which is interna - tional in character and commitment. Thus the University requires that a large majority of the forty required credit hours of Gen - eral Education be distributed within its Core Curriculum and allows the remaining to be taken as Liberal Arts electives. \"Liberal Arts\" encompass any course that is not de - signed primarily for skill or knowledge ac - quisition in a specific profession or field of work and generally includes the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and math - ematics. The total number of General Education credit hours on a student's record must be forty or higher and must satisfy the Core requirements. The required distribution of Core courses through a range of disciplines reflects the mission of the University of Bridgeport. In particular, courses from disciplines are cho - sen because they encourage reflection upon the interdependent nature of the world, con - tribute to global awareness, and encourage interdisciplinary modes of integrative learn - ing. All classes in this curriculum contrib - ute to academic development and lay the groundwork for success in graduate schools or students' chosen professions. The Core Curriculum represents what is best and dis - tinctive about the University of Bridgeport.The Core Curriculum THE UNIVERSITY'S CORE CURRICULUM HAS THREE DIMENSIONS: 1. Skills 2. Heritage 3. Seminars I. THE SKILLS SECTION Skills classes help students learn how to think clearly, write effectively, and communicate accurately and persuasively. These courses, normally taken in the first semester, lay the foundation for all further study. The Univer - sity of Bridgeport requires competency for such skills through successful completion or placement out of two such courses: one in composition, the other in mathematics. (Note: Placement out of any course requires an equal number of credits to be completed in other approved liberal arts coursework toward the minimum forty required credit hours of General Education.) English: English 101 Math: Math 102, 103, 106, or 109 II. THE HERITAGE SECTION Heritage classes introduce students to the ar - tistic, communicative, cultural, social, histori - cal and scientific achievements of the world. The courses below have been selected for inclusion in the Core Curriculum because they contribute to forming an interdisciplin - ary perspective about these achievements. These courses aim to help students see the world in a distinctive way: as a plural but increasingly interdependent reality. Upper- level courses are suggested to students who are completing Core General Education re - quirements as juniors or seniors, or who have focused academic interests in a particu - lar area of enquiry. Enrolling in these upper- level courses requires the instructor's permis - sion. Full course descriptions and any course prerequisites can be found in Undergraduate Courses of Instruction section of the Catalog. Three Hours of Fine Arts: one of the follow - ing approved courses.

See Registrar or Honors Program Director for details III. SEMINARS: FIRST YEAR SEMINAR AND CAPSTONE 390 The thematically focused First Year Semi - nar (FYS 101), taught with common student learning outcomes to all freshmen, is taken during the first semester of study. This semi - nar introduces students to the academic val - ues of a university education while inculcat - ing habits of learning that will serve them throughout their undergraduate education and beyond. Through this seminar experi - ence, students establish a foundation upon which the rest of their university education stands. The Capstone Seminars, CAPS 390, provide an academic context in which the skills and content of the other courses in the General Education Curriculum can be synthesized and integrated. The Capstone is the \"crown - ing achievement\" of the General Education Curriculum. As such, the seminars are lim - ited to juniors and seniors who have com - pleted at least 75 semester credit hours and all required hours within in the Skills and Heritage sections of the Core Curriculum. No exceptions will be granted to this policy.

Internships and other experiential learning experiences provide a practical ap - plication of academic studies in combination with opportunities to learn material that go beyond the classroom. Performing intern - ships, performing a job shadow or partici - pating in a mentorship opportunity offer the additional experience and development of skills, which aid in the overall career readi - ness of the student. TYPES OF EXPERIENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES Paid, Unpaid, Volunteer Internship Credit Based Internship (usually 1-3 credits) Cooperative Education Experience Volunteer/Community Service Special Programs (Job Shadow, Mentorship, Student Leadership Institute) Student Employment/Graduate Assistant - ships/PHD Awards QUALIFYING FOR AN INTERNSHIP Students are able to perform internships throughout their academic career. Most posted opportunities will provide a list of qualifications which should be reviewed for specific GPA, major and class level require - ments. Students are encouraged to partici - pate in more than one opportunity to gain a variety of diverse professional experience. For credit-based roles - a student should con - sult with their assigned academic advisor, to learn specific departmental criteria for per - forming an internship. In most majors, a student must be a Junior or Senior Standing with a 2.5 GPA (undergraduate) and hold a 3.0 GPA for graduate studies. CAMPUS RESOURCES Center for Career Development (https:// www.bridgeport.edu/student-life/career- development) Academic Departments (https://www. bridgeport.edu/academics/programs) Office of Campus Activities and Civic En - gagement (https://www.bridgeport.edu/student-life/campus-activities) Office of Student Employment (https://www. bridgeport.edu/life/student-employment) INTERNSHIP QUALIFYING CRITERIA In order for an internship to be approved by the University, the following criteria must be met. This criteria is set to protect University of Bridgeport students, and ensure valuable and educational experiences through intern - ships and experiential opportunities. A designated supervisor is identified to provide the intern with guidance. Projects and tasks have been developed to give the intern legitimate work which will allow them to gain professional experience applicable to the industry. Intern responsibilities relate to their particular course of study or desired interest area. The intern does not displace regular employees, and works in close proximity to a full-time employee. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern and does not solely advance business operations. Feedback is provided by the intern supervisor throughout the internship term, including completion of an Internship Evaluation provided by the University of Bridgeport. Clearly defined goals and learning objectives are identified which closely align with the intern's course of study or desired interest area are developed. UNPAID INTERNSHIP, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL) GUIDELINES In 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL) released new guidelines for determining whether an individual or opportunity classi - fies as an unpaid intern. The new model is called the \"primary beneficiary test,\" which takes a more straightforward approach by asking, \"who benefits from the relationship most, the employer or the intern?\" The test is based on seven criteria: Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests the intern is an employee\u2014and vice versa. The internship provides training similar to what would be given in an educational environment. The extent the internship is tied to coursework or academic credit. The extent the internship accommodates academic commitments according to the academic calendar. The internship's length provides the intern with beneficial learning. The intern's work complements, not displaces, the work of paid employees while still educating the intern. The intern and employer understand the intern is not entitled to an offer for a paid job at the end of the internship. The DOL states these factors are flexible, so the final decision on whether the intern is an employee depends on the specific case. If the intern is deemed an employee, he/she is eligible for minimum wage and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT): INTERNSHIPS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Any international student, who performs work OFF CAMPUS, must complete Curricu - lar Practical Training documentation PRIOR to beginning work.

English Language Institute Carlson Hall 303 University Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4860 Website: http://www.bridgeport.edu/eli GENERAL INFORMATION The English Language Institute of the Uni - versity of Bridgeport offers an intensive program of English as a Second Language. ELI also organizes off-campus trips and on- campus activities designed to introduce in - ternational students to the United States, its language and its people. ELI classes are offered year round, Monday through Thursday. Full-time students attend class in the mornings and afternoons. Part- time students can choose to attend mornings or afternoons. For full-time students, a typical day consists of 5 hours of instruction, includ - ing classroom instruction in grammar, com - position, reading, listening, and speaking, and assigned work in the university's state- of-the-art language laboratory. ELI provides highly individualized instruction. Classes are limited to 15 students per teacher. ELI students receive a University of Bridge - port student I.D. card and are entitled to use facilities on the campus of the University of Bridgeport, such as the Wahlstrom Library and the Wheeler Recreation Center, to name a few. ADMISSION ELI students must have a strong personal commitment to learning the English lan - guage. Courses in English as a Second Lan - guage are offered year-round at all levels from beginner through advanced. ELI appli - cation forms and additional program infor - mation may be obtained at the above address or printed out directly from the ELI Internet address shown above. Applicants must be at least 17 years old. Applications are accepted at any time of the year and new students may begin class throughout the year. International Admis - sions issues an official letter of admission to the program and an I-20 form promptly upon receiving a completed ELI application. After receiving the I-20 issued by ELI, the prospec - tive student may apply for an F-1 student visa at an American embassy or consulate prior to coming to the United States. WHY STUDENTS ENROLL AT ELI Many students wish to enrich their knowl - edge of the English language while on leave from a school or a job in their home country. Most of these students return to their home country after a stay at ELI of from 14 weeks to a full year or more. Many ELI students plan to apply for admis - sion to a degree program at the University of Bridgeport. They improve their knowledge of English to meet the English language re - quirement for university admission. These students usually obtain \"conditional accep - tance\" to a degree program and will receive full acceptance when they satisfy the Univer - sity's English language requirement for ad - mission. It should be noted that successful completion of ELI's advanced level satisfies the English language requirement for ad - mission to the University of Bridgeport. ELI graduates are not required to take the TOEFL or IELTS. THE CURRICULUM The ELI curriculum focuses on improving skills in speaking, listening comprehension, writing, and reading. At all levels of the cur - riculum, ELI instructors seek to help students improve their language skills through active use of the language both in and out of the classroom. New students complete a placement test upon arrival and are placed in an appropri - ate level of English. Successful completion of the session allows the student to move up to the next level. Students who are placed in the lower levels concentrate on basic grammar, speaking, lis - tening, and reading skills, and practice para - graph writing. As students progress through the levels, they continue to improve their speaking and listening skills while taking on more challenging tasks in reading and writ - ing. In the advanced levels, students strive to achieve competence in language-dependent tasks similar to those that are required of na - tive speakers of English in both academic and career-related activities. These include reading for content; note-taking from spoken and written materials; speaking skills needed to relate information, to persuade, to negoti - ate, and to inquire; and skills needed in es - say and report writing, as well as in effective correspondence. Graduates of ELI receive a \"Certificate of Completion\" which certifies that they have met the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridgeport. Grades reports are issued upon request. SCHEDULE OF CHARGES Please see insert for current academic year for tuition, fees, and other expenses. ELI students should plan on spending about $300-$400 per 14-week session to cover mis - cellaneous personal expenses such as rec - reational travel, local transportation, books, laundry, clothing, etc. APPLICATION FORMS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Prospective students may obtain application forms, student housing applications, credit card charge forms, insurance information, etc. at ELI's Internet site, by email, or by call - ing or faxing ELI.College of Science and Society49Biology Bachelor of Arts / Bachelor of Science Degree Dana Hall, Room 213 Telephone: (203) 576-4253 Program Description The Biology Department offers a 120-credit Bachelor of Arts and a 120-credit Bachelor of Science degree in Biology.

The Professional Interior Designer is quali - fied to identify, research and solve problems pertaining to the function and aesthetic qual - ity of the interior environment. The designer must have knowledge of construction mate - rials, their applications and methods of in - stallation. Interior designers must design the space in accordance with federal, state and local building codes to meet safety, health, and accessibility requirements. Interior de - signers both plan the space and furnish the interiors of private homes, public buildings and commercial establishments such as of - fices, retail, restaurants, hospitals, hotels and theaters. They may plan additions, renova - tions and be involved in historic preserva - tions. With a client's needs and budget in mind, they develop space-planning solu - tions; prepare working drawings, millwork, architectural details and specifications for in - terior construction, furnishing and finishes. Designers use computers to generate plans and construction documents, in addition to 3D modeling views. At UB several interior projects assignments are done in collaboration with noted interior/ architectural firms, to give students a grasp of real projects and receive additional inputs from professionals in the field. In addition, this relationship helps establish connections for internships. *ITDSN 398 (Internship) can be taken as an elective in addition to the required course - work. As an Interior Design major, you can special - ize in several areas: Residential Design (new and existing) Contract Design such as: Retail, Hospital - ity, Corporate Offices, Health care, Institu - tional Historic Preservation Interior Design Bachelor of Science Degree Furniture and Furnishings Design Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate ability to identify, analyze, and solve design problems. Assessment: Portfolio projects and project research. 2. Demonstrate mastery of design tools, techniques, and concepts in design. As - sessment: Projects and portfolios that evidence craftsmanship and adherence to project parameters. 3. Demonstrate an understanding of the aesthetics of form development, and of the history and current state of de - sign. Assessment: Projects, papers, and presentations for art and design history courses; in studio courses, projects that appropriately reference historical prec - edents. 4. Demonstrate proficiency in selection and use of relevant technologies in design. Abilities to use available technical and industrial processes to produce a design product, and to design and implement such a process. Assessment: Project and portfolio materials planned to be feasi - bly reproducible by industrial means rather than by one-off or by hand. 5.

Po - litical economy describes the nexus between politics and economics, and international po - litical economy studies the arena where inter - national politics and international economics meet. The subject matter of International Po - litical Economy is the study of the interna - tional economic system and how it produces, distributes, and uses wealth. The study of the international political system focuses a set of institutions and rules by which social and economic interactions are governed. It rep - resents an investigation of the political basis of economic action and the economic basis of political action. An important additional consideration is the role of international law in developing universal principles and norms in the conduct of international relations, and governing of relations between states and their citizens. Because diplomatic negotia - tions form the basis of new international law, and because diplomacy operates within the framework of extant international law, the study of diplomacy is an important compo - nent in the study of international political economy. Learning Outcomes The B.A. in International Political Econo - my & Diplomacy has the following learn - ing outcomes: 1) students will demonstrate an ability to explain and compare different political and economic systems; 2) students will be able to reflect on the role of culture, history and religion in international political economy; 3) students will be able to explain the role of diplomacy and conflict resolution in international relations; 4) Students will demonstrate a basic working knowledge of a world language other than one's mother tongue; 5) students will demonstrate the ability to use critical thinking in their evalu - ation of issues and problems in international political economy; and 6) students will dem - onstrate practical skills in helping resolve global disputes through diplomacy and con - flict resolution. * Note that for all College of Public and In - ternational Affairs majors, a portfolio is col - lected to track progress in programmatic out - comes.

The program offers a variety of customized options so students may select an academic plan that best suits their goals. We offer de - gree course paths in Molecular Biology, Bio - medical Science, or Ecology and Evolution. We also offer two degree options, the Master of Science (MS) or Master of Arts (MA) in Biology. Degree Options MASTER OF SCIENCE (M.S.) IN BIOLOGY This option emphasizes design and execu - tion of experimental work. In this program, the student will be required to complete a thesis featuring an original research. Students in this program will most likely be pursuing terminal degrees following the completion of their degree. MASTER OF ARTS (M.A.) IN BIOLOGY This option emphasizes career building. As a student in the M.A. degree program, students will have the option of pursuing an internship or completing their degree with coursework only. Students in the M.A. degree program will most likely be working professionals in - terested in advancing their careers by gaining expertise in the field of biology. CAREERS AND PROFESSIONS AVAILABLE TO GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM. The program advances the skills and training of students with degrees in Biology or related fields, making them competitive for jobs in private, academic, and government research institutions, clinical laboratories, government agencies, teaching opportunities and those seeking to strengthen their applications to doctoral programs and other professional programs. Graduates with master's degrees in biology are expected to have additional opportunities in nonscientist positions re - lated to biology, in fields like sales, market - ing, publishing, and research management. Some examples of nonscientist job titles that require or prefer a Master's degree include Proposal Development Specialist, Global Product Manager, Technical Sales Represen - tative, and Land Management Specialist. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM The M.S. program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours of coursework designed to meet stated objectives of student learning for the program. All credit hours must therefore be graduate level (400-level or higher) courses in Biology, or cognate courses tailored to individual student interests, in Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineer - ing, Health Science, or Medical Technology. All cognate courses are subject to depart - mental approval of their contributions to ei - ther the research or career skill acquisitions listed in the programs objectives (see item III.1 below).

In addition to the general admissions re - quirements listed above, candidates in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Concen - tration must demonstrate sustained experi - ence in the field of Counseling. A personal interview is also required. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university but do not meet one or more of the above cri - teria may be admitted provisionally. Those without the recommended background in Psychology may be required to take addi - tional psychology-related coursework as part of their degree program. Programs The Counseling Program offers a Master of Science degree in Counseling with a concen - tration in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. In addition to the master's degree, a Certifi - cate of Advanced Study (CAS) is offered for those who wish to take specialized courses beyond the masters and/or complete licen - sure requirements. Students who apply to one program and wish to transfer to another must apply to change programs. Upon entry into a program, students plan an individualized plan of studies with their advisor in which graduate transfer credit of no more than six credits may be included. While students can take courses at their own pace, all of the counseling degree programs require a minimum of two years to complete. There is a set sequence of courses for each concentration and some courses have pre - requisites. Courses are offered once a year, typically in the evening or on weekends. In addition, there is a seven year time limit for completion of all degree requirements. Typically students take two-four courses each term. Many students have full or part- time employment. Although it is possible to take all course work in the late afternoon, evening, or on weekends, some additional time during the day may be required to meet course expectations. This is especially true for internship placement. Professional Licensure Students interested in licensure should con - sult the state in which they wish to practice for specific requirements. The State of Con - necticut requires a 60 credit master's degree. Specific areas of coursework are also re - quired. In addition, candidates for licensure must complete supervised clinical experienc - es and obtain a qualifying score on a stan - dardized examination. Students who wish to pursue licensure should select the Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration. Certificate of Advanced Study For individuals who hold a master's degree in Counseling or a closely related field but lack one or more of the requirements for licen - sure as a professional counselor, the Coun - seling Program offers a specialized program of study leading to a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) in Clinical Mental Health Coun - seling. The requirements of this program are individualized to the needs and goals of each student and consist of 30 credits. Practicum The practicum is designed to allow students to develop their counseling skills in a closely supervised setting. The course instructor, Counseling Master of Science Degree88student's advisor, and site supervisor deter - mine appropriate practicum activities. Ac - tivities could include observing/shadowing, attending staff meetings, tutoring, advising, interviewing professional staff members, studying materials and procedure manuals, and other support functions. Internship Following the practicum and pre-requisite courses, students will pursue an internship. The goal of the internship is to further de - velop and refine the skills established during practicum. You are eligible for the internship component of your program after completing the required coursework and approval from faculty. The internship is the heart of the master's degree training program in Coun - seling at the University of Bridgeport (UB). It provides a venue within which students receive the guidance necessary for develop - ment as an entry-level counselor. Program faculties provide didactic and experiential training, which serves as the foundation for the development of skills necessary for inde - pendent work in clinical settings. The intern - ship operationalizes this training and, in the person of the clinical supervisor, personifies the profession with which the intern ideally identifies. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the type of internship site that you choose and you should discuss this closely with your advisor. Successful intern - ship training can only occur when program faculty and site supervisors form a close col - laborative relationship with the mission of providing quality training and the develop - ment of the intern as a whole person. In - ternships are not guaranteed and approval to attend internship is dependent upon stu - dents' performance both interpersonally and academically. Internships must be completed over two semesters, typically over the course of a full academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring.

A minimum of 51 credit hours must be completed to satisfy the requirements of this dual-degree program. Multiple MBA Concentrations Students may gain additional concentrations by successfully completing three courses in any of the eight concentrations (courses may not be counted twice toward concentra - tions). Students may receive a double con -centration in their original concentration by taking three additional advanced courses in the discipline. MBA/Engineering Partnership In an arrangement, with the School of En - gineering, approved Engineering courses of - fered by the College of Engineering are avail - able for students in the MBA degree. Specific courses for this study are selected with - and approved by - the student's advisor. Progression/Sequence of Coursework Preparatory coursework is the first step: Stu - dents start their studies by completing all necessary Preparatory courses. Once all the Preparatory courses have been completed, students may enter the formal MBA program. In some cases, students may take a combina - tion of Preparatory and Core courses during their transition into the Program, but students should not take a Preparatory and advanced class in the same discipline at the same time (e.g. ITKM500 and ITKM505). Students begin the formal MBA program by completing the six Core courses (in any order). The three Capstone courses should be taken in the final semester, or final two semesters, and must only be taken once all Core courses have been successfully com - pleted (not concurrently). Fulltime Status Fulltime status requires at least three classes per semester (spring and fall) for interna - tional students and at least two classes per semester for domestic students. International students on an F1 or J1 visa may take fewer than 9 credits only once during their gradu - ate tenure (spring and fall semesters), which is only permitted in their final semester. Grading Policy A grade of C or better is required for credit toward graduation in all preparatory and program coursework. Students are expected to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or bet - ter throughout their studies. Those students who earn a semester GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation and must comply with the associated formal process to successfully maintain proper status. Requirements for Graduation To qualify for the award of the degree of Master of Business Administration, a student must fulfill the following minimum require - ments: 1. Admitted to candidacy for the degree in the School of Business. 2. Satisfactorily complete all academic re - quirements with a cumulative grade point average grade of \"B\" (CGPA = 3.0) or bet - ter. 3. File an application for the award of the degree at the Registrar's Office on or be - fore the date published in the University Calendar. 4. Complete all academic requirements within five (5) years from the date of first registration, unless a petition for exten - sion is granted.

The MSF develops the ability of students whose career goals include specialist, technical, and management roles in financial enterprises. The program ac - complishes its mission by developing student expertise in financial instruments, financial technology, financial analysis and financial management. Positive program outcomes will be achieved through the knowledge and skills the students will acquire from a com - prehensive curriculum design, instruction in an effective learning environment, opportu - nities for inquiry, and professional develop - ment. This program largely leverages our ex - isting offerings. Students learn concepts in risk, finance, in - vestments, and analytics that provide the basis for careers in finance. Students also develop the technical and quantitative skills needed to pursue a variety of careers in the finance industry. While more specific and analytical in nature, these learning outcomes are in line with our institutional mission, and our MBA program. Students will learn how to evaluate and price a financial opportunity. They will learn how to gauge the appropriate level of risk to dis - count future projections. They will learn how to compare across investment opportunities at a given time and how to allocate among them in an optimal way. They will learn how to create useful tools for answering financial questions so that reports could be generated automatically and progress can be tracked. They will learn how to both assess and man - age risk. Most importantly and most gener - ally, they will learn how to solve financial problems with finely honed problem-solving skills via analytical capabilities and data-driv - en decision-making.Program Characteristics Although students with work experience will find maximum benefit from the MSF, no pre - vious work experience is required. The cur - riculum is designed to recognize and accom - modate substantial diversity in preparation and experience as well as the different goals and career expectations of students. For this reason, some students may be required to complete preparatory coursework to success - fully graduate from the 30-credit MSF pro - gram. Flexible course delivery enables stu - dents to proceed at their desired pace. Most students complete the MSF program in 18 to 24 months. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate 1. knowledge in - evaluating and pricing financial opportunities, gauging the ap - propriate level of risk to discount future projections, comparing investment op - portunities and allocating among them in an optimal way, creating useful tools for answering financial questions so that reports are generated automatically and progress is tracked, assessing and man - aging risk, analyzing and solving finan - cial problems with finely honed decision making and problem solving skills. 2. the ability to communicate ideas clearly and persuasively in oral and written struc - tures in both formal and informal settings. 3. interpersonal and professional skills that enable them to contribute within diverse sets of teams and build internal and exter - nal relationships that facilitate success in contemporary organizations. 4. information literacy, proficiency with tech - nology, and analytical techniques for de - cision-making. 5. creativity and innovation when addressing current issues and case studies. 6. integrity in their actions, as well as an un - derstanding of ethical theories, such as triple bottom line and corporate social responsibility. 7. critical and logical thinking that integrates concepts across disciplines enabling them to successfully lead in a dynamic global environment.LEARNING OUTCOMES WILL BE ASSESSED USING THE FOLLOWING MEASURES: participation in classroom activities ad - dressing current financial events, preparing case studies, creating one-off back tests of financial hy - potheses, performing simulations, developing reusable financial and risk management tools, performing due diligence research proj - ects, writing 5-to-10-page papers on critical fi - nancial topics, presenting findings in a five-minute pro - fessional presentation, and one capstone exercise reflecting their accumulated knowledge and skills. Language Requirement Conditionally accepted international stu - dents with an undergraduate degree that was taught in a language other than English are required to successfully complete additional language-related coursework and third-party assessment testing before joining the pro - gram. Academic Preparation Students with undergraduate preparation in a non-business field may be required to complete up to 6 credits of preparatory course- work. Students with a strong aca - demic record (B or better in each case) from an accredited university, or significant rele - vant work experience, may be able to waive preparatory foundation courses.

The program was de - signed to enhance and improve the effective - ness of public and private organization lead - ers, school administrators, and researchers. Graduates and current students have held and hold significant positions in state-wide school systems, for-profit, non-profit insti - tutions, colleges, and universities. The ad - vanced graduate curriculum integrates the sound principles of administration, manage - ment, organizational psychology, informa - tion technology, program evaluation, grant writing, quantitative, and qualitative research methodologies. The Hybrid (predominately online) Educa - tional Leadership Doctoral Program was in - stituted in the Fall of 2015. It is closely aligned to the on-campus program, but requites four International Education courses. These four courses, described later in this handbook, re - place four courses that are a component of the traditional \"on the ground\" Educational Leadership Doctoral Program. The program is specifically tailored for work - ing professionals anywhere in the world, as all classes (except for two one-week summer doctoral residencies) are offered online. The successful completion of the program leads to the Doctor of Education degree (Ed.D.). The 62-credit program takes approximately three years for completion including two years (six semesters) of formal study, and one year to complete the dissertation. Dur - ing the first two years, students typically take nine credits pf doctoral seminars per semes - ter (Fall, Spring, and Summer). For students to be considered full time, they must take a minimum of 6 credits Fall and Spring semes - ter until they have completed all courses with the exception of EDLD 845-DL (Comprehen - sive Examination) and EDLD 846-DLcDisser - tatin Proposal Defense). These two courses ae repeatable as necessary. Once EDLD 845 and EDLD 846-DL are successfully passed students take EDLD 850-DL (zero credit=full time) continuously Fall and Spring semes - ters and under advisement of the Director or Chair for the summer term until they have graduated. Students must take a one-week Doctoral Residency (EDLD 825-DL) during the first two summers as part of the require - ment of the program. Note: On-campus courses (without the -DL designation) may be substituted for the (Dis - tance Learning) courses with the approval of both Program Directors. Learning Outcomes The candidates will be able to: 1. Integrate principles of administration, management, organization and program evaluation n a research agenda; 2. Produce a dissertation proposal that re - flects a student's research interests; 3. Exhibit the mastery of principles of lead - ership and be able to pass the compre - hensive examination questions; 4. Research, write, and defend a Doctoral dissertation. 1.

Residency A period of residence must be included in a doctoral program to provide significant faculty-student interaction, opportunities for exposure to and engagement with cognate disciplines and research scholars working in those disciplines, and significant face-to-face peer interaction among graduate students. Residency is established through continuous enrollment, fall, spring, and summer (which is highly recommended) with a minimum of 3 credits per semester in the first two years. It is established through two on-campus sum - mer Doctoral Residency week (EDLD 825). Residency provides the opportunity for a mentor-apprentice relationship between fac - ulty and students and time for in-depth and direct faculty support of students. Thus, the intent of the residency requirement is to en - sure that doctoral students contribute to, and benefit from, the complete spectrum of edu - cational, professional, and enrichment oppor - tunities provided on and off the University of Bridgeport campus. ELD 845 Comprehensive Examination and EDLD 846 Dissertation Pro - posal Defense should be taken in sequence and are considered making adequate prog - ress in the program. Students enrolled in EDLD 850 Continuous Dissertation, which is a 0-credit course, are considered full time. 3. Dissertation Preparation The dissertation proposal draft is a 30-50 page overview od he student's ideas or his/ her dissertation and a well-developed draft of her/his literature review. The draft is cre - ated in the first year of the program as part of EDLD 811 Introduction to Research, EDLD 812 Quantitative Research and EDLD 813 Lit - erature Review. The proposal provides op - portunities for guidance from dissertation committee members and is a basis for further 161expansion of methodology in EDLD 813A Lit - erature Review and EDLD 814 Qualitative Re - search taken in the second year. The purpose for the dissertation proposal draft is to state the problem, purpose, research questions, methodology and procedures to conduct the research project. The proposal draft will in - clude a graphic depiction of the methodology and methods and a time line for completion of the dissertation including literature review and Human Subject approval. Discussing the research proposal in draft format with a po - tential committee chair, other potential com - mittee members, and peers enable the stu - dent to obtain advice early in the dissertation process as to the suitability of the topic and as to whether or not the research questions, methodologies, and procedures are logical, appropriate and sound. 4. Comprehensive Examination and Dissertation Proposal All matriculated doctoral students wishing to become doctoral candidates must pass the EDLD 845 course inclusive of the writ - ten comprehensive examination. The com - prehensive exam consists of (a) one research methodology question; (b) one program fo - cus question and (c) one area of specializa - tion question related to the students' disserta - tion topic. Questions for the comprehensive examination are created by doctoral faculty with input from the student to rigorously as - sess mastery and knowledge garnered dur - ing coursework. The comprehensive exami - nation also gauges the student's potential for independent dissertation research. Students should take the exam after all coursework has been completed. Doctoral students who passed their compre - hensive examination can consequently enroll in the EDLD 846 course inclusive of the de - fense of the dissertation proposal. The UB Doctoral Guidelines are derived from standard practices among universities, libraries, and publishers. The student, their committee, and the School of education ex - pects careful attention to APA 6th style and format in the proposal document. The pro - posal includes the student's statement of a research problem and the chosen method of investigating it. The proposal is the first step toward completion of the dissertation, which is an original contribution to one's field of study. The study may be applied research; it may be experimental quasi-experimental, or non-experimental in its design; it may in - clude quantitative, qualitative, action, mixed or critical methodology. The dissertation proposal is an overview of the student's ideas for their dissertation. The purpose for the dissertation proposal is to state the problem, purpose, research ques - tions, outline the method and procedures to conduct the research project. The proposal draft will include a graphic depiction of the methods proposed and a time line for com - pletion of the dissertation proposal includ - ing literature review and Institutional Review Board approval. Discussing the research in draft format with a potential with a potential committee chair, other potential committee members, and peers will enable the student to obtain advice early in the dissertation pro - cess as to the suitability of the topic and as to whether or not the research questions, meth - od, and procedures are logical, appropriate, and sound. 5. Dissertation-Doctoral Candidacy Once the student has successfully passed the Comprehensive Examination and completed the Dissertation Proposal, he or she is eligi - ble to apply to be a Doctoral Candidate. The student should submit the form \"Admission to Doctoral Candidacy\" to the Director. This designation will be conveyed to the student by an official letter from the School of Educa - tion and/or the Department of Educational Leadership. Doctoral Candidacy allows the student to register for dissertation advising EDLD 850 which is a 0 credit course but is deemed to be full time. A student must be a candidate for at least two semesters prior to the granting of the degree. Student may not, unless granted a waiver, defend the dis - sertation during the semester immediately following the semester during which he or she completed the proposal. The purpose of this requirement is to assure a minimal lapse of time for effective work on the dissertation after acquisition of the basic competence and after delineation and approval of the research problem and methodology.

The Chinese herbology (ACH) cours - es will be offered in a blended format with 50% of the didactic program offered online and 50% in person each semester, and addi - tional weekends each summer for advanced study. Students will participate in an online environment to complete their herbal stud - ies. M.S.CH. The MS-CH program is a stand-alone pro - gram that will allow licensed health care professionals to better understand Chinese Herbology and be able to safely utilize these herbal products. Currently, many healthcare professionals are able to prescribe herbal therapies (MDs, DOs, NDs, DCs, L.Acs) or work with herbal therapies (PharmDs). The UB MS-CH pro -gram is the only clinically-oriented system - atic masters-level program for health pro - fessionals in these therapies. The focus of this program is on not only clinical usage of Chinese herbal therapies but also on safety in the clinical setting while framing the clini - cal use of these herbs in the TCM tradition. The potential for issues associated with inte - grated care and drug-herb and nutrient-herb interactions are covered in detail within the MS-CH courses.

The School of Chiropractic prepares students to be primary portal of entry health care providers. Each student is educated to arrive at a diagnosis, care for the human body, understand and relate fundamental scientific information, and to consult with, or refer to other health care providers. The University of Bridgeport School of Chiropractic (UBSC) is a non-profit, coeducational professional institution which grants the Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree to graduates who successfully complete four academic years of study including a clinical clerkship. The program is offered on a full-time basis. All requirements for the D.C. degree must be completed within seven years from the date of matriculation. Degree Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) Accreditation & Membership The doctor of chiropractic degree program of the University of Bridgeport School of Chiropractic is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE), 8049 N. 85th Way, Scottsdale, AZ 85258, 480-443-8877. The School of Chiropractic is also a member of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC). Mission Statement To educate chiropractic students to be successful providers of highly-competent, patient-centered care by utilizing best practice educational methodologies, engaging in relevant scholarly activities, and providing effective service to our University, College, and local communities.Curriculum A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purpose is to meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives particular attention to the relationship of structural and neurological aspects of the body and is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as related health subjects. Chiropractic science concerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous system) of the human body and how that relationship affects the restoration and preservation of health. \"The DCP of the University of Bridgeport incorporates the understanding of chiropractic as a profession, practicing primary health care, providing curricular and clinical evidence of that through outcome measures, and consists of education and training to prepare graduates to: A. Practice direct contact health care as a primary portal-of-entry provider for pa - tients of all ages and genders; B. Assess the patient's general health status, complaints and problems leading to a di - agnosis. Specific elements of patient as - sessment minimally include a complete health history; review of systems; physi - cal exam, biomechanical and neurologi - cal examination; analysis of vertebral and extra-vertebral joint function; and, when clinically indicated, diagnostic im - aging, clinical laboratory, and/or special - ized diagnostic procedures; C. Develop a goal-oriented case man - agement plan that addresses any joint misalignment/function or other neuro- biomechanical problems which may in - clude rehabilitation and/or other thera - peutic modalities; D. Develop appropriate doctor/patient re - lationships with continuity in the chiro - practic management of health problems, and coordination of care with other health-care providers; and E. Promote wellness by assessing health risks and providing problem-related, general and public health information, and lifestyle counseling. The purpose of chiropractic professional education is to provide the student with a core of knowledge in the basic and clinical sciences and related health subjects sufficient to perform the professional obligations of a doctor of chiropractic. A doctor of chiropractic is a primary portal- of-entry physician and practitioner of the healing arts, to help meet the health needs of individual patients and of the public, giving particular attention to the structural and neurological aspects of the body. The application of science in chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between structure, primarily the spine, and function, primarily coordinated by the nervous system of the human body, and how that relationship affects the restoration and preservation of health. Further, this application of science focuses on the inherent ability of the body to heal without the use of drugs or surgery. As a gatekeeper for direct access to the health care delivery system, the doctor of chiropractic's responsibilities as a primary care physician include wellness promotion, health promotion, health assessment, diagnosis and the chiropractic management of the patient's health care needs. When indicated, the doctor of chiropractic consults with, co-manages, or refers to other health care providers. \"An accredited Doctor of Chiropractic Program (DCP) prepares its graduates to practice as primary portal-of- entry chiropractic physicians, and provides curricular and clinical evidence of such through outcome measures.\" (From the Council on Chiropractic Education Standards for DCPs, July 2013). It is the purpose of the University of Bridgeport School of Chiropractic program to offer, as a minimum, those courses and objectives as suggested in the CCE standards. It is also the purpose of the UBSC program to offer a broad-based educational experience. In many cases, the educational program presented will go beyond the course offerings suggested by CCE and will also go beyond individual state laws and scope of practice. The University of Bridgeport School of Chiropractic curriculum is divided into three phases: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Clinical Services.School of Chiropractic172Semester Based Curriculum (18 WEEK PROGRAM PER SEMESTER) YEAR ONE ____________________________ SEMESTER ONE NUMBER COURSE LECT.

A set of competencies has been developed to verify ability to perform total client care and de - velop professionally. Students must demon - strate successful completion of these compe - tencies in order to graduate. Completion of competencies confirm that the student has the ability to safely provide dental hygiene care at an entry level, or what is minimally expected in performance as a new graduate. As a licensed professional who continues in his/her career, experience and continued learning leads one in becoming proficient, or eventually, even an expert in the delivery of care. The Fones School of Dental Hygiene Competencies are posted on the University Website. Students learn the skills and knowledge nec - essary to function effectively as an integral member of the dental health team. The pro - gram utilizes the facilities of the University of Bridgeport Health Clinics Fones School of Dental Hygiene Health Center, area hospi - tals, and community health clinics. Special - ized course work must be taken in the out - lined sequence. DHYG designated courses are open to admitted dental hygiene students only.

Dana Hall Room 142 Telephone (203) 576-4260 Fax: (203)576-4051 Program Overview The Doctor of Health Sciences (D.H.Sc.) is a terminal academic degree program that can be described as a combination of the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) and the Doctor of Public Health (DPH) degrees. The goal is to pro - vide a solid foundation in the health sciences while developing skills in research design and analysis, best-practices in clinical care and education. It is envisioned to contribute significantly to the personal and professional growth of healthcare professionals and edu - cators. This program offers students with master's degrees the opportunity for continu - ing academic training and advancement in their fields. There are currently three areas of concentration: clinician, nutrition and educa - tion. The Doctor of Health Sciences is an aca - demic degree and not a clinical healthcare degree, but one which prepares healthcare professionals with tools of administration and scholarship. The goals are to enable health professionals to become better clini - cians, teach in colleges and universities, or become health care administrators. For those interested in research, this program provides the foundation for both qualitative and quan - titative research as core values in the educa - tional process. Concentration Areas This D.H.Sc. program is currently designed with three tracks: 1) Clinician track 2) Nutrition track 3) Education track Students will have the option of taking cours - es from other tracks, as electives. This program has the potential to grow and add new tracks as demands and needs arise in the future. Outcomes of the Program Become leaders with the skills and knowl - edge to initiate changes in healthcare en - vironments Have the ability to analyze and influence public policy related to healthcare services Possess the skills necessary to effectively utilize evidence to support best practice clinical decisions Have the knowledge to integrate evi - dence-informed complementary medi - cine modalities into care delivery Have the ability to use research to solve problems and make ethical decisions in healthcare settings. Effectively serve as consultants to pa - tients, clients, community organizations, and professional colleagues Generate more professors with improved higher education pedagogy Dissertation DISSERTATION PROCESS Upon the successful completion of all online coursework, a student enters the dissertation phase of the Doctor of Health Sciences pro - gram. The dissertation phase includes three (3) required courses: HSCI 890: Dissertation Seminar, HSCI 891: Dissertation I, and HSCI: 892: Dissertation II. Each course is graded Pass/Fail. The dissertation topic can be an area of interest selected by the student, with the approval of their adviser and the Program Director. To complete the degree, students must take the required dissertation sequence and submit their dissertation which must be accepted and approved by a dissertation committee, and then by the Program Direc - tor. The dissertation for the D.H.Sc. degree may involve original research, or it can be a research paper, literature review, meta-anal - ysis, or a systematic review. The dissertation is a high-quality scholarly paper, presenting the student's research and findings, that is submitted in support of candidature for the Doctor of Health Sciences degree. DISSERTATION COMMITTEE At the beginning of HSCI-891: Dissertation I, each student will be assigned a faculty ad - visor who will also act as their committee chairperson. The dissertation committee will be formed, during HSCI-892 Dissertation II, after the adviser determines that the disserta - tion is ready to be submitted to a committee. The dissertation committee will consist of a minimum of three qualified faculty mem - bers. At least two members of the committee should be from the faculty of the University of Bridgeport. All committee members must possess a terminal degree and have some expertise in the area. An individual who is not a member of the University of Bridgeport faculty, but possesses the required qualifica - tions, may serve as a third member on the committee with the approval of the Program Director. The student will work closely with their dis - sertation adviser/committee chairperson, who will be responsible for supervising the student's work and guiding the student through the process. The responsibility of the entire committee is to examine the dissertation to make a final determination concerning its acceptability. After the dissertation receives unanimous approval from the committee, it is then sent to the Program Director for final review and approval.

The historical information gleaned from these sources is compared to the narratives and mythologies passed down through the written and oral traditions of the various schools. We examine the unfolding of the Shaolin Gongfu schools influenced by Chan as well as the Wudang tradition influ - enced by Daoism, the emergence of Martial Arts in the Hwarang movement of the Korean Silla kingdom and their revival after the Japa - nese occupation, and the transformation of Gongfu traditions in Japan via Okinawa. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 213 Martial Arts and East Asian Thought This course examines the impact of East Asian philosophy and religion on the Martial Arts.

In the re -Martial Arts Studies238view of the linkage between Daoism and Taiji we will focus on the cosmology of the Book of Changes, which informs the conceptual framework of Taiji, as well as influential Dao - ist concepts such as Wu Wei (No Action), Yin and Yang and passive values as depicted in the Laozi, Zhuangzi, the Book of Changes, and the Taijiquan Treatise. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 235 Issues in Taekwondo This course invites students to consider the challenges faced by Taekwondo at this stage in its history.
