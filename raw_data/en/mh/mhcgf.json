With over 20 years of clinical experience, Jitao Bai, Licensed Acupuncturist (LAc), practices acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Her specialties include infertility, women's health, pain management, internal illness and other conditions. Acupuncture views human body as a biological energy field. This energy, Qi (or Chi, pronounced \"Chee\"), flows along 14 channels in the whole body. Each channel is associated with a particular physiological system and internal organ. There are 361 classic acupuncture points along the channels. If those channels are imbalanced or blocked, disease will rise. Very fine needles are inserted into various points of the body to restore and balance the normal flow of energy. Each point has a predictable effect to certain part of human body or associated disease, thus help relieving pain and improving body function. Acupuncture is one of the safest of all medical practices, while still maintaining a high degree of favorable results. In fact, it is a natural therapy without introducing any chemicals or drugs into your system, but can still balance your body hormones, change the circulation of your blood, release pain and stress and totally cure some diseases. Acupuncture is currently used by 10 million American patients yearly and performed by thousands of physicians, master's degree level acupuncturists and other practitioners for relief or prevention of pain and a variety of health problems. Instead of using invasive techniques and harsh drugs, acupuncture unlocks the body's natural ability to heal. INFERTILITY About one in eight couples experience problems with fertility.
