We are delighted to have you as a partner in this important effort to increase immunization rates among healthcare personnel. Since the inception seven years ago, the Maryland Healthcare Personnel (HCP) Immunization Initiative has enlisted dozens of healthcare facilities and providers in our fight against the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases in healthcare settings. A collaboration between the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Maryland Partnership for Prevention, and professional associations across the state, the Initiative has raised awareness locally and nationally about the importance of vaccination among healthcare professionals. As the program evolves, we continue to strive to provide the most relevant, useful resources to support your vaccination efforts. This year's toolkit features new information and updated versions of important resources to support your campaign. We hope it will facilitate continued success. Features of the 2011-12 Maryland Healthcare Personnel Immunization Initiative Toolkit: xListing of Maryland hospitals with the highest healthcare personnel vaccination rates (p. 39) xExamples of successful strategies for increasing vaccination among healthcare personnel (p. 30) xSpecific information and tools arranged by disease, including: oFacts and Frequently Asked Questions oVaccine Information Statements (VIS) oStanding Orders oSample Vaccination Declination Forms We appreciate your commitment to raising immunization rates among Maryland's healthcare personnel and look forward to working with you.

Notable revisions to the 2006 recommendations include 1) revisions to the tables of contraindications and precautions to vaccin ation, as well as a separate table of conditions that are commonly misperceived as contraindications and precautions; 2) reordering of the report content, with vaccine risk-benefit screening, managing adverse reactions, reporting of adverse events, and the vaccine injury c ompensation program presented immediately after the discussion of contraindications and precautions; 3) stricter criteria for selecting an appropriate storage unit for vaccines; 4) additional guidance for maintaining the cold chain in the event of unavoidable temperature deviat ions; and 5) updated revisions for vaccination of patients who have received a hematopoietic cell transplant. The most recent ACIP recomm enda- tions for each specific vaccine should be consulted for comprehensive details. This report, ACIP recommendations for each vacci ne, and additional information about vaccinations are available from CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Introduction CDC recommends routine vaccination to prevent 17 vaccine-preventable diseases that occur in infants, children, adolescents, or adults. This report provides information for clinicians and other health-care providers about concerns that commonly arise when vaccinating persons of various ages. Providers and patients encounter numerous issues, such as the timing of each dose, screening for contraindications and precautions, the number of vaccines to be administered, the educational needs of patients and parents, and interpreting and responding to adverse events. Vaccination providers help patients understand the substantial, occasionally conflicting, information about vaccination. These vaccination recom-mendations are intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who vaccinate patients.

This document provides updated guidance for the use of influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2011-12 influenza season. In 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) first recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months in the United States ( 1,2). Vaccination of all persons aged 6 months continues to be recommended. Information is presented in this report regarding vaccine strains for the 2011-12 influenza season, the vaccination schedule for children aged 6 months through 8 years, and considerations regarding vaccination of persons with egg allergy. Availability of a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved intradermally administered influenza vaccine formulation for adults aged 18 through 64 years is reported. For issues related to influenza vaccination that are not addressed in this update, refer to the 2010 ACIP statement on prevention and control of influenza with vaccines and associated updates ( 1,2). Methodology for the formulation of the ACIP annual influenza statement has been described previously ( 1). The ACIP Influenza Work Group meets every 2-4 weeks throughout the year. Work Group membership includes several voting members of the ACIP , as well as representatives from ACIP Liaison Organizations. Meetings are held by teleconference and include discussion of influenza-related issues, such as vaccine effectiveness and safety, coverage in groups recommended for vaccination, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and anticipated vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited experts, and published and unpublished data are discussed. CDC's Influenza Division provides influenza surveillance and antiviral resistance data, and the Immunization Safety Office and Immunization Services Division provide information on vaccine safety and distribution and coverage, respectively. Vaccine Strains for the 2011-12 I nfluenza Season The 2011-12 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine virus strains are identical to those contained in the 2010-11 vaccine. These include A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus strain is derived from a 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus ( 3). Recommendations for Vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months ( 1). To permit time for production of protective antibody levels ( 4,5), vaccination should optimally occur before onset of influenza activity in the community, and providers should offer vaccination as soon as vaccine is available. Vaccination also should continue to be offered throughout the influenza season. Although influenza vaccine strains for the 2011-12 season are unchanged from those of 2010-11, annual vaccination is recommended even for those who received the vaccine for the previous season. Although in one study of children vaccinated against A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) virus, vaccine efficacy remained high against this strain 3 years later, the estimated efficacy of vaccine decreased over the seasons studied ( 6). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that postvaccination antibody titers decline over the course of a year ( 7-10 ). Thus, annual vaccination is recommended for optimal protection against influenza. Vaccine Doses for Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination to optimize immune response. In a study of children aged 5 through 8 years who received trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) for the first time, the proportion of children with protective antibody responses was significantly higher after 2 doses than after 1 dose ( 11). The importance of vaccine priming might depend more on the similarity of the antigenic composition between the priming and second dose than the temporal interval between doses. From the 2003-04 to 2004-05 influenza seasons, the A(H1N1) virus antigen remained unchanged; however, the A(H3N2) virus antigen changed to a drifted strain, and the B virus antigen changed more substantially to a different lineage. In a study conducted over those two seasons, influenza-vaccine na\u00efve children aged 6 through 23 months who received 1 dose of TIV in the spring of their first year of vaccination followed by a second dose in the fall were less likely to have protective antibody responses to the A(H3N2) and B virus antigens when compared with children who received 2 doses of identical vaccine in the fall ( 12). Response to the unchanged A(H1N1) virus antigen was comparable between the groups. In another study conducted over the same two seasons, unprimed children aged 10 through 24 months who received 1 dose of TIV during the fall of each season had similar responses to the unchanged A(H1N1) virus antigen as well as to the drifted A(H3N2) virus antigen when compared with children aged 6 through 24 Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2011 8The Immunization Action Coalition thanks Eric E.

For information about additional vaccines you may need, see the references at the bottom of page 3. CDC answers frequently asked questions about how to protect healthcare workers (page 1 of 3)Hepatitis B and the healthcare worker www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2109.pdf Item #P2109 (6/08)Which workers in the healthcare setting need hepatitis B vaccine? Th e Occu pational Safety and Health A dministra- tion (O SHA) requires that h epatitis B vacc ine be offered to healthca re workers (HCW s) wh o hav e a reasonable expectat ion of being exposed to blood on th e job. Th is requirement does not inclu de HCW s wh o w ould not be expected to hav e oc- cupational risk, such a s receptionis ts, billing staff, and general ofc e workers. At what anatomic site should hepatitis B vaccine be administered to adults? What needle size should be used? Th e deltoid mu scle is recomm ended for routine intramu scula r (IM) vacc ination am ong a dults. Th e glut eus mu scle should not be used as a site for administering h epatitis B vacc ine. Th e sugg ested need le size is 1\"-2\" dependin g on th e recipi- ent's gender and w eight (1 \" for femal es w eigh- ing l ess tha n 70 kg ; 1\u00bd \" for femal es w eighing 70-100 kg ; 1\"-1\u00bd \" for mal es weighing less tha n 120 kg ; and 2\" for mal es weighing 120 kg or more and femal es more tha n 100 kg) . A 22- t o 25-gaug e need le should be used. For optimal protection, it is crucial that th e vacc ine be administered IM, not subcuta neously. If a HCW had one dose only of hepatitis B vaccine 4 months ago, should the series be restarted? No. Th e hepatitis B vacc ine series should not be restarted wh en doses are delayed; rath er, th e series should be continued from wh ere it stopped. Th e HCW should receive th e second dose of vacc ine now a nd the third dose at l east 8 w eeks lat er. Th ere needs to be at l east 16 w eeks between the rst and the th ird doses and at l east 8 w eeks between th e second and third doses of vacc ine. Is it safe for HCWs to be vaccinated during pregnancy? Yes. Limited data indicat e no apparent risk for ad- verse events to developing f etuses. Cu antigen (HB sAg) a nd should pose no risk to the fetus. If th e mother is being vacc inated be-cau se she is at risk f or hepatitis B v irus (HBV) infection (e.g., a HCW, a person with a sexuall y transmitted disease, an injection drug u ser, mul- tiple sex partners), vacc ination should be initiated as soon as her risk fact or is identied during th e pregnancy. If not vacc inated, a pregnant w oma n ma y contract a n HBV infection, wh ich m ight result in severe disease for the mother and ch ronic infec- tion for the newborn. In addition, giving h epatitis B vacc ine to th e m other is not a c ontraindicat ion to breastfeedin g. Which HCWs need serologic testing after receiving 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine? All HCW s wh o hav e a reasonable risk of expo- sure to blood or body flu ids containing blood (e.g., HCW s with direct patient contact, HCW s wh o hav e the risk of need lestick or sharps injury, la borato- ry workers wh o draw or test blood) should hav e postvacc ination testing f or antibody to hepatitis B surfac e antigen (a nti-HB s). Postvacc ination test- ing should be done 1-2 m onths aft er the last dose of vacc ine. What should be done if a HCW's postvaccina- tion anti-HBs test is negative 1-2 months after the last dose of vaccine? Repeat th e 3-dose series and test for anti-HB s 1-2 months aft er the last dose of vacc ine. If th e HCW is still negat ive aft er a second vacc ine series , th e HCW is considered a non-responder to hepatitis B vacc ination. HCW s wh o do not respond to vac- cination should be tested for HB sAg t o determine if th ey hav e ch ronic HBV infection. If th e HB sAg test is positive, th e person should receive appropri - ate counseling a nd medical ma nagement. Persons wh o test negat ive for HB sAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be coun- seled about precaut ions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain hepatitis B immu ne globulin (HBIG) prophylax is for any known or likely expo- sure to HB sAg- positive blood. How often should I test HCWs after they've received the hepatitis B vaccine series to make sure they're protected? For immu ne competent HCW s, periodi c testing or periodi c boos ting is not needed. Postvacc ination testing (a nti-HB s) should be done 1-2 m onths aft er the la st dose of h epatitis B vacc ine. If a dequat e anti-HB s (at l east 10 mIU/mL) is presen t, nothing more needs to be done. If postvacc ination testing is less tha n 10 mIU/mL, th e vacc ine series should be repeated and anti-HB s testing done , 1-2 m onths after the last dose of th e second series. Th is infor- mat ion should be recorded in the HCW 's employee health record. Should a HCW who performs invasive proce- dures and who once had a positive anti-HBs result be revaccinated if the anti-HBs titer is rechecked and is less than 10 mIU/mL? No. Immu ne competent persons known to hav e re- sponded to hepatitis B vacc ination do not require additional passive or act ive immu nizat ion. Postvac- cination testing should be done 1-2 m onths aft er the original vacc ine series is completed. In th is scenario, th e initial postvacc ination testing showed that th e HCW wa s protected. Substantial evidence sugg ests that a dults wh o respond to hepatitis B vacc ination (anti-HB s of at l east 10 mIU/mL) a re protected from ch ronic HBV infection for as long as 23 years, even if th ere is no detecta ble anti-HB s currently. Only immu nocompromised persons (e.g., hemodialysis patients, some HIV- positive persons ) need to hav e anti-HB s testing a nd boos ter doses of vacc ine to ma intain th eir protective anti-HB s concentrations of at l east 10 mIU/mL . Before reading the recommendations of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices (ACIP) that say not to do this, we tested our employees for anti-HBs several years after they were vaccinated and some people had inadequate results, even though they had all completed a 3-dose series. What should we do now? ACIP does not recomm end periodi over time, and HCW s rema in protected even if th eir anti-HB s concentration declines to below Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave. been vacc inated in the past and wh o do not hav e a docum ented re- sponse to vacc ination of at 10 mIU/mL, ACIP recomm ends testing for anti-HB s at th e time of an exposure and providing a ppropri ate ma nagement based on the results of testing. (See postexposure guidelines in Ta ble 1.) If c ost is not a g reat c oncern or if an employee or employer wa nts docum ented assurance of immu nity, a revacc ination series ca n be undertak en followed by testing 1-2 m onths aft er the 3rd dose of h epatitis B vacc ine. How often should anti-HBs testing be done on HCWs who perform invasive procedures? For persons wh ose immu ne statu s is normal, pe- riodi c serologic t esting t o assess anti-HB s con- centrations is not necessary. Persons wh o perform invasive procedures should be treated no differently from other HCW s with respe ct t o anti-HB s testing. If a HCW ha s an exposure (e.g., need lestick), s/he should be evaluat ed for th eir need for immu no- prophylax is acc ordin g to postexposure gu idelines in Ta ble 1. If HCWs received hepatitis B vaccination in the past and were not tested for immunity, should they be tested now? No. In th is scenario, a HCW does not need to be tested unless s/he ha s an exposure. If a n exposure occu rs, refer to th e postexposure gu idelines in Table 1. How should a vaccinated HCW with an unknown anti-HBs response be managed if they have a percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids from an HBsAg-positive source? Th is person should be tested for anti-HB s as soon as possib le aft er exposure. If th e anti-HB s concen- tration is at l east 10 mIU/mL, no further treatm ent is needed. If th e anti-HB s concentration is less tha n 10 mIU/mL, HBIG a nd one dose of hepatitis B vac- cine should be administered. Prior to administering the HBIG a nd vacc ine, blood should be draw n for a baseline HB sAg t est. Subsequently, in 3-6 m onths, an additional a nti-HB s and an HB sAg t est should be performed. If th e HB sAg is positive, th e person is infected and should be referred for medical evalu- ation. If th e anti-HB s result is at l east 10 mIU/mL, the person is seropro tected. It is necessary to do postvacc ination testing lat er tha n the usual recom- mended time fram e becau se anti-HB s from HBIG might be detected if testing is done any earlier. Th e postvacc ination test result should be recorded in the person's health record. For a pre-employment physical, a HCW states she received all three hepatitis B vaccine doses as an adolescent. Would you test for anti-HBs? If th e HCW ha s w ritten docum entation of a full hepatitis B vacc ine series , testing f or anti-HB s at th is point is not necessary. If th e HCW ha s a subsequent exposure to HBV , h epatitis B immu- noprop hylax is should be administered following guidelines for a person wh o ha s been vacc inated, but th e immu ne response is not k nown (Ta ble 1) . Th is informat ion should be docum ented in th e HCW 's employee health record. Th is approach should be sufc ient to m eet th e needs of th e em- ployer and the requirements of O SHA . If th ere is no written docum entation of h epatitis B vacc ination, see the next qu estion.

Persons wh o test negat ive for HB sAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precaut ions to pre- vent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG prophylax is for any known or likely exposure to HB sAg- positive blood (see Ta ble 1) . Can a person with chronic HBV infection become a HCW? Yes. All HCW s should pract ice standard precau- tions, wh ich a re designed to prevent HBV t ransmis- sion, both f rom patients to HCW a nd from HCW t o patient. Th ere is, however, one cav eat c oncernin g HBV- infected HCW s. Th ose posi- tive and HB eAg (h epatitis B e antigen) positive should not perform exposure-prone procedures (e.g., gynecologic, ca rdiothoracic surgery) u nless they hav e sought c ounsel from a n expert review panel and been advised under what c ircum stances, if any, th ey ma y continue to perform th ese proce- dures. Such c ircum stances might inclu de notifying ctive patients of th e HCW 's seroposi tivity before they undergo exposure-prone invasive pro- cedures.

Persons with a nti-HB s concentrations that decline to less tha n 10 mIU/mL a re still protected aga inst HBV infection. For HCW s with normal immu ne statu s wh o hav e demonstrated adequat e anti-HB s (at l east 10 mIU/mL) f ollowing vacc ination, boos ter doses of vacc ine or periodi c a nti-HB s testing is not rec- omm ended. A person who is a known non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine has a percutaneous expo-sure to HBsAg-positive blood. According to older ACIP recommendations, I have the option to give HBIG x 2 or HBIG x 1 and initiate revaccination. How do I decide which to do? Cu rrent recomm endations hav e been ended postexposure prophylax is for per- sons wh o are non-responders to hepatitis B vac- cine (i.e., hav e not responded to an initial 3- dose series and revacc ination w ith a 3- dose series ) is to give HBIG a s soon as possib le aft er exposure and a second dose of HBIG one m onth lat er (see Table 1) . Ex posed persons , wh o are known not to hav e responded to a prima ry vacc ine series , but hav e not been revacc inated with a second 3- dose series , should receive a single dose of HBIG a nd reinitiate th e hepatitis B vacc ine series w ith th e rst dose of hepatitis B vacc ine as soon as possib le after exposure. If an employee does not respond to hepatitis B vaccination (employee has had two full series of hepatitis B vaccine), does s/he need to be removed from activities that expose her/him to bloodborne pathogens? Does the employer have a responsibility in this area beyond providing the vaccine? Th ere are no regulat ions that require removal f rom job situat ions wh ere exposure to bloodborne path o- gens occu r; this is an individual policy deci- sion w ithin th e organizat ion. O SHA regulat ions require that employees in jobs wh ere th ere is a reasonable risk of exposure to blood be offered hepatitis B vacc ine. In addition, th e regulat ion states that a dequat e person al protective equip- ment be provided and that standard precaut ions be followed. Ch eck your state OSHA regulat ions regarding a dditional requirements. If th ere are no state O SHA regulat ions, federal O SHA regula- tions should be followed. Adequat e docum entation should be plac ed in the record regarding non-response to vacc ination. HCW s wh o do not to vacc ination should be tested for HB sAg to determine if th ey hav e ch ronic HBV infection. Keep your own vaccination history! Record the dates you received hepatitis B vaccine, as well as the results of your postvaccination serologic testing (anti-HBs). Remember to save records of any vaccinations you receive so you don't have to repeat them. To order adult immunization record cards, visit www.immunize.org/adultizcards.Several physicians in our group have no documentation showing they received hepatitis B vaccine. They are relatively sure, however, that they received the doses many years ago. What do we do now? Becau se th ere is no docum entation ina- tion, th e 3- series should be ad- ministered and postvacc ination testing should be performed 1-2 m onths aft er the third dose of vac- cine. Th ere is no ha rm in receiving extra doses of vacc ine. Ca re should alwa ys be tak en to docum ent vacc ine lot, date, ma nufactu rer, route, and vacc ine dosages. Postvacc ination testing results should also be docum ented, inclu ding th e date testing wa s per- formed. All organizat ions (e.g., hospitals, cl inics) should develop policies or gu idelines to assure val id hepatitis B immu nizat ion. A healthcare worker (HCW) thinks she had 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine in the past but has no documentation of receiving those doses. Before reading the recommendations to revaccinate her, we obtained an anti-HBs titer and the result was greater than 10 mIU/mL. With this lab result, can't we assume she is immune? A positive anti-HB s indicat es that th e vacc inated person is immu ne at th e time the HCW wa s tested, but does not necessarily assure that th e HCW ha s long-t erm immu nity. Long-t erm immu nity ha s been shown only for persons atta ining a n adequat e anti- HB s result of at l east 10 mIU/mL aft er a 3- dose vacc ination series. Th e most direct wa y to deal w ith this is to vacc inate the HCW w ith th e 3-dose series of h epatitis B vacc ine; test for anti-HB s in 1-2 months and docum ent th e result in the HCW 's em- ployee health record. An adequat e anti-HB s result from a docum ented 3- dose vacc ine series would assure not only seropro tection, but l ong-t erm pro- tection, as well. Of c ourse, it is possib le that th e HCW ha s an anti- HB s result of g reater tha n 10 mIU/mL becau se of an HBV infection in the past. If th is is of concern, a total a nti-HBc t est could be performed to discern this (a positive result indicat es a h istory of HBV infection at some undened period in time). I'm a nurse who received the hepatitis B vaccine series more than 10 years ago and had a positive follow-up titer (at least 10 mIU/mL). At present, my titer is negative (less than 10 mIU/mL). What should I do now? Nothing. Data show that vacc ine-induced anti-HB s levels might decline over time; however, memory (anam nestic a nti-HB s response ) rema ins Hepatitis B and the healthcare worker Page 3 For more information on vaccination recommendations for healthcare workers, see the following: 1. \"Immunization of Vaccination Recommendations,\" Immunization Action Coalition, www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2017.pdf (page 3 of 3) 11Morbidity and Morta lity Week ly Report MMWR / Apri l 8, 2011 / Vol. 60 / No. 13 421Notes f rom the Field Measles Outbrea k \u2014 H enne pin County , Minnesota , February -March 2011 On March 2, 2011, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) confirmed measles in a Hennepin County resident aged 9 months. As of April 1, investigation of contacts and heightened surveillance had revealed a total of 13 epide-miologically linked cases in Hennepin County residents. Of those cases, 11 were laboratory confirmed, and two were in household contacts of confirmed cases and met the clinical case definition for measles. The patients included children aged 4 months-4 years and one adult aged 51 years; seven of the 13 were of Somali decent. Eight patients were hospitalized. Vaccination status was known for 11 patients: five were too young to have been vaccinated, and six (all of Somali descent) had not been vaccinated because of parental concerns about the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The most recent rash onset was March 28. An additional, unrelated case of measles was con-firmed in a Hennepin County resident aged 34 years who was exposed in Orlando, Florida, sometime during March 1-10. The investigation determined that the index patient was a U.S.-born child of Somali descent, aged 30 months, who developed a rash February 15, 14 days after returning from a trip to Kenya. The patient attended a drop-in child care center 1 day before rash onset; measles developed in three contacts at the center and in one household contact. Secondary and tertiary exposures occurred in two congregate living facilities for homeless persons (four patients), an emergency department (two patients), and households (two patients). A virus isolate from the index patient was genotyped at CDC as B3, which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Outbreak control efforts have included following up with potentially exposed persons, providing immune globulin to persons without evidence of immunity, and recommending that persons without evidence of immunity who have been exposed to measles not leave their residence while potentially infectious (21 days). Multiple vaccination clinics have been held or scheduled at community venues and in the congregate living facilities.In the United States, MMR vaccine normally is given as a 2-dose series, with the first dose at age 12-15 months and a second dose at age 4-6 years.* However, this series may be accelerated during outbreaks. In response to the current outbreak, MDH has recommended that children aged 6-11 months living in selected congregate living facilities receive a dose of MMR vaccine, and that older children and adults in these facilities receive vaccine if they are susceptible and have had less than 2 doses of MMR vaccine. MDH also has recommended an accelerated vaccination schedule (a total of 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days) for all children aged 12 months living in Hennepin County and all children of Somali descent living in the wider Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. However, importations of measles from other countries still occur, and low vaccination coverage associated with paren-tal concerns regarding the MMR vaccine puts persons and communities at risk for measles. Public health and health-care providers should work with parents and community leaders to address concerns about the MMR vaccine to ensure high vaccination coverage and prevent measles.

Because serologic response to the measles vaccine is variable among infants aged 6-11 months, infants vaccinated before age 12 months should be revaccinated on or after the first birthday with 1 dose of MMR vaccine followed by a second at least 28 days later. 12Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Prevention & Control /g76/g79/g76/g87/g76/g72/g86/g17/g3/g36/g81/g3/g72/g73/g73/g72/g70/g87/g76/g89/g72/g3/g89/g68/g70/g70/g76/g81/g68/g87/g76 some people born before 1957 need to be vaccinated with MMR? Provisional Recommendations for Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) 'Evidence of Immunity' Requirements for Healthcare Personnel Date of ACIP vote: June 24, 2009 Date of posting of provisional recommendations: August 28, 2009 On June 24, 2009 the ACIP voted on revised recommendations for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 'evidence of immunity' requirements for healthcare personnel . The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has endorsed these changes. Summary of new recommendations: Adequate presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps for persons who work in health care facilities: Measles : a. Documented administration of two doses of live measles virus vaccine1or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 1957234 Rubella a. Documented administration of one dose of live rubella virus vaccine1or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 1957 (except women of childbearing age who could become pregnant)234 Mumps a. Documented administration of two doses of live mumps virus vaccine1or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 1957234 1The first dose should be administered on or after the first birthday; the second dose of measles and mumps-containing vaccine should be administered no earlier than one month (i.e., a minimum of 28 days) after the first dose. Combined MMR vaccine generally should be used whenever any of its component vaccines is indicated. 2May vary depending on current state or local requirements. 3For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with two doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. 4For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend two doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella. These recommendations update two previous ACIP documents: 1.

The index case occurred in a boy aged 11 years who had returned on June 17 from a trip to the United Kingdom, where approximately 7,400 reports of laboratory-conrmed mumps were received by the Health Protection Agency in 2009.* He then attended a New York summer camp for tradition-observant Jewish boys, where he became symptomatic on June 28. Subsequently, other camp attendees and a sta member were reported to have mumps, and transmission continued in multiple locations when the camp attendees returned home. As of January 29, 2010, a total of 1,521 cases had been reported, with onset dates from June 28, 2009, through January 29, 2010, a substantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of October 30, 2009 ( 1). The outbreak has remained conned primarily to the tradition-observant Jewish community, with <3% of cases occurring among persons outside the community. The largest percentage of cases (61%) has occurred among persons aged 7-18 years, and 76% of the patients are male. Among the patients for whom vaccination status was reported, 88% had received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and 75% had received 2 doses. This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the United States since 2006 ( 2). Although mumps vaccination alone was not sucient to prevent this outbreak, maintaining high measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage remains the most eective way to prevent outbreaks and limit their size when they occur. Mumps cases included in this report were reported by January 29, 2010. Cases were classified according to the 2008 case denition of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists ; only cases of probable and conrmed mumps are included in this report. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that children receive 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the rst dose administered at 12-15 months and the second dose near the time of school entry (at 4-6 years). \u00a7 Methods used to obtain the vaccination status of patients have included parental report, review of vaccination cards, and verication from health-care providers. The 1,521 outbreak-related mumps cases have been reported from several counties in New York and New Jersey; local transmission is continuing (Figure). The majority (675 [44%]) of cases have been reported from New York City (primarily Brooklyn), followed by Orange County, New York (364 [24%]); Update: Mumps Outbreak \u2014 New Y ork and New Jersey, June 2009-January 2010 INSIDE 130 Transmission of Yellow Fever Vaccine Virus Through Breast-Feeding \u2014 Brazil, 2009 133 Progr ess in Immunization Information Systems \u2014 United States, 2008* Available at http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2010/news0210.htm#mmps. An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary glands, lasting at least 2 days, and without other apparent cause. Probable case: a case that meets the clinical case denition without laboratory conrmation and is epidemiologically linked to a clinically compatible case. Conrmed case: a case that 1) meets the clinical case denition or occurs in a patient with a clinically compatible illness and 2) is either laboratory conrmed or is epidemiologically linked to a conrmed case. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/casedef/mumps_2008.htm. \u00a7 ACIP recommends 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine for all school-aged children (i.e., grades K-12) and for adults at high risk for disease (i.e., persons who work in health-care facilities, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions). Health-care workers born in or after 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity should receive 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine, and those born before 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity should consider receiving 1 dose. During outbreaks, ACIP recommends oering a second dose of vaccine to children aged 1-4 years ( 8). 16The MMWR series of publications is published by the Oce of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Atlanta, GA 30333.

T wenty-ve (2%) cases (reported during June 28-September 8) were associated with the summer camp in Sullivan County, New York; however, no additional cases occurred in the county after the camp ended in late August. Of the 1,521 patients, 1,477 (97%) are members of the tradition-observant Jewish community. Of the 44 cases not associated with this religious community, 33 have been reported from New York City; seven from New Jersey; two from Orange County, New York; and two from Rockland County, New York. Many of these outside cases have occurred among persons who have reported regular contact with members of the aected community. Diagnostic laboratory testing for mumps (i.e., detection of mumps immunoglobulin M antibod-ies by various methods, detection of mumps RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or isolation of mumps virus in cell culture) has been performed for 761 (50%) cases. Of these, 385 (51%) cases are laboratory conrmed. Of the 1,518 patients whose age is known, 1,385 (91%) are aged >6 years (Figure). The median age of patients is 15 years (range 3 months-90 years) and is similar in all areas with ongoing transmission except New Jersey, where the median age is 17 years. Of the 1,489 patients whose sex is known, 1,136 (76%) are male. Sixty-ve reports of complications from mumps have been received: orchitis (55 cases), pancreatitis (ve cases), aseptic meningitis (two cases), transient deafness (one case), Bell's palsy (one case), and oophoritis (one case). Nineteen hospitalizations from mumps have been reported; no deaths have occurred. Vaccination status is known for 1,115 patients: 966 (91%) of 1,062 patients aged 18 years and 149 (33%) of 456 patients aged 19 years (Table). Of these patients, 976 (88%) had received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine before the outbreak, and 839 (75%) had received 2 doses. Among patients aged 7-18 years, the age group with the majority of cases and for whom 2 doses of MMR vaccine is recom-mended, 93% had received at least 1 dose, and 85% had received 2 doses.

A total of 16,858 pertussis cases and 12 infant deaths were reported in 2009 ( 1; CDC, unpublished data, 2009). Although 2005 recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) called for vaccination with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertus-sis (Tdap) for adolescents and adults to improve immunity against pertussis, Tdap coverage is 56% among adolescents and <6% among adults ( 2,3). In October 2010, ACIP rec- ommended expanded use of Tdap. This report provides the updated recommendations, summarizes the safety and effec-tiveness data considered by ACIP , and provides guidance for implementing the recommendations. ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 through18 years who have completed the recommended child-hood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTP/DTaP) vac-cination series and for adults aged 19 through 64 years ( 4,5). T wo Tdap vaccines are available in the United States. Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) is licensed for use in persons aged 10 through 64 years, and Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, Canada) is licensed for use in persons aged 11 through 64 years. Both Tdap products are licensed for use at an interval of at least 5 years between the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and Tdap dose. On October 27, 2010, ACIP approved the following additional recommendations: 1) use of Tdap regardless of interval since the last tetanus- or diphtheria-toxoid containing vaccine, 2) use of Tdap in certain adults aged 65 years and older, and 3) use of Tdap in undervac-cinated children aged 7 through 10 years. The Pertussis Vaccines Working Group of ACIP reviewed published and unpublished Tdap immunogenicity and safety data from clinical trials and observational studies on use of Tdap. The Working Group also considered the epidemiology of pertussis, provider and program feedback, and data on the barriers to receipt of Tdap. The Working Group then presented policy options for consideration to the full ACIP . These addi-tional recommendations are intended to remove identified barriers and programmatic gaps that contribute to suboptimal vaccination coverage. An important barrier that limited vac-cination of persons with Tdap was unknown history of Td booster. Programmatic gaps included lack of a licensed Tdap vaccine for children aged 7 through 10 years and adults aged 65 years and older. In light of the recent increase of pertussis in Updated Recommendations for Use of Tetanus Toxoid , Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , 2010 the United States, the additional recommendations are made to facilitate use of Tdap to reduce the burden of disease and risk for transmission to infants (Box). Timing of Tdap Following Td Safety. When Tdap was licensed in 2005, the safety of administering a booster dose of Tdap at intervals <5 years after Td or pediatric DTP/DTaP had not been studied in adults. However, evaluations in children and adolescents suggested that the safety of intervals as short as 18 months was acceptable (6). Rates of local and systemic reactions after Tdap vaccination in adults were lower than or comparable to rates in adolescents during U.S. prelicensure trials; therefore, the safety of using intervals as short as 2 years between Td and Tdap in adults was inferred ( 4). Additional data on the safety of administering Tdap <5 years after Td are now available. T wo studies were conducted with 387 persons aged 18 through 76 years who received a Tdap or combined Tdap-inactivated polio vaccine (Tdap-IPV) vaccination either within 21 days, or <2 years following a previous Td-containing vaccine ( 7,8). Tdap-IPV vaccine is not licensed in the United States. In both studies, immediate or short-term adverse events (e.g., 30 minutes to 2 weeks) after receipt of Tdap or Tdap-IPV were examined. The majority of these events were limited to local reactions, including pain (68%-83%), erythema (20%-25%), and swelling (19%-38%) (7,8). Serious adverse events related to the receipt of Tdap or Tdap-IPV shortly after Td or Td-IPV vaccinations did not occur. However, the number of subjects in these studies was small and does not exclude the potential for rare, but serious, adverse events. Guidance for use. ACIP recommends that pertussis vac- cination, when indicated, should not be delayed and that Tdap should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. ACIP concluded that while longer intervals between Td and Tdap vaccination could decrease the occurrence of local reactions, the benefits of protection against pertussis outweigh the potential risk for adverse events. Adults Aged 65 Years and Older Unpublished data from trials for Adacel (N = 1,170) and Boostrix (N = 1,104) on the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap in adults aged 65 years and older who received vaccine were provided to ACIP by Sanofi Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline. 18MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / July 9, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. 26 817 birthing hospitals and local health departments to support postpartum vaccination of mothers and close contacts of newborns.

Salmonella Newport Infections Associated with Consumption of Unpasteurized Milk \u2014 Utah , April-June 2010 On April 29, 2010, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) was notified of three cases of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport infection. The three patients recently had consumed unpasteurized milk purchased from a store in northern Utah (store A). In Utah, unpasteurized milk can be sold legally at licensed dairies or by licensed dairies at dairy-owned retail stores meeting specic requirements ( 1). A central Utah dairy licensed to sell unpasteurized milk (dairy A) owns and sells unpasteurized milk at store A and a second northern Utah store (store B). By May 3, 2010, three additional patients with S. Newport infec- tions had been reported; all recently had consumed unpasteurized milk purchased from store A. UDOH notied the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) of the suspected association between illness and unpasteurized milk consumption, and UDAF suspended sales of unpasteurized milk at the two stores on May 3, 2010. During April 29-June 3, 2010, a total of 10 S. Newport cases were reported to UDOH; all 10 patients had consumed unpasteurized milk from store A (seven patients) or store B (three patients). The patients ranged in age from 2 to 56 years (median: 21 years); six were female. One patient was Pertussis \u2014 California , January-June 2010 The number of pertussis cases reported to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has increased substantially during 2010. The increase in cases was rst noted in late March among patients admitted to a children's hospital. During January 1- June 30, 2010, a total of 1,337 cases were reported, a 418% increase from the 258 cases reported during the same period in 2009. All cases either met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists denitions for conrmed or probable pertussis or had an acute cough illness and Bordetella pertussis -specic nucleic acid detected by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal specimens ( 1). During January-June in California, the incidence of pertussis was 3.4 cases per 100,000 population. County rates ranged from zero to 76.9 cases per 100,000 (median: 2.0 cases). By age group, incidence was highest (38.5 cases per 100,000) among infants aged <1 year; 89% of cases were among infants aged <6 months, who are too young to be fully immu-nized. Incidence among children aged 7-9 years and 10-18 years was 10.1 cases and 9.3 cases per 100,000, respectively. Of 634 case reports with available data, 105 (16.6%) patients were hospitalized, of whom 66 (62.9%) were aged <3 months. Incidence among Hispanic infants (49.8 cases per 100,000) was higher than among other racial/ethnic populations. Five deaths were reported, all in previously healthy Hispanic infants aged <2 months at disease onset; none had received any pertussis-containing vaccines. The incidence of pertussis is cyclical, with peaks occurring every 3-5 years in the United States ( 2). The last peak was in 2005, when approximately 25,000 cases were reported nationally and approximately 3,000 cases in California, including eight deaths in infants aged <3 months. If the rates from the rst half of the year persist throughout 2010, California would have its highest annual rate of pertussis reported since 1963 and the most cases reported since 1958. CDPH is attempting to prevent transmission of pertussis to vulnerable infants ( 3) by disseminating educational materials and clinical guidance, raising community awareness, and oering free tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine to Notes from the Field 19Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Clinical Questions and Answers Does ACIP recommend varicella Should HCPs /g55/g75/g72/g3/g36/g38/g44/g51/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g43/g44/g38/g51/g36/g38/g3/g71/g82/g3/g81/g82/g87/g3/g85/g72/g70/g82/g80/g80/g72/g81/g71/g3/g85/g82/g88/g87/g76/g81/g72/g3/g87/g72/g86/g87/g76/g81/g74/g3/g82/g73/g3/g43/g38/g51/g86/g3/g73/g82/g85/g3/g89/g68/g85/g76/g70/g72/g79/g79/g68/g3 after exposure to natural varicella? /g3/g11/g6/g81/g68/g87/g88/g85/g68/g79/g12/g3/g17 /g3/g11/g6/g87/g82/g83/g12 Are recently vaccinated HCPs at risk for for unvaccinated HCPs without evidence of immunity who are exposed mpaigns for Vacc 23 Successful Campaigns for Vaccinating Healthcare Personnel \u00b1 Prior to the start of influenza season, remind healthcare personnel of the importance of vaccination and when the vaccine will be available. \u00b1 Sponsor a kick-off event. \u00b1 Offer vaccine free of charge to all staff and volunteers. \u00b1 Educate employees via fact sheets, newsletters or bulletin board posting.

Babcock,1Nancy Gemeinhart,2Marilyn Jones,2W. Claiborne Dunagan,1,2and Keith F. Woeltje1 1Washington University School of Medicine and2BJC HealthCare, St Louis, Missouri (See the editorial commentary by Pavia, on pages 465-7.) Background. Influenza vaccination of health care workers has been recommended since 1984. Multiple strat- egies to enhance vaccination rates have been suggested, but national rates have remained low. Methods. BJC HealthCare is a large Midwestern health care organization with 26,000 employees. Because organizational vaccination rates remained below target levels, influenza vaccination was made a condition of employment for all employees in 2008. Medical or religious exemptions could be requested. Predetermined medicalcontraindications include hypersensitivity to eggs, prior hypersensitivity reaction to influenza vaccine, and history of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome. Medical exemption requests were reviewed by occupational health nurses and their medical directors. Employees who were neither vaccinated nor exempted by 15 December 2008 were not scheduledfor work. Employees still not vaccinated or exempt by 15 January 2009 were terminated. Results. Overall, 25,561 (98.4%) of 25,980 active employees were vaccinated. Ninety employees (0.3%) received religious exemptions, and 321 (1.2%) received medical exemptions. Eight employees (0.03%) were not vaccinatedor exempted. Reasons for medical exemption included allergy to eggs (107 [33%]), prior allergic reaction or allergy to other vaccine component (83 [26%]), history of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome (15 [5%]), and other (116 [36%]), including 14 because of pregnancy. Many requests reflected misinformation about the vaccine. Conclusions. A mandatory influenza vaccination campaign successfully increased vaccination rates. Fewer employees sought medical or religious exemptions than had signed declination statements during the previous year. A standardized medical exemption request form would simplify the request and review process for employees,their physicians, and occupational health and will be used next year. Influenza infection is associated with 36,000 excess deaths and 1200,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually [1, 2]. It is the leading cause of vaccine- preventable death in the United States every year [3]. The risk of complications associated with influenza ishigher among older persons, young children, and pa-tients with underlying medical conditions [2, 4]. In- fected people may shed virus before symptoms develop [5-8], and health care workers often work while sick.Outbreaks of influenza in hospitals have been well de-scribed [3, 4, 9-12].

In nursing home settings, vaccination of health care workers hasbeen shown to decrease morbidity and mortality among nursing home residents [16-18]. The impact of vac- cination of workers in acute care settings is more dif- cult to study because of the short duration of most hospitalizations. Other evidence for the importance ofherd immunity on influenza rates comes from a Jap-anese study in which the vaccination of school childrenagainst influenza resulted in decreased mortality asso- ciated with pneumonia or influenza in the general pop- ulation [19]. Annual influenza vaccination was rst recommended for health care workers by the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices in 1984 [3, 20, 21]. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology [22], the Association for Professionals in Infection Control [11], and the Infec-tious Disease Society of America [23] also strongly en-dorse health care worker vaccination. The US NationalHealth objectives for 2010 include a health care worker influenza vaccination rate of 60%. Recommended prac-/g3 25460CID 2010:50 (15 February) Babcock et altices to improve vaccination rates include making the vaccine available without charge to employees at multiple convenientsites and times, using incentives and rewards, and having visibleleadership support [21, 24-27]. More recently, declinationstatements have been suggested as a way to increase vaccinationrates. The impact of these statements is still being studied [28-30]. Despite these efforts, vaccination rates among health careworkers remain low across the United States; the influenzavaccination rate among US health care workers during 2006-2007 was 44.4% [3]. Mandatory vaccination is a controversial strategy that pits health care worker autonomy against patient safety [31-36].Other vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella vaccineand varicella vaccine, are already required by many health carefacilities, as is annual tuberculin skin testing. Virginia MasonHospital (Seattle, W A) implemented a mandatory influenza vac-cination program in 2004, and there have been media reportsof other individual hospitals instituting similar programs. Thereare no reports in the literature of large multihospital systems implementing a mandatory influenza vaccination policy. Annual influenza campaigns at BJC HealthCare include free vaccine available at multiple sites and times, extensive publicity,incentives and educational programs, and more recently, dec-lination statements. In 2007, influenza vaccination rates wereadded to the BJC patient safety and quality scorecard used at all hospitals in the organization. Hospital leaders receive in- centives based on their hospital's performance on scorecardmeasures. Despite signicant efforts by occupational health andinfection prevention specialists, the vaccination rate among BJCemployees remained below the BJC goal of 80%. In 2008, BJC HealthCare implemented a mandatory influenza vaccination policy for all employees. METHODS Setting. BJC HealthCare is a large Midwestern health care organization with 26,000 employees. Facilities include 11 acute care hospitals and 3 extended care facilities, as well asday care centers, employed physician groups, occupationalmedicine, home care, and behavioral health services. Hospitalsare located in urban, suburban, and rural settings and rangefrom 40 to 1250 beds. Of the acute care hospitals, 1 adult and 1 pediatric facility are teaching hospitals. BJC Occupational Health Services coordinates and stan- dardizes occupational health programs through the Council of Occupational Health Professionals, which includes a represen- tative from each facility. Bimonthly council meetings are de-signed for education, policy, and procedure standardization,coordination of occupational health and safety surveillance, and development of interventions throughout BJC. Each facility uses the centralized BJC occupational health database for track-ing employee vaccinations, immune status, and occupationalinjuries and exposures. The database includes demographic and job information on all BJC employees. 2008 Influenza policy. In 2008, as a patient safety initiative, influenza vaccination was made a condition of employment forall BJC employees, regardless of job function, including clinicaland nonclinical staff, contracted clinical personnel, and vol-unteers. Hospital-employed physicians, including hospitalists,residents, and fellows, were included in the policy. Most at-tending physicians afliated with BJC HealthCare are in privatepractice or are employed by Washington University School ofMedicine (St. Louis, MO) and are not covered by the policy. The policy was communicated to employees through their managers, with standardized educational materials and factsheets provided; an Intranet site; letters mailed to employees'homes; BJC T oday, in-house newspaper at all facilities; and \"T own Hall Meetings\" scheduled throughout the vaccination campaign with infectious diseases physicians, infection prevention specialists, and occupational health nurses available for questions or concerns. The CEO of BJC published a letter in the BJC newspaper explaining therationale for the policy. The multidisciplinary implementation team met regularly before and during the vaccination campaign to ensure timely, consistent, and coordinated communication and responses to any issues that arose. Free vaccine, including thimerosal-free and intranasal prep- arations, was available at multiple locations at all facilities start- ing 15 October 2008. V accinations were tracked at each facility in real time. Multiple methods of tracking vaccination were avail- able to each facility, including badge scanners, consent forms with carbon copies, a database into which managers could di-rectly enter their vaccinated employees, and preprinted labelswith bar codes. All data were entered in real time or were down-loaded regularly into the BJC occupational health database. Feed- back was provided not less than weekly to managers at the fa- cilities. Managers interacted with their staff to ascertain reasonsfor noncompliance and to provide coaching about influenza, thevaccine, and the consequences of noncompliance. Employees who were neither vaccinated nor exempted by 15 December 2008 were suspended without pay. Those who were vaccinated before 15 January 2009 could return to work. Em-ployees still not vaccinated or exempt by 15 January 2009 wereterminated for failure to meet their conditions of employment. Exemptions. Medical or religious exemptions could be re- quested. Religious accommodations required a letter from the employee to Human Resources that stated a religious convic-tion opposed to vaccination. Employees were notied within5 days whether their request had been granted. Medical exemptions required a letter from a licensed phy- sician (MD or DO) that stated a medical contraindication toinfluenza vaccination. Predetermined accepted medical contra-indications were based on the Advisory Committee on Im-/g3 26Mandatory Influenza Vaccination CID 2010:50 (15 February) 461Table 1.

These included hy- persensitivity to eggs, prior hypersensitivity reaction to influ-enza vaccine, and history of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome. Preg- nancy was accepted as a medical exemption if requested by theemployee's physician, despite the vaccine being recommended during pregnancy, because the vaccine is listed as a category C agent. Occupational health nurses reviewed other reasons on acase-by-case basis with assistance from their medical directoras needed. Employees received a form within 5 days that statedwhether their request had been granted. Denials included anexplanation of the reason for denial on the form. Second re-quests with clarications could be submitted for review. Some physicians who had written exemption request letters were con- tacted directly by the facility occupational health medical di-rector for clarication or at the request of the employee.Granted medical exemptions could be permanent or temporary(1 year only). Concerned employees not meeting criteria forexemption could discuss their concerns with the occupationalhealth nurses or medical directors. Employees who were granted an exemption were encouraged to wear an isolation mask while providing patient care during the influenza seasonto avoid contracting or transmitting influenza. No specic en-forcement was put in place, and no data on compliance werecollected. RESULTS Of 25,980 active employees, 25,561 (98.4%) were vaccinated (T able 1). Medical exemptions were granted to 321 employees (1.24%). Religious accommodations were granted to 90 em-ployees (0.35%). Overall, 25,974 employees (99.96%) were compliant with the policy (vaccinated or exempt). Only 8 em-ployees (0.03%) were terminated for noncompliance with thepolicy. At the 2 teaching hospitals, there were 907 residents andfellows in 127 graduate medical education programs. All of these trainees complied with the new policy: 902 (99.45%) werevaccinated, and 5 received exemptions (3 medical and 2 reli-gious). V accination rates in 2008 increased by 43.4%, comparedwith rates in 2006, and by 26.5%, compared with rates in 2007(Figure 1). Of 372 requested medical exemptions, 321 (86.3%) were granted (188 permanent and 133 temporary). Reasons for med- ical exemption included allergy to eggs (107 [33% of exemp- tions; 0.4% of all employees]), prior allergic reaction or allergy to other vaccine component (83 [26% of exemptions; 0.31%of employees]), 0.05% of employees]), and other (116 [36%]). The majority (89 [77%]) of employees with other indications for a medical exemption received a temporary exemption: 50 for aprior vaccine reaction that was not further specied, 25 formedical reasons not further specied by their physician, and14 for pregnancy. The remaining 27 (23%) of 116 employeeswith other indications were granted permanent exemptions: 15 for a prior severe reaction to an influenza vaccine, 5 for aneurologic condition, 3 for concerns of triggering a flare of anautoimmune disease, 2 for being vegan, 1 for multiple food sensitivities, and 1 for concern for increased risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. Eight employees (0.03%) were not vaccinated or granted an exemption, and their employment was terminated. T wo em-ployees worked with information systems in the corporate of-ces of BJC HealthCare. The other 6 noncompliant employees were from 4 acute care hospitals: 1 laboratory technician, 1 patient care technician, 1 paramedic, 1 nurse, 1 sitter, and 1physical therapist. The remaining hospitals and service orga-nizations had no noncompliant employees. T wo employeeswere per diem employees, 3 were part-time, and 3 were full- time employees. The median duration of employment before termination was 37.5 months (range, 23- 134 months). Of theseemployees, most did not submit an exemption request. Oneemployee submitted a request for a religious exemption 2 daysbefore termination, after being unable to obtain a doctor's notestating a medical contraindication; the request was denied. Adverse events reported by employees were tracked in the occupational health database. T wenty-one employees (0.08%)reported a possible adverse reaction. Eleven reported a sorearm. Five reported a possible allergic reaction, and 1 reporteda possible vagal response with fainting. Four events of uncertainrelation to the vaccine were also reported by employees, in-cluding 2 cases of fever and myalgias, 1 with upper respiratory symptoms, and 1 case of a new neurologic syndrome diagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, whichcould not be objectively linked to the influenza vaccine becauseof several other potential antecedent triggers. DISCUSSION The mandatory vaccination program successfully increased vac- cination rates at a large multihospital health care organization.Efforts during previous years included most recommended 27462CID 2010:50 (15 February) Babcock et al Figure 1. BJC HealthCare annual influenza vaccination rates (percentage of total employees). The National Health Interview Survey rates of influenza vaccination among health care workers during 1997-2006 are shown with the trend line. practices to maximize vaccination rates, including free, easily available vaccine, incentives, and leadership support. Despitethese efforts, rates were still suboptimal (Figure 1). The man-datory program markedly increased vaccination rates across allfacilities. Key factors that supported the success of the programincluded consistent communication emphasizing patient safety and quality of care, coordinated campaigns, leadership support, and medical director support to talk with any employee withconcerns about the vaccine, on request. The program was es-tablished as a patient safety initiative; thus, no prospective at-tempts were made to link to absenteeism. Because of the way that employees are reimbursed for time off work, we were unable to distinguish between sick time and vacation time and,thus, could not assess the impact of the program on absentee-ism. In addition, the year that the program was implementedhad a mild influenza season; therefore, nding reduced absen-teeism would be difcult to link to the vaccination program. Few other organizations have established mandatory influ- enza vaccination programs. Virginia Mason Hospital imple-mented a mandatory program in 2004, with resulting vacci- nation rates of 198%. Several smaller hospitals were mentioned in the media for attempting mandatory campaigns, but nodetails have been published. T o our knowledge, this is the rst report of a large multihospital health care organization imple- menting a mandatory influenza vaccination program. Some programs allow health care workers to sign declination forms stating that they understand the risks of not receivingthe influenza vaccine to themselves, their patients, and theirfamilies. Declination statements have recently been publicized as a potentially valuable strategy for increasing vaccination rates [11, 21, 22], but data on their efcacy are mixed [28-30]. W efound that many fewer employees sought medical or religiousexemptions than had signed declination statements in previous years. Requests for religious exemptions were reviewed by Hu-man Resources at each facility. The letter from the employeehad to state a sincere religious conviction opposed to vaccination.Some requests were only submitted after medical exemption re-quests had been denied, and some requests stated opposition toa mandatory policy, not to vaccination itself. These requests weredenied. Severe egg allergy is a contraindication to receipt of the in- fluenza vaccine [3]. Virginia Mason Hospital provides free, on- site egg allergy testing for employees seeking an exemption on the basis of egg allergy. Our organization did not attempt toverify reports of signicant egg allergy or allergy to other vac-cine components. Egg allergy rates decrease with age, and re-ported rates in the medical literature range from 0% to 0.35%[37-39]. Overall, 107 (0.4%) of all employees reported a sig- nicant egg allergy. Exemption requests often reflected misinformation about the vaccine and about influenza among employees and among theirphysicians. Several requests cited chemotherapy or an immu-nosuppressed state as reasons not to get the vaccine, even thoughthese groups are at high risk for complications from influenza and are specically recommended to be vaccinated. Several re- quests cited pregnancy, although the vaccine is recommendedduring pregnancy [3, 40]. Other requests did not include enoughinformation to make a determination of the validity of the re-quest. Some health care workers whose initial request for ex-emption was denied returned to their personal physician for a more detailed note or requested that occupational health contact their physician to discuss their request. Some community phy-sicians felt beleaguered by these multiple contacts. A standardizedform listing accepted contraindications and their denitions, with/g3 28Mandatory Influenza Vaccination CID 2010:50 (15 February) 463checkboxes and space for additional information and contact information, would simplify the request and review process forhealth care workers, their physicians, and occupational healthstaff. BJC HealthCare benetted from strong leadership support for this initiative and a solid infrastructure for timely and con- sistent communication. The experience at our organization maynot be completely generalizable. Economic factors at the timeof the study may have limited the number of employees willingto lose their jobs. Influenza vaccination rates increased in 2007(Figure 1) and may have continued to increase even withouta mandatory vaccination policy, although we believe that such a dramatic increase would have been unlikely. Not all physicians afliated with BJC HealthCare are employees of the organi-zation and, thus, were not covered by the policy. All physiciansemployed by the organization, however, including 900 resi- dents and fellows, complied with the policy. In conclusion, amandatory influenza vaccination policy was successful in in-creasing vaccination rates at a large multihospital health care organization with 26,000 employees.

Source: www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mdcode/ 35 [YOU R INSTITUTION'S NA ME] Policy for Influenza Immunization o f Health Car e Work ers Influenza is a serious infection that causes an average of 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year. 1 Health care workers* are at high risk for acquiring influenza infection because of their exposure to ill patients, as well as their exposure in the community. Health care workers infected with influenza can spread the virus to patients in their care.2-4 In fact, research suggests that health care workers can be a key source of institutional outbreaks, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality among vulnerable patients. 1 Health care workers encounter patients throughout the influenza season in a variety of settings, including medical practices, general hospitals, specialty hospitals, pediatric hospitals,5,6 long-term care facilities,7 emergency departments,8 ambulatory care settings, rehabilitation facilities and home-care sites. Vaccination is the primary means of reducing transmission and preventing influenza infection, yet immunization rates among health care workers remain low. Only 36 percent of workers who have direct contact with patients are immunized annually, despite long-standing recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and other national health care organizations. 1,9,10 Greater emphasis needs to be placed on improving influenza immunization rates among health care workers to help ensure patient safety and protection\u2014especially for patients at increased risk of influenza-related complications. 7 Immunization also provides personal protection for health care workers and minimizes workforce absenteeism during the influenza season.11 TRANS MISSION Influenza is transmitted by direct and indirect contact and by droplet contact. There may be an airborne component to transmission as well. Therefore, the virus is easily spread from person to person via coughing, sneezing, and contact with contaminated items and surfaces. The virus can spread rapidly, especially in classrooms, households, offices, and medical settings. Individuals are generally infectious 1-4 days before the onset of symptoms; however, only around 50% of infected persons will develop classical symptoms of influenza, making exclusion of infected health care workers difficult. 1,12 Moreover, individuals remain infectious five or more days after symptoms appear. Studies show health care personnel are more likely than staff in other areas to work through or return to work sooner during illness, thus increasing the likelihood of transmitting the virus to patients.13 TEMPLATE POLICY STATEMENT 36INSTITUTIONAL INFLUENZA OU TBREAKS Institutional influenza outbreaks can have serious implications for both the patient and health care provider. These events can put patients at risk, result in or exacerbate existing staff shortages, curtail admissions, and increase health care costs. An outbreak in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the year 2000 included 19 infants, one of whom died. Only 15 percent of staff in the facility had been im munized against influenza. Although investigators could not pinpoint the source of the outbreak, a health care worker was the suspected source; since influenza-like-illness was not found in the mothers of these infants. 14 A 2001 report documented an outbreak that included four influenza cases among patients in a 12-bed, single-room transplant unit. Three of the four affected patients had no visitors between admission and influenza infection to account for the spread. Investigators concluded that health care workers were the likely source of transmission. 15 A very large outbreak in the early 1990s occurred in a nursing home in New York. Nineteen percent of residents developed influenza. A total of 34 individuals developed pneumonia; 19 were hospitalized, and two died. In this f acility, only 10 percent of health care workers were immunized. 16 While index cases are not always identifiable, health care workers can easily propagate an outbreak as they move from patient to patient. It is also clear that unvaccinated health care workers can be the index case for influenza in a facility, potentially posing a threat to high-risk patients and other workers. ECONO MIC IMPACT OF OU TBREAKS Influenza outbreaks are associated with substantial direct and indirect costs. An outbreak in an internal medicine ward of a French hospital in 1999, in which 41 percent of patients and 23 percent of staff were infected, resulted in 14 days of staff sick leave and suspension of all admissions to the ward, including eight that were previously scheduled. The total cost of the outbreak in this small ward was estimated at $34,000 (U.S. dollars). 17 Amantadine resistance was documented in a small pediatric NICU outbreak. Oseltamivir, an expensive alternative therapy, was used to halt the outbreak instead. In a bone marrow transplant unit, Oseltamivir was also used in place of prophylactic amantadine during an outbreak because concomitant use of immuno-suppressant therapy and amantadine has been shown to increase the incidence of patient falls, which could have had dire consequences in these patients.18 Ensuring the health and safety of health care workers has additional implications for patient safety and health care cost containment. Hiring replacement workers often means assuming additional costs beyond those associated with salary. Studies show that using pool staff in place of experienced unit staff increases the incidence of medical errors. On occasions when staff members work a double shift, it has been shown that attention decreases after 12 hours of work. 19 ROLE OF HEAL TH CA RE FAC ILITIES Health care facilities have an important role to play in maximizing influenza vaccination rates among health care workers. Every facility should develop and implement comprehensive influenza vaccination programs for employees. 8,9 37RECO MMENDATIONS [NAME OF INSTITUTION] recommends the following measures be implemented to increase influenza immunization rates among its health care workers and improve patient safety and personal health. x Health care workers should receive an annual influenza immunization to prevent spread of the virus to vulnerable patients. x Develop an influenza immunization program that is implemented annually, to o Educate health care workers about the importance of influenza immunization in health care settings and the low risk of adverse events associated with immunization; 20 o Increase vaccine demand among health care workers; o Reduce barriers to immunization of health care workers by developing programs that increase access to immunization and reduce the cost of the vaccine;21 and o Facilitate the influenza vaccination process, for example, through the use of standing orders issued by the Occupational Health Program for influenza vaccination of health care workers. x Monitor annual immunization rates of employees and provide feedback through the infection control and patient safety programs. x Monitor and track influenza rates among health care workers and compare those figures to this group's immunization rates. Providing this information may stimulate health care workers to seek vaccination. x Work with public health officials to track community incidence of influenza, using data from emergency rooms, physicians' offices, and clinics. As the incidence increases, infection control and hospital administration should work together to identify pending admissions of potential influenza cases and to establish parameters for visitor restrictions. 38Refe rences 1.

Seasonal influenza (flu) is a contagious viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs that usually occurs in the fall and winter months and can cause severe illness. In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza activity generally occurs during December - March, but activity can occur as early as October and as late as May occasionally, but usually in limited areas. Influenza is thought to be spread from person to person, primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Influenza may lead to hospitalization or even death, especially among the elderly. On average, each year between 5 percent and 20 percent of the population contract influenza, more than 200,000 are hospitalized, and 36,000 die from seasonal influenza-related complications annually. This flu season could be worse. There is a new and very different flu virus spreading worldwide among people called novel H1N1 flu . This virus may cause more illness or more severe illness than usual. Vaccines are the best tool we have to prevent influenza; however, the seasonal flu vaccine is unlikely to provide protection against novel H1N1 influenza. However a novel H1N1 vaccine is currently in production and may be ready for the public in the fall. The novel H1N1 vaccine is not intended to replace the seasonal flu vaccine - it is intended to be used along-side seasonal flu vaccine. Who should get seasonal influenza vaccine? Summary of seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations for adults Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for any adult who wants to reduce the risk for becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting it to others. Vaccination also is recommended for all adults in the following groups, because these persons are either at high risk for influenza complications, or are close contacts of persons at high risk: Persons 50 years of age or older; Women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; Persons who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); Persons who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus); Persons who have any condition (e.g., cognitivie dysfuncti on, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration; Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities; Health care personnel; Household contacts and caregivers of children younger than 5 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children younger than 6 months of age; and, Household contacts and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from influenza. Symptoms Typical seasonal influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, chills, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat, and muscle and joint pain. Unlike other common respiratory infections that are often called \"the flu,\" influenza can cause more sever e illness that can result in complications leading to hospitalization and death. However, persons with mild symptoms such as cough and mild fever can also have an infection with influenza virus, and symptoms can be similar to those caused by other respirat ory viruses. Persons with mild symptoms can still transmit influenza virus to others, including to persons at risk for more se vere influenza virus infections. Prevention Getting a seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to prevent influenza. The time to vaccinate is as soon as vaccine is available and throughout the influenza season. Because the flu vaccine is updated every year to keep up with changes in circulating flu viruses and because immunity to influenza viruses declines within a year after vaccination, it is important to get vaccinated against influenza every year. 45Facts About Seasonal Influenza for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003 Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Summary of seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations for children and adolescents aged 6 months - 18 years Vaccination of all children aged 6 months - 18 years is recommended for the 2009-10 influenza season. Children and adolescents at high risk for influenza complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routinely vaccinating all children and adolescents. Children and adolescents at higher risk for influenza complications are those: Aged 6 months up to their 5 th birthday Who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); Who are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) Who have any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration; Who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, who therefore, might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; Who are residents of chronic-care facilities; and, Who will be pregnant during the influenza season. Children and adolescents who are household contacts of any of the high risk groups above are also recommended for annual vaccination. Note: Children younger than 6 months of age are the pediatric group at highest risk of seasonal influenza complications, yet they are too young to receive the influenza vaccine. The best way to protect these children is to vaccinate their close contacts, including siblings and out of home care givers, against seasonal influenza. Vaccine Safety Two different types of seasonal influenza vaccine are available. Injected vaccine The injected influenza vaccine can be given to persons 6 months of age and older. It is usually given as a shot in the upper arm or in the thigh. There may be some mild soreness, redne ss or swelling at the injection site wh ich may last 1 to 2 days. Other possible mild side effects include a headache and low-grade fever for a day after vaccination. Intranasal vaccine The intranasal vaccine can be given to healthy persons 2 to 49 years of age, but should not be given to persons with chronic medical conditions. In addition, it should not be given to pregnant women or to persons who are in close contact with severely immune-suppressed persons. There may be a runny nose, headache, low-grade fever, sore throat, fatigue or cough after vaccination 46Facts About Seasonal Influenza for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003 Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Two different types of seasonal influenza vaccine are availabl e: injectable in activated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live attenuated influenza vacci ne (LAIV) administered as a nasal spray. TIV is recommended for use by people 6 months of age of age and older with or without chronic medical conditions. LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 to 49 years of age. Recommendations for the use of both vaccines are posted on the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm. FACT: Influenza can be prevented with safe, effective vaccines . FACT: To protect infants younger than 6 months of age from influenza and its complications, adults, other household members, and out-of-home caregivers of these children should be vaccinated. FACT: Each year, on average, 36,000 people in the United States die from seasonal influenza complications, including an average of about 100 deaths each year in children younger than 5 years of age. Greater than 90% of deaths occur in persons 65 years of age and older. FACT: During the 1990's, an average of more than 200,000 people were hospitalized each year for influenza-related complications. FACT: Total direct hospitalization costs of a severe influenza epidemic are estimated to be over $3 billion. FACT: Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is paid for by Medicare Part B. FACT: Because influenza viruses can change from year to year and because protection from the vaccine does not last more than one year, annual influenza vaccination is necessary. FACT: Influenza vaccine does not protect against respiratory infections caused by viruses other than influenza. Many respiratory illnesses are often called \"the flu\", but only some of these illnesses are actually caused by the influenza virus. FACT: Influenza can worsen chronic heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, and can lead to bacterial or viral pneumonia. FACT: In most influenza seasons, 5-20% of the U.S. pop ulation will be infected with seasonal influenza virus. These infections typically cause the infected person to miss work or school, or be ill while on vacation. FACT: Anyone who wants to avoid becoming ill with influenza or transmitting it to others should get vaccinated. FACT: Most persons who are recommended for vaccination do not get vaccinated. 47COM 10320 Fluzone\u00ae Intradermal (Influenza Virus Vaccine) Facts at a Glance About Fluzone Intradermal Vaccine Fluzone Intraderm al vaccine is the first in fluenz a vaccine licensed in the United St ates th at uses a new microinjection s ystem for intr aderm al deli is indic ated for active immuniz ation o f persons 18 throu gh 64 years o f age against in fluenz a dise ase c aused b y influenz a virus subt ypes A and t ype B cont ained in vaccine.1 The microinjection s ystem uses an ultr a-thin needle o f 0.0 6 inches (1.5 mm ) in len gth, or less th an one- tenth the len gth o f the st andard needles used for the tr adition al intr amuscul ar route o f administr ation.1 Fluzone Intraderm is supplied as preser vative-free, pre filled s licensed a microinjection s ystem in fluenz a vaccine m arketed as Intanza or ID flu\u00ae in more th an 40 countries includin g Austr alia, Canada, and vaccin ation deli vers the vaccine into the derm al layer o f the skin.

See www.immunize.or Visite www.immunize.or LAIV? 3 Infl uenza (\"flu\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the influenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get influenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: fever/chills sore throat muscle aches fatigue cough headache runny or stuffy nose Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for influenza. Young children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from influenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting flu vaccine you can protect yourself from influenza and may also avoid spreading influenza to others. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine - LAIV (nasal spray)2 attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains live but attenuated (weakened) influenza virus. It is sprayed into the nostrils. 2.Inactivated (killed) influenza vaccine, the \"flu shot,\" is given by injection with a needle. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. Influenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including flu viruses not contained in the vaccine. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the vaccination. Protection lasts about a year. LAIV does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives. LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 through 49 years of age , who are not pregnant and do not have certain health conditions (see #4, below). Some people should not receive LAIV4 LAIV is not recommended for everyone. The following people should get the inactivated vaccine (flu shot) instead: Adults 50 years of age and older or children from 6 through 23 months of age . (Children younger than 6 months should not get either infl uenza vaccine.) Children younger than 5 years with asthma or one or more episodes of wheezing within the past year. Pregnant women. People who have long-term health problems with: - heart disease - kidney or liver disease - lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes - asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. Anyone with a weakened immune system. Anyone in close contact with someone whose immune system is so weak they require care in a protected environment (such as a bone marrow transplant unit). Close contacts of other people with a weakened immune system (such as those with HIV) may receive LAIV . Healthcare personnel in neonatal intensive care units or oncology clinics may receive LAIV . Children or adolescents on long-term aspirin treatment. Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to influenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of infl uenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. 50Tell your doctor if you have gotten any other vaccines in the past 4 weeks. Anyone with a nasal condition serious enough to make breathing difcult, such as a very stuffy nose, should get the flu shot instead. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. When should I receive infl uenza vaccine? 5 Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur any time, but most influenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be benecial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of infl uenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. What are the risks from LAIV? 6 A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Live influenza vaccine viruses very rarely spread from person to person. Even if they do, they are not likely to cause illness. LAIV is made from weakened virus and does not cause influenza. The vaccine can cause mild symptoms in people who get it (see below). Mild problems: Some children and adolescents 2-17 years of age have reported: runny nose, nasal congestion or cough fever headache and muscle aches wheezing abdominal pain or occasional vomiting or diarrhea Some adults 18-49 years of age have reported: runny nose or nasal congestion sore throat cough, chills, tiredness/weakness headache Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. If rare reactions occur with any product, they may not be identied until thousands, or millions, of people have used it. Millions of doses of LAIV have been distributed since it was licensed, and the vaccine has not been associated with any serious problems. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html and www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/Activities_Index.html What if there is a seve re reaction?7 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Protection lasts about a year. Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains a preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal-free influenza vaccine is available. Ask your doctor for more information. Who should get inactivated influenza vaccine and w hen? 3 WHO All people 6 months of age and older should get flu vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of severe influenza and their close contacts, including healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months. WHEN Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur at any time, but most infl uenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be benecial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of influenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. Some people should not get inactivated influenza vaccine or should wait 4 Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to influenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of infl uenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 525Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. What are the risks from inactivated infl uenza vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from inactivated influenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. Mild problems: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough fever aches headache itching fatigue If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Moderate problems: Young children who get inactivated flu vaccine and pneu- mococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time appear to be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information. Tell your doctor if a child who is getting flu vaccine has ever had a seizure. Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated infl uenza (swine flu) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current flu vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. One brand of inactivated flu vaccine, called Afluria, should not be given to children 8 years of age or younger, except in special circumstances. A related vaccine was associated with fevers and fever-related seizures in young children in Australia. Your doctor can give you more information. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html and www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/Activities_Index.html What if there is a seve re6reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B viru s (HBV). The virus can affect people of all ages. Once inf ected, some people are never able to rid themselves of the virus. This long-term or \"chronic\" HBV infection can lead to liver cirrhosi s, liver cancer and death. The virus is found in the blood and body fl uids of infected people and is most often spread among adult s through sexual contact or by sharing needles and other drug paraphernalia with an infected person. HBV can also be spread through normal household contact with HBV-infected persons, or by passage of the virus from an HBV-infected mother to her infant during birth. Symptoms Hepatitis B can often be a \"silent disease\" that affects people without making them feel sick; this is more common among childr en. People who do get sick from hepatitis B might experience loss of appetite, tiredness, stomachache, nausea and vomiting. They might also experience yellowing of the white s of the eyes (jaundice) and/or joint pain. People with chronic HBV infection usual ly do not feel sick for many years, but will have symptoms if they develop the most serious complications from hepatitis B, like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Treatment There is no specific treatment fo r newly acquired HBV infection. Medicines are available to treat people with chronic hepatitis B. These medicines work for some peopl e, but not for all. Prevention Safe, effective hepatitis B vaccines are av ailable. The vaccines are used to protect everyone from newborn babies to older adul ts. The vaccination series is usually given as three doses over a six-month period. However, more flexible schedules can be used. Hepatitis B vaccine is recognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent liver cancer caused by chronic HBV infection. Who should get hepatitis B vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 All children and adolescents from birth through 18 years of age. /.notdef.g0001 Persons at risk of sexual HBV transmission: men and women who have had more than one sex partner during the previous six months or who have had a recently acquired sexually transmitted disease (STD); men who have sex with men; and persons receiving treatment for STDs, and persons with HIV infection. /.notdef.g0001 Persons at risk of HBV transmission by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood: people whose jobs potentially expose them to human blood or blood-cont aminated body fluids, in cluding most healthcare workers and some public safety workers; injection drug users; and persons with end-stage kidney disease. /.notdef.g0001 People living with or having sexual contact wi th a person who has chronic HBV infection. /.notdef.g0001 Travelers who live or work for at least six months in areas where HBV infection is of high or intermediate endemicity, or who stay for shorter periods and will likely have contact with blood (e.g., in a medical setting) or sexual contact with local persons. /.notdef.g0001 Inmates of correctional facilities, including all inmates who receive a medical evaluation in federal and state prisons, jails, and juv enile correction facilities. /.notdef.g0001 Residents and staff of institutions a nd nonresidential daycare facilities for developmentally disabled persons. /.notdef.g0001 People with chronic liver disease including hepatitis C. /.notdef.g0001 All adults requesting protect ion from HBV infection.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 FACT: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. FACT: You cannot get hepatitis B from the hepatitis B vaccine. FACT: During the 1970s and 1980s, 200,000 to 300,000 persons were infected with HBV each year in the United States. FACT: Hepatitis B incidence has declined substantially since 1991 when a strategy to eliminate HBV transmission through immunization began to be implemented. The decline in incidence has been greatest among children and adolescents, who are recommended to be routinely vaccinated against hepatitis B. FACT: In 2007, rates of new cases of acute hepatitis B were highest among adults aged 30 - 44 years of age. FACT: More than 50% of new hepatitis B cases could be prevented if hepatitis B vaccination were routinely offered to all persons attending sexually transmitted disease clinics and to all correctional facility inmates. FACT : About 42% of adults who become infected with HBV have a risk factor for infection in 2007. FACT : Even if a person infected with HBV does not feel sick, he or she can still infect others. FACT : HBV infection can result in chronic (life-long) infection that increases a person's risk of developing chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. FACT : An estimated 800,000- 1.4 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. FACT : HBV infection kills about 2,000 to 4,000 people in the United States each year, usually as the result of complications from chronic liver disease. FACT : HBV is found in blood and other body fluids such as semen and vaginal secretions. The hepatitis B virus is 100 times more infectious than HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. FACT : Hepatitis B is a sexually-transmitted disease but can also be transmitted during normal household contact with an infected person. FACT : The hepatitis B vaccine is the first vaccine that prevents a form of cancer \u2014 liver cancer. FACT : Infants born to HBV-infected women have a very high chance of getting HBV infection from their mothers unless they receive their first hepatitis B vaccination at birth. Vaccine Safety Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. You cannot get hepatitis B from the vaccine. The most common side effect of the vaccine is soreness at the injection site. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with hepatitis B disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the hepatitis B vaccine. 62HEPATITIS B VACCINE W H AT Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Inform ation St atements are available in Sp anish and other l anguages. See www.immunize.or g/vis. 1What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious disease that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause: Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: loss of appetite diarrhea and vomiting tiredness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not haveacute illness. Chronic (long-term) infection . Some people go on to develop chronic HBV infection. This can be very serious, and often leads to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are infected can spread HBV to others, even if they don't appear sick. In 2005, about 51,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. About 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. Each year about 3,000 to 5,000 people die from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV . Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. A person can become infected by: - contact with a mother's blood and body fluids at the time of birth; - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that could have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes or razors; - having unprotected sex with an infected person; - sharing needles when injecting drugs; - being stuck with a used needle on the job. 2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of HBV infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. Routine hepatitis B vaccination of U.S. children began in 1991. Since then, the reported incidence of acute hepatitis B among children and adolescents has dropped by more than 95% - and by 75% in all age groups. Hepatitis B vaccine is made from a part of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots . This vaccine series gives long-term protection from HBV infection, possibly lifelong. 3Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and w hen? Children and Ado lescents All children should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and should have completed the vaccine series by 6-18 months of age. Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults All unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with HBV , - men who have sex with men, - people who inject street drugs, - people with more than one sex partner, - people with chronic liver or kidney disease, - people with jobs that expose them to human blood, - household contacts of people infected with HBV , - residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients, 63- people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. Anyone else who wants to be protected from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 4Who should NO T get hepatitis B vaccine? Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to baker's yeast , or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Y our provider can give you more information about these precautions. Pregnant women who need protection from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 5 Hepatitis B vaccine risks Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The following mild problems have been reported: Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). T emperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in theUnited States. 6What if there is a moderate or seve re reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarse- ness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 7The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Progra m In the event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine, a federal program has been created to help pay for the care of those who have been harmed. For details about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visit their website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . 8 How can I learn more? Ask your doctor or nurse.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Facts About Measles for Adults What is measles? Measles is a highly contagious virus found throughout the world. People get measles disease by breathing in the measles virus which is spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. You can get measles just by being in the same room with an infected person. Who should get MMR vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps-containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to these three diseases. /.notdef.g0001 College and university students, health care personnel, child care workers such as teachers and day care personnel and international travelers are at increased risk for measles, and should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine to ensure adequate protection. Vaccine Safety The measles vaccine and the combined MMR vaccine are very safe and effective and generally have few side effects. Mild reactions such as fever, redness or swelling at the injection si te have been reported. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with measles disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the measles vaccine. MMR vaccine should not be given to persons who are pregnant or severely immunosuppressed. Prevention There is a vaccine to protect against measles. The vaccine is frequently given as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vaccine that protects only against measles. Symptoms Symptoms of measles include high fever, rash, runny nose, watery eyes, coughing, diarrhea, and earache. The average time between exposure to the measles virus and the development of symptoms is usually from 10 to 14 days. 68National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Facts About Measles for Adults FACT: Measles can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. FACT: The risk of death from measles is higher for infants and adults than for children. FACT: Of the 140 confirmed cases of measles reported in 2008, approximately 25% occurred among adults. FACT: Pregnant women who get measles disease have an increased risk for early labor, miscarriage, and low birth weight infants. FACT: Measles is contagious from 4 days before until 4 days after the rash appears. FACT: Measles can cause life-threatening pneumonia and brain inflammation, middle-ear infection, severe diarrhea and sometimes death. FACT: Outbreaks of measles in 2008, primarily affected those who has not been vaccinated with MMR vaccine. FACT: Most cases of measles in the United States now result from infections acquired in other countries or are linked to such imported cases. FACT: Globally, an estimated 10 million cases of measles occur annually, resulting in an estimated 197,000 deaths, nearly all of these among children less than five years old. 69National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

People who have mumps may spread the infection to others, even when they do not have any symptoms or their illness is mild. Who should get MMR vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adults born in 1957 or later including non-pregnant women of childbearing age who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of MMR vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to these three diseases. /.notdef.g0001 College and university students, health care personnel, child care workers such as teachers and day care personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for mumps.

Prevention There is a vaccine to protect against mumps. The vaccine is given to adults as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vaccine that protects only against mumps. Symptoms The symptoms of mumps include a low grade fever and swelling or tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands in the cheeks and under the jaw. In postpubertal males, up to 30% may also experience testicular pain and swelling. Symptoms usually appear between 12 and 25 days after a person has been exposed to the virus. However, as many as 30-40% of the cases may be asymptomatic and nearly 50% are associated with non-specific or primarily respiratory symptoms, with or without parotitis Vaccine Safety The mumps vaccine and the combined MMR vaccine are safe and highly effective in preventing mumps. Occasionally, adults who get the mumps vaccine will develop a low-grade fever or swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks and neck. Other adverse events that are asso ciated with the measles and/or rubella component of MMR, including fever, rash and joint symptoms in adult women, may also infrequently occur. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with mumps disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the mumps vaccine. 70National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

FACT: Serious complications of mumps are more common among adults than among children. FACT: About 2-3 out of every 10 adolescent or adult men who have mumps may experience painful swelling of the testicles. Sterility rarely occurs. FACT: Rare complications caused by mumps include infection of the brain (encephalitis) and inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Other rare complications include arthritis, kidney and pancreas problems, deafness, and inflammation of the ovaries. FACT: In 2006, a multistate outbreak of mumps occurred in the United States that affected more than 6,000 people. The majority of the cases occurred among collage age persons, but adolescents and adults were also affected. FACT: In 2008, of the 386 reported cases of mumps, 54% were between 15 and 59 years old. 71 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Facts About Rubella for Adults What is rubella? Rubella, also called German measles, is caused by a virus that is spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Rubella is also spread by direct contact with the nasal or throat secretions of an infected person. If a pregnant woman gets rubella during pregnancy, particularly during the first 3 months, her baby is at risk of having serious birth defects. Who should get MMR vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adults born in 1957 or later including non-pregnant women of childbearing age who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps- containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to these three diseases. /.notdef.g0001 College and university students, health care personnel, child care workers such as teachers and day care personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for rubella and these persons should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity, regardless of age, in order to ensure adequate protection. Prevention There is a safe and effective vaccine to protect against rubella. The vaccine is usually given to adults as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vaccine that protects against rubella only. Symptoms Symptoms of rubella may include a rash, slight fever, aching joints, and reddened eyes. The rash first appears on the face and spreads from head to toe. The lymph nodes just behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell, causing soreness and pain. Many people with rubella have few or no symptoms, and up to half of the people who have the disease may not get a rash. In most cases of rubella, symptoms appear within 16 to 18 days after exposure. Vaccine Safety The rubella vaccine and the combined MMR vaccine are very safe. The most common side effect is burning or stinging at the injection site. Other common side effects include fever, rash, headache and general weakness. Another adverse event that are associated with the rubella component of MM R vaccine is joint symptoms in adult women. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with rubella are much greater than the potential risks associated with the rubella vaccine. 72 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

FACT: Rubella is contagious from 7 days before until 5 to 7 days after the rash appears. FACT: In most cases of rubella, symptoms appear within 12 to 23 days, and 20% to 50% of cases may not exhibit symptoms. FACT: If a pregnant woman gets rubella during the first 3 months of pregnancy, her baby has a good chance of having serious birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, liver and spleen damage, and mental retardation FACT: During 2001-2008, 79% of all reported cases of rubella occurred among people 15 years of age and older. FACT: As many as 7 million women of childbearing age are susceptible to rubella. FACT: Up to 7 % of young adults are susceptible to the rubella virus. 73MEASLES , MUMPS & RUBELLA (MMR) VACCINES W H AT Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Inform ation St atements are available in Sp anish and other l anguages. See www.immunize.or g/vis. Why get rubella are serious diseases. Measles Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death. Mumps Mumps virus causes fever, headache, and swollen glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, rarely, death. Rubella (German Measles) Rubella virus causes rash, mild fever, and arthritis (mostly in women). If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. Y ou or your child could catch these diseases by being around someone who has them. They spread from per-son to person through the air. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent these diseases. Most children who get their MMR shots will not get these diseases. Many more children would get them if we stopped vaccinating. Who should get MMR vaccine and w hen? 2 - Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: The first at 12-15 months of age - and the second at 4-6 years of age . These are the recommended ages. But children can get the second dose at any age, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have had either the vaccines or the diseases. Ask your provider for more information. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. 3Some people should no t get MMR vaccine or should wait People should not get MMR vaccine who have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or to a previous dose of MMR vaccine. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get MMR vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after getting MMR vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get MMR vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer. - Has any kind of cancer - Is taking cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder) People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get MMR vaccine Ask your provider for more information. 744What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing seri- ous problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting any of these three diseases. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any problems with it. Mild Problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare) If these problems occur, it is usually within 7-12 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) T emporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) T emporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child gets MMR vaccine. But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. These include: - Deafness - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness - Permanent brain damage Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and feverin about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reportedmore often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or seve re reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is spread easily through the air by infected people when they sneeze or cough. The disease also spreads through contact with an infected person's chickenpox blisters. Because chickenpox is very contagious, it is possible for people who have never had chickenpox nor been vaccinated against it to become infected just by being in a room with someone who has the disease. However, transient exposure is not likely to result in infection. Symptoms of chickenpox Early symptoms may include body aches, fever, fatigue, and irritability. A rash then appears and develops into as many as 250-500 itchy blisters over the entire body, that usually last for 5-7 days and heal with scabs. The rash may even spread into the mouth or other internal parts of the body. The illness is usually not severe, but the risk of hospitalization and death is increased among adolescents and adults. Symptoms appear between 10 and 21 days after exposure to the varicella-zoster virus. Persons who were vaccinated against chickenpox may sometimes develop chickenpox disease but the presentation is usually mild, with approximately 50 or fewer red bumps that rarely evolve to blisters. What is shingles? Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a common illness that strikes about 1 million Americans each year, about half of whom are 60 years of age and older. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. When people are first infected with the varicella-zoster virus, usually as children, they get chickenpox. Years or decades later, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk of shingles. Shingles is associated with normal aging and with anything that weakens the immune system such as certain medications, cancers, or infections, but it can also occur in healthy children and younger persons. Symptoms of shingles A painful, blistering rash tends to occur on one side of the body, usually on the trunk or face. There may be pain, numbness or tingling of the area 2 to 4 days before the rash appears. Pain or numbness usually resolves within weeks, but it can sometimes persist for much longer. Damage can occur to the eyes or other organs if they are involved. One of the most serious long-term consequences of shingles is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a condition where pain persists after the rash has resolved. PHN pain can be very difficult to treat and it can diminish quality of life and functioning to a degree comparable to congestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabetes and major depression. Prevention Chickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. Children who have never had chickenpox should get two doses of chickenpox vaccine, with the 1st dose administered at 12 - 15 months of age and the 2 nd at 4-6 years of age. Two doses, administered 4-8 weeks apart, are also recommended for people 13 years of age or older. There is a safe and effective vaccine to prevent shingles. It prevents shingles in 50 percent of those vaccinated and reduces the incidence of PHN by 66 percent. Although people who are vaccinated may still get shingles, they are likely to experience a milder case than un-vaccinated persons.

The chickenpox vaccine is recommended for all susceptible children and adults who do not have contraindications for vaccination. A second dose catch-up varicella vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults who previously had received only one dose. Persons belonging to the following groups who have not received the vaccine and have not already had chickenpox should receive special consideration because they are at a higher risk for exposure/transmission: /.notdef.g0001 Healthcare workers. /.notdef.g0001 College students. /.notdef.g0001 Household contacts of immunocompromised persons. /.notdef.g0001 Residents and sta ff in institutional settings. /.notdef.g0001 Inmates and staff of correctional institutions /.notdef.g0001 Military personnel. /.notdef.g0001 Nonpregnant women of childbearing age. /.notdef.g0001 Teachers and day care workers. /.notdef.g0001 Non-immune persons who have been exposed to chickenpox should receive varicella vaccine to prevent or diminish the severity of illness. The vaccine is most effective if given within 3 days (72 hours) to 5 days (120 hours) of the exposure. Vaccine is still recommended after 5 days of the exposure to prevent future disease if this current exposure does not result in disease. /.notdef.g0001 . international travelers Who should get shingles vaccine? The shingles vaccine is recommended for anyone 60 years of age and older to keep the varicella-zoster virus from re-activating and causing shingles. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 80 Facts About Chickenpox and Shingles for Adults FACT: Chickenpox (varicella) can be prevented with a vaccine. Sometimes vaccinated persons come down with chickenpox after vaccination but the illness is usually mild with < 50 lesions. FACT: Chickenpox is contagious from 1 to 2 days before the appearance of rash until all blisters have formed scabs or lesions fade away (if no blisters develop). FACT: Following exposure to an infectious person, it usually takes 10 to 21 days before the symptoms of chickenpox begin to appear. FACT: Adults are more likely than children to die from chickenpox and have serious complications resulting from varicella infection. Currently, less than 5% of adults are susceptible to infection with the chickenpox virus; younger adults are more likely to be susceptible. FACT: Immunocompromised people are more likely to have serious illness with complications as a result of chickenpox. The best way to prevent infection in such people is by immunizing their susceptible fa mily members and their othe r close contacts. However, some immunocompromised people are eligible for vaccination. FACT: If a pregnant woman gets varicella during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, her baby has a 1 in a 100 risk of having serious birth defects such as shortening and scarring of limbs, cataracts, small head size, abnormal development of the brain and mental retardation FACT: There are about 1 million cases of shingles diagnosed annually in the U.S. About half of cases are in those 60 years of age and older. FACT: Shingles, typically affects people over 50 years of age and those whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV infection, cancers, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. FACT: There is a safe, effective vaccine to prevent shingles; it is recommended for everyone 60 years of age and older. FACT: Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. FACT: Initial infection with varicella-zoster cause chickenpox but the virus can then remain silent in the body for decades. Reactivation of the virus causes shingles. FACT: Shingles causes a painful, blistering rash that usually appears on just one side of the body, most often on the torso or face. FACT: Pain and numbness may occur in the location of the rash two to four days before the rash appears. FACT: The chance of getting shingles increases with age. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. site: neuralgia (PHN), a long-lasting shingles pain syndrome, is the most common complication of shingles. FACT: PHN diminishes quality of life to a degree similar to congestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabetes and major depression. FACT: Antiviral medications can be used to treat shingles in its acute stage; however, these medications do not have an effect on whether PHN will persist afterward. FACT: Medications used to treat PHN pain are only modestly effective. FACT: There is a vaccine available that reduces th e risk of risk of shingles by 50% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 66%. FACT: The vaccine is recommended for people even if they've had shingles before because shingles can recur. The vaccine should also be given to people in the recommended age groups even if they cannot recall if they have ever had chickenpox. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Vaccine Safety Research has shown 1-dose chickenpox vaccine to be 70-90% effective in preventing disease and 95% effective in preventing severe disease. Two doses of vaccine were 99% effective in preventing disease in children in clinical trials. Varicella vaccine is also very safe. The most common side effects are mild and may include pain and redness at the injection site. A mild rash may develop. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with varicella disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the varicella vaccine. Research has shown shingles vaccine to be 51% effective in preventing shingles and 67% effective in preventing the painful condition of post-herpetic neuralgia, one of the most common complications of shingles. No specific safety concerns arose during the shingles vaccine trial. The most common side-effects following the shingles vaccine are redness, pain, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site and headache. 82CHICKENPOX VACCINE W H AT Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Inform ation St atements are available in Sp anish and anguages. www.immunize.or g/vis. 1Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. 2Who should get chickenpox vaccine and w hen? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-Up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your provider. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both chickenpox and MMR vac-cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should no t get chickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer - Has any kind of cancer - Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your provider for more information. Chickenpox 3/13/08 834What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild Problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe Problems Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reac- tions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or seve re reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form.

Only someone who has had chickenpox - or,rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine - canget shingles. The virus stays in your body,and can cause shingles many years later. You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a personwho has never had chickenpox (or chicken-pox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common. Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in youngerpeople. It is also more common in peoplewhose immune systems are weakenedbecause of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy. At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. 2Shingles vaccine vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. n clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the sk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce ain in people who still get shingles after eing vaccinated. single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended r adults 60 years of age and older. 3Some people should no t get shingles vaccine or should wait person should not get shingles vaccine ho: 85- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia orlymphoma. is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine. Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone witha moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before get- ting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3\u00b0 F or higher. 4What are the risks from shingles vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severeallergic reactions. However, the risk of avaccine causing serious harm, or death, isextremely small. No serious problems have been identi/g192ed with shingles vaccine. Mild Problems Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1person in 3). Headache (about 1 person in 70). Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severeproblems. 5What if there is a moderate or seve re reaction?

Tetanus, commonly called lockjaw, is caused by a bacterial toxin, or poison, that affects the nervous system. It is contracted through a cut or wound that becomes contaminated with tetanus bacteria. The bacteria can get in through even a tiny pinprick or scratch, but deep puncture wounds or cuts like those made by nails or knives are especially susceptible to infection with tetanus. Tetanus bacteria are present worldwide and are commonly found in soil, dust and manure. Tetanus causes severe muscle spasms, including \"locking\" of the jaw so the patient cannot open his/her mouth or swallow, and may lead to death by suffocation. Tetanus is not transmitted from person to person. Who should get Tdap or Td vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 All adults aged 19-64 years who have not already received Tdap and have not had a Td booster immunization in the last 10 years should receive a single dose of Tdap (rather than Td). Adults > 65 years who have not had a Td booster in the last 10 years should receive Td. /.notdef.g0001 Older adults and diabetics, who are at higher risk for tetanus, should carefully review of their history of tetanus immunization and receive Td or Tdap if they have not had a Td in the last 10 years. /.notdef.g0001 Adults who have never received immunization against tetanus should receive a three dose primary series. /.notdef.g0001 Adults who are health-care workers or who are in contact with infants <1 year of age should also receive Tdap vaccine if they have not had a Td in the past 2 years, in order to protect against pertussis (whooping cough). /.notdef.g0001 All adolescents and adults who deferred their regular booster during 2001-2002 b ecause of shortages of the vaccine - the supply problems have been resolved. /.notdef.g0001 Adolescents aged 11-18 years who have not already received Tdap or Td should receive a single dose of Tdap (rather than Td) to add protection against pertussis (whooping cough). /.notdef.g0001 Any adult or adolescent who has recovered from tetanus (lockjaw) disease should receive Tdap or Td. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008Prevention Vaccination is the only way to protect against tetanus. Due to widespread immunization, tetanus is now a rare disease in the U.S. A booster immunization against tetanus is recommended every 10 years. A new combination vaccine, called Tdap, protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and should be used for persons 11-64 years instead of Td (tetanus-diphtheria vaccine). Td should be used for adults 65 years and older. Adolescents and adults who have never received immunization against tetanus should start with a 3-dose primary series given over 7 to 12 months. Symptoms Common first signs of tetanus include muscular stiffness in the jaw (lockjaw) followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, rigidity of abdominal muscles, generalized spasms, sweating and fever. Symptoms usually begin 7 days after bacteria enter the body through a wound, but this incubation period may range from 3 days to 3 weeks. Vaccine Safety Tetanus vaccine and the combination Td and Tdap vaccines are very safe and effective. Most people have no problems with either. When side effects do occur, they usually include soreness and redness or swelling at the injection site. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with tetanus disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the tetanus vaccine. You cannot get tetanus from the vaccine. 90 Facts About Tetanus for Adults FACT: Tetanus can be prevented with safe and effective vaccines. FACT: You cannot get tetanus from the vaccine. FACT: Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by a type of bacteria found worldwide in soil, dust and manure. FACT: Tetanus is not transmitted from one person to another; vaccination provides protection of the vaccinated individual only. FACT: Almost all reported cases of tetanus occur in persons who either have never received the primary series of tetanus-preventing immunizations, or those who completed a primary series but have not had a booster vaccination in the past 10 years. FACT: Approximately 10-20% of reported cases of tetanus are fatal. FACT: In the U.S., where 50 or fewer cases of tetanus occur each year, deaths are more likely to occur in persons 60 years of age and older and in persons who are diabetic. FACT: People with tetanus may have to spend several weeks in the hospital under intensive care and frequently require ventilator support. FACT: For adults, a tetanus booster every 10 years ensures protection against tetanus. Tdap booster provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and Td provides protection against tetanus and diphtheria. FACT: Recovery from tetanus may not result in immunity. Patients recovering from tetanus should be immunized soon after their condition has stabilized.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 91 Facts About Diphtheria for Adults What is diphtheria? Diphtheria is an acute bacterial disease that usually affects the tonsils, throat, nose and/or skin. It is usually spread from person to person by breathing in droplets that contain diphtheria bacteria. These droplets are produced after an infected person has coughed, sneezed or even laughed. The disease can also be spread by contact with items such as drinking glasses and soiled tissues which are contaminated by discharges from an infected person. Diphtheria bacteria can cause a \"membrane' to form over the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Untreated diphtheria can occasionally result in heart failure, paralysis or death. Although no longer a common disease in the US, diphtheria remains a large problem in other countries and can pose a serious threat to those not fully immunized who travel to other countries or have contact with international travelers coming to the US. Who should get Td/Tdap vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 All persons who did not receive a primary series of immunization against tetanus and diphtheria during childhood. /.notdef.g0001 Persons who have not received a booster dose within the past 10 years. /.notdef.g0001 All adolescents and adults who deferred their regular booster during 2001-2002 b ecause of shortages of the vaccine - the supply problems have been resolved. /.notdef.g0001 Among adolescents aged 11-18 years and adults 19-64 years who have not already received Tdap (Td in combination with acellular pertussis antigens), a single dose of Tdap is preferred for the regular booster (rather than Td) to add protection against pertussis (whooping cough) . /.notdef.g0001 Adults who have recovered from diphtheria disease. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 Prevention There is a vaccine to prevent diphtheria. Most people receive their first doses as children in the form of a combined vaccine called DTwP (diphtheria-tetanus- whole-cell pertussis) or DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis). At age 11 -12, children also receive a booster dose of a combined vaccine called Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids )or Tdap (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis for adolescents and adults) For adults, a combination vaccine, called a Td booster, protects against both tetanus and diphtheria. It should be administered once every 10 years from the last dose of a diphtheria-containing vaccine to maintain immunity Adults 19-64 years should receive a single dose of Tdap to replace one Td booster. Symptoms In its early stages, diphtheria may be mistaken for a severe sore throat. Other symptoms include a low grade fever and enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) located in the neck. Another presentation of diphtheria can be skin lesions that may be painful, red and swollen. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 4 days after infection, with a range of 1 to 6 days. Untreated diphtheria patients may continue to carry diphtheria bacteria and can be contagious for up to 4 weeks. Some persons may also carry the diphtheria bacteria and spread the disease even though they themselves do not develop symptoms. Vaccine Safety The tetanus and diphtheria (Td) and tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines are very safe, and very few people experience any side effects. When side effects do occur, they are usually soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, and a slight fever. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. The potential risks associated with diphtheria are much greater than the potential risks associated with the diphtheria vaccine. You cannot get diphtheria from the vaccine. 92 Facts About Diphtheria for Adults FACT: Diphtheria can be prevented with safe and effective vaccines. FACT: You cannot get diphtheria from the vaccine. FACT: Diphtheria is transmitted to others through close contact with discharges from an infected person's nose, throat, eyes and/or skin lesions. FACT: Nearly one out of every 10 people who get diphtheria will die from it. FACT: Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, and sometimes heart failure, paralysis or death if untreated. FACT: Most cases of diphtheria occur among people who are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated. FACT: Contracting diphtheria is not always followed by lasting immunity, so even those persons who have recently recovered from the disease need to be immunized. FACT: A tetanus-diphtheria (Td) shot every 10 years gives protection against both tetanus and diphtheria. A tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) shot gives protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. FACT: Although no longer a common disease in the United States, diphtheria remains a large problem in other countries and can pose a serious threat to United States citizens who may not be fully immunized and who travel to other countries or have contact with immigrants or international travelers coming to the U.S. FACT: An epidemic of diphtheria in Eastern Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union resulted in over 160, 000 cases and over 4,000 deaths between 1990 and 2001.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 What is pertussis? Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a serious in fection that sp reads eas ily from person to person. The infect ion causes coughing spells so severe that it can be hard to b reathe, eat or sleep. C oughing can even lead to cracked r ibs, and is also complicated by pneumonia or hospitalization. Pertussis has been on the rise in the United States since an all-time low of just over 1,000 cases were reported in 1976. While 25,616 cases were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2005, the vast majority of cases go unreported and some estimates of true incidence range from one to three million cases annually. Symptoms Early symptoms of pertussis are similar to the common c old or bronchitis and may include runny nose, sneezing and low-grade fever. Spasms of coughing then become progressively worse, accompanied by vomiting or incontinence, Sometimes a \"whoop\" sound occurs while gasping for b reath at the end of a c oughing spell. Adults rarely have the classic \"whoop\", but the spasms of cough can last for weeks, even months. Prevention Whooping cough is most contagious before the coughing starts, so the most effective way to prevent it is through immunization. The whooping cough booster vaccine for adults (and adolescents) is called Tdap (tetanus-diphtheri a-acel lular pertussis). Children get a di fferent formula tion, called DTaP. Both protect against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Two Tdap vaccines are currently licensed for use in the U.S. One preparation can be used for both adults and adolescents, and the other has been approved for use only in adolescents: ADACEL (sanofi pasteur) for use in persons 11 to 64 y ears of age Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in persons 10 to 18 y ears of age Who should get the Tdap vaccine? The CDC recomme nds that adults 19 to 64 years of age (and adolescents 11 to 18 years of age) receive a single dose of Tdap in place of the next Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster recommended for all adults and adolescents. In addition, the CDC has issued recommendations for specific adult populations to have the dose of Tdap before the usual 10 year interval after the last booster dose of Td : Adults who have or who anticipate having close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age. (e.g., parents, grandparents younger than 65 years of age, child care pr oviders, healthcare workers) Healthcare pers onnel in hospitals or ambulatory care settings who have di rect patient c ontact. Priority is given to v accina tion of workers in di rect c ontact with infants younger than 12 months of age. Pregnant women after delivery, before discharge from the hospital or birthing center. Vaccine Safety The Tdap vaccine is safe. React ions to the vaccine are usually mild. The most common reactions after vaccina tion are pain and redness at the injection site. Other adverse events are possible. Please consult with your doctor. A healthcare professional should be informed if you have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within six weeks following a prior tetanus vaccination, if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you have experienced Arthus-type hypersensitivity react ions (i.e., rare but severe, exagg erated local react ions) following a prior tetanus vaccine. 94Facts About Pertussis for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 FACT: Pertussis is a serious infectious disease that has been on the rise in the United States over the last decade, across all age groups. FACT: Protection against pertussis from early childhood vaccines wears off, leaving adults and adolescents at risk for infection. FACT: The Chinese refer to pertussis as the \"cough of 100 days\" due to the prolonged, dry cough that is experienced by infected individuals. FACT : Pertussis can be difficult to diagnose because early symptoms may appear like the common cold or bronchitis. FACT : Pertussis causes coughing spells that can affect breathing, eating and sleeping. It can even lead to cracked ribs and hospitalization. FACT: Pertussis causes coughing that lasts for weeks, even months. Sometimes a \"whoop\" sound occurs while gasping for breath during a bad coughing spell. However, the \"whoop\" is not always present; adults rarely have the classic \"whoop.\" FACT: The vast majority of cases are not reported. While 25,616 cases of pertussis were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005, experts estimate that the true number may actually be one to three million cases annually. FACT: Adults and adolescents can spread pertussis to infants who have not yet had all of their vaccines, even before a cough develops. Infants have the highest rates of pertussis complications and deaths. FACT: Parents, grandparents and older siblings are often the source of pertussis in infants. FACT: A booster vaccine, known as Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis), is available to protect against pertussis. One formulation can be used for adults and adolescents. The other has been approved for adolescents only. FACT: The pertussis booster vaccine protects against two other important diseases-- tetanus and diphtheria. FACT: The CDC recommends that adults 19 to 64 years of age (and adolescents 11 to 18 years of age) receive a single dose of Tdap in place of the Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster previously recommended for all adults. FACT: The CDC also recommends that adults in close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact \u2014 especially with infants younger than 12 months of age \u2014 and pregnant women directly after delivery receive a single dose of Tdap. 95ACIP Provisional Recommendations for Health Care Personnel on use of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) of Postexposure Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Date of ACIP vote: February 23, 2011 Date of posting of provisional recommendations: April 4, 2011 Scheduled date of publication of recommendations in CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: fall 2011 (Immunization of Healthcare Personnel) and 2012 (full pertussis-containing vaccines recommendations) On February 23, 2011 the ACIP approved revised recommendations for healthcare personnel on use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and use of postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis. Revised recommendations on use of Tdap in healthcare personnel incorporate the changes made by ACIP at the October 2010 meeting and support direct language to remove barriers to facilitate the uptake of Tdap. Use of Tdap in healthcare personnel: x The ACIP recommends that all healthcare personnel (HCP), regardless of age, should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap and regardless of the time since last Td dose. x Tdap is not currently licensed for multiple administrations. After receipt of Tdap, HCP should receive routine booster immunization against tetanus and diphtheria according to previously published guidelines. x Hospitals \u00b6\u00b6 and ambulatory-care facilities should provide Tdap for HCP and use approaches that maximize vaccination rates (e.g., education about the benefits of vaccination, convenient access, and the provision of Tdap at no charge). Postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis in healthcare personnel: x Healthcare facilities should maximize efforts to prevent transmission of Bordetella pertussis . Respiratory precautions should be taken to prevent unprotected exposure to pertussis. x Data on the need for postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis in Tdap-vaccinated HCP are inconclusive. Some vaccinated HCP are still at risk for B. pertussis. Tdap may not preclude the need for postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis. x Postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommend for all HCP who have unprotected exposure to pertussis and are likely to expose a patient at risk for severe pertussis (e.g., hospitalized neonates and pregnant women). Other HCP should either receive postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis or be monitored daily for 21 days after pertussis exposure and treated at the onset of signs and symptoms of pertussis. \u00b6\u00b6 Hospitals, as defined by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, do not include long-term-care facilities such as nursing homes, skilled-nursing facilities, or rehabilitation and convalescent care facilities. Ambulatory-care settings include all outpatient and walk-in facilities. This July 8, 2011 From: CDR Edward W. Wolfgang, MSA, BSN, Chair of the Review Committee LT Juan C.

Why get vaccinated? 1 Children 6 years of age and younger are routinely vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. But older children, adolescents, and adults need protection from these diseases too. Td (T etanus, Diphtheria) and Tdap (T etanus, Diphthe-ria, Pertussis) vaccines provide that protection. TETANUS (Lockjaw ) causes painful muscle spasms, usually all over the body. It can lead to tightening of the jaw muscles so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. T etanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected. DIPHTH ERIA causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Coug h) causes severe coughing spells, vomiting, and disturbed sleep. It can lead to weight loss, incontinence, rib fractures and passing out from violent coughing. Up to 2 in 100 adoles- cents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, including pneumonia. These three diseases are all caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. T etanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds. The United States averaged more than 1,300 cases of tetanus and 175,000 cases of diphtheria each year before vaccines. Since vaccines have been available, tetanus cases have fallen by over 96% and diphtheria cases by over 99.9%. Before 2005, only children younger than than 7 years of age could get pertussis vaccine. In 2004 there were more than 8,000 cases of pertussis in the U.S. among adolescents and more than 7,000 cases among adults. Td and Tdap vaccines 2 Td vaccine has been used for many years. It protects against tetanus and diphtheria. Tdap was licensed in 2005. It is the rst vaccine for ado- lescents and adults that protects against all three diseases. Note: At this time, Tdap is licensed for only one lifetime dose per person. Td is given every 10 years, and more often if needed. These vaccines can be used in three ways: 1) as catch-up for people who did not get all their doses of DT aP or DTP when they were children, 2) as a booster dose every 10 years, and 3) for protection against tetanus infection after a wound. Which vaccine, and w hen? 3 Routine: Adolescents 11 through 18 A dose of Tdap is recommended for adolescents who got DT aP or DTP as children and have not yet gotten a booster dose of Td. The preferred age is 11-12. Adolescents who have already gotten a booster dose of Td are encouraged to get a dose of Tdap as well, for protection against pertussis. Waiting at least 5 years between Td and Tdap is encouraged, but not required. Adolescents who did not get all their scheduled doses of DT aP or DTP as children should complete the series using a combination of Td and Tdap. Routine: Adults 19 and O lder All adults should get a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Adults under 65 who have never gotten Tdap should substitute it for the next booster dose. Adults under 65 who expect to have close contact with an infant younger than 12 months of age (including women who may become pregnant) should get a dose of Tdap. Waiting at least 2 years since the last dose of Td is suggested, but not required. Healthcare workers under 65 who have direct patient contact in hospitals or clinics should get a dose of Tdap. A 2-year interval since the last Td is suggested, but not required. New mothers who have never gotten Tdap should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery. If vaccination is needed during pregnancy, Td is usually preferred over Tdap. Protection After a Wound A person who gets a severe cut or burn might need a dose of Td or Tdap to prevent tetanus infection. Tdap may be used for people who have never had a dose. But Td should be used if Tdap is not available, or for: - anybody who has already had a dose of Tdap, - children 7 through 9 years of age, or - adults 65 and older. Tdap and Td may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some people should not be vaccinated or should wait 4 Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTP, DTaP, DT, or Td should not get Td or Tdap. Anyone who has a severe allergy to any component of a vaccine should not get that vaccine. Tell your provider if the person getting the vaccine has any severe allergies. 99 Anyone who had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a dose of DTP or DT aP should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found (these people can get Td). T alk to your provider if the person getting either vaccine: - has epilepsy or another nervous system problem, - had severe swelling or severe pain after a previous dose of DTP , DT aP , DT , Td, or Tdap vaccine, or - has had Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Anyone who has a moderate or severe illness on the day the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting Tdap or Td vaccine. A person with a mild\\ illness or low fever can usually be vaccinated. What are the risks from Tdap and Td vaccines? 5 With a vaccine (as with any medicine) there is always a small risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction or other serious problem. Getting tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis would be much more likely to lead to severe problems than getting either vaccine. Problems reported after Td and Tdap vaccines are listed below. Mild Problems (Noticeable, but did not interfere with activities) Tdap Pain (about 3 in 4 adolescents and 2 in 3 adults) Redness or swelling (about 1 in 5) Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in 25 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Headache (about 4 in 10 adolescents and 3 in 10 adults) Tiredness (about 1 in 3 adolescents and 1 in 4 adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in 4 adolescents and 1 in 10 adults) Chills, body aches, sore joints, rash, swollen glands (uncommon) Td Pain (up to about 8 in 10) Redness or swelling (up to about 1 in 3) Mild fever (up to about 1 in 15) Headache or tiredness (uncommon) Moderate Problems (Interfered with activities, but did not require medical attention) Tdap Pain at the injection site (about 1 in 20 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Redness or swelling (up to about 1 in 16 adolescents and 1 in 25 adults) Fever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 250 adults) Headache (1 in 300) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 3 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Td Fever over 102\u00b0F (rare) Tdap or Td Extensive swelling of the arm where the shot was given (up to about 3 in 100). Severe Problems (Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention) Tdap T wo adults had nervous system problems after getting the vaccine during clinical trials. These may or may not have been caused by the vaccine. These problems went away on their own and did not cause any permanent harm. Tdap or Td Swelling, severe pain, and redness in the arm where the shot was given (rare). A severe allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine. They are estimated to occur less than once in a million doses. What if there is a seve re reaction? 6 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can le this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Meningococcal (muh-nin-jo-cock-al) disease is a very serious bacterial infection that causes severe swelling of the protective lining around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the bloodstream (meningococcal bacteremia). Less often, it causes arthritis or pneumonia. The bacteria that cause meningococcal disease are spread by close, direct contact with a person who is carrying the bacteria in their nose or throat. Even with appropriate treatment, one in ten people who get meningococcal disease will die and two more will have serious permanent disabilities including brain damage, hearing loss and limb amputations. Prevention Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is effective at preventing meningococcal disease caused by four of the five types of bacteria that cause the majority of meningococcal disease worldwide. The vaccine can be given to anyone 2 to 55 years old. Another vaccine (the \"polysaccharide vaccine\") protects against the same four types of meningococcal bacteria and is available for people over 55 years old. Symptoms It its early stages, meningococcal disease symptoms can include fever, headache, body aches and a stiff neck. These symptoms may be mild and can easily be mistaken for less severe illnesses, like a cold or flu. But symptoms can progress quickly, killing an otherwise healthy young person in less than 48 hours. Other symptoms that may occur are nausea, vomiting, confusion, sleepiness, sensitivity to light and a rash (usually dark purple spots on the arms, legs or torso). Who should get meningococcal conjugate vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adolescents 11-18 years of age /.notdef.g0001 College freshmen living in dormitories /.notdef.g0001 Other adults at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including : military recruits, international travelers going to certain areas where meningococcal disease is epidemic, microbiologists who may be working with Neisseria meningitidis , and people who have had their spleen removed (or who have non-functioning spleens) as well as other adults with certain medical conditions.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 The conjugate meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all adolescents 11-18 years of age, college freshmen living in dormitories and other persons 19-55 years of age who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Vaccine Safety The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is safe. Reactions to the vaccine are usually mild. The most common reactions are pain and redness at the injection site. The vaccine cannot cause meningococcal disease. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a syndrome of muscle weakness, has been reported rarely among some people who were vaccinated with meningococcal conjugate vaccine. People for whom meningococcal vaccination is recommended but who have a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome should talk to their doctors - the menin gococcal polysaccharide vaccine ma y be a good alternative for them.. 104Facts About Meningococcal Disease for Adults FACT: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine licensed to prevent meningococcal disease in persons 2-55 years old. FACT: The vaccine protects against four of the five main types of meningococcal bacteria that cause meningococcal disease. These four types cause 75% of cases in adults and adolescents. FACT: You cannot get meningococcal disease from the vaccine. FACT: The vaccine is safe and side effects af ter vaccination are usually minor and can include pain and redness at the inj ection site. There have been rare reports of severe muscle weakness occurring in association with getting this vaccine. FACT: Up to 2,800 Americans get meningococcal disease every year; one in every ten will die, even with treatment. FACT: Two in ten of those who survive will have serious perma nent disabilities like brain damage, hear ing loss and limb amputations. FACT: College-bound students, particularly those who will live in dormitories, are at higher risk for this disease. FACT: The bacteria are spread through close, direct contact with a person carrying the bacteria. FACT: The bacteria are not spread by casual contact such as br eathing air where an infected person has been. FACT: Early symptoms of meningococcal disease (fever, headache, body aches and stiff neck) may be mistaken for other less serious illnesses like the common cold or flu, but meningococcal disease symptoms can progress quickly killing an otherwise healthy young person in two days or less. FACT: The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all college freshmen living in dormitories (if they have not already received it). It is recommended for other adults who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including military recruits, persons traveling to areas where there is more meningococcal disease, or persons with certain medical conditions.

See www.immunize.or g/vis. What is meningococca l disease? 1 Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000 - 2,600 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who survive, another 11-19% lose their arms or legs, become deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, become mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen. College freshmen who live in dormitories, and teenagers 15-19 have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. Meningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such as penicillin. Still, about 1 out of every ten people who get the disease dies from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2 Meningococca l vaccine There are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: - Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licensed in 2005. It is the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. - Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s. It may be used if MCV4 is not available, and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. Both vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. Meningococcal vaccines cannot prevent all types of the disease. But they do protect many people who might become sick if they didn't get the vaccine. Both vaccines work well, and protect about 90% of people who get them. MCV4 is expected to give betterlonger-lasting protection. MCV4 should also be better at preventing the disease from spreading from person to person. , Who should get meningococca l vaccine and w hen? 3 A dose of MCV4 is recommended for children and adolescents 11 through 18 years of age. This dose is normally given during the routine pre- adolescent immunization visit (at 11-12 years). But those who did not get the vaccine during this visit should get it at the earliest opportunity Meningococcal vaccine is also recommended for other people at increased risk for meningococcal disease: . College freshmen living in dormitories. Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world where meningococcal disease is common, such as parts of Africa. Anyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleen has been removed. Anyone who has terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder). People who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age in these risk groups. MPSV4 can be used if MCV4 is not available and for adults over 55. How Many Doses? People 2 years of age and older should get 1 dose. Sometimes a second dose is recommended for people who remain at high risk. Ask your provider. MPSV4 may be recommended for children 3 months to 2 years of age under special circumstances. These children should get 2 doses, 3 months apart. 1064Some people should no t get meningococca l vaccine or should wait Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of either meningococcal vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your provider. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Anyone who has ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome should talk with their provider before getting MCV4. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. However, MCV4 is a new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be used only if clearly needed. Meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococca l vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Mild problems As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. A serious nervous system disorder called Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (or GBS) has been reported among some people who received MCV4. This happens so rarely that it is currently not possible to tell if the vaccine might be a factor. Even if it is, the risk is very small. What if there is a moderate or seve re reaction? 6 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . VAERS does not provide medical advice. The Na tional Vaccine Injury Compensation Progra m 7 A federal program exists to help pay for the care of any- one who has had a rare serious reaction to a vaccine. For information about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visit their website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . How can I learn more? 8 Ask your doctor or nurse. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.

I understand the benefits and risks of meningococcal vaccination as described. However, I do not want the vaccine given to me. I also understand that, because I work in a health care environment, I may place patients and co-workers at risk if I work while infected with meningococcal meningitis. By declining this vaccine, I acknowledge that I will be at risk of acquiring meningococcal meningitis and spreading it to others. Reason(s) I do not wish to take the vaccine. Check all that apply. I do not believe I will contract meningococcal meningitis I do not believe the disease is serious I had side effects when I received the vaccine previously I will stay home if I catch the disease so I will not spread it to patients or colleagues Other ____________________________________ I understand that this declination will be void if I later choose to be vaccinated. _______________________ _____________ P r i n t N a m e D a t e _______________________ Signature 109A special thanks to our Supporting Partners: Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration APIC Delmarva Long Term Care Chapter Health Facilities Association of Maryland (HFAM) Greater Baltimore APIC Chapter LifeSpan MidAtlantic Maryland Ambulatory Surgical Association (MASA) Maryland Board of Nursing MedStar Institute for Innovation Mental Hygiene Administration Statewide Advisory Commission on Immunization University of Maryland School of Nursing If you would like to become a partner in the Maryland Healthcare Personnel Immunization Initiative, please email hcwinfo@immunizemaryland.org or call 410-902-4677.
