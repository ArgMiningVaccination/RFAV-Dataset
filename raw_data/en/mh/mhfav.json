The main intention of the ceremony is to connect and bring down higher frequency light from the heavens to cleanse and harmonize earthly energies. In this healing ceremony we will create a portal of light : a Gateway of light from heaven to earth connecting, unifying and harmonizing the yin and yang forces. This powerful light portal will be able to shift the collective and individual energies of everyone in the ceremony space. As a group, we will open and connect to the highest divine light to clear denser energies from the earth and bring them to the light. According to ancient Taoists, human beings are inherently light beings. In fact, the word for human being in Japanese is \"Hito\" - the gate of light. Essentially as human beings, our job is to remember how to keep our gate of light bright and clear and learning how to remove the dirt and grime that accumulates from daily life. The ceremony will be facilitated by 3 gifted healers from various traditions and lineage. As facilitators we will help and guide the group to bring down the light from the heavens and open the healing portal to help clear, cleanse and update the energetic body. During this process each healer will work on the group as a whole and also individually to open or release any blockages. Outline of Ceremony: Duration: 3 hours Copal cleansing and energy check Explanation of how ceremony works Prayer to open ceremony Meditation to chanting of monk Breathwork and movement to clear blockages in body Deep breathwork with shamanic drumming and sound channeling Energetic healing and Physical touch during breathwork Closing of breathwork and healing session Calming down and harmonizing the energy Optional - 3rd Eye light machine activation (15 min). For those who want to experience this light strobing, please sit closer to the light and look towards the light with eyes closed. Optional - Sananga eye drops to integrate nervous system Closing prayer Sharing circle Additional Information: Breathwork (combination of Biodynamic and Soma Breathwork): In order to get the most benefit from any kind of healing work, it is necessary to be in a slight state of trance so that we can shift out of the thinking rational mind and more into the subconscious mind. Meditation and Breathwork are natural ways to enter into trance. Breathwork requires continuous breathing in and out for a long period of time and can be physically challenging. However we will help to motivate and support you with drumming and channeled sounds. It's best to focus only on yourself, your breath, body sensations and the sound of the drumming and singing. Physical Touch: Physical touch can be light, medium and deep. We will ask everyone for your permission. All touch is by consent. We often work on areas of the body that tend to hold a lot of tension and can be painful. We also work on the pelvis area by rocking the pelvis from side to side. Please let us know your comfort zone. Being the Witness to Emotional Release: We encourage everyone to let go as much as you can, we hold a safe container for expression of repressed emotions and past traumas through crying, yelling, screaming. It's good to release and to move the blocked energy, while the energy is being released, its important to not identify with it. For example, if there is anger being released, we can also be a witness to the energy of anger moving through and that we are NOT the energy of anger. We are also not attached to the anger in any way and is a separate from it. Self Nurturing and Self-Coaching: Human beings are complex beings and multi-dimensional in many ways. In regards to personality, each of us have qualities that could be labeled as of being a mother, father, child, victim, warrior, healer, etc. According to psychologists, we are able to play all of these roles in different situations and circumstances in our life. In the light portal ceremony, at various times, we might be experiencing one or more of these roles and the associated emotions. The knowledge that we can be in any role at anytime is helpful because for example, if there is a hurtful childhood memory arises, we can first release it through the breath, body movement and sounds. Then we can consciously separate from hurt and call upon the role of the mother or father and with unconditional love of the parent to help the wounded child. We can send unconditional love to the little child that was hurt by putting our hands on our hearts and to coach and guide the child to overcome the hurt. Sensation of Pain in deep tissue work: According the latest research in the Neuroscience, Pain is in the Brain. [http://crystallotushealing.org/pain/](http://crystallotushealing.org/pain/) Eye drop: Sananga eye drops is a powerful plant from the Amazon that is used by hunters to clear and increase their inner vision for hunting. Light Portal Healing Sangha: Our light portal ceremony has become a platform in which those who have healing abilities are encouraged and supported to share their gifts. We have an organic process of onboarding to cultivate and nurture these healing gifts. If your healing abilities start to manifest and interested in how we can support your growth, please let us know.
