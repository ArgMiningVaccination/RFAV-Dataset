Constitutional Hydrotherapy: Constitutional Hydrotherapy is by far a very effective therapy for stimulating the immune system and achieving total body detoxification. It has been used for years to detoxify heavy metal exposure, pesticide/herbicide toxicity, and the daily toxic buildup of improper diet and lifestyle. Hot and cold contrast towel applications are combined with various electrical physical therapy stimulations to achieve a remarkable healing therapy. This is called \"constitutional hydrotherapy\" because it changes the very constitution of each individual cell. This means that each cell in your body is stimulated to dump waste products, to utilize nutrition more efficiently, and to work more effectively. You can rebuild your metabolism and regenerate your health with this amazing therapy. Studies recently done at the [National College of Naturopathic Medicine](http://www.ncnm.edu/intro.html) and the famous Windrose Clinic, in Spokane, WA, determined that the constitutional hydrotherapy will raise a low basal body temperature, moderate low or high blood sugar, which helps with metabolism and diabetes, and moderate high or low blood pressure. Remarkably, an increase in white blood cell count by 10,000 more cells on average in circulation is seen within 2 to 8 hours after only 1 hydrotherapy. This is a rapid way to boost your immune function and fight any infection - even the antibiotic resistant bacteria, and it has been used to treat serious conditions like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and even bubonic plague (Thankfully the latter is not very common!). We had a client come in with a migraine and walk out without one. Talk about quick relief! This therapy has been used for sinusitis, whooping cough, pneumonia as well as chronic conditions such as asthma, psoriasis, irritable bowel, Crohn's disease, and arthritis. Constitutional hydrotherapy is part of many of our autoimmune programs and fertility programs. Infrared Sauna: What if you could improve heart function without drugs or even exercise? Would you like to burn 600 calories a day without lifting a finger? What if you could gain personal health benefits for circulation, weight loss, sleep, immunity, stress relief, and general pain relief? Does this all sound too good to be true? With the new Sunlighten full-spectrum infrared sauna, all of this and more is possible! What is Infrared? Infrared light (experienced as heat) is the invisible part of the sun's spectrum with the ability to penetrate human tissue, providing a soothing, natural warmth. It is naturally occurring from the sun and is the basis for Sunlighten sauna therapy. Sunlighten's SoloCarbon\u00ae infrared technology is therapeutic because it is 99% efficient at heating the body directly rather than simply heating the air. It works to raise the core body temperature to produce a deep, detoxifying sweat at the cellular level where the majority of toxins reside.

We use this in all systems of the body, from reproductive, cognitive/neurological, digestive, respiratory, and more! You don't have to fast or go on a 'cleanse' to detoxify. Our cells detoxify constantly. Just think what would happen if they didn't! These natural homeopathic products help your natural detoxification processes. Biotherapeutic drainage helps us optimize this normal process in every system of the body. Clinical Nutrition: With so many diets out there, how are you to choose? There's Paleo, blood type diet, vegetarian, ketogenic, and more. There's not one diet for everyone. Naturopathic doctors have hundreds of hours of training in nutrition. Nutritional plans will be customized for your specific symptoms and nutritional deficiencies. We can also do a comprehensive nutrient panel called the Spectracell test. Food allergy testing*: Did you know that food allergies can be causing symptoms ranging from asthma to skin rashes to infertility? Even people without symptoms in the digestive tract can have food allergies. Some people report difficulty thinking or weight gain from offending foods. The first step to getting better is to avoid these foods. But that's only part of the answer. We have to support and nourish the gut so that further allergies don't occur. Homeopathy and specific nutrients are great for that. Come learn which foods to which your body is reacting with this simple test. Anti-Aging Program: This program starts with a test* to measure the age of your cells my measuring an enzyme called telomerase. This protein helps the cell divide. The more times a cell can divide, the longer it lives. If the levels are low, we will supplement with a product that has shown to raise levels of this enzyme. Telomere science is becoming the 'next big thing'. More labs are studying this part of the DNA, in order to support its ability to keep replicating. The anti-aging program includes a telomerase test at the beginning, and also 6 months into Naturopathic care. It also includes customized recommendations specifically for your health concerns. Naturopathic doctors are licensed in many states, and scope of practice varies in each state. Naturopathic doctors in PA do not perform IV therapies for nutrients or for chelation. IV chelation has side effects including gray hair, insomnia, gray eyebrows, and kidney pain. In this office, we can test for heavy metals and use safe and effective methods that work with your body. *Tests are provided for informational purposes, and not with the purpose of diagnosing any medical condition.
