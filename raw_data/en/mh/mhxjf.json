There are no approved treatments for this disease, nor are there any approved vaccines. That's put big drug companies, universities and biotech startups on the hot seat. Since the 2003 outbreak of SARS, another variety of deadly coronavirus, they've been researching ways to handle diseases that can be produced by this family of viruses. When a coronavirus is capable of infecting humans, it typically attacks the respiratory system, which can make them particularly deadly. It usually takes about 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine. The good news: leaps in technology, such as the ability to rapidly sequence virus genomes and to create vaccines out of messenger RNA, are speeding up the process of development. Developing new drug treatments can also take time\u2014about a decade from discovery to getting on the market. But here technology also provides an advantage. New types of antiviral drugs and immunotherapy treatments can treat a wide range of diseases. Which means that drugs already in the development pipeline or already treating diseases in patients could be useful to fight COVID-19, shortening the time it will take to make an effective medicine. On this page, we'll be tracking and regularly updating the development of new treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, from research to testing to commercial release. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine On March 19, the [Trump Administration announced](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/03/19/trump-says-fda-approved-anti-malaria-drug-chloroquine-to-test-as-coronavirus-treatment/#77762930303d) that antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine had been approved by the FDA for clinical trials. The FDA has also approved the use of the treatments on a \"compassionate use\" basis. Clinical trials will [begin in New York](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/03/22/new-york-to-begin-clinical-trials-for-coronavirus-treatment-tuesday-cuomo-says/#4881dfc24203) on Tuesday, March 24. The treatments, which were invented in the 1950s, are manufactured by a number of countries. Small studies from China and France have provided encouraging preliminary data, but more research is needed.
