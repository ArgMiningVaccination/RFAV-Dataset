For more information Wellevate Supplement Dispensary, Standard Process Patient Direct, and Chinese Herbal Formulas via Roots Acupuncture, please see the sections below. 1/ Wellevate Online Patient Supplement Dispensary Please note that Wellevate does not provide access to the following items: Chinese FerroFood, Immuplex, etc. True Lemon products. If you need a refill for any of these products, continue reading the below sections. Need a refill? or Want to browse and order natural, non-toxic, clinical products from your home? [Wellevate](https://wellevate.me/fuyiu-yip) is an online supplement dispensary \u2014 an area to access the supplements you would typically buy in my Office, plus more. All you need to do is click on the \"Place Order\" image above, create an account, and purchase / refill probiotics, enzymes, fish oils, minerals, vitamins, natural oral / skin products, etc. Wellevate's goal is to support Practitioners and Patients by ensuring that you can continue to access and use the products you trust and know work for you, especially while I am out of the office. You will continue to receive a discount through Wellevate and will notice that the prices are similar to what you have been paying in my Office, which has always been less than typical retail prices. Fuyiu has always researched the products that she has recommended \u2014 often trying many of them herself before suggesting them to patients \u2014 while keeping in mind the use of research based, active/bioavailable forms of vitamins & minerals (common store supplements are synthetic & poorly absorbed), synergistic/antagonistic combinations, and avoiding common toxic and allergenic ingredients, as well as cross contamination. More importantly now, while undergoing extensive treatment for neurotoxicity [severe heavy metal toxicity, mycotoxicosis (toxic mold)], Fuyiu has become even more acutely aware of the level of toxins in our everyday products and supplements. Thus, [her unique Wellevate site](https://wellevate.me/fuyiu-yip) reflects a hand-curated Custom Dispensary: she has clicked through nearly every product, reading every ingredient list, and made conscious decisions \u2014 for you \u2014 to try to minimize glyphosate (herbacide), GMO, poorly absorbed forms of vitamins & minerals, magnesium stearates and other unnecessary fillers/flow agents, artificial coloring, corn, gluten, \"fragrance\" (unless specifically stated from natural sources), soybean oil, canola/rapeseed oil, most hydrogenated oils, various hidden alcohols (in the skin care), etc. {As always, please check every product based on your own needs.} As a reference, some of the brands included are: Thorne, Innate, Designs for Health, Pure Encapsulations*, Wobenzym*, Garden Labs, Jarrow, Integrative Therapeutics, Trace Mineral Research, Allergy Research Labs, and many others. *Many have been concerned by the recent acquisition of some of these Brands by Nestle, but Nestle Company is not merely the candy segment that we are familiar with in the USA. Instead, Nestle recently purchased the Canadian company, Atrium Innovations, which is the global leader in nutritional supplement and health products to become Nestle Health Science; the candy segment was sold to Ferraro. Thus, Nestle Health Science now owns Pure Encapsulations, Garden of Life, Wobenzym, and Genestra. While conglomerate ownership such as these can certainly be concerning, thus far, it appears that these purchased brands remain true to its quality, formulations, free of all common allergens and non-GMO, and that is what ultimately matters. As a Practitioner, Fuyiu will always do her best to keep watch over such matters. Click [here](https://ndnr.com/naturopathic-news/nestle-buys-pure-encapsulations-and-genestra/) and [here](https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-acquires-atrium-innovations) for more information. An important distinction to note is that the Innate Brand is also glyphosate free. While there is a move towards removing this neuro-toxic herbacidal residue, many companies have not yet done so. Innate is one of Fuyiu's favorite, mindfully produced, extensively researched, toxin-free, quality brands. Innate is the Clinical line of Mega Food (consumer line) and you'll see many similar products from both Brands. On the skin care side, for example, I've included products from Weleda and Mychelle (omitting products from Mychelle that contained hidden alcohols in 4-5 forms within one product), as well as Goddess Garden suncreen, and other items. There is an option to set up an auto-refill for specific items at the frequency you choose, if you wish, and free shipping is provided for any order >$49. There is also a new Mobile Patient Ordering App: search \"Wellevate\" in the app store or text GETWELLEVATE (no spaces) to 72345 to access the ease of ordering from your phone. ~ For Fuyiu's Patients: If you do not see a product that you think may be available, please contact me & I am happy to add it for you if available. ~ If you are not a Patient and have landed here: I hope you can hear the careful consideration placed in the choices and you're welcome to set up an account to browse and gain access to Wellevate. 2/ New! Standard Process Patient Direct \u2014 shipped directly to you! Standard Process has now established Patient Direct Access via a qualified Practitioner. Please contact Fuyiu/Roots Acupuncture for more information on having refills/orders sent directly to you. {Unfortunately, without evaluation, new patients are excluded as per Standard Process's guidelines.} [Standard Process](https://www.standardprocess.com/) is one of the earliest, if not the pioneer, in food-based and glandular supplements. This Company was established by Royal Lee in 1929. Fuyiu has been recommending Standard Process Supplements for nearly a decade for these food-based supplements \u2014 without binders, fillers \u2014 are easy to digest, not synthetically manufactured in a concentration that can cause digestive discomfort, bioavailable, and provide unique sources to target the human physiology and organ systems. Fuyiu is working on taking courses to learn more on Standard Process Veterinary Formulas, for our furry companions should have the same access to bioavailable, food-based, clean supplements that humans do when their systems show signs of illness and imbalance. Animal kibble/feed are highly processed and void of many necessary natural vitamins & minerals, often leaving nutritional deficiencies in pets that lead to itchiness, bowel issues, digestive issues, runny eyes/nose, lumps and bumps, musculoskeletal concerns, and more. Please stay tuned for more updates! 3/ Chinese Herbal Formulas from Roots Acupuncture & Herbal Medicine \u2014 contactless local pickup Roots Acupuncture is still fulfilling Chinese Herbal Formulas: pills, tablets, capsules, topical sprays and oils, & other supplement needs.
