Vaccinations, or immunizations, work by stimulating the [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3905) system, the natural disease-fighting system of the body. The [healthy](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39755) immune system is able to recognize invading [bacteria](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13954) and [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viral_infections_slideshow_pictures/article.htm) and produce substances (antibodies) to destroy or disable them.
