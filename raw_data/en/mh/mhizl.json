Facebook posts: Pfizer vaccine contains living particles that can germinate to cause sickness. PolitiFact rating: Pants on Fire! Here's why: A 17-minute video posted to Facebook shows a Swedish doctor claiming that the Pfizer vaccine contains particles that could germinate and cause illness in those who get vaccinated. The doctor is Erik Enby, whose medical license was revoked in 2007 after two cancer patients in his care died following his prescriptions of fungicides, herbs and vitamins, according to Swedish news reports. In the Facebook video, which has since been removed from the platform but exists on other platforms like Reddit, Enby displayed images on his computer that he claimed showed a microscopic view of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The particles moving on the screen, he said, were living microorganisms. \"I believe it has to do with development of illness. I think (the particles) can germinate in the body and if they do, there will be further growth development and all sorts of uncontrollable byproducts,\" Enby said.

Is that right?](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/16/people-covid-vaccine-safe-spreading-covid-others/8472251002/) Enby also claimed that a vaccinated person could stop the living particles from germinating by taking vitamins and supplements. The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Health experts say there's no truth to it. PolitiFact debunked a similarly false claim that the Pfizer vaccine contained a parasite. The ingredients for Pfizer vaccines are chemical components \u2014 not living organisms, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"There is no evidence that there are living particles in doses of the Pfizer vaccine. There is no accuracy to this claim,\" Adalja said.

This process presents the body with the instructions to build immunity.\" Volker Mai, associate professor in the department of epidemiology at the University of Florida, said he hasn't come across peer-reviewed evidence of contamination in the Pfizer vaccines. \"Contamination with spores or other microbial material can theoretically happen during production of any biologic, including vaccines,\" Mai said. \"However, quality control is extensive and monitoring occurs continuously. Thus, it is highly unlikely that any contaminated batch would make it into the market.\" PolitiFact reached out to Enby for evidence to support his claim, but didn't hear back. Our ruling Enby claimed in a Facebook video that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine contained living particles that could germinate and cause illness in vaccinated people. Health experts say this is false. The Pfizer mRNA vaccine does not contain any living organisms, only chemical components that trigger the human body to produce antibodies against COVID-19. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!
