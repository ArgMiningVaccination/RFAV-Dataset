Nearly a third of young people know someone with dementia. As the population ages and the number of people living with dementia increases, more and more young people are likely to be affected through family and friends. Alzheimer's Society is creating a dementia-friendly generation, supporting young people to understand and take positive action on dementia today. Educating young people about dementia can help reduce stigma and increase understanding. Changing attitudes and building knowledge can help to reduce the loneliness and social isolation that many people with dementia experience. Educating young people about dementia means they can learn about protecting their own health and the importance of a healthy lifestyle including diet and exercise. Through learning, young people will become more aware of the importance of care roles, ethical issues, and issues connected with an ageing population. It will also encourage them to become active and responsible citizens.What is dementia Dementia describes a set of symptoms that may include memory loss and difficulties with movement, problem-solving or communication. Dementia is caused when the brain is damaged by diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or a series of strokes. It is progressive, which means the symptoms will get worse over time. Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not a natural part of ageing. There are 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK, with this figure predicted to reach 2 million by 205 1 if no action is taken. Nearly one third of young people know someone with dementia.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Introduction4 T eachers' notes These resources have been developed to help schools tackle some of the common misconceptions that surround dementia. In order to do this, the resources provide an insight into dementia, exercises aimed at reducing stigma and an opportunity for students to interact with those affected by dementia. These lesson-ready resources predominantly focus on PSE and Citizenship, however, there are links to other areas of the national curriculum for students aged 1 1- 14, including design and technology, art, drama, ICT and English. For detailed information on how these resources support the national curriculum in all four nations, please see pages 37-41. These resources are flexible, which allows individual schools to use these resources as they see fit. This can vary from a one-off lesson or assembly, through to delivering a scheme of work or creating an enrichment day - the resources can be adapted to include additional activities, to further challenge or suit the school and its learners' needs. Each lesson plan comes with an appendix that provides teaching staff with useful information that could be used in lessons, or by the school to publicise the work that students are doing to raise further awareness to parents and guardians. We are always keen to hear about what you are doing in your school, or offer you support where required. If you have any questions, would like to tell us about your project, or want more information please contact: youngpeople@alzheimers.org.uk Using this resource suite to provide further support: If an additional member of staff (such as a TLA) will be present in the lesson, it is useful that they have a copy of the lesson plan and activities you will be using. They may be able to help scaffold the lesson for students with SEND and adapt the resources accordingly. Any students with SEND that have access to ICT should be encouraged to use it within the lesson, as many of the Alzheimer's Society resources can be copied onto a memory stick and transferred onto individual computers / student shared areas, allowing students with SEND to complete worksheets / tasks on the computer. Look out for our suggestions at the bottom of each lesson plan for further ideas on how to promote inclusive learning.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Introduction5 Summary of lessons and supporting materials: All of the supporting materials can be found in each lesson's appendix and full curriculum links are outlined on pages 37-41. NB: Each lesson has a suggested homework task to be completed by the students, and schools are encouraged to contact parents/carers advising them that the school will be conducting lessons on dementia and the work carried out by Alzheimer's Society. To raise awareness of this, schools can promote these lessons on their newsletter, hold assemblies or send a letter to the parents/carers of the students who will be completing the lessons. Parental assistance and support with homework and in raising awareness is greatly welcome (please see page 42).The three lessons and the further activity options aim to enable students to make progress, and develop their knowledge and understanding of dementia, but the lessons do not have to be taught consecutively. Each of the lesson-ready resources is adaptable with accompanying supporting materials enabling adjustable activities to suit the class and their needs.

Ideas for activities are given below according to subject areas. Subject Approach English Run a creative writing competition based on life story books. Explore poem composition using dementia as a theme. Explore literature that features people living with dementia. Use the book, Elizabeth is missing by Emma Healey to explore the concept of an unreliable narrator and this technique in storytelling. Maths Design a memory card game. Use numbers about dementia to learn aspects of the maths curriculum, for example: statistics using prevalence data. Think about demographics, ageing and increases in the numbers of people living with dementia. Science Explore the biological side of dementia, and the effects of diet and food plans. Understand how diet and exercise affect our behaviour and development. Explore how the brain works and what happens when it deteriorates. Explore issues around research, drugs, and ethical issues in science. ICT Create leaflets to raise awareness about dementia. Work with people in care homes to find out about reminiscence, then create 'memory sticks'. PE Learn how exercise can help to reduce risk of illnesses such as dementia. Undertake activities with older people, such as bowling. Geography Use knowledge from local people about how the local community and environment has changed. Explore issues of an ageing population and population demographics. Explore cultural variation; looking at response to dementia in different countries. History Use key figures, who had dementia, to learn about the past. Use knowledge from local people about how the local community and environment has changed. Music and drama Hold a performance around mental health and wellbeing. Learn about how music can help with memory recollection. Form an intergenerational choir. Create and perform a play about the effects of dementia, or in which one of the key characters has dementia.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Introduction7 Subject Approach Art and design Design an artwork indicating what the local community looked like 50- 100 years ago. Design an artwork that conveys the theme of dementia. Design posters to advertise a dementia-friendly community. Explore art as a therapeutic activity for people with dementia. Create memory books or collages with people with dementia. Design and technology Create a short film about dementia. Design an app for carers of people living with dementia. Create an assistive technology device. Humanities Consider how people living with dementia may have been treated through the ages and design a modern dementia-friendly community. Look at the history of the development of services helping people living with dementia. Modern foreign languages Design a memory card game in different languages. Weave the theme of dementia into conversational practice, vocabulary learning and composition writing. Citizenship Hold a debate about dementia and the balance of choice, social freedom and government responsibility. Explore the government's responsibility in providing services verses the role of carers. Religious education Research and discuss how people living with dementia might be viewed by different faiths or in different cultures. How different cultures view and support people with disability and illness generally as well as people with dementia. Sex and relationships education Use dementia as an example of a long-term condition, and explore how this might affect a relationship when one person gets dementia in their 40s, 50s or 60s. Work-related learning Explore volunteering in health and social care, or working in memory cafes. Understand the health and social care system, the pressures it faces and how it supports people living with dementia and carers. Develop fundraising activities to support people living with dementia and carers.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Introduction8 Setting ground rules Many of the activities in this resource pack require students to feedback their ideas and provide and insight into living with dementia. Please remind the class that there may be some students in the lesson who know someone living with dementia, or potentially lost someone who had dementia. It is important that everyone feels respected and that the classroom is a safe environment (please see Ice breaker activity as a suggestion). Ground rules you may wish to promote and encourage: Listen to people when they are speaking Respect everyone's view and opinions Put your hand up if you wish to contribute to the lesson Be mindful that someone in your class may know or have known someone living with dementia No silly or inappropriate comments Our advice is to usually avoid personal accounts in the classroom; nevertheless this will depend on individual teachers. Please remind students that if the content of the lessons causes them to feel upset about a family member, they can share their personal feelings with a member of the pastoral team within the school. Exercise sensitivity that pupils may be young carers themselves, or pupils' family members may having caring responsibilities. Information and signposting about support for pupils and families should be made available during and after the lessons.10 minutes For more information or advice, contact the National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 1 122 Additionally, if the class would like further information, advice or support on dementia and the work carried out by the Alzheimer's Society, they can visit Alzheimer's Society website ( alzheimers.org.uk ). Ice breaker activity: This activity can be applied to any of the three lessons. Split the class into small groups and ask them to write down anything they associate with the term dementia. Encourage students and groups to include facts, feelings and examples from the media (some students may even wish to share personal stories). Deliver this through a feedback and class discussion with key points raised noted on the board. These can be referenced at the end of the lesson. United Against DementiaCreating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 19 Lesson one: Explaining dementia 1 Learning outcomes Students will: Learn to appreciate what it is like to live with dementia Learn to communicate with others Develop empathy skills Explore mental and emotional health issues Apply decision making skills1 hour Learning objectives This lesson will help students to: Understand what dementia is Explore common misconceptions about dementia Lesson materials Eight objects - these can be any objects from the school / classroom Diagram worksheet - Appendix page 14 Scissors - a few pairs should suffice between small groups True or false worksheet - Appendix page 15 Video: 'What are the symptoms of dementia?' www.bit.ly/AlzSocSch6 White board / flip chart (and pens)Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 110 Getting you thinking! Show the students eight objects. Give them a minute to look at these and then ask them to close their eyes. Remove one of the objects and move the others around. Ask students which of the objects is missing. Discussion topics: Q: How did the activity make you feel? Q: How do you think people who have difficulty remembering things would cope with this activity? Q: What does our memory do? Q: How does it help us in our lives? Q: How might this activity help you to explain the symptoms of someone with dementia? Video 'What are the symptoms of dementia?' www.bit.ly/AlzSocSch6 Split students into groups and give them the diagram on Appendix page 14. Ask groups to write down a list of things that the brain controls. Examples might include: memory, skills, thinking, sight, balance, communication, recognising, hearing, movement. Explain that dementia affects how the brain functions. Looking at the list they have come up with, ask students to write down things that someone with dementia might struggle to do. As a class, go through all the suggestions and compare answers. Point out the differences in what groups have come up with. Not everyone with dementia will show the same symptoms as a different part of their brain might be affected.5 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutesHow do you feel? In pairs, ask students to talk about the last holiday they went on, or last day out they had. Tell them to focus on how they felt - excited, happy etc. Discussion topics: Q: What did you do on the second afternoon of your holiday? Q: If you couldn't remember the details of the holiday, do you think you would still remember it as being fun? Point out that people with dementia might not be able to remember what they did, but feelings and emotions can stay with them. If you know someone with dementia, it doesn't matter that they can't remember your visit - they may still feel happy when you are there and this may help their overall feelings.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 111 Main activity Hand out the true or false statements (Appendix page 15). In groups, students can cut these up, read through them and decide whether the statements are true or false. Give students 10 minutes and then go through the statements. Build class discussion into this activity where the students/groups must be able to justify their decisions on the statements. Use statement D to hold a class discussion and get students to explore the following ideas: It's best not to talk about dementia It's depressing and makes people uncomfortable Q: What does the class think? Q: What are the advantages of talking about sensitive topics such as dementia? Further support: The true or false task could be reduced to ensure students can complete it within the time given.Want to know more about dementia? Visit the Alzheimer's Society website for more information. Students could produce a poster or leaflet.25 minutes (Homework suggestion) Plenary: What do you now know about dementia? Go back to the list of students' ideas about dementia from the start of the lesson. Ask students to correct any misconceptions. Can students answer any of the questions that were put forward at the start of the lesson? Remind students that they can visit the Alzheimer's Society website for more information or that they can talk to members of staff if they are concerned about any of the issues raised during the lesson.10 minutesCreating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 112 Lesson one Further challenges Activity one Independent research Ask students to conduct their own internet / library research on dementia and complete the worksheet on Appendix page 17 or produce a presentation (using the criteria on the worksheet). Students could complete this on their own or in small groups. A useful resource for students to explore is the Alzheimer's Society 'Infographic', which provides facts and statistics about dementia: alzheimers.org.uk/infographic or visit: alzheimers.org.uk/aboutdementia Activity two Doing an everyday task in a different way Task students to complete one of the activities below and then answer the questions: Ask students to tie their shoe laces with a blindfold on Draw a house on a piece of paper from its reflection in a mirror Discussion topics: Q: What did you find difficult about this task? Q: Why was this activity more difficult than doing it normally? Q: Why is the brain getting confused? Q: How can you use these activities to explain how someone with dementia might feel?Activity three The alphabet shopping list game Ask the class to sit in a circle. Start with the first student and ask them to say 'I am going shopping and I am going to buy...'. Each student should give an item beginning with the letter of the alphabet. As you go around the circle, each student must repeat the phrase as well as each item (in alphabetical order); they must then add their item to the end of the list. Discussion topics: Q: Why is it difficult to remember everything? Q: Are some items more difficult to remember than others? Why? Q: How might someone with dementia struggle with simple tasks such as food shopping?Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 113 Diagram worksheet 14 True or false worksheet 15 True or false answer sheet 16 Further challenges: Activity one worksheet 17Lesson one appendix:Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 114 On this sheet of paper, write down a list of things that the brain controls.Diagram worksheetCreating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 115 Approximately 850,000 people in the UK have dementiaDementia is much more common amongst old peopleDementia affects the brain We shouldn't talk about dementia because it is depressing Someone with dementia may have problems with their memory and languageYou can catch dementia from someone Dementia gets worse over timeThere is a cure for dementiaAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia People under 65 can't get dementiaDrinking and smoking don't affect your risk of getting dementiaIt's possible to live well with dementiaA D GB E H K L JC F ITrue or FalseTrue or false worksheetCreating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 116 A.

(Explain) Q: Do people know enough about dementia in order to help others in the community?Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 220 25 minutes 10 minutes (Homework suggestion)Main activity Divide the class into small groups. Using supporting materials on Appendix page 23, give each group a scenario and ask them to prepare a role play. The students will have to act out the scenario to the class. Once they have finished their role play, the other members of the class should suggest what members of the public could do to help the person with dementia. There is an alternative activity suggestion on Appendix pages 24 and 25 in the instance role play is not suitable for your class. Further support: Allocate the particular public services / organisations to groups within the class. Give students the opportunity to create a story board, enabling them to read the information, draw the scenario and make verbal suggestions on how to overcome this problem.Plenary: What do you now know about dementia? Remind the class: living with dementia can be frightening and lonely. However, with the right support and understanding, people with dementia can live well. Q: What could be done to ensure more people understand what dementia is and the challenges of living with this disease? Ask students what they could do to raise awareness of dementia and to feed back their ideas. Want to know more about dementia? Encourage students to talk to people at home about what they have learnt about dementia, the difficulties of living with dementia, and what can be done to support people. The more people that understand about it, the more people are likely to be understanding and help others within their community. Students could be encouraged to research local charities that support people in their community who are living with dementia. Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 221 SCAREDALONE SADLesson two Further challenges Activity one Feelings in a foreign country Ask the students to imagine that they have been asked to go to a foreign country. They have never been to this country, do not speak the local language, have no idea where they are going or what people are saying. (To set context: possibly play a foreign language clip). Discussion topics: Q: Why is this difficult? Q: How do you feel? Q: What would help you? Q: How might someone with dementiaActivity two Meeting someone with dementia This lesson focuses on students experiencing meeting someone with dementia from the school's local community / area. The aim of the lesson is for students to understand that it is possible to live well with dementia. The visitor would be invited into the school to talk to students about their life in the community and the local area when they were young and how it has changed. Discussion topics: Q: What are their needs to ensure they can continue living well with dementia? Q: What are their main challenges within the community? Q: How was life different before they had dementia? Q: How can young members of the community help?Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 222 Role play scenarios 23 Main activity alternative 24 Main activity alternative worksheet 25Lesson two appendix:Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 223Prepare a role play using one of these scenarios Scenario one: Anne is walking down the street and doesn't know where she lives.

Students will need to suggest ways in which public services and organisations can make their business and staff dementia-friendly. Those students who wish to challenge themselves could use the row labelled 'Other' to add another public service / organisation that hasn't been listed and apply the same principles. To help students with their task, they could be given one of the six scenarios from the role play activity to discuss and consider as they complete the table on the worksheet. The 'Small changes' video will also provide a useful insight into what it is like living with dementia and how some people fail to appreciate the needs of those living with dementia within the community.

Ask students to write down how they think a family might be affected if someone in their family was diagnosed with dementia. Q: How would they feel? Q: What impact might it have on the family? Students to feed back ideas and discuss as a class.5 minutes 25 minutes Main activity Remind students that dementia can affect the whole family, not just the person that has been diagnosed. Ask students to write a story or diary entry imagining that they are member of the Wilson family. Their entry could include the following: Which member of the Wilson family has dementia? How do they feel? (Do they understand what dementia is and how it affects the individual?) What things do they struggle to do? What can they do to help and support this person? What impact does dementia have on their family? Who in the family looks after the person with dementia? Further support: Give students the questions on paper with a series of sentence starters / writing frames to help them complete the activity as a written task. A picture sequence may also be useful as the students piece together the role of a carer.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 328 Want to know more about dementia? Ask students to carry out their own research into looking after a person living with dementia. This can be shared with the class in the next lesson.(Homework suggestion)Plenary: What do you now know about dementia? Discussion topics: Q: Can anyone be a carer? Q: What tasks might you have to do if you are a carer? Q: How does your life change when someone in your family is diagnosed with dementia?Lesson three Further challenges Activity one Independent research project - computer room Students to use computers to conduct their own research into carers and how to look after someone with dementia. They could use the worksheet on pages 30-31 to record their findings. Alternatively, students could use the questions on the worksheet to conduct research that they can present to the class. Activity two Appreciating the support available for carers Extend students' knowledge and understanding of carers by asking them to consider the help and support available for carers. Students will need to identify themes such as additional care, financial support, advice, equipment, etc. This could be set as a homework task or in a computer room.10 minutes Definition of a 'carer' \"A carer is anyone who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support. Anyone can become a carer; carers come from all walks of life, all cultures and can be of any age\" www.carers.org/what-carerCreating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 329 Further one carer worksheet 30Lesson three appendix:Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Lesson 330 Research the following questions What is a carer? What is the typical age of a carer of someone living with dementia? What tasks might a carer do? What might make a carer's life more difficult? How does your life change when you become a carer?

This might be something very simple, or a more complex electronic device. Advanced technology means that the internet and telecommunications can provide peace of mind for relatives, and enable people to continue living in their own home for longer. Assistive technology can: help people stay independent for longer improve quality of life for people with dementia and their carers.their design and label it.Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Further activities and building awareness34 Examples of assistive technology: Reminder messages: These remind people to pick up their keys or lock the front door Clocks and calendars: Automatic calendar clocks can be helpful for people who forget which day it is and what they should be doing Locator devices for inside the home: These can be attached to a key ring. If someone wants to find a particular item, they press a button and the item will beep until it has been located Devices to enable safer walking: Some people with dementia may wear or use devices that can be used to track their location if they are likely to walk about and get lostAutomatic pill dispensers: When medication needs to be taken, the dispenser beeps and the pill is released at the correct time in the correct dosage Discussion topics: How do the examples help people with dementia to be more independent? What other types of technological aids might help someone living with dementia? How would these devices help the carer/ members of the family?Main activity Once the class has an understanding of assistive and digital technology, task them with creating their own device. This could become a cross-curricular project with design and technology or science. Alternatively, learners could draw their design and label it, followed by a presentation of their ideas and a class vote on the design they think is the best. Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Further activities and building awareness35 How charities communicate Either individually or in small groups task students with creating their own awareness campaign idea. Ask students to think about an issue linked with dementia that they would like to improve, e.g. transport, communicating with people. This could be a national campaign, or targeted at the local community or school. They should research into how charities communicate with supporters and the general public and the input of people who are living with dementia in creating the campaign. Students can begin their research by looking at Alzheimer's Society campaigns such as, Dementia Awareness Week, 'Worried about your memory?' and Dementia Friends. Discussion topics: Q: What they like and dislike about the posters and videos. Q: How the posters and videos made them feel. Q: Who the audience is. Q: What they are being asked to do. Q: What kind of language is used. The following could be used as ideas for dementia-related campaigns: reducing stigma by explaining what dementia is recognising symptoms of dementia raising awareness of risk factors such as healthy diet and exercise raising awareness of a charity, such as Alzheimer's Society improving support for people with dementia or their carers.Want to know more about dementia? Ask students to design or create materials for their own campaign based on their idea, for example: posters, short videos, etc. The materials could be presented to the rest of the class in the next lesson or displayed around the school or in assemblies during Dementia Awareness Week, for example.(Homework suggestion)Creating a dementia-friendly generation - Further activities and building awareness36 Join in the fun and help raise vital funds for Alzheimer's Society.

The resources and lesson plans developed by Alzheimer's Society will help raise awareness amongst young people and create a dementia-friendly generation. As a school, we feel it is important to provide lessons on dementia for our young people as there are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK, with a prediction that this will rise to 2 million by 205 1. The lessons will develop learners' knowledge and understanding of dementia, but also provide them with valuable life skills in order to be able to help and support people in their family/community who may be living with dementia. Dementia is a sensitive topic and we appreciate that some learners may know/ have known someone affected by dementia, which could potentially cause them to feel upset. All learners taking part in the lessons will be reminded that they can speak to a member of the pastoral team for additional support, and parents/carers are also advised to speak to their son/daughter in advance of the lesson. As part of integrating learning about dementia into a wider whole school approach we welcome any parents/carers to either attend an assembly or to come into school to talk to our learners about their experience of supporting someone living with dementia. Please contact [insert contact details]. If you have any concerns or comments regarding this new curriculum opportunity, please contact [insert contact details] in the first instance. We look forward to implementing this scheme of work which we believe will enable our young people to become more aware of the issues connected with an ageing population and the ways in which they can become more active and responsible citizens.
