As the name suggests, star anise is in the shape of a star. Anise essential oil is obtained by steam distillation. It is recommended for use in aromatherapy, where it helps with respiratory issues, sleeping disorders and for calming. 10ml of anise essential oil is dosed in a beautiful packaging made of myron glass, which protects the oil from harmful sunlight for a long time. Only an invisible spectrum of sunlight is allowed inside, which allows the molecular structure of the oil to be preserved. Warning: The essential oil should not be used as a substitute for treatment or medicines. Oils can only help to treat a certain condition. Talk to your doctor first about any treatment with essential oils. Use the product responsibly. "}
