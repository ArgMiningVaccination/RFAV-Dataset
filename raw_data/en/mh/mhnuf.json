{"title": "The Inclusion of Chiropractic Care in the Healthy China Initiative 2030", "author": "Eric Chun-Pu Chu; Andy Fu Chieh Lin; Valerie Chu", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The Healthy China Initiative 2030 represents a major shift in China's healthcare policies for health promotion and disease prevention. Chiropractic care, with its focus on musculoskeletal health and nonpharmacological treatment, can contribute to the goals of this initiative. However, its potential contribution is hampered by the lack of official recognition and regulation in mainland China, which restricts its general awareness and integration into healthcare systems, and potentially leads to untreated musculoskeletal disorders. This research proposes the inclusion of chiropractic care in the Healthy China Initiative 2030 framework. It provides an overview of the goals of this initiative and the current state of chiropractic care in China. The alignment of chiropractic principles and practices with the aims of the Healthy China Initiative 2030 is also discussed. Policy recommendations for integrating chiropractic care into the healthcare system are proposed, which include the establishment of education standards, licensing protocols, and collaborative research initiatives. Potential challenges, including regulatory barriers, a lack of awareness, and research limitations are highlighted. We also present potential strategies to leverage opportunities for promoting chiropractic care, such as the rising demand for musculoskeletal care. This research provides the first focused discussion on the integration of chiropractic care into China's evolving preventive healthcare landscape under the Healthy China Initiative 2030.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-07", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
