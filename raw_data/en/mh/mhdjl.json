Health organisations have only recently begun to recognise the role of socio -psychological factors in vaccinatio n decisions. These factors are particularly important, given that they are inherently amenable to policy and behaviour change. This thesis employs a mixed -methods approach to investigate the determinants of adult seasonal influenza and tetanus vaccination in the UK general adult population. It focuses on socio - psychological factors and draws upon health behaviour models, heuristics and biases and customer journey mapping theoretical approaches to guide research and elucidate findings. A narrative and a systematic review and meta -analysis reveal there are a number of socio - psychological factors frequently associated with vaccination, particularly influenza and influenza vaccine risk perception, perceived vaccine effectiveness and reported physician recomm endation, and show that most of the evidence in this area is produced in the US. They also highlight the importance of some vaccine risk perceptions, such as influenza -like symptoms and unspecific side - effects, and demonstrate that the existing evidence is highly heterogeneous and often lacking in quality, further supporting a case for robust empirical research on this topic. Two qualitative studies show that vaccine uptake is largely driven by people's risk perception of influenza and tetanus, and that the tetanus vaccine is perceived as safe, unlike the influenza vaccine. They also reveal how specific healthcare 'touchpoints' across the immunisation journey can facilitate or hinder uptake. A novel finding is that certain childhood experiences can influence adult vaccination decisions. Two cross -sectional survey studies show that a compact set of variables can predict 91% of influenza and 75% of tetanus vaccination behaviour. They also demonstrate that socio -psychological factors are the most important deter minants of vaccination behaviour. This thesis shows that incorporating socio -psychological dimensions in all aspect of immunisation policy, from surveillance systems to policy evaluation, is critical to improve vaccination rates. 5 Achievements related to this thesis Peer reviewed publications 1 Wheelock A, Miraldo M, Thomson A, Vincent C and Sevdalis N.

Efforts to reduce global inequalities in childhood vaccination have been fruitful. By the end of 2010, 85% of infants worldwide had received the vaccination schedule recommended by the World Health Organi sation (WHO) (WHO and UNICEF, 2005) . In contrast, routine vaccination coverage in adults is often suboptimal (WHO and UNICEF, 2005; Zhang, While et al., 2011) . US mortality rates due to vaccine - preventable diseases illustrate this trend: while approximately 200 children die every year of these type of dis eases, annual adult deaths can reach 70,000 (Poland, Jacobson et al., 2009) . This gap has widened by the failure of vaccine development efforts to keep pace with rapid demographic changes ; whilst current vaccines were well suited to address the needs of a relatively young 20th century society , they are not designed to meet the health requirements of a population that is expected to live almost twice as long (Rappuoli, Mandl et al. , 2011) . In high -income countries, adult immunisation schedules comprise a number of vaccines usually designed for s pecific populations (e.g. older adults, those at risk of certain sexually transmitted disease s, etc.). Two vaccines are widely administered to different age groups : the seasonal influenza vaccine (hereinafter referr ed to as \"influenza vaccine\") and boosters\" or \"tetanus vaccines\") . A brief overview of the challenges posed by influenza and tetanus , and current efforts to prevent their occurrence , is prov ided next . Upper respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of vaccine -preventable mortality and morbidity among adults living in developed economies , and influenza is a major contributor to this burden of disease (GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2013) . Estimates show that influenza epidemics can cause up to 49,000 deaths every year in the US and 40,000 in the European Union (CDC (1), 2010; ECDC (1), 2015), and can cost billions in medical visits, hospitalisation and loss of pr oductivity (Ryan, Zoellner et al., 2006; WHO (1), 2014) . In most developed countries, a vaccine is recomm ended every year to those at higher risk of developing complications , that is people 65 years and older ( 65s) , people with certain chronic health cond itions , pregnant women and tho se in close contact with vulnerable individuals (56th World Health Assembly, 2003; Council of the European Union, 2009 ; CDC (2), 2010) . Despite continuous 20 efforts to improve influenza vaccination rates, uptake among high -risk groups remains below the minimum 75% coverage recommended by the WHO and the Council of the European Union (56th World Health Assembly, 2003; Council of the European Union, 2009) . For example, d uring th e 2013/2014 influenza season 65% of 65s and 46% of younger adults with eligible health conditions were vaccinated against influenza in the US (CDC, 2014). In the same season, influenza vaccination rates in the UK, one of the highest in Europe, were 73% in 65s and 53% in eligible younger adults (PHE, 2014). Importantly, excess mortality and morbidity due to influenza can be partly attributed to inadequate vaccination coverage , but also to partial vaccine efficacy (CDC (3), 2014) . In contrast, only 10-30 cases of tetanus are reported on average every year in high -income countries , mostly among inadequately immunised older people and injecting drug users (VENICE II and EC DC, 2010; CDC, 2012 ), yet tetanus mortality rate can reach 50% (ECDC (2), 2015) . Low tetanus incidence is attributed to safer healthcare practices , efficacious and long er-lasting vaccines , and effective childhood vaccination programmes (CDC, 2011) . However, uptake of adult tetanus boosters , which are recommended for all adults or certain at -risk individuals every 5 -20 years (depe nding on the country), remains substandard (CDC, 2011; ECDC (3), 2015) . In the US, for example, where a booster is routinely recommended every 10 years, 55-64% of adults received one in the past 10 years (Williams WW, Lu P -J et al., 2014 ). Uptake is also i nsufficient in Germany and France (both 73%) (Guthmann, Fonteneau, 2012; B\u00f6hmer, Walter, 2011) , albeit higher than in the US. To my knowledge, there are no publically available coverage data for adult tetanus boosters in the UK. The existing evidence on the determinants of influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, tetanus vaccination indicates that uptake is largely determined by healthcare system factors , demographic , socio -economic and health -related 2007; Johnson, 20 08; B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011; Silva, Perrier et al., 2015 ). While these categories of determinants are often interrelated, they encompass distinct sets of barriers and driv ers to vaccination. Healthcare system factors known to influence vaccination uptake , as might be expected, include vaccine availability and provision. Although t hese barriers are commonly associated with developing countries, they can also affect vaccinat ion coverage in developed economies, particularly during vaccine shortages (Brewer and Hallman, 2006) . Demographic, s ocio -economic and health -related factors that have predicted vaccination include age, health status, income and health insurance (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Xakellis, 20 05; Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ). Socio - psychological factors play a significant role in vaccination decisions and are increasingly rec ognis ed 21 as the 'Achilles heel' of immunisation (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlham mer, 2007; Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . For example, the perceived likelihood of acquiring a specific disease and the perceived benefits of vaccinating against it have been significantl y associated with higher uptake , whereas perceived harm from vaccinat ions has been found to have the opposite effect (Chapman and Coups, 1999; CDC, 2004 ; Tabbarah, Zimmerman et al., 2005; Kohlhammer, 2007 ). Identifying and addressing the constellation of factors that drive and hinder vaccination uptake is critical to maintain both individual and herd immunity. Yet, s ocio -psychological f actors are of particular interest , given that they are inherently amenable to policy and behavio ur change. Recent vaccine -related controversies , which have resulted in widespread vaccina tion refusal, illustrate the impor tance of monitoring public sentiment toward vaccination and responding rapidly and effectively when trust is compromised. In France, for example, errors of official risk communications about the effectiveness and safety of the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine against pandemic influenza in 2009/2010 , resulted in long lasting unfavourable attitudes toward vaccination in general, and a significant drop in seasonal influenza vaccination rates (Bone, Guthmann et al., 2010) . In the UK , a scare sparked by extensive media coverage of an artic le reporting a purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism (Wakefield, Murch et al., 1998) , which was later retracted, is still causing ripples and was partly blamed for a measles outbreak in Wales in 2013 (National Assembly for Wales, 2013) . In Japan, the Health M inistry recently issued a nationwide notice that HPV vaccination should no longer be recommended due to safety concerns after a string of alleged adverse events (The Japan Times, 2013) . The full effect of this decision on women's health and overall vaccination rates remains to be evaluated. A decline in public confidenc e in vaccines is an ongoing challenge which has been recognised by national and supranational health organisations. As a re sult, the WHO established the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization to provide advice on how to address vaccine hesitancy and its determinants (WHO (2), 2014) . Similarly, the US National Vaccination Advisory Committee has recently form ed the Vaccine Hesitancy Working Group to identify factors that drive confidence in vaccines to inform and evaluate future interventions (NVAC, 2013) . Public Health England , in conjunction with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) , has recently formed the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Immunisation at LSHTM, a 5 -year initiative aiming to undertake research to extend the implementation and coverage of existing vaccine policy, including work on communications, implementation and vaccine acceptability (LSHTM, 2014) . Vaccine manufacturers are also taking action against decreasing vaccine confidence, 22 through targeted advocacy and communication initiatives (Vaccines Europe, 2014) , and research funding such a s the grant supporting my work . Worryingly, the evidence likely to inform multilateral efforts to systematis e existing knowledge and explore better ways to measure and improve confidence in vacc ines has several gaps . First , the existing body of knowledge is methodologically disp arate and often lacking in quality (e.g. small convenience samples and non -validated measures). Secondly , most studies assess a limited number of constructs, which does not allow a robust assessment of the ir relative importance in predicting vaccination be haviour. Furthermore, socio -psychological predictors of vaccination are generally evaluated separately from demographic, socio -economic and health -related determinants; thus , the extent to which vaccination behaviour is predicted by socio -psychological fac tors over and above the population characteristics routinely collected in national health surveys, has not been systematically explored. Thirdly , the majority of studies are country and vaccine -specific, thus the validity of employed measures across differ ent countries and vaccines remains largely untested. Fourthly , key socio -psychological constructs that are likely to influence vaccination behaviour such as trust (in vaccines, manufacturer s, commissioners and providers), fear (of both diseases and vaccines), and personality variables and coping styles, such as overconfidence, information -seeking, avoidance and denial, remain largely unexplored (Miller, Brody et al., 1988; Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2007) . Lastly, most of th e evidence on adult vaccination focuses on influenza vaccination , particularly pandemic influenza, and studies evaluating socio -psychological factors influencing tetanus vaccination among the general population are scarce (Johnson, 2008; B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011) . Importantly, comparative analys es across different vaccines have not been undertaken to any great extent . Although the target populations of influenza and tetanus vaccines overlap , their schedule, composition and the diseases they are designed to prevent differ greatly . An in -depth exploration of the factors underlying the uptake of such different products can provide valuable insights into vaccination decisions and, in turn, result in a more meaningful contribution to science, policy and practice. The focus of this thesis is, therefore, on the determinants of adult seasonal influenza and tetanus vaccination uptake in the UK general adult population, as well as on key areas of convergence and divergence . This work forms part of a large scale multinational project aiming to identify the determinants of adult vaccination and to predict uptake in both developing and developed countries. I pay particular attention to socio -psychological factors and seek to address the identi fied gaps drawing upon health behaviour models such as the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1966 ) and the Protection Motivation Theory ( Rogers, 1975) , and two theoretical approaches: heuristics 1973; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) and Customer journey mapping (Tseng MM, Qinhai M et al., 1999; Dunn and Davis, 2002) .Pandemic influenza is beyond the remit of this research because perceptions around novel viruses and vaccines have been found to differ in nature and intensity from those associated with seasonal influenza and routine vaccination (Poland, Jacobson et al., 2009 ; Maurer, Uscher -Pines et al., 2010 ). This introductory chapter is split into three main parts. First, I provide an overview of adult vaccination in the UK, influenza and tetanus, and the corresponding vaccines and vaccination programmes . Secondly, I summarise the relevant models of health behaviour and other theoretical approaches used in this thesis, and their application to seas onal influenza and tetanus vaccination. I conclude this c hapter with an explication of the aims of my thesis and the rationale behind each of the ensuing chapters. 1.2 Adult vaccination in the UK Although vaccines have been available for use since the 1700s, most recommended adult vaccinations were introduced in the last few decades, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. (PHE (1), 2013 ). Over the years, the development of new and safer vaccines has led to variations in the schedule. These include the introduction of new vaccines (e.g. shingles), new routes of administration (e.g. intranasal), new targeted population groups (e.g. pregnant women) and improved products [e.g. multivalent (more than one virus strand), conjugated (more than one antigen/dise ase) and adjuvenated vaccines (contain an agent that enhances their efficacy)]. Note: adapted from the Historical vaccine development and introduction of vaccines in the UK (PHE (1), 2013). Armed forces1; people with tetanus -prone wounds2; at risk groups3; temporary pandemic flu4; pregnant women5 Figure 1.1 Timeline of introduction of key adult vaccines in the UK Currently, a dults in the UK are recommended to receive a series of vaccinations when they reach a certain age (usually 65 s) or if they belong to a specific risk group. For the first time in 2013, a comprehensive vaccination schedule was published by the National Health Service (NHS), which comprises all the recommended vaccines across an individual's lifespan (NHS (1), 2013) . The adult vaccination section of the schedule is summarised in Table 1.1. 1930s 1950s 1960s 1970s to the routinely recommended vaccines, selec ted vaccinations are offered free of charge to those who are in contact with vulnerable individuals, or who are exposed to particular risks due to their occupation, incomplete or unknown vaccination history or life -style choices. These are: chickenpox vaccine, BCG (tuberculosis) vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine and MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubell a) for non -immune adults. Vaccines against some travel -related infections are also freely available, including diphtheria, polio and tetanus (tetanus -containing booster), typhoid, hepatitis A (including when combined with typhoid or hepatitis B) and choler a. Other travel vaccines privately provided at a cost are: hepatitis B (when not combined with hepatitis A), Japanese encephalitis, tick - borne encephalitis, meningococcal meningitis, rabies, tuberculosis (TB) and yellow fever. Individuals who do not meet t he NHS eligibility criteria described above can obtain influenza vaccines at a cost.

Other eligible people include: pregnant women, th ose living in a long -stay residential care home or other long -stay care facility, carers of an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk, healthcare professionals or social care workers with direct patient contact (NHS (2), 2014) . The vacci nation policy and schedule in the UK is decided by the Department of Health, with the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The JCVI is an independent committee and statutory body constituted by expert and lay members. Its m ission is to review the existing evidence on the burden of disease, on vaccine safety and efficacy and on the impact and cost effectiveness of vaccination strategies in order to make objective recommendations to UK health departments (JCVI, 2013) . As shown in Figure 1.2, the successful implementation of vaccination programmes in the UK depends upon a number of interrelated aspects, from vaccine development and delivery to vaccine acceptance. 25 Adult vaccinations are commonly recommended and administered by a general practitioner (GP) or nurse within the primary care setting. Whilst most adult vaccines are delivered free of charge in primary care settings to those who are eligible, some vaccines are also in secondary care facilities such Accidents & Emergency Departments (A&E) , or at a cost in pharmacies and other commercial outlets. Note: adapted from The aims of vaccination: national policy and schedules (HPA, 2011) . Figure 1.2 Components of vaccination programmes Depending on the vaccination programme, official communication strategies range from mass media national campaigns and internet -based information, to leaflets provided in GP practices and personalised invitations. Unofficial sources of information, particu larly internet -based, are prevalent and widely accessed (Bish, Yardley et al., 2011) . While some of these sources, such as university - based websites, pharmacy websites, and websites sponsored by pharmaceutical companies provide evidence which largely coinc ide with the information provided by the NHS, others, such as personal blogs and websites sponsored by purported \"natural \" products such as vitamin and nutritional supplements , often provide a distorted account of vaccination safety and effectiveness (Natural News, 2015) .

This is partly because adult vaccines have different schedules and most are only recommended for specif ic populations such as people in their late te ens and early twenties (e.g. human papilloma virus), the elderly (e.g. herpes zoster and p neumococcal) and those who are trave lling to particular countries (hepatitis A, y ellow fever). 1.3 Influenza 1.3.1 Influenza and the influenza vaccine Influenza i s an acute and highly contagious respiratory viral infection. In the northern hemisphere, influenza commonly occurs during the winter season. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B and C. Influenza A viruses are the most common and the cause of m ost epidemics, and in some cases pandemics. Influenza B viruses are generally milder and the cause of smaller outbreaks. Influenza is usually transmitted by becoming in contact with respiratory secretions of an infected individual with an incubation period ranging from 1 -3 days (PHE, 2015 ). The most common symptoms of influenza are fever, chills, headache, myalgia, fatigue, dry cough ,sore throat and congested nose (PHE, 2015 ). In healthy people, influenza symptoms are usually mild to moderate and can last between 2 -7 days (PHE, 2015 ). Influenza, however, can lead to complications such as bronchitis and secondary bacterial pneumonia , and can be particularly serious among older people, those with chronic health conditions such as chronic respiratory, heart, k idney, liver and neurological diseases, diabetes, immunosuppression and asplenia, and pregnant women (PHE, 2015 ). Influenza viruses suffer small changes overtime commonly known as \"antigenic drift\" and \"antigenic shift\" (CDC (3 ), 2010) . Antigenic drift re sults in new virus strands that may not be recognised by the body's immu ne system. Antigenic shift is a sudden, major change in the influenza A viruses that produces a new influenza A subtype to which the population may have little or no immunity. This novel virus can lead to widespread epidemics or pandemics such as the one caused by the new N1H1 virus in 2009 (CDC (3 ), 2010) . Most hospitalisations and influenza -related deaths are among those in clinical high -risk groups, particularly the elderly (PHE (3 ), 2013) . The excess winter deaths potentially attributable to influenza fluctuate significantly depending on different factors, notably, the type of circulating viruses, the match between these and the strands contained in the vaccine and vaccine coverage (PHE, 2015 ; CDC (1), 2015) . 27 Due to the changing nature of influenza viruses, different vaccines are produced every year. These vaccines contain the predominant virus strands which are expected to circulate in the forthcoming winter for both the northern and southern hemispheres, acco rding to WHO recommendations (WHO (3), 2014) . The effectiveness of influenza vaccines depends upon two main factors: 1) individuals' characteristics (e.g. age and health) and 2) the match between the vaccine and circulating viruses (CDC (3), 2014) . Most i nfluenza vaccines are trivalent and contain two subtypes of influenza A and one B virus. Quadrivalent vaccines, which include an additional B virus, were available in the UK for the first time in 2013 and are expected to decrease influenza morbidity and mortality, as it matches a wider spectrum of circulating strands (PHE, 2015 ). The partial effectiveness of influenza vaccines, however, continues to challenge health systems, particularly when the circulating and vaccine strands are mismatched. A recent comp rehensive systematic review and meta -analysis found that current influenza vaccines are overall moderately effective against infection and illness, yet in some seasons and age groups (e.g. over 65s) the level of protection was low or non -existent (Osterhol m, Kelley et al., 2012) . Therefore, promising results in developing a universal long -lasting influenza vaccine would most likely improve its efficacy and significantly reduce the burden of influenza -associated illness (Pica and Palese, 2013) . 1.3.2 Influenza vaccination in the UK An annual influenza vaccine is offered free of charge through GP surgeries to those at higher risk of morbidity and mortality, usually between October and January. This includes people 65 years of age and under 65s with certain medical conditions such as asthma, heart disease and diabetes, and also those who are in close contact with at risk -individuals, such as healthcare professionals and healthy family members (NHS (2), 2014) . The aim of the current influenza vaccination progr amme is to protect people at higher risk of infl uenza -related complications, but also to reduce transmission. WHO guidance recommends a minimum coverage of 75% in older people living in high -income countries (56th World Health Assembly, 2003) . Similarly, the European Union Council has encouraged its members to vaccinate at least 75% of high -risk populations (Council of the European Union, 2009) . This proposed coverage, however, is insufficient to establish herd immunity (80% of healthy people and 90% of hi gh-risk individuals) (Plans -Rubi\u00f3, 2012) . Despite widely available influenza vaccination, influenza and pneumonia are the 4th highest cause of death in women and the 6th in men the UK (ONS (2), 2013) . In some winters, as many as 25,000 deaths can be attri buted to this disease in the UK (HPA, 2012) . This is due to both partial vaccine effectiveness and insufficient vaccination coverage. As shown in Figure 1.3 , in 2013/2014, although a 28 relatively high percentage of people aged 65 and older received an influenza vaccine (73%), uptake among under 65s with chronic medical conditions was inadequate (53%) (PHE (1), 2014) . Similar coverage was observed during the previous influenza season (2012 /2013), which resulted in over 10,000 deaths due to influenza -related illness (PHE (4 ), 2013) . Data from Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Uptake amongst GP Patient Groups in England (PHE (2), 2014) Figure 1.3 Seasonal influenza vaccination uptake estimates by year in England 1.4 Tetanus 1.4.1 Tetanus and the tetanus vaccine Tetanus is a serious infe ction caused when the bacteria c lostridium tetani, which is present in soil or manure, becomes in contact with a puncture wound, burn or scratch (PHE (5 ), 2013) . The tetanus bacteria then release a neurotoxin which affects nerve function. Tetanus has an incubation period of between four and 21 days and its symptoms include muscle stiffness usually involving the jaw (lockjaw) and neck. Mortality ranges from 10 to 90% and it is highest in infants and the elderly (PHE (5), 2013) . The tetanus vaccine contains tetanus toxoid, a cell -free purified to xin extracted from a strand of clostridium tetani, and in high -income countries , it is only available as a combined vacc ine such as the tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated polio vaccine (Td/IPV), the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis and inactivated polio vaccine (DTaP/IPV or dTaP/IPV) or the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio and h aemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTaP/IPV/Hib) (CDC (2), 2015; NHS (3), 2014) . Common side -effects include pain, swelling or redness at the injection site and 0102030405060708090100 Under 65 at risk 65 and over29 may occur more frequently following subsequent doses (Miller, 1999) . Confirmed post -vaccinat ion anaphylaxis occurs extremely rarely (PHE (5), 2013) . Tetanus -prone wounds in unprotected individuals are normally treated with intravenous or intramuscular tetanus immunoglobulin. Post -injury tetanus vaccination is not recommended as treatment since it may not boost immunity early enough to provide the required protection within the incubation period of the disease (Porter, Perkin et al., 1992) . 1.4.2 Tetanus vaccination in the UK Tetanus vaccination was first introduced in the UK Armed Forces in 1938, and na tionally in 1961 (PHE (1), 2013 ). Tetanus primary vaccination is a five -dose course starting in childhood, which according to the NHS, should provide life -long vaccination (NHS (3), 2014) . The first three doses are given in the DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine for babies at two, three and four months of age, followed by a booster of the DTaP/IPV vaccine administered at around four years of age, and a final Td/IPV booster given to children between 13 a nd 18 years. A full five -dose course is also recommended for immunosuppressed patients, for individuals whose vaccination status is uncertain and those born before 1961 who may not have been immunised in infancy (NHS (3), 2014) . A tetanus, diphtheria and polio booster (Td/IPV) is currently only recommended as a travel vaccine for adults who have not been vaccinated before or have not been fully vaccinated, those who are travelling to a country with limited medical facilities, and those whose last dose of the tetanus vaccine was more than 10 years ago (NHS (3), 2014) . In 2012, a tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and polio (DTaP/IPV) booster was introduced for pregnant women as a response to increased neonatal mortality due to pertussis (NHS (2), 2014 ). Althou gh tetanus cases in the UK are rare (83 reported infections in last 10 years in England and Wales, mostly among people over 65s) (HPA, 2014) , evidence suggests that people born before 1961, the year in which tetanus vaccination was introduced to the nation al routine childhood programme, are disproportionally affected due to inadequate vaccination (Department of Health, Scottish Executive Health Department et al., 2006) . Therefore, experts have recommended a dual vaccination policy: one for those who were bo rn before 1961 (full primary course of vaccinations or boosters as required) and other for those who were born after that year (a booster every 20 years) (Bracebridge, Crowcroft et al., 2004) . Worryingly, a recent study concluded that low tetanus rates in the UK may be partly due to the misalignment between current tetanus vaccination guidelines and A&E departments' approach to 30 tetanus prevention - when in doubt err on the side of vaccination (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) . This mismatch between policy and practice may also be occurring in primary care settings. 1.5 Understanding adult vaccination behaviour As noted at t he beginning of this c hapter, previous research on influenza vaccination and emerging evidence on tetanus vaccination have shown that their upta ke is significantly influenced by socio - psychological factors (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlhammer, 2007; Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007; Johnson, 2008; B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011 ). Research focusing upon the socio -psychological aspects of influenza vaccina tion often uses health behaviour models to understand and predict vaccination uptake, albeit with varying degrees of success (Montano, 1986; Nex\u00f8e, Kragstrup et al., 1999; Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . The premise of these models is that social cognitions , the processes through which people make sense of other people and themselves (Fiske and Taylor, 2013) , are proximal determinants of behaviour and that these cognitions are modifiable, thus they constitute a powerful mechanism to triggering behaviour chan ge. Importantly, health behaviour models acknowledge that individuals' decision -making processes are influenced by their social context, beliefs and attitudes, and often driven by intuition rather than rational thought (Kahneman, Slovic et al., 1982) . An outline of the main models of health behaviour and their relevance to influenza vaccination is provided below. 1.5.1 Health behaviour models and influenza vaccination Four models have been frequently used to explain influenza vaccination behaviour: The Health Belief Model (HBM) (Rosenstock, 1966) , the Theory of Reasoned Action and Ajzen, 1975; Ajzen and Fishbein, 1977) , which of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985; Ajzen, 1991) , and the Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (TIB) (Triandis, 1977) . An important limitation of health behaviour theories is that they focus on individual beliefs and perceptions as determinants of behaviour , and overlook policy and social context factors which can significantly influence preventive behaviour s such as vaccination (Brewer & Rimer, 2008 ). Another shortfall is the notion that intention causes behaviour , a relationship that has been disproved in a number of studies (Webb & Sheeran, 2006). Further, m ost studies testing these theories use correlational rather than experimental designs, thus the proposed causal links between pr edictors and behaviour have often been erroneously inferred (Weinstein, 2007) . Moreover , research employing these models use measures of varying quality , thus their findings may not be comparable. Despite the se shortcomings, health behaviour models , particularly when used in combination (Brewer & Rimer, 2008 ), offer a useful set of well-defined constructs to study the social -cognitive processes that might 31 underlie i ndividuals' vaccination choices (Ogden, 2003) , some of which are highly predictive of vaccination behaviour (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . The HBM postulates that health behaviour depends upon three categories of factors occurring simultaneously: suffic ient motivation or health concern (perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease) and the perceived benefits (e.g. effectiveness) and costs (e.g. side -effects) of the response or intervention, in this case, vaccination (Rosenstock, 1966) . Later m odifications of the model incorporated cue to action (internal or external stimuli which trigger a health behaviour), self - efficacy (confidence in own ability to carry out a health behaviour) and modifying variables such as demographic (e.g. age and sex) and socio -psychological factors (e.g. social influences and personality traits) (Rosenstock, Strecher et al., 1988) . A frequent criti cism of the HBM is that it a simple catalogue of variables which predict behaviour (Prentice -Dunn and Rogers, 1986) , rather than an explanatory model. Furthermore, the HBM omits emotional factors such as fear, which may significantly influence behaviour. A lthough the HBM explains influenza vaccination only modestly (Montano, 1986) , it provides a relevant set of constructs, most of which have been found to be associated with vaccination ac ceptance, particularly perceived disease and vaccine risks, as well as vaccine effectiveness (Larson, Olsen et al., 1979; Chapman and Coups, 1999; Nex\u00f8e, Kragstrup et al., 1999) . The TRA postulates that intention is the best predictor of behaviour, and that intention is, in turn, determined by individuals' attitude s toward the specific behaviour (belief toward an outcome and evaluation of the outcome) and their subjective norms (what experts think and motivation to comply with others) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) . The TPB, the successor of TRA, suggests that the achievement o f a health behaviour depends upon motivation (intention), which is influenced by beliefs and attitudes (behavioural beliefs and attitudes toward the behaviour), social norms (normative beliefs and subjective norms) and ability (control beliefs and perceive d behavioural control) (Ajzen, 1985; Ajzen, 1991) . These models, however, also overlook emotional aspects such as fear, regret or past experience, and assume that individuals have the opportunities and resources to achieve the behaviour. Although attitudes and social norms are significantly associated with influenza vaccination uptake, perceived behavioural control does not appear to be linked to influenza vaccination behaviour (Montano, 1986; Gallagher and Povey, 2006) . Similarly, the TIB theorises that behaviour is a function of intention, habit and facilitating (or constraining) conditions, and that intention is shaped by attitudes (beliefs about outcomes and rational evaluation of outcomes), social factors (norms, roles and self -concept) and affective factors (emotions) (Triandis, 1977) . Importantly, the TIB conceives habit as a heuristic or shortcut, which 32 minimises the cognitive effort required to make periodic decisions, and postulates that the repeated experience of a behaviour leads to an increased influence of habit and a decline of the importance of intention (Triandis, 1977) . Studies using TIB to explain influenza vaccination behaviour have shown that the model's constructs, particularly habit, are good predictors of intention to vaccinate and, t o a lesser extent, of vaccination uptake (Montano, 1986; Zimmerman, Nowalk et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., 2003; Nowalk, Zimmerman et al., 2004) . Other relevant approaches with a focus on affect, which have successfully predicted health behavi ours but are yet to be used in the context of vaccination , are the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) (Rogers, 1975; Maddux and Rogers, 1983) and the Risk -as-Feelings hypothesis. The PMT originated from research on fear appeals (communications about a thre at) and postulates that information sources (verbal persuasion, observational learning, personality variables, prior experience, etc.) initiate cognitive activity (cognitive mediating processes), which lead to protection motivation and later to health prot ective behaviour. A process of threat appraisal (perceived severity of and vulnerability to the threat, and fear) and a process of coping appraisal (perceived self -efficacy, perceived response effectiveness and perceived response cost), in which the option s of minimising a threat are evaluated, can lead to either adaptive coping (protection motivation) or maladaptive coping (response that may lead to health risk - e.g. avoidance). The Risk -as-Feelings hypothesis (Slovic, Finucane et al., 2004) proposes that immediate visceral reactions to risky situations, such as fear and anxiety, often drive behaviour, and are sometimes strikingly divergent from the cognitive assessment of those risks. Consistently, recent studies have found that feelings about influenza c an be better predictors of vaccination uptake than cognitive evaluations (Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2007; Liao, Wong et al., 2013) . In sum, the evidence shows that these models are comprised of a number of often overlapping constructs, some of which have consistently predicted influenza vaccination uptake. This thesis intend s to further investigate the relevance of these constructs , alongside other individual and contextual barriers and drivers, to influenza and tetanus vaccination behaviour through a broa der narrative review of the literature and a more focused systematic review and meta -analysis (Chapters 2 and 3), an in -depth exploration of the factors underpinning vaccination decisions (Chapters 4 and 5) and a quantitative assessment of the ability of s aid constructs to predict vaccination uptake when evaluated simultaneously (Chapter 6 and 7). 33 1.5.2 Heuristics and biases A significant body of research has demonstrated that when people are unable to assess risk using statistical reasoning they often rely on he uristics, an experience -based and intuitive approach used to facilitate decision -making (Meehl, 1954; Simon, 1957; Kahneman and psychologists have termed \"cognit ive shortcuts\" , in other words, they allow an inference to be made regarding risk without going through n umerous analytical calculations . A frequently used heuristic is availability, the tendency to make judgements about the frequency or probability of an event based on the ease with which a similar episode can be recalled (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) . The use of this heuristic could yield accurate actions but it could also lead to erroneous decisions. For example, a high -risk individual may be prompted to have a n influenza vaccine after being exposed to extensive media coverage about one single influenza -related death. The following season, he may decide not to have the influenza vaccine due to a friend experiencing side-effects (e.g. influenza -like sympto ms) after receiving a n influenza vaccine. In both cases, his decision -making is determined by the ease with which the risks associated with influenza or the influenza vaccine spring to mind (which vary between the two seasons), as opposed to the statistica l probability of experiencing either adverse effect (which may be constant across the two seasons). The first decision, however, is aligned with current vaccination recommendations, whereas the second is not. Additionally, it has been established that peop le's evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is often biased by their pre -existent belief in the truth or falsity of the conclusion (Evans and Curtis - Holmes, 2005) . For example, if the same high -risk individual distrusts the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry and prefers alternative medicine instead, it is likely that the news about an influenza -related death will have a lesser impact on his vaccination decision than his friend's reported side -effects - due to mentally over -weig hting the vaccine adverse effects, which are consistent with his pre -existing beliefs. Importantly, belief -based decision -making need not be conscious (Haidt, 2001; Wilson, 2009) . Thus, a decision based on intuition may be later post - rationalised and expla ined using analytical -sounding arguments, when in reality cost -benefit analysis was not employed. Consequently, this thesis seeks to go beyond explicit enquiry to elicit actual drivers of vaccination - as opposed to readily available information or post -decisional rationalisations - by developing and testing a new qualitative approach and undertaking an in -depth exploration of psychological and contextual factors that may provide a broader picture of what motivates or deters people from 34 vaccinating (Chapters 4 and 5). Additionally, my work attempts to minimise common research biases such as social desirability bias , by carefully considering the order and phrasing of questions and statements of qualitative and quantitative empirical studies . 1.5.3 Customer journey mapping The c ustomer journey mapping approach is commonly used in service design to capture and evaluate people's experience of different services (Shostack, 1984; Bitner, 1992; Kingman -Brundage, 1992 ; Tseng MM, Qinhai M et al., 1999) . Although so me elements may be more important than others, this approach considers the overall experience of the service user as the result of every element in a journey through a service. Although the customer journey mapping approach has been mainly used by the tran sport and tourism industries, it has also enabled health providers to improve their service provision by uncovering key areas which deserve attention and focus improvement efforts on such areas (Westbrook, Coiera et al., 2007) . Of particular note is \"the b rand touchpoint wheel \" developed a decade ago by Dunn and Davies (Dunn and Davis, 2002) . This conceives the customer journey as a wheel comprised of three main stages (pre -purchase, purchase and post - purchase experience) and a number of \"touchpoints \", whic h are key points at which the consumer interacts with a particular pr oduct or service (see Figure 1.4 ).

Figure 1.4 The brand touchpoint wheel Website Advertising Collateral Product assortment Point of purchase displays Parts delivery Customer service Billing Loyalty programs Product quality Product performance Pre - purchase experience Purchase experience Post - purchase experience Brand touchpoint wheel 35 Further investigation into the applicability of this approach to adult vaccination behaviour will be undertaken as part of this this thesis (Chapter 5). The aim is to explore how people's experience of health services and immunisation communications impact s uptake, and which areas require improvement. 1.6 Thesis aims and rationale A growing body of empirical literature has demonstrated that social and psy chological factors significantly influence adult vaccination decisions. However, in the UK and elsewhere, efforts to robustly investigate, monitor and incorporate these factors into immunisation policies and communication strategies have been insufficient. This, in turn, may partly explain the limited success of some adult vaccination programmes. At a time when national and international health organisations are beginning to recognise the importance of understand ing and address ing vaccine hesitancy and its determinants , it is critical that we take stock of the existing evidence , evaluate its gaps and methodological weaknesses, and develop better tools to measure vaccination behaviour . As illustrated in Figure 1.5 , drawing upon the theoretical perspectives pre sented in the previous section, this thesis focuses on gaining in -depth understanding of adult influenza and tetanus vaccination behaviour in the UK , and developing evidence -based survey tool s to better explain and predict uptake . My overall hypothesis is that socio -psychological factors are better predictors of vaccination behaviour than commonly monitored population characteristics. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, t his programme of research is part of a larger multinational project undertaken in collaborati on with Sanofi Pasteur (a pharmaceutical company), Ipsos MORI and Double Helix (market research companies). This work will be made available to industry and policymakers seeking to track vaccination sentiment and to inform and evaluate interventions. A na rrative review will aim to provide an overview of the empirical evidence on aspects associated with influenza vaccination behaviour among adults in high -income countries and to identify the most salient socio -psychological factors underpinning vaccination uptake . The latter factors will be systematic ally review ed and meta -analysed to estimate the strength and variability of the associations between such factors and influenza vaccination, and to identify moderators of these relationships (e.g. sample size, study design, measure quality, etc.). Qualitative s tudies will then investigate in depth the socio -psychological factors influencing the uptake of influenza and tetanus vaccines in the UK, by exploring how people's context and experiences shape their belie fs, attitudes and behaviour toward these vaccines. These studies will also evaluate whether the identified factors are comparable between vaccines or vaccine -specific. Lastly, findings from the literature reviews and 36 the qualitative studies will inform the development and testing of two survey tools aiming to identify the determinants of influenza and tetanus vaccination and t o predict vaccination behaviour, as well as to examine whether vaccination determinants are comparable across vaccines and to ascerta in the importance of socio -psychological factors in relation to population characteristics and practical barriers . This research was approved by the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (see Appendices 2 and 3 ). Figure 1.5 PhD research design overview The specific objectives of this thesis are: i. To review and evaluate the existing evidence on the socio -psychological factors influencing the uptake of adult influenza and tetanus vacci nes (Chapters 2 and 3). ii. To identify the drivers and barriers of adult vaccination in the UK, specifically influenza and tetanus, and to assess whether they are comparable or vaccine -specific (Chapter 4). iii. To explore in depth the wi der constellation of factors likely to influence adult influenza and tetanus vaccination decisions in the UK over time , and to ascertain differences and commonalities between vaccines (Chapter 5). iv. To develop and test survey tools to identify the determinants of adult influenza and tetanus vaccination in the UK and to assess whether they are comparable across vaccines , to examine whether socio -psychological factors are better predictors of vaccination than population characteristics and practical barriers , and to predict vaccination behaviour (Chapter s 6 and 7).

Research investigating the causes of low seasonal influenza vaccination rates has demonstrated the importance of socio -psychological factors on vaccination uptake , as synthesised by three reviews of the literature (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlhammer, 2007 ; Ward and Draper, 2008 ). Chapman and Coups identified vaccine effectiveness and perceived likelihood of side -effects, perceived risks associated with influenza, previous vaccination and a physician recommendation as the most relevant predictors of vaccination ( Chapman and Coups, 1999 ). Similarly, Kohlhammer showed that a physician recommendation, perceived vaccine effectiveness and side -effects, and perceived influenza risks were the most frequently reported factors influencing vaccination (Kohlhammer, 2007 ). Lastly, Ward and Draper foun d that previous vaccination , concerns about the vaccine, perceived risks of contracting influenza and advice and information regarding the vaccine were associated with uptake ( Ward and Draper, 2008 ). The two most recent reviews, however, include a relativ ely small number of studies (10 -14) and focus on the elderly (Kohlhammer, 2007 ; Ward and Draper, 2008 ). Furthermore, they were published before the A(H1N1 ) pandemic influenza in 2009/2010 and the controversies around the vaccine that ensued , which had a negative impact on people's attitudes toward seas onal influenza vaccination (Poland, Jacobson et al., 2009; Maurer, Uscher -Pines et al., 2010 ; Bone, Guthmann et al., 2010 ). Given that people's views about vaccines are shaped by continually changing contextual factors (Larson, Cooper et al., 2011) , an up -to date review of the empirical evidence is needed to identify the social and psychological aspects underpinning influenza vaccination decisions among adult s. 38 2.1.1 Study aim s This study has three aims : i) to synthesise the available evidence and provide an up -to-date overview of the socio -psychological factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among adults in the high -income countries ; ii) to identify the most salient socio -psychological factors underpinning vaccina tion behaviour; iii) to evaluate areas that require attention and identify directions for further research. 2.2 Methods: search , selection criteria and synthesis strategy I conducted searches in MED LINE, P sycINFO and EMBASE using the OVID interface and reviewed references from seminal articles. I included English -language articles reporting qualitative and quantitative data on socio -psychological factors of influenza vaccination in adults , published from the date databases started until December 2012. The main search terms were vaccine(s), immunisation(s), influenza, flu, elderly, older, chronic disease, factor, determinant, social, psychological, attitude, behavio( u)r, belief and decision -making . Preliminary searches yielded only two articles on tetanus vaccination behaviour, thus this review focuses only on influenza vaccination for consistency . The outcome measure was vaccination uptake. I excluded reviews, articles with no primary data (e.g. editorials or commentaries), articles that conflated multiple constructs and those focusing on healthcare professionals and pregnant women, as their vaccination decision -making processes are significa ntly influenced by those they care for and/or regulated by healthcare authorities and professional bodies, thus some of their motivations and concerns may differ (Tong, Biringer et al., 2008 ; Riphagen Dalhuisen, 2012; Meharry, Colson et al., 2013) . No stud y was exclude d based on quality, as I sought to capture all potential determinants reported in the literature. Psychological factors include d thoughts, feelings, emotions, subjective percep tions and understanding, and social factors encompass ed social netw orks, community, family and environment (Hewstone, Stroebe et al., 2012) . Although healthcare system barriers were not the focus of this review , I included perceptions relating to such barriers (e.g. perceived lack of vaccine availability in subsequent seasons after a shortage). The retrieved articles (both quantitative and qualitative) were qualitatively analysed by two coders - one coder analysed 100% of the articles (myself) and the second analysed 50% (Dr Stephanie Russ) . The reported data were synthesis ed into relevant themes using an inductive thematic analysis approach, in which codes are derived from the extracted data and refined as the analysis progresses 39 (Brown, Long et al., 2012) . There were no significant disagreements between coders. Based on this approach, relevant socio -psychological factors were identified and synthesised into broad themes (see themes definition in Appendix 4) . 2.3 Results Forty -five articles met the inclusion criteria . Twenty -six articles reported data from the US (Carter, 1986; Ganguly and Cameron, 1989; Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; and Viscoli, 1991; Nichol, Mac Donald et al., 1996; Chapman and Coups, 1999; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Abel, McGaha et al., 2003; Madhavan, Rosenbluth CDC, 2004; Zimmerman et Zimmerman et 2005; Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Chapman and Coups, 2006; Winston, Weinstein, Kwitel Frew, Painter et al., 201 2; Shim, Chapman et al., 2012) , nine from the UK (Honkanen, Keistinen et al., 1996; 2006; et al., 2006; Evans, Prout et 2007; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007; Colley, 2008) , three fro m the Netherlands ( van E ssen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (1), 1997; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (2), 1997; Opstelten, Hak et al., 2001; ), two from Spain (Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; Rodriguez - Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006) , and one from Italy (Pregliasco , Sodano et al., 1999) , Canada (Roy, Fradet et al., 1996) , Israel (Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010), Singapore (Tan, Lim et al., 2010) and Hong Kong (Lau, Yang et al., 2006). Three articles reported qualitative data (Telford and Rogers, 2003 ; Evans, Prout et al., 2007; Wray, 2007 ). To analyse a fairly complex evidence base, a simple coding scheme was developed: f or all the identified themes, I first counted the times the factor had been studied and whether it ha d been linked to v accination uptake or refusal. I then rank -ordered th e factors from those most researched to those least researched. The results are presented in Figure 2.3. In the following sections, I summarise the existing evidence around eight themes: social influence, disease related factors, vaccine related factor s, habit, general beliefs and perceptions toward health and vaccines, awareness, practical barriers and motivators, and altruism. Demographic, socio - economic and health -related factors that emerged from the review as associated with uptake are only briefly summaris ed, as these were outside the scope of this study . 40 Factor reported by unvaccinated participants Factor reported by vaccinated participants Note: t hemes are in descending order from most recurrent factor. The grey and orange bars illustrate the number of papers addressing each factor reported by unvaccinated and vaccinated participants , respectively.

A recommendation f rom a healthcare professional was the most mentioned motivator for vaccination (Carter, 1986; Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Roy, Fradet et al., van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (1), 1997; Pregliasco, Sodano et al., 1999; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Lewis - Parmar and McCann, 2002; Mangtani, Breeze 2006; Gough et et al., Cobler, 2004; Zimmerman et al., Zimmerman and and Povey, 2006; Rodriguez z, Gaton Amo et al., 2006; Winston, Wortley et al., 2006; Evans, Prout et 2010; Frew, Painter et al., 2012) . Doctors not recommending vaccination was also reported as a rea son for not receiving the influenza vaccination (Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Fiebach and Viscoli, 1991; Mayo and Cobler, 2004; Johnson, 2008) . Similarly, there was some evidence that a recommendation or bad exp erience from family members or friends persuade d or dissuade d people from vaccinating against influenza , respectively (Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., et al., 2004; Gallagher Povey, 2006; Mangtani, Breeze et al., 2006) . 2.3.2 Disease related factors Perceive d susceptibility to , or likelihood of, catching influenza was an important incentive to vaccinate (Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et (1), 1997; Abel, al., et al., et al., Brewer Breeze et al., 2006; -Rodriguez, Gaton Amo et al., 2006; Evans, Prout et al., 2007; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007; Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2 007; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010; Tan, Lim et al., 2010; Shim, Chapman et al., 2012) , as was anticipated regret or worry that people associate d with contracting in fluenza in the future if they did not get vaccinated (Chapman and Coups, 2006; Gallagher and Povey, 2006; Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2007) . Misperceptions about own risk of contracting influenza were also common among unvaccinated participants , even those at higher risk of infection (Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Ab el, 42 McGaha et al., 2003; Telford and 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez 2004; Tabbarah, Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010 ). Similarly , vaccination was more frequent among those who believe d influe nza was a serious disease (Carter, 1986; Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; Roy, Fradet et al., 1996; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (1), 1997; van Ess en, Kuyvenhoven et al. (2), 1997; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Bekker, Gough et al., 2003; Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Lau, Yang et al., 2006; Rodriguez - Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007) , while there is some indication that those who were not vaccinated may underestimate the severity of influenza (Carter, 1986; Opstelten, Hak et al., 2001; Evans, Prout et al., 2007; Wray, 2007) . 2.3.3 Vaccine related factors Perceived vaccine protectiveness was often reported as a vaccination driver (Carter, 1986; Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; Honkanen, Keistinen et al., 1996; Nichol, Mac Donald et al., 1996; Roy, Fradet et al., 1996; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (1), 1997; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (2), 1997; Chapman and Coups , 1999; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, Abel, Telford Rogers, 2003; al., 2003; Santibanez et al., Nowalk, Zimmerman et Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Gallagher and Povey, 2006; Lau, Yang e t al., 2006; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007; Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2007; Althoff, Anastos et al., 2010) , while unvaccinated participants mention ed the limited effectiveness of the vaccine as one of the reasons behind their decision to abstain from vacci al., 2007; Wray, 2007; Johnson, 2008) . I also found some evidence that people who believe that influenza vaccination ameliorates the symptoms of influenza were more prone to receive it (Bekker, Gough et al., 2003) and vice -versa (Harris, Maurer et al., 2009) . The most salient concern among both of these groups of unvaccinated people was perceived or previou sly experienced side -effects of the influenza vaccine, yet these were seldom specified (Carter, 1986; Ganguly and Cameron, 1989; Ganguly, al., 2003; CDC, Mayo and Cobler, 2004; Tabbarah, Zimmerman et 2005; Lau, Yang et al., 2006; Rodriguez -Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006; Evans, Prout et al., 2007; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007; Wray, 2007; Johnson, 2008; Harris, Maurer et al., 2009 ; Shahrabani 43 and Benzion, 2010 ). In contrast, those who reported not worrying about the vaccine side-effects were more likely to vaccinate ( Chapman and Coups, 1999 ; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002 ; Frew, Painter et al., 2012 ). Safety issues around influenza vaccination, such as causing influenza or worsening pre -existing health conditions, were also commonly raised by those who refuse d vaccination (Carter, 1986; Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Roy, Fradet et al., 1996; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (1), 1997; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al. (2), 1997; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Abel, CDC, Mayo 2004; Breeze et 2006; Winston, Wortley et al., 2006; W ray, 2007; Johnson, 2008 ; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010 ). As with side -effects, people who vaccinated were not concerned about the safety of the vaccine ( Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Brewer and Hallman, 2006) . Lastly, the available evidence suggests that some people did not vaccinate due to fear of pain caused by injections (Ganguly and Cameron, 1989; Gene, Espinola et al., 1992; Armstrong, Berlin et Madhavan, Rosenbluth et al., 2003; CDC, 2004; Mangtani, Breeze al., 2006; Johnson, 2008 ; Shah rabani and Benzion, 2010 ). 2.3.4 Habit Having been previously vaccinated against influenza was an important predictor of future vaccination (Carter, 1986; Chapman and Coups, 1999; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Zimmerm an, Santibanez Painter et al., 2012) . However, it cannot be inferred from the reported data whether this repeated behaviour occurred unconsciously or was prompted by others (e.g. a GP) . 2.3.5 General beliefs and perceptions toward prevention and vacci nation A number of studies linked attitudes and beliefs toward prevention and vaccination with influenza vaccination uptake (Ganguly, Webster et al., 1990; Opstelten, Hak et al., Nowalk et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., 2003 ; Nowalk, Zimmerman et al., 2004; Tabbarah, Zimmerman et al., 2005; Mangtani, Breeze et al., 2006; Rodriguez -Rodriguez, Gaton del et al., 2009; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010; Frew, Painter et al., 2012) . These ranged from fe eling that 44 vaccination against influenza was a wise thing to do ( Zimmerman, Nowalk et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., 2003; Nowalk, Zimmerman et al., 2004; Tabbarah, Zimmerman et al., 2005 ; Rodriguez -Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006 ) or repor ting a positive attitude toward prevention in general (Mangtani, Breeze et al., 2006) , to not trusting vaccines or believing that vaccination weakens the immune system ( Opstelten, Hak et al., 2001 ; Telford and Rogers, 2003; Rodriguez - Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010 ). 2.3.6 Awareness and lack of consideration An important proportion of unvaccinated people expressed lack of awareness of the need or when to vaccinate against influenza , including high risk individuals (Ganguly an d Cameron, 1989; Ganguly, Webster et al., 2003; CDC, 2004; Johnson, 2008) , whereas most of those who vaccinated knew they were at higher risk of influenza -relate d complications (Carter, 1986; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., 2003; Bekker, Gough et al., 2003 ; Madhavan, Rosenbluth et al., 2003) . However, few reported that public health communication campaigns had encouraged them to vaccinate (Pregliasco, Sodano et al., 1999; Bekker, Santibanez et al., 2003) . Lack of con sideration or forgetfulness were also reported as reasons for not vaccinating against influenza (Carter, 1986; Ganguly and Cameron, 1989; et Zeldin et Essen, 1997; Pregliasco, Sodano McGaha Mangtani, Breeze et al., 2006; Rodriguez -Rodriguez, Gaton del Amo et al., 2006; Harris, Maurer et al., 2009). 2.3.7 Practical barriers and motivators In the US, heightened urgency to vaccinate was reported during influenza vaccination shortages (Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Benin, Learsy -Cahill et al., 2009) . Lack of availabili ty of influenza vaccination was also associated with a decrease in uptake in the same country , even in subsequent seasons when supply had been normalised (Abel, McGaha et al., 2003; CDC, 2004; Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Johnson, 2008) . Some studies reported that having health insuranc e or not needing to pay for a vaccine (Madhavan, Rosenbluth et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez et al., 2003; Cobler, 2004 ; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010 ), vaccinating in the work place and wishing to minimise time off work (Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010) stimulate d vaccination . In contrast, lack of time and issues around access , cost and transportation were raised as barriers to vaccination (Carter, 1986; Ganguly and Cameron, 1989; Pregliasco, Sodano 2002; Madhavan, Rosenbluth et al., 2003; CDC, 2004 ; Harris, Maurer et al., 45 2009 ; Shahrabani and Benzion, 2010 ; Tan, Lim et al., 2010 ), yet it is not clear the extent to which these were perceived or actual barriers . 2.3.8 Altruism There was some evidence tha t altruism (e.g. vaccinating oneself to help maintain herd immunity) may be both facilitating and hindering influenza vaccination uptake. While some individuals reported that protecting others motivated them to vaccinate (Carter, 1986; Shahrabani and Benzi on, 2010; Shim, Chapman et al., 2012) , others, particularly in the pre sence of vaccine shortages, decided not to vaccinate so that those at higher risk of complications were able to do so (Johnson, 2008; Benin, Learsy -Cahill et al., , socio -economic and health -related predictors of influenza vaccination have been extensively examined (Nagata, Hernandez -Ramos et al., 2013) and I do not intend to address them fully in this chapter . However, there are a num ber of characteristics that have been frequently associated with vaccination uptake, which deserve consideration ; notably, a ge, chronic health conditions and insurance cover (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Xakellis, 2005; Winston, Wortley et al., 2006; Kohlhamme r, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ). Although there is no consensus regarding the impact of gender, marital status, education and income on vaccination rates, there is some evidence that these characteristics may be correlated with vaccination (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Evans and Watson, 2003; Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Nagata, Hernandez -Ramos et al., 2013 ). Ethnicity has been linked to vaccination uptake , particularly in the US, where i nfluenza vaccination rates in African American and Hispanic populations are lower than among white populations (Abel, McGaha et al., 2003; Winston, Wortley et al., 2006; Frew, Painter et al., 2012) . This health disparity may be explained by community -specific attitudes toward vaccines, inade quate acces s to care, marginalis ation and lack of trust in the health system (Abel, McGaha et al., 2003; Winston, Wortley et al., 2006; Frew, Painter et al., 20 12). 2.4 Discussion This study focuses on the social and psychological factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among adults in high -income countries . It has updated and expanded previous reviews by providing a more detailed account of the factors likely to influence the behaviour of both vaccinated and unvaccinated people . Out of the 45 studies that were included in this review, the majority were conducted in the US (58%) and only 9 studies were UK -based - the most recent was 46 published in 2008 , before the 2009/2010 A(H1N1 ) pandemic influenza . This highli ghts the importance of further research in this area , particularly outside the US . I identified eight broad themes and 22 factors within which the ev idence base can be categorised. Social influence, perceived disease and vaccine characteristics, habit and general beliefs and perceptions toward health and vaccines , awareness and knowledge, and to a lesser extent, practical barrier s and motivators, and altruism all play an important role in the uptake of influenza vaccination in developed economies . Consistent with previous literature reviews, the most reported socio -psychological factors associated with influenza vaccination uptake are a recommendation from a healthcare professional, perceived susceptibility to influenza or likelihood of acquiring it , vaccine effectiveness , side effects and safety , and having had an inf luenza vaccination in the past (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008) . These findings suggest that people's perceptions about influenza and the influenza vac cine remain largely unscathed and that improved approaches to modify erroneous beliefs are much needed. Newly identified factors include anticipated regret of contracting influenza, generally valuing (or nor valuing) prevention or influenza vaccination , not considering or forgetting to vaccinate , and being unaware of the need to vaccinate . The reviewed evidence confirms the importance of the role of healthcare professionals in vaccination acceptance. However , the reported lack awareness of the need to vac cinate indicate s that healthcare professionals may not be reaching many of those who are eligible for vaccination. Widespread influenza -related misperceptions (e.g. lack of susceptibility) and concerns around influenza vaccination (e.g. side -effects and safety) further support the need for better strategies to engage with under -vaccinated populations , both through mass and targeted communications . These may range from expanding the use of effective communication mechanisms such as personalised letters or phone calls (Thomas, Russell et al., 2010) , to improving the quality of the information exchanged during consultations in order to adequately address people's anxieties . Seasonal fluctuations in vaccine effectiven ess, however, undoubtedly erode trust in in fluenza vaccination, thus better and more reliable products are certainly needed to increase vaccination confidence . Importantly, effective communication strategies should be informed by public opinion , which in turn requires periodic and sound monitoring . Interestingly, general perceptions around preve ntion or vaccination are associated with both influenza vaccination and non -vaccination . This indicates that there may be important synergies across different preven tive practices and vaccines. For example, those who believe that vaccines are untrustworthy may be not only be unwilling to vaccinate against influenza but also against other diseases. Future research exploring these links is needed. 47 My findings revealed important gaps in the evidence -base . Given that most of the existing evidence is from the US, the importance of general perceptions (e.g. trust in vaccines) , psychological constructs (e.g. altruism ) and population characteristics (e.g. ethnicity) on vaccination uptake should be further investigated in other settings . Similarly , practical barriers such as limited access to vaccines and lack of time were mainly reported in the US , which may be explained by its largely privatis ed healthcare system and long working hours . Yet, the presence of these barriers in other high -income countries deserve s further investigation. One important is sue in the reviewed evidence is the varying quality of the employed methods of enquiry and survey measures . Consequently, key questions remain unanswered. For instance, do people who vaccinate su ccessively do it out of habit or because they are prompted by external stimuli such as annual reminders from physicians ? Is there overlap between perceived vaccine side -effects and perceived vaccine safety? Is lack of aw areness of the need to vaccinate due to poor patient -physician communication, inadequate access to healthcare, lack of trust in the healthcare system or all of the above? I believe that better understanding these associations, which means concurrent assess ment of them within a single study, will facilitate the development of more effective public health strategies. Lastly , there is a need to examine how socio -psychological factors affect other adult vaccines. Although there is some evidence on pneumococca l vaccines (Kohlhammer, Schnoor et al., 2007) , other routine vaccinations such as tetanus containing vaccines, are largely unexplored. Comparative research across populations and vaccines using barometer -type instruments could enhance our understanding of the effect of these factors on vaccination rates, and enable the design of more effective and synergistic policies to increase vaccination coverage in adults. 2.4.1 Limitations This review is limited by its methodology and the quality and quantity of the evide nce I was able to retrieve. Due to the limitations of the reviewed studies, research focusing on specific populations and within particular settings may have limited generalis ability . For example, the attitudes of diabetic patients may not be shared by eld erly people who do not have the condition. There are also limitations associated with interpreting results from qualitative studies, which by nature are not representative of the investigated population. Such studies aim to obtain detailed understanding of an issue and to develop further hypotheses rather than to extrapolate their findings to a larger population. Further , some quantitative studies included in this review had r elatively small sample sizes and samples were generally not representative of the population of interest , which may have 48 led to selection bias. Finally, a number of studies provided insufficient information about the measures employed, thus their validity may be questionable. More broadly, it should be note d that the review was not systematic, thus so me articles may have been omitted . Furthermore, the reviewed data is methodologically disparate, thus my qualitative synthesis may represent some of these studies more accurately than others. Future reviews could address some of these limitations by selectin g a narrower subset of studies and more comparable methodologies . 2.4.2 Summary and implications for further research Since its inception, influenza vaccination coverage in high -income countries has dramatically improved, particularly among over 65s. However, compliance among at risk populations is still suboptimal. This study confirmed that s ocio -psychological factors significantly affect influenza vaccination uptake among adults i n high -income settings , and identif ied the most reported reasons for accepting or refrain ing from influenza vaccination. These will be explored further in the following chapters. An important finding is that the existing evidence in this area is mostly from the US . Better understanding of how socio -psychological factors influence vaccination decisions in different contexts and across vaccines remains a priority. Further, r outinely collect ing socio -psychological data using standardised methodologies and quality measures will help address the identified knowledge gaps and focus resourc es where they are most needed. As an initial step, in the next c hapter I undertake a systematic review of the literature and meta - analysis , honing in on the most salient socio -psychological factors associated with vaccination identified in this study. I aim to gauge the importance of these factors on vaccination uptake and to better understand the influence of methodological aspects such as measure quality on effect magnitude . 49 3 Socio -psychological predictors o f seasonal influenza vaccination in the general population : a systematic review and meta -analysis 3.1 Introduction As established in Chapter 2, socio -psychological factors have an important role in influenza vaccina tion behaviour . This finding is supported by four previous literature reviews exploring the factors associated with influenza vaccination . Three non-systematic reviews of the literature (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) and one systematic review focusing on elderly people (Kohlhammer, 2007) indicated that influenza risk perception (e.g. perceived likelihood of catching influenza), vaccine side -effects (e.g. post - vaccination flu -like symptoms), vaccine effectiveness, and a physician recommendation were the most salient aspects associated with influenza vaccination decisions (Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Wheelock , Thomson et al., 2013) . However, the se reviews also showed that the existing evidence is disparate and often methodologically limited, thus conclusions drawn from qualitative syntheses may be inaccurate or at best incomplete. There is little research on the factors influencing tetanus vaccination and, to my knowledge, reviews of the literature evaluating socio -psychological fact ors associated with the uptake of tetanus boosters are not presently available. As described in the previous c hapter, research assessing barriers to tetanus vaccination found that as with the influenza vaccine, people are concerned about the side -effects a nd effectiveness of tetanus boosters , and uptake is influenced by a physician recommendation . Yet, t he importance of tetanus risk perceptions in tetanus vaccination decisions remains largely unexplored. Thus far, the only attempt to quantitatively syn thesize the existing evidence regarding the link between perceptions and adult vaccination is a meta -analysis published in 2007 (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . It explored the association between three dimensions of risk perception (perceived disease likel ihood, susceptibility and severity) and the uptake of a number of vacci nes, including influenza. This study found small to moderate associations between influenza vaccination and influenza risk perception . Given that people's attitudes are sensitive to con textual factors such as vaccine scares and poor risk communications (Bone, Guthmann et al., 2010 ; Larson, Cooper et al., 2011) , a meta -analysis of the ever increasing evidence -base on important socio -psychological 50 predictors of influenza vaccination behavi our, particularly those which have not been previously meta -analysed, is warranted . The present study follows a rigorous systematic approach to provide a transparent representation of the existing evidence and to quantitatively estimate the importance of t hese factors on vaccination uptake. Building upon the work of Brewer et al. (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) , this study seeks to systematic ally review and meta -analyse studies assessing the association between adult influenza and tetanus vaccination uptake (actual or self -reported) and the four dimensions that have been most frequently linked to vaccination behavio ur: disease risk perception, vaccine risk perception, perceived vaccine effectiveness and reported physician recommendation. 3.1.1 Study aims The aim s of this study are : (i) to gauge the importance of the aforementioned dimensions on vaccination uptake by focusing on studies using comparable measures , when ever possible; (ii) to assess methodological factors that might modify the strength of the associati ons between the evaluated perceptions and vaccination , including sample composition, vaccination rate and measure quality; and (iii) to measure the consistency of findings across studies . The ultimate aim is to inform the development of the survey -tools re ported in Chapters 6 and 7. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Study research On 18 February 2014 , the following databases were accessed using the OVID interface from the beginning of their collection, to search for literature relevant to the aims of this literature review: MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase Classic + Embase (from 1947 ) and PsycINFO (from 1967 ). The Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organi sation publicat ion databases were also reviewed . Searches were not restricted by time of publication, as , to my knowledge, no other systematic review of the literature has achieved the above aims. Database searching was complemented with scoping searches using Google Scholar and hand -searching bibliographies of retrieved reports which were eligible for inclus ion. A search strategy was developed using an iterative process. The search comprised three facets dictated by the aims of this study: vaccine (e.g. influenza), population (e.g. adult) and social or psychological factors (e.g. perceptions, decisions, etc. ). Each facet included search terms and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH\u00ae) terms relevant to each database . MeSH terms were \"exploded\" 51 to ensure their sub -headings were included in the search. To maximise the specificity and sensitivity of the search, d ifferent combinations of terms were tested. The search was only restricted to human studies . The detailed search strategy can be found in Appendix 5. Initially, I aimed to assess the social and psychological determinants of both influenza and tetanus vaccinatio n. However, I was not able to retrieve tetanus studies which met the eligibility criteria. Hence, this chapter focuses on influenza only. 3.2.2 Screening and data extraction After removing duplicate references , titles and abstracts were screened independently by two researchers: I reviewed 100% of the titles and a second investigator (Dr Stephanie Russ) reviewed 50% of the titles . If either reviewer considered a title relevant or potentially relevant , the abstract was reviewed. Disa greements were resolved by consensus. When studies seemed to meet the eligibility criteria, the ful l text articles were retrieved. Reasons for exclusion were coded. Data were extracted with a standardis ed form comprised of a number of criteria , which I des cribe in the following section . 3.2.3 Selection criteria 3.2.3.1 Type of reports included I included all published articles reporting original data which provided sufficient information to calculate bivariate effect sizes (e.g. frequencies, means and standard errors) . I excluded studies reporting only multiva riate associations , as these analyses may understate the true relation between vaccination behavio ur and the assessed measures. However, attempts were made to contact the authors of such studies to request the additi onal information needed (Honkanen P, 1999; Tsutsui Y, Benzion U, et al., 2012) . I also excluded reports which aggregated \"I do not know\" and yes or no responses because this strategy can bias results , and studies assessing the acceptability of new routes of administration (e.g. dermal) , since novel products fall outside the remit of this thesis . If multiple published reports used the same sample, I included only the one which provided the most detailed information on the assessed measures. 3.2.3.2 Type of participants included I included relevant articles reporting on adult influenza vaccination uptake. Yet, for the same reasons described in Chapter 2, I excluded studies which focused or included pregnant women or healthcare professionals . 52 3.2.3.3 Type of outcome measures included The outcome measure was vaccination uptake. Although actual vaccination (e.g. extracted from medical records) is recognised as the most a ccurate measure of vaccination, for practical reasons, the vast majority of studies in this area use self -reported vaccination as the outcome measure. Since actual and self -reported influenza vaccination are strongly correlated (Irving, Donahue et al., 200 9), the latter was acceptable as a reliable outcome measure. 3.2.3.4 Type of survey measures included 3.2.3.4.1 Influenza risk perception I included three distinct sub -dimensions of risk: perceived likelihood of getting influenz a, perceived susceptibility to influen za and perceived severity of influenz a, as defined by Brewer et al. (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . Perceived likelihood is the perceived probability of harm conditioned on not taking action to prevent it (i.e. not getting the influenza vaccine). It is illustrate d by the question \"If you do not get the influenza vaccine, what is the likelihood that you will get the influenza this year?\" Although it is often used as a synonym of likelihood , perceived susceptibility , is hereby understood as perceived constitutional vulnerability to harm. It is represented by the question \"if you got influenza, would you feel sicker than people your age?\" The third construct, perceived severity , refers to the extent of harm a disease could cause. This construct can be captured with th e question \"If you were to get influenza, how severe would it be?\" Influenza risk measures were acceptable if they captured the individual's own perceived risk (e.g. \"Influenza could make me severely ill\") rather than general risk (e.g. \" Influenza is a se rious disease\"), as the latter may be interpreted as knowledge and misrepresent actual perceived risk. Likelihood measures were required to condition the perception on not having received the influenza vaccine (e.g. \"Without the in fluenza vaccine, I would get influenza this winter\"). Susceptibility measures were included only if they specifically addressed the individual's intrinsic v ulnerability (e.g. \"If I got influenza, I would feel sicker than other people my age\"). 3.2.3.4.2 Vaccine risk perception: perceived s ide-effects The perceived harm of influenza vaccines is commonly addressed in the literature as side-effects and regarded as one of the most important barriers to vaccination. However, there is important variance in the measures used to assess perceived si de-effects. Some measures capture general attitudes toward side-effects (e.g. \"Are you concerned about the side -effects from the influenza vaccine?\"), 53 whilst others focus on specific types of side -effect or perceived safety issues (e.g. \"People can get influenza from the influenza vaccine\"). I believe it is important to unpack this construct to uncover which asp ects generate the most anxiety. Due to the characteristics of the available evidence , the inclusion criteria for side -effects measures were less str ict than for influenza risk perception measures (e.g. they did not have to concern the individual) . Included measures were categorised as follows: perceived general side -effects (e.g. \"I am concerned about influenza vaccine's side -effects\"), perceived post -vaccination illness (e.g. \"The influenza vaccine makes you ill\"), perceived likelihood of side -effects (e.g. \"It is common to experience side -effects after having the influenza vaccine\"), previous side -effects (\"I have experienced side -effects after havin g the influenza vaccine), perceived severity of side -effects (e.g. \"Side -effects from the influenza vaccine can be serious\"), perceived vaccine safety (e.g. \"Some of the contents from the influenza vaccine could be harmful\" or \"The influenza vaccine gives you influenza\") and perceived pain (e.g. \"The influenza vaccine can be painful\"). 3.2.3.4.3 Perceived vaccine effectiveness Perceived vaccine effectiveness is understood as the perceived ability of a vaccine to prevent one or more diseases. Since the effectiveness o f the influenza vaccine is partial and varies depending on individuals characteristics such as age and health, and how well the influenza virus strains match the vaccine's in any given year, this construct is particularly relevant when assessing the perceived ut ility of the vaccine. As with side -effects, the criteria applied to perceived effectiveness measures were more relaxed. For example, the terms efficacy (how well a treatment works in clinical trials) and effectiveness (how well a treatment works in practic e) were often used interchangeably. Thus, I included studies which addressed both perceived vaccine effectiveness (e.g. \"The influenza vaccine protects people from catching influenza\") and efficacy (e.g. \"The influenza vaccine is very efficacious \"), regard less of the specifici ty of the measure. M easures which assess ed the vaccine's ability to ameliorate influenza symptoms were excluded , as this is a different construct. 3.2.3.4.4 Physician recommendation Influenza vaccination is usually prompted by the recommendation of a physician. The existing evidence suggests that a physician recommendation is the single most important predictor of influenza vaccination uptake. Most studies assessing physician recommendation use straightforward measures (e.g. \"My doctor recommend ed the influenza vaccine\"). However, some studies use ambiguous statements such as \"I discussed the influenza vaccine with my doctor\". I excluded such 54 measures because discussing the pros and cons of the influenza vaccine with a doctor does not necessarily result in it being recommended. 3.2.4 Data Analyses Computed effect sizes ( rs) per study ranged from 1 -6, depending on the number of eligible measures reported. The effect sizes were then converted to Fisher's zs for meta -analytical synthesis as this corrects f or the skew in the r value distribution as population value deviates from zero (Rosenthal, 1984) . For each assessed dimension, a pooled z score was generated and converted back into r for reporting (Rosenthal, 1994; Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . If the sa me study reported multiple eligible measures of the same construct (e.g. two or more likelihood measures), I averaged the rs. If the same study reported multiple measures of different constructs (e.g. perceived general side - effects, side -effects likelihood and influenza severity), these were included separately in the meta - analysis under the corresponding construct. I tested the pooled r score of each of the assessed dimensions for its difference from zero using t -test. Determination of heterogeneity was un dertaken using the 2 test (Cochran's Q) and I2 value; with I 2 50% taken to denote a high degree of heterogeneity. When I 2 was 50% , I assessed f our possible factors which have been shown to moderate the relationship between the studied dimensions and vaccination behavio ur: study design , vaccination rate, population and measure quality (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . Moderators were calculated using t -test only if there were three studies or more in e ach moderator 's dichotomous sub-category (e.g. 3 high vaccination rate vs. 3 low vaccination rate). When possible, associations between moderators were computed using chi-square tests . However, due to the size of the sub - samples, these analyses should b e considered indicative of a possible association rather than a statistically robust one. Reporting biases and other biases were assessed using visual inspection of funnel plots along with Egger's and Begg and Mazumdar' s tests for small -study effects ( Borenstein, 2009). Inter -rater reliability was calculated using Cohen' s kappa statistic . Analyses were conducted by a meta -analysis expert (Dr Ashrafian ), a using Stata\u00ae 12 (version 12.1; LP, C ollege Station, TX, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 . 3.2.5 Study coding For each study , the following data was extracted: country of origin, study design (i.e., retrospective or prospective), vaccination rate (i.e., high or low, based on the average rate), popul ation (i.e., healthy or high -risk participants - 65s or with an eligible chronic health condition) and sample size . 55 Additionally, each measure received a quality score based on the quality assessment criteria proposed by Brewer et al. (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . Scoring was performed separately by myself (100%) and Dr Stephanie Russ (50%) with no disagreements. All measures received one point if they concerned the individual and an additional point if the categories of the response scale were not dicho tomi sed for analysis, which would reduce the variability of the independent variable (minimu m score = 0; Maximum score = 2) . Perceived side -effects measures received an extra point if they specified the assessed adverse effect, for example \"the influenza v accine could give me influenza\" rather than \"the influenza vaccine is unsafe\" (minimum score = 0; Maximum score = 3). An additional point was given to perceived influenza likelihood measures that specified time frame, for example t his winter (minimum score = 0; m aximum score = 3). 3.3 Results The PRISMA diagram in Figure 3.1 illustrates the number of articles identified, their sources and reasons for exclusion. Database searches produced 4,891 publications and three articles were retrieved t hrough hand -searchin g. Of these, after removing duplicates, 2,542 were excluded based on the information provided in the title, and a further 359 using the information in the abstract. The agreement between reviewers was excellent (K = 0.891, p<0.001). Out of the 213 papers eligible for full text screening, 43 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta -analysis. Details of the included studies and measures are presented in Table 3.1. Most s tudies were conducted in the US (23) (Buchner, Carter et al., 1985; Ca rter, 1986; Fiebach and Viscoli, al., 1992; Pearson and Thompson, 1994; Nichol, Mac Donald et al., 1996; Chapman and Coups, 1999; Armstrong, Berlin et al., 2001; Evans and Watson, 2003; Zimmerman, Nowalk et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Sa ntibanez et al., 2003; and Cobler, 2004; Nowalk, Zimmerman et al., Brewer and Hallman, 2006; Wooten, et al., 2012; Lorenz, Norris et al., 2013) , followed by the UK (5) (Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Bekker, Gough et al., 2003; Evans and Watson, 2003; Burns, Ring et al., 2005; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007) , The Netherlands (3) (Meynaar, van't Wout et al., 1991; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al., (1) 1997; van Essen, Kuyvenhoven et al.

There were 36 retrospe ctive and 7 prospective studies . Thirty -four studies focused on high -risk groups a nd nine assessed healthy populations. The median vaccination rate was 58% (range 11 -83%). A total of 120 measures were included, 38% of which used samples 200 participants and 62% used samples 200 participants . Twenty -nine measures were of low quality (minimum score) and only 14 were of high quality (maximum score).

The negative pooled effect of perceived side -effects severity on influenza vaccination was significant (t = 5.56, p<0.000) and small to moderate in size (r = -0.20). Variation attributable to heterogeneity was also moderate (I2 = 64.9%). Reports with low vaccination rate and low quality measures had a larger negative pooled effect size ( Table 3. 2). 3.3.2.6 Perceived vaccine safety Data on 4,673 participants from 10 reports were included. Effect sizes ranged from -0.14 to -0.50. The negative pooled effect of perceived vaccine safety on influenza vaccination was significant (t = 5.20, p<0.000) and small to moderate in size (r = -0.26).

In the studies that assessed severity, no association was found between moderators. In the studies that examined perceived susceptibility, however, vaccination rate was correlated with study design and population ( 2 =6.0, p<0.05) - all the studies in healthy populations were prospective and had low vaccination rates. In studies assessing perceived vaccine safety, vaccination rate was correlated with population ( 2 =11.00, p<0.01) - all the studies in healthy populations had low va ccination rates. In the studies that examined effectiveness, vaccination rate was correlated with population ( 2 =7.99, p<0.05) - all the studies in healthy populations had low vaccination rates. In the studies evaluating physician recommendation, vaccinat ion rate was also correlated with population ( 2 =5.42, p<0.05) - all the studies in healthy populations had low vaccination rates. The associations betwe en moderators warrant cautious interpretation of their effect on the relationship between the assessed dimensi ons and vaccination uptake .

It has also revealed that the existing evidence is highly heterogeneous and overly representative of d eveloped countries, particularly the US ( 54% of studies). Thus, further research is required to ascertain the relevance of these factors in other contexts . Specifically, f rom the evaluated influenza risk perceptions, p erceived likelihood of catching influe nza yielded the strongest association with vaccination uptake ( r=0.32), followed by perceived susceptibility ( r=0.25) and severity ( r=0.16). These results are consistent with findings from Brewer et al. (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) and confirm that the p erceived severity of influenza may be less indicative of vaccine uptake than the perceived probability of becoming infected or feeling vulnerable to the disease. A plausible explanation is that most people recognise that influenza can be a serious disease that can sometimes be fatal, but only for those who are older and frail (Nowak GJ, Sheedy , et al., 2015) . Hence, r isk communications may benefit from shifting their focus from the severity of influenza to likelihood of infection and constitutional vulnerab ility to harm (CDC, 2013; NHS , 2013) . In contrast , those who expressed concerns about post -vaccination illness were the least likely to vaccinate (r = -0.42). Individuals who were worried about general side -effects ( r=-0.35), had experienced side -effects ( -effects to be more likely ( r=-0.29), had concerns about the vaccine safety ( r=-0.26) or the severity of side -effects ( r=-0.20) were also less likely to vaccinate. Perceived pain ( r=-0.08), however, was not associated with vaccinati on uptake . These findings indicate that , although important, concerns around the vaccine safety or the severity of its side-effects may be less influential than the commonly experienced post -vaccination influenza -like symptoms. Furthermore, it is possible that general measures assessing vaccine risk perceptions (e.g. perceived general side -effects, side-effects likelihood and experienced side -effects) may have also captured participant s' anxieties about post -vaccination symptoms. Fear of acquiring viruses f rom vaccines is often reported in the literature and date s back to smallpox inoculation - the unsafe practice of deliberately introducing material from smallpox pustules into the skin of healthy individuals to produce a milder infection (Gross and Sepkowit z, 1998) . Understandably, if the influenza vaccine is perceived to cause the same sy mptoms as the disease it is supposed to prevent, vaccination may be perceived as futile . Thus, improved strategies to address misconceptions about the severity of post -vacc ination influenza -like symptoms are warranted. 68 Consistent with the above results, participant s who believed the influenza vaccine was effective were more likely to receive it (r = 0.31). This association can be largely explained by the changing nature of influenza viruses and the decreased effectiveness of vaccines in seasons when circulating and vaccine strains are mismatched (CDC (3), 2014) . The introduction of products which offer better protection against influenza , such as the quadrivalent vaccine , may have a positive impact on perceived vaccine effectiveness (Grohskopf LA, Olsen SJ, et al., 2014; PHE (3), 2014) . Further research examining whether this holds true is needed. Unsurprisingly, I found that a recommendation from a physician was moderat ely associated with vaccination uptake (r = 0.39). This confirms that healthcare professionals are an important influence in vaccination acceptance and supports the need for continuous efforts to develop more effective interventions and communication strat egies within primary health . Where possible , I also evaluated the factors moderating the relationship between the asse ssed dimensions and vaccination . It has been postulated that prospective studies are preferable, because retrospective designs may lead to confirmation bias (e. g. I vaccinated, therefore, I must be susceptible to influenza ), which could in turn result in inflated effect sizes (Weinstein, 2007) . I found, however, that prospective studies yielded similar results to retrospective studies for pe rceived susceptibility, consistent with findings from Brewer et al . (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . This may be because confirmation bias from previous seasons can influence the responses of recurrent vaccinators. Retrospective designs yielded a larger neg ative effect size for previous side -effects. A possible explanation is that a recent memory of an unpleasant side -effect is likely to be more intense and available than one experienced in previous seasons. The moderators \"vaccination rate\" and \"population \" had similar effects on the assessed measures as they often overlapped: studies with high -risk populations had higher vaccination rates. Studies with high vaccination rates and high -risk participant s yielded similar results to those with low vaccination rates and healthy participant s for perceived susceptibility and perceived vaccine safety. The former finding may be due to the inclusion of younger high -risk participant s in all of the studies assessing susceptibility, who tend to und erestimate their risk (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) , and of high -risk participant s in studies with a majority of healthy individuals , both of which may have biased results . Concerns around vaccine safety appear to be ubiqui tous and not dependent on belonging to a risk group, which may explain why vaccination rate was not a significant moderator for this sub -dimension. In studies with high vaccination rates, however, the perceived severity of influenza was significantly highe r than in those with lower vaccination rates. This finding confirms the relevance of this dimension in vaccination decisions , particularly among 69 those at higher risk of complications . Finally, a higher vaccination rate yielded a lower effect for physician recommendation, an indication that such a recommendation is more prevalent among high -risk individuals ; hence, other factors (e.g. susceptibility) may play a more significant role in the decision to vaccinate. Unlike results from Brewer et al. (Brewer, Cha pman et al., 2007) , my analyses showed that studies assessing perceived influenza severity, vaccine side -effects severity and physician recommendation with low quality measures yielded higher pooled effect sizes than those with high quality measures. This unexpected finding may be because studies with high quality measures only differed from those with low quality measures as to whether the categories of the used scales were not combined for analysis, a criterion which may have not m ade much difference on i ts own. Conversely, high -quality measures of perceived vaccine effectiveness comprised either of the two employed quality criteria (non -dichotomized scales and scales concerning the individual) and yielded a higher effect than low - quality measures. Import antly , although the heterogeneity of findings across studies may be partly explained by differences in study characteristics , it could also be attributed to seasonal fluctuations in vaccine effectiveness - which could affect people's perceived need to vaccinate - and epidemiological and contextual factors such as the emergence of influenza pandemics and the impact of ensuing policies and risk communications on vaccination behaviour (Bone, Guthmann et al., 2010) . 3.4.1 Limitations There were a number of limitations related to the quality and qu antity of the reviewed evidence; thus , the results of this study should be i nterpreted with caution. First, and perhaps the most important limitation is the methodological variability of the e xisting evidence, reflected by high between -study heterogeneity. Funnel plot asymmetry identified in one of the four assessed sub - dimensions provides further evidence of methodological differences across studies - although reporting bia ses and other contex tual factors cannot be excluded. Secondly , due to the small number of studies in some of the assessed categories, I was not always able to perform moderator analyses (or assess funnel plot asymmetry ), which limited the possibility of drawing meaningful conclusions. Therefore, this study does not provide robust evidence about the influence of the assessed moderators on the effect sizes of the included dimensions , and there is a chance that other factors , which I was not able to evaluate , also moderated the r elationship between these dimensions and vaccination behaviour. Thirdly , studies using objective outcome measures (i.e. actual vaccine uptake) were rare, thus this important characteristic could not be assessed as a 70 potential moderator. Fourthly , due to th e disparate nature of the included studies, the extent to which the studied dimensions predict uptake when assessed concurrently , and over and above other factors such as socio -demographic characteristics , could not be explored . Finally, since most of the evidence is from a few developed countries, the r esults may not be generalisable to other geographies . 3.4.2 Summary and implications for further research My systematic review and meta -analysis showed that influenza and vaccine risk perceptions, perceived vaccine effectiveness and a recommendation from a physician were, individually, significantly associated with influenza vaccination. Perceived likelihood of catching influenza was the most impor tant influenza risk perception sub -dimension, whereas perceived severity was the least important. Interestingly, concerns about post -vaccination illness and general side -effects were more important than those related to safety issues and the severity of side-effects . This study also revealed that the existing evidence is highly heterogeneous and should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, most of the research in this field continues to arise from the US , consistent with the government's efforts to bette r understand and monitor the public's perceptions about the influenza vaccine (NVAC, 2013; CDC (1), 2014). Therefore, the findings presented here may not be generalisable to other countries , including the UK . Reflecting on these findings, there are a numbe r of implications for further research that are particularly relevant to Chapters 6 and 7 . First, i n order to predict influenza, but also tetanus vaccination, and to uncover the relative importance of the determinants of vaccination behaviour, both well -known predictors and potential ly relevant variables ought to be tested concurrently. Second , when possible , studies should aim to employ measures which are continuous to improve the statistical power of the study, they should also be disease or vaccine -specific to avoid misinterpretation , capture individual s' own perceived risk, and condition risk perceptions on not having received the vaccine. In the following two chapters, I examine in depth perceptual and contextual drivers and barriers to influenza and tetanus vaccination, in order to determine whether : i) the factors ident ified in this and the previous c hapter are relevant t o the UK population; ii ) these factors are comparable between vaccines or vaccin e-specific; and iii ) there are country -specific aspects which have yet to be uncovered. 71 4 Socio -psychological drivers and barriers of influenza and tetanus vaccination in adults: a qualitative study 4.1 Introduction As highlighted in Chapters 2 and 3, a large body of work has found that individ uals' perceptions of influenza and the influenza vaccine , and the influence of others are consistently associated with influenza vaccination uptake. In countries with good vaccination coverage, where structural barriers to access are limited, these perceptions are particularly relevant in shaping vaccination decisions (Honkanen, Keistinen et al., 1996; Rogers, 2003; Mangtani, Breeze e t al., 2006; Keenan, Campbell et al., 2007) . One important gap is that the vast majority of the evidence in this field is quantitative (i.e. survey - based) . Whilst quantitative data enable researchers to e xtrapolate their findings to entire populations, qualitative research provides an opportunity to better understand a topic and to unearth new issues by delving in depth into individuals' views and experiences. The UK is no exception; to date, few studies h ave explored influenza vaccination decision -making qualitatively and most have focused on the elderly (Telford and Rogers, 2003; Evans, Prout et al., 2007; Kwong, Pang et al., 2010) . Research evaluating drivers and barriers to tetanus vaccination uptake fr om the perspective of the vaccinee is non -existent in the UK. 4.1.1 Study aims This study had two aims : i) to explore in depth adults' perceptions of vaccination and the factors that drive them to have themselves vaccinated (or not) against seasonal influenza an d tetanus ; and ii) to evaluate whether these factors are comparable between vaccines or vaccine -specific. 4.2 Methods This study was approved by the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (See App endix 2 ). 4.2.1 Sampling and recruitment Interviews were carried out in three regions in the UK: London, South East and West Midlands. Although representative samples are not required in qualitative research, I sought to attain relevant 72 perspectives by recruiting participants from areas where the majority of the UK population reside. I used a purposive sampling strategy to select 20 adult participants who were both vaccinated or not vaccinated against influenza and tetanus, and represented a range of population characteristics associated with vacc ination uptake, particularly age and health status (see Table 4.1). In line with sampling criteria used in the previous chapters, this study also excluded pregnant women and healthcare professionals . To reduce recall bias , only those who had been vaccinate d in the past 12 months at the time of recruitment were eligible as vaccinated participant s (Coughlin, 1990) . A screening question was used to exclude participants who were fundamentally opposed to vaccination, as this stance represents only a small minori ty of the non -vacci nated population and hence, could confound the results (Leask, Kinnersley et al., 2012) . Participants were recruited via telephone using random dialing, sourced from telephone directories , by Ipsos MORI, an international market research company. Table 4.1 Purposive sampling strategy Key participant characteristics Minimum participant quota per country Eligible chronic condition* 7 = with, 7 = without Gender 8 = female, 8 = male Parent/Guardian of child/children under 18 4 = mothers, 4 = fathers Age 8 = 18-49, 4 = 50-64, 6 = 65 Socio -economic group (social grade)** 7 = ABC1, 7 = C2DE Adults who have had ONE of the vaccines 4 = influenza, 3 = tetanus Have had both tetanus and influenza vaccines 6 Have not had either vaccination 6 *Asthma, obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchitis, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, neurological conditions, weakened immune system due to conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or as a result of medication such as steroid tablets or chem otherapy, among others. **A = higher socio -economic group and E = lower socioeconomic group. Occupation and income data was used to determine participants' social grade. The interview schedule was designed through expert consultations and a review of the relevant literature (Chapters 2 and 3) . The schedule was then tested with two researchers from Imperial College and two researchers from Ipsos MORI who were not involved in the present study. The duration and flow of the interview were discussed and the sc hedule was finessed as a result. The refinements to the schedule were related to wording (e.g. using 'flu' instead of 'influenza' for simplicity) and reordering and/or deletion of redundant probes. These interviews were not included in the final sample. Piloting was subsequently carried out for the first three interviews, whereby the research team observed each interview conducted by an Ipsos MORI trained interviewer behind a one -way mirror and evaluated its quality in real -time (see Figure 4.1) . At the en d of the session, minor improvements were made to the interviewers' instructions included in the schedule. 73 Figure 4.1 Indicative image of i nterviewing facilities used for piloting phase 4.2.2 Procedure Participants were presented with a research information sheet and briefed on confidentiality/anonymity of their data before they were asked to sign a consent form (See Appendices 6 and 7) . Participants were interviewed face -to-face in their homes or at a central interviewing facility for approximately 60 minute s. Each participant received \u00a370 in return for their time. In order to minimise interviewer bias, half of the interviews were conducted by myself and half by a trained interviewer from Ipsos MORI. Two versions of the interview schedule were used: one for v accinated and one for non -vaccinated participants (se e summary in Table 4.2 and full interview schedules in Appendices 8 and 9). The interview schedule comprised six sections. Section 1 obtained an overview of participants' life and values, to build rapport with the interviewee and to identify important issues to assist with probing throughout the interview. Section 2 elicited parti cipants' general information -seeking behaviours and influences. Section 3 examined participants' views toward health, healthcare professionals and adult vaccines. Section 4 evaluated participants' decision -making \"journeys to vaccination or non -vaccination \". Section 5 examined participants' attitudes toward paediatric influenza and tetanus vaccines. The aim was to understand whether or not people's views about adult vaccines correspond with their views about childhood vaccines. Finally, in section 6 I explo red 74 participants' knowledge of the two diseases and vaccines (i.e. influenza and tetanus) to understand to what extent their decision -making was influenced by fact ual information. Table 4.2 Interview schedule Interview topic (sections 1 -6) Key interview qu estions 1. Overview of life and values Tell me about yourself and your life, for example, what you spend your time doing and how you enjoy yourself. What sorts of things do you worry about? 2. Information seeking behaviours and influences Can you tell me how you find out what is happening generally in the world? And who are the people whose opinion you value or with whom you discuss important issues with? And why is that? 3. Views about health and vaccinations Can I ask how you feel your own health is? When you think about your health, what are all the things that come to mind? Do you do anything to keep healthy? What sorts of things? Which doctors or nurses do you particularly trust and listen to, if any? And why is that? Why is that important to you? Thinking now about vaccinations, what are all the things that come to mind when you think about vaccinations? Looking at these cards, which are all adult vaccinations, please can you sort them into groups? 4. Journey to vaccination (or non - vaccination) How would you describe to a friend how you came to have (or not to have) the vaccination? What things happened that meant you ended up getting (or not getting) vaccinated? What would you say happened at that point that triggered that change (or decision)? And why was that important? How did you know where to go for the vaccination? How did you book an appointment and fit it into your plans? What other things were competing for your time? Before you we re vaccinated, do you remember any times when you thought about or started the process toward being vaccinated but didn't end up getting vaccinated? (vaccinated) Of all of those things, which would you say was the most important thing that led to you not getting vaccinated? And why is that? And the second most important thing? And the third? (non -vaccinated) 5. Children's vaccinations In general, do you think people should vaccinate their children against tetanus? Why/why not? And do you think people should vaccinate their children against influenza? Why/why not? 6. Factual knowledge on influenza and tetanus and related vaccines How much would you say you know about influenza/tetanus? How serious or life -threatening do you think the disease is? In general, how likely do you think you are to catch the disease? How much would you say you know about the vaccine for influenza/tetan us? Do you happen to know how often it is recommended that you have it, or who it is recommended for? 75 I explored the set of circumstances and emotional factors that drove participants to accept or refuse vaccination, aided by qualitative interviewing approaches aimed at obtaining information which explicit enquiry (i.e. a direct question) may fail to captur e - as follows. First, throughout the interview I used an elicitation technique called 'laddering', which provides a simple and systematic way of establishing people's core values and beliefs, and the linkages between these and key behaviours, in this case , vaccination (Reynolds and Olson, 2001) . In section 3, general views on adult vaccines were evaluated by asking participants to spontaneously arrange and rank, using a category of their choice, cards depicting five adult vaccines (influenza, tetanus, pneu monia, hepatitis and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)) into one or more groups. By identifying how people group vaccines, and the reasons for their groupings, I aimed to contextualise and gain deeper understanding of their views on influenza vaccines and t etanus boosters. In section 4, I employed the \"journey to vaccination \" approach (Wheelock, Miraldo et al., 2014) , a visual exercise in which the interviewer and the participant jointly draw a timeline that captures salient events that le d the participant to get or not to get vaccinated. These results will be presented in the following chapter, as they require different analysis. Briefly, a journey to vaccination for influenza and other for tetanus is drawn for each participant. Differences and commonalitie s emerging from these data are identified and synthesised, and typical journeys proposed. 4.2.3 Data Analysis The recorded interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy by Ipsos MORI. To ensure reliability of coding and interpretat ion, I analysed all the transcripts and 50% of the transcripts were double -coded independently by Dr Anam Parand, an experienced qualitative researcher (Pope, Ziebland et al., 2000) . Differences were resolved through discussion and review until consensus w as reached. Using thematic analysis, an initial categorising system was developed based on the study objectives and the topics explored (Silverman, 2001; Flick, 2009) . New themes and sub -themes emerging from the data analysis were identified and included w hen deemed relevant by the coders. Two identical thematic indexes, one for influenza and one for tetanus, were produced to code the majority of the data. This coding strategy enabled me to evaluate whether the assessed factors were comparable between vacci nes or were vaccine -specific. I also examined whether participants' views varied depending upon their vaccination status. Additionally, a separate matrix was developed to code and analyse the categories and rankings proposed by participants during the card exercise in section 3 of the interview schedule . 76 4.3 Results 4.3.1 Participant characteristics Twenty members of the UK public were interviewed in May 2013. The sample was equally split by gender. Eight participants were 18 -49 years, seven were 50 -64 years and five were 65+. The majority were white British (N=16) and half were educated to university level. Just under half of the sample were retired or had a chronic health condition. Participants' characteristics are fully described in Table 4.3. Distinctive vaccina tion behaviour patterns emerged from the data. Thus, the dichotomous vaccination status (i.e. vaccinated/not vaccinated) initially employed was fine -tuned; participants were classified as regular (vaccinated most or all the time; N=8), intermittent (had va ccinated only for a period of time; N=5) and unvaccinated (never had vaccinated; N=7) tive (vaccinated before injury an in (both preven tive and injury -led) (N=3) and unvaccinated (never had vaccinated; N=4) for tetanus. In the sections that follow, I use this classification to report my findings. 4.3.2 Context of vaccine perceptions Participants widely agreed on the importance of vaccination in general and childhood vaccina tion in particular. When asked to rank influenza, tetanus, pneumococcal, hepatitis and MMR for adults (cards exercise), participants employed three main categories: disease severity, vaccine importance and vaccination age. Most found it difficult to catego rise MMR and generally regarded it as a childhood vaccine, despite interviewers stressing that it was also an adult vaccine . Severity of the disease emerged as a key classification category. Regular vaccinators classified influenza as the most or one of t he most severe diseases, followed by tetanus, pneumonia and hepatitis, although some stressed that their knowledge of the latter was limited. Overall, those who had not vaccinated against influenza did not perceive this disease to be as severe as hepatitis or pneumonia, and ranked tetanus as being more severe than influenza. \"How do vaccinations help? Well, in my opinion, they help to keep a lot of infection away. You could be infected by something and it could take your life, it could kill you if you neve r had that vaccination\" (P20) 77 N City Influenza vaccination Tetanus vaccination Age Gender Chronic illness Marital status Children under 18 Socioec. grade Private insurance Employment status Type of employment Education (completed) Religion Ethnicity 1 London Unvaccinated Unvaccinated 18-49 Male No Married Two ABC1 No Employed part-time Supervisor High school or equivalent Sikh Other ethnic group 2 London Regular Mixed 18-49 Female Yes Single None C2DE No Prefer not to say Shop owner, artisan, other Post -graduate degree Non White British 3 London Intermittent Injury -led 50-64 Male No Cohabiting One ABC1 No Employed full - time Middle management Secondary school Not stated White British 4 South East Unvaccinated Injury -led 50-64 Male No Married One ABC1 No Self-employed Business owner (full or partner) Post -graduate degree Hindu White British 5 London Regular Preventive 18-49 Male Yes Single None ABC1 No Self-employed Shop owner, artisan, other Post -graduate degree Non White British 6 London Regular Injury -led 65+ Female No Widowed None C2DE No Retired Employed position, not at a desk Primary school Christian White British 7 London Intermittent Injury -led 50-64 Male No Cohabiting One ABC1 No Self-employed Business owner (full or partner) University degree Christian White British 8 London Regular Preventive 50-64 Female No Married None ABC1 Yes Retired Employed position at a desk Secondary school Muslim White British 9 South East Unvaccinated Injury -led 65+ Female No Divorced None ABC1 No Retired Top management High school or equivalent Muslim White British 10 London Unvaccinated Injury -led 18-49 Female No Single None ABC1 No Self-employed Shop owner, artisan, other University degree Non White British 11 West Midlands Regular Mixed 18-49 Male Yes Married Two ABC1 No Looking for work Skilled manual worker Primary school Non White British 12 West Midlands Unvaccinated Unvaccinated 50-64 Female Yes Single None ABC1 No Retired Employed position at a desk University degree Buddhist Black background 13 West Midlands Intermittent Injury -led 50-64 Male Yes Married None ABC1 No Retired Middle management University degree Christian White British 14 West Midlands Unvaccinated Preventive 65+ Female No Divorced None C2DE No Retired Business owner (full or partner) High school or equivalent Non White British 15 London Intermittent Injury -led 18-49 Male No Single None C2DE No Self-employed Skilled manual worker University degree Christian Other white background 16 West Midlands Regular Unvaccinated 18-49 Male Yes Cohabiting None ABC1 No Student Employed position at a desk Primary school Non Other white background 17 West Midlands Regular Mixed 50-64 Male Yes Married None C2DE No Retired Professional (e.g. lawyer, architect) University degree Christian White British 18 West Midlands Intermittent Unvaccinated 65+ Female No Divorced One C2DE Yes Retired Middle management Post -graduate degree Christian White British 19 West Midlands Unvaccinated Preventive 18-49 Female Yes Married None ABC1 No Self-employed Other (unskilled manual worker) High school or equivalent Christian White British 20 West Midlands Regular Injury -led 65+ Female Yes Widowed None C2DE No Retired Employed position not at a desk Secondary school Other White British 4.3 Participant characteristics 78 Some of t hose who had previously vaccinated against influenza also chose vaccine importance to categoris e vaccines. Perceived vaccine importance was associated with both perceived severity and likelihood of the disease it protected against, and, consequently, the importance of \"being protected\". The influenza vaccine was ranked among the two most important vaccines, followed by tetanus, pneumonia, hepatitis and MMR. \"...I think so many very elderly people die of flu in the winter; I think [the flu jab] is important. Yes, that one [tetanus boosters] because as we grow up, certainly teenagers and everybody onwards needs one of those... The same with that one [pneumococcal vaccine] but I think there's more flu. I'm assuming there are more flus than pneumonia around\" (P14) Some participants used vaccination age as a ranking category and associated the influenza and pneumonia vaccines with adults, particularly the elderly. Hep atitis was also linked to adulthood. In contrast, t etanus was associated with teenagers and adults and MMR with children. 4.3.3 Drivers and barriers to vaccination: Findings of the thematic analysis Thematic saturation was reached at 14 interviews (i.e. no new t hemes appeared in the last 6 interviews that were carried out). Five overarching themes emerged from the analysis : i) perceived health and health behaviours; ii) knowledge; iii ) vaccination influences (salient previous experiences, healthcare professionals and media ); iv) disease appraisal (perceived susceptibility, severity and likelihood ); and v ) vaccination appraisal (perceived benefits and costs) . These are reported in detail below . 4.3.3.1 Perceived health and health behaviours Exercise, a balanced diet, not s moking and moderate alcohol consumption were perceived by most participants as desirable healthy behaviours, yet vaccination was generally not associated with the 'healthy living' paradigm. \"...I'm not 20 years old you know? I get tired so quickly. By keepi ng fit, going to the gym, and eating healthy you know, you're putting more life into your body\" (P1) Those with chronic conditions were generally aware of their health status and the recommended health behaviours for preventing complications, including inf luenza vaccination. Accordingly, two thirds of participants who reported having a chronic health condition regularly vaccinated against influenza and had had a preventive tetanus booster. However, they were the least likely to engage in other healthy behav iours. 79 4.3.3.2 Knowledge Several participants felt they did not know enough about influenza and tetanus, or the associated vaccines. Most mentioned that influenza was a potentially severe illness, yet those who had vaccinated in the past were more likely to stress it was a life -threatening disease. \"Well I know that people die from [flu], so it's quite serious [laughs], it can be quite serious. I don't think that I've ever had proper flu\" (P10) Participants were widely aware about high -risk groups but were less spe cific about the influenza symptoms, which were commonly referred to as a \"very bad cold\". Most knew the influenza vaccine was offered once a year and that it could cause side -effects. A third of the sample accurately mentioned that the vaccine did not prot ect against all circulating virus strands. \"I think like the surgery where I am, I think it's diabetes, chest complaints and old age pensioners that get [the flu jab]... I believe that it is the flu virus but it's not live. And is it grown in eggs is it? Bec ause I know my mother -in-law can't have it because she's allergic to eggs and that's where it starts. I believe that to be right. Which is why I think when people say, 'Oh it gave me the flu', I don't know if it does or if it doesn't, because it's never gi ven it to me\" (P11) Tetanus was generally referred as \"lockjaw\" and perceived to be a very serious disease; yet additional symptoms were seldom identified. Cuts, rust and animal bites were mentioned as main sources of infec tion. Some believed tetanus did not exist in the UK any more. \"...tetanus? Only that I believe it can lead to lockjaw, which is quite nasty, and I also believe that it can flow through, the actual localised injury can sort of lead to, say you have it in your foot, it could lead to amputati on, this is my belief\" (P7) Just under half of participants mentioned that a tetanus booster was recommended every 10 years and several noted they would get it if they had an injury, but they did not see the need to have it preventive ly. \"...I was under the awareness that it was every 10 years that you have to be vaccinated against tetanus... the influenza one in my mind is a preventative and the tetanus is also a preventative, but it can be taken after the incident\" (P10) 80 4.3.3.3 Vaccination influences 4.3.3.3.1 Salient previou s experiences Most participants reported experiencing influenza -like symptoms once or more times over the course of their lives and several stressed, unprompted, that they knew the difference between a cold and influenza. None of the participants had contr acted tetanus. \"...'No, no, I'm not having it', and then one year, I was, again, I was so ill here. It was just after Christmas, I can't remember what year it was, it was after I retired and I was so ill and I thought, 'Oh dear, maybe I should have had th at flu jab'. The following year I did have it and I've had it ever since and I have no problems at all \" (P6) Some participants reported they had considered having the influenza vaccine or had decided to get vaccinated after relatives or friends had either su ffered a bout of the disease or had recommended the influenza vaccine. \"I don't know that many people that have had really bad flu but I know the ones that have had it, when they've said how rotten they felt, I can't imagine feeling like that for three or four weeks in bed aching or whatever. So, for me, again, yes, the outcome is that I'd rather not have it than have it. \" (P2) All influenza unvaccinated participants , except one young healthy participant, mentioned that a relative , a friend or both had had a bad experience with the vaccine, and some recalled that although in certain seasons they had heard or read media reports about influenza -related deaths, no one they knew had been severely affected. \"I suppose, I can't remember, but I would seem to reme mber things, well, on the telly of people getting the flu, that people had died from getting the flu. That nobody I knew, I knew lots of people I knew got the flu , but nobody died from it and I suppose from a sort of childhood perspective, I just tho ught f lu is just like a cold, but a bit worse. \" (P4) Some tetanus vaccinators also mentioned that advice from a relative had influenced their decision to seek medical help after an injury. \"Yes, well, I was frightened. Well, it's not so much me that's frightened , my daughter, she kind of hits the roof, she's worried all the time, you see, 'You've got to have [the tetanus booster], Mum. Mum, you don't know, you don't know where the dog's been\" (P6) 81 4.3.3.3.2 Healthcare professionals Many participants had discussed vaccinati ons, particularly influenza, with their GP . Several unvaccinated or intermittent vaccinators expressed negative feelings toward healthcare professionals, which revolved around GP's lack of empathy, NHS perverse incentives (e.g. GPs receiving payments for e ach administered vaccine) and general distrust of the medical profession. In contrast, all regular influenza vaccinators reported that their GPs had recommended and routinely reminded them to get vaccinated during regular consultations, through GP surgery adverts and letters. Some participants mentioned they had either got vaccinated against influenza or were reminded to do so at a pharmacy. \"My doctor, my GP, yes, he's the one who started the ball rolling with the flu vaccine... I know when they'll start because it's on the surgery wall, you know, 'Get your flu vaccine here', whatever... I'm almost living in these people's pockets, you know. I br ing them all panettone at Christmas\" (P5) Receiving a tetanus booster preventive ly or after an injury was generally triggered by a recommendation from a GP or an A&E doctor. \"Yes, I fell and cut the jeans open and had a big gash and elbow gash as well, bu t nothing serious I thought. But I went to the doctor... she said, 'Just when was the last time you had your tetanus jab?' I sort of looked and thought, 'No, I can't remember. I know I have had tetanus jabs, but...' She said, 'Well if you can't remember, you 'll have to have a tetanus jab', so that was that\" (P7) Some participants, however, reported that healthcare professionals seemed somewhat unsure as to what the course of action was, particularly when the request for a booster was patient -led. \"Does tetanus exist in the UK or not? Don't go round to the surgery and they go, 'You don't really need that.' What sort of message does that give out? Yes? Do I or don't I?... Where is the provision of this information? Is it schools? Who's doing it? Is i t the GP? Is it from birth? This is the thing I think they've got to worry about here...\" (P5) Others mentioned they hoped their GPs would know from their electronic medical records when they were due for a tetanus booster. Two participants, one intermittent and one unvaccinated , raised specific concerns regarding the pharmaceutical industry's lack of trustworthiness. 82 \"...pharmaceutical companies are out to make a buck... I'm not an advocate of conspiracy theories but these people have got enormous power and a lo t of money and they wouldn't be above publishing a lot of information and research that scares the hell out of us, so we all go and get a vaccine\" (P8) 4.3.3.3.3 Media Some participants mentioned finding out the risks of catching influenza through the news (accessed through different media ), whilst others had read about influenza vaccines' risks mainly through user - generated web -based sources such as personal blogs and social media. \"I'm friends with a professor on Facebook, and he just constantly puts things about t he poison that's going into your body with the flu jab and everything, and he is very switched - on... I know he's extreme so I don't totally think, 'Everything he says is absolutely right', but I do think sometimes there's no smoke without fire\" (19) 4.3.3.4 Disease appraisal 4.3.3.4.1 Perceived susceptibility As mentioned in Chapter 3, s usceptibility denotes constitutional vulnerability to a particular hazard, rather than the likelihood of exposure to it. All regular and some intermittent influenza vaccinators reported feeling susceptible to the disease. \"...I know that I can't afford to get the flu because it's very, I've never had it, I know some people are in bed for a couple of weeks. If I had it, I'd probably be off for a month and it would be really bad for me. But some pe ople don't have that attitude because maybe the risk of getting something isn't such a big deal. But I don't\" (P2) In contrast, although some unvaccinated participants said they would consider having the vaccine when they were older and therefore more vuln erable to influenza, most felt that the risks influenza currently posed to their health did not warrant vaccination. Furthermore, some intermittent and unvaccinated participants , felt they were able to prevent influenza by \"improving the immune system\" or \"keeping healthy\". \"[If] I get the flu now, I'm pretty unlikely to die from it because I'm quite healthy and I had it a couple of years ago and I was all right. So [I] think, 'Well, it's not worth taking it now but if the danger arises, so to speak, so lik e as I get older, then I probably would'\" (P4) 83 A minority of preventive vaccinators reported feeling particularly vulnerable to tetanus. Having a \"good immune system\" was raised by only one injury -led vaccinator as a reason why they did not feel the need t o have a preventive tetanus booster. 4.3.3.4.2 Perceived severity Most participants acknowledged that influenza could be life -threatening for high -risk groups, but only a few were concerned about having a severe bout of the disease. The majority, particularly those who had not vaccinated , perceived themselves as being able to \"cope\" with influenza . \"So, I've never, never thought of [the flu] as being a kind of dangerous thing to have... I'd seen things on the telly of people dying, that people did die from it , althoug h mostly kind of elderly and weak people\" (P4) In contrast, just under half of participants, most of whom had had a preventive booster, stated that they had a tetanus booster for fear of contracting a life -threatening disease. \"I suppose [I am] generally a ware that [tetanus] was a dangerous thing to get and could kill you if you weren't looked after properly. Lockjaw it used to be called, didn't it?... and that was always a scary thought, a scary way to die\" (P17) 4.3.3.4.3 Perceived likelihood Most regular influenza vaccinators felt they were likely to catch influenza, whereas some intermittent and unvaccinated participants felt it was unlikely they would catch it. Participants generally interchanged susceptibility to influenza and likelihood of getting it throughout their interviews. \"I'd say 20 plus and it becomes more difficult to catch, but under that then obviously a lot of germs are being spread about. The same with older people as well, because your immune system gets a lot weaker when you 're older, so it'll be easier to catch if you're old\" (P16) Almost half of the sample mentioned they were likely to contract tetanus, commonly due to lifestyle choices (e.g. gardening or travelling abroad), risky work environment (e.g. construction) or inj uries. The other half, however, felt the likelihood of contracting tetanus was very low. \"A flu jab or the MMR or something, these were things that you might possibly get; you might or you might not. The tetanus, I might possibly get infected but there's m ore of a chance of me getting it now because I've got an injury there that's swollen\" (P3) 84 4.3.3.5 Vaccination appraisal 4.3.3.5.1 Perceived benefits Although many were aware that the influenza vaccine was not 100% effective, those who vaccinated regularly were more likely to acknowledge the benefits of being protected or protecting a vulnerable family member against influenza, albeit partiall y. Remaining productive at work or at home was raised as one of the benefits of influenza vaccination. \"So, for me, [influenza vaccin ation] is one of these things that I fit into time... I was freelance working, so I got paid when I actually worked, so if you had flu, it's three or four weeks... you not want to be ill really because four weeks off work, not many people can afford to not be paid for four weeks\" (P2) Most participants, however, were unsupportive of the paediatric influenza vaccine. Many stated that \"children's immune system should be built naturally\" whereas others questioned the need for an influenza vaccine for children due to perceived low prevalence of the disease among this group. \"I used to work in a school and I'm not aware of children getting influenza\" (P8) Being immunis ed against tetanus was considered important, yet many thought a booster was only needed after an injury and not as a preventive measure. \"I thought because we travel a lot, I thought that's important to having [the tetanus boosters] up -to-date and it's not good to get...I think it's called lockjaw, isn't it, if you're not up-to-date with tetanus? That I t hink is very important\" (P8) In contrast, the majority of participants felt that vaccinating children against tetanus preventive ly was necessary, as they were more prone to falls and injuries. 4.3.3.5.2 Perceived costs 4.3.3.5.2.1 Vaccine side -effects and safety Some intermittent and most unvaccinated participants mentioned the influenza vaccine's side - effects as a main concern. The most commonly mentioned adverse effects were influenza -like symptoms and pain in the arm. Compared to other vaccines, such as tetanus , the influenza vaccine was generally perceived as unreliable, particularly by those who had not vaccinated in the past, and some participants thought the vaccine caused influenza. 85 \"A lot of people I've heard say, 'Had my blooming flu jab and I still had f lu, I was really poorly with it afterwards'. So I've heard that it's not totally effective. Whereas, as far as I'm aware, something like the measles jab, it's very, very rare to then go on to get measles after you've had your jab; with tetanus as well and so on, as long as you have it every time that you're meant to.\" (P19) Others mentioned side -effects could change yearly, depending of the composition of the vaccine, and others believed the vaccine was unsafe. \"...if it's not broke, then you don't fix it, sort of thing and, okay, you can take a [flu] vaccine but I don't know what's in the vaccine. It might be fine and one would hope that it's been thoroughly researched and thoroughly tested but then I also know that there have been things in the past that h ave supposedly been thoroughly tested that then turn out to have something, side effect or something wrong with them. So, I won't, I don't want to take that risk unless the risk equates against the danger\" (P4) No important concerns regarding the side -effects or safety of tetanus boosters were raised. Several participants noted that the vaccine had been sufficiently tested and that they had not heard anything negative about it. 4.3.3.5.2.2 Needle -related pain Some participants, including regular influenza vaccinators, were apprehensive about needles. Feelings of fear generally stemmed from their previous experiences or those of others. \"...it was either my second or third [flu jab]... She literally just stabbed me with a needle and took me completely by surprise, so that w orried me\" (P16) Fear of needles, however, generally waned when confronted with the decision of vaccinating against a disease which was perceived as a serious threat to their health: tetanus in most cases and influenza in the case of those who reported fe eling particularly vulnerable to it. 4.3.3.5.2.3 Practical barriers Competing priorities or lack of time was raised by some as the main practical barrier to influenza vaccination. 86 \"It's just kind of seeing myself at risk, having the time... Just the same as having any inoculation, having to book an appointment, the accessibility to it. I don't really like needles\" (P15) Although affordability was not an issue, two participants who were not eligible to have a free vacci ne through the NHS had difficulties getting it elsew here. One reported lack of vaccine availability at the local pharmacy and the other was denied the vaccine at a supermarket due to high blood pressure. Just under a third of participants mentioned that keeping up -to-date with tetanus boosters was challengi ng due to their recommended time interval (10 years). 4.4 Discussion This study explored in depth the socio -psychological factors influencing adult vaccination uptake in the UK. My results suggest that the public have no general concept of adult immuni sation, as they have for childhood immunis ation. Instead, their beliefs and attitudes are vaccine -specific and in some cases age -specific. Participants classified influenza and tetanus, and to a lesser extent pneumonia, as severe diseases. Consistent with their di sease appraisal, participants felt that the influenza, tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines were important. Understandably, few participants had heard of the hepatitis vaccines or knew about hepatitis, as both hepatitis A and B are uncommon in the UK. Partici pants generally associated influenza and pneumonia vaccines with older age, tetanus with adolescence and MMR with childhood. The perceived age segmentation and general lack of awareness of an adult immunisation schedule may be a ref lection of the way adult immunis ation policy in the UK has been communicated. Although a recent shift toward 'life course vaccination' (Gusmano and Michael, 2009) is a move in the right direct ion, unlike the CDC's annually Recommended adult immunization schedule (Advisory Committ ee on Immunization Practices, 2013) , the NHS provides an overall schedule fr om 2 to 70 years old, which includes only three adult vaccines, all for over 65s: influenza, pneumococcal and the recently introduced shingles vaccine (NHS (1), 2014) . The rest of the recommended adult vaccines fall into the \"Vaccines for special groups\" and \"Travel vaccines\" categories detailed in additional documents or webpages, which , in turn , include many sub -categories and at times somewhat ambiguous exceptions. A case in poin t is the tetanus booster recommendation, which states: \" A tetanus vaccination is usually recommended for anyone who: has not been vaccinated before, has not been fully vaccinated, is travelling to a country with limited medical facilities, and whose last dose of the tetanus vaccine was more than 10 years ago \"(NHS (3), 2014) . 87 Participants' knowledge about influenza and the influenza vaccine was reasonably accurate and generally acquired through mainstream media, mostly TV news, and healthcare professionals , whereas information about vaccine risks was usually found online and in some cases in social networking sites such as Facebook. These findings resonate with those from previous research evaluating the impact of different media on vaccination behaviour (Maurer, Uscher -Pines et al., 2010) and suggest that mass vaccination campaigns are indeed improving knowledge and prompting uptake. They also indicate that confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998) may be driving hesitant individuals to seek unofficial sources th at provide information at odds with scientific evidence and against vaccination - which confirms their own reluctance . Knowledge about tetanus was less specific, but most participants were aware of the severity of the disease. Key vaccination drivers for influenza were the perceived risk of the disease, commonly assessed in the literature as a combination of perceived disease susceptibility, severity and likelihood (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) , and a GP recommendation. In contrast, perceived lack of sus ceptibility to influenza, concerns around the vaccine side -effects and partial effectiveness were the main barriers to vaccination. These findings are comparable to those reported in Chapters 2 and 3 and in previous studies assessing social and psychologic al underpinnings of vaccination (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) . Whilst the drivers of tetanus vaccination were analogous to those of inf luenza vaccination, the barriers were somewhat different and mostly related to lack of awareness, consistent with previous research (Johnson, Nichol et al., 2008; B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011) , and variable vaccination practices. There is some indication th at preventive vaccination is initiated by the vaccinee, while injury -led vaccination is instigated by healthcare professionals . I found that social influences played an important role in vaccination behaviour, sometimes trumping participants' factual knowledge. Regular influenza vaccinators were more prone to consider th e advice of relatives and peers and have positive attitudes tow ard healthcare professionals than those who were not vaccinated . Furthermore, vaccinators reported that receiving regular reminders from their GPs about the influenza vaccine triggered vaccination uptake, which suggests that such reminders were indeed fal ling on fertile ground. This resonates with a vast body of literature which shows that a recommendation from a healthcare professional and routine reminders significantly influence vaccination uptake (Thomas, Russell et al., 2010) . Conversely, participants who showed a lack of trust toward healthcare professionals or had a relative or friend who had reported a negative experience with the vaccine , were more likely to refuse vaccination or ignore their GP's recommendation. Preventive tetanus vaccinators also displayed favourable 88 opinions toward doctors. However, some participants also felt healthcare professionals were hesitant when asked for advice on whether or not to receive a booster, which is another indication that the current tetanus vaccination policy in the UK may lead to inconsistent or inappropriate practice (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) . In line with previous research reporting tetanus over -vaccination in A&E (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) , participants generally associated tetanus boosters with the t reatment of injuries as opposed to the prevention of tetanus . However, some also felt that \"keeping up -to-date\" with tetanus vaccination (every 10 years) was important. My findings suggest t hat a convoluted tetanus immunis ation policy may not only underpin the routine administration of tetanus boosters in UK A&E departments , but also GP practices. Excess vaccination may be further exacerbated by the recently added 'Adult Immunisation Program' section of the Green Book (the official and most up -to-date sourc e of information on immunis ation for healthcare professionals in the UK), which features tetanus vaccination for adults prominently, above the influenza and pneumococcal vaccines (PHE (2), 2013 ). Worryingly, my results indicate that tetanus boosters may of ten be administered after an injury to prevent a possible infection. However, current guidelines state that the recommended course of action is administering intravenous human tetanus immunoglobulin, as the tetanus vaccine may not boost immunity in time to provide adequate protection (PHE (5 ), 2013) . Attitudes toward childhood vaccines were often discordant with views on the adult versions of the same vaccines , further supporting the notion that people's perceptions are disease, vaccine and age specific. Whilst participants were acc epting of children being immunis ed against tetanus, they were largely unsupportive of paediatric influenza vaccination, consistent with parental concerns reported in previous studies (Ramet, Weil -Olivier et al., 2007) . Although s ome attitudes may be unsubstantiated (e.g. \"children's immune system should be built naturally\"), others, such as the lack of perceived need for paediatric influenza vaccines, may be explained by the comparatively low child mortality attributed to this dis ease (CDC (2), 2014) . 4.4.1 Limitations of this study Although interviews were conducted in an open and non -judgmental manner and efforts were made to minimis e availability and social desirability biases, it is possible that some participants may at times have felt compelled to give what they perceived to be rational or desirable answers. Furthermore, it is likely that recall bias may have influenced some of the participants' recollections about past experiences, particularly those around tetanus boosters. 89 Of similar importance, the composition and size of my sample , although balanced and appropriate for a qualitative study (Pope and Mays, 2006), may have an effect on the generalisability of my results . Promisingly, the achieved theme saturation is a good in dication of sample adequacy. Yet, experimental and quantitative study designs should be used to further test my findings. 4.4.2 Summary and implications for further research This study found that the uptake of both influenza and tetanus vaccines is largely driven by people's risk perception of these diseases. For influenza, this appears to be mediated by trust in healthcare professionals and the perceived risks of the vaccine, insofar as the latter do not outweigh the perceived risks of influenza. The tetanus vaccine is largely viewed as sufficiently tested and safe, whereas the changing composition of the influenza vaccine is a cause of uncertainty and distrust. The broader i mplications for policy and practice of this and the following studies will be addressed in the main discussion of the thesis (Chapter 8). Of immediate relevance to the next chapter , in order to gain an in -depth understanding of vaccination decision -making processes, it is necessary to uncover the internal and external influences and triggers that lead people to vaccinate or remain unimmunised over time. I report on the development and testing of a new approach to elicit these aspects in Chapter 5. 90 5 Journey to vaccination: a qualitative exploration of the factors influencing adult vaccination behaviour over time 5.1 Introduction Making decisions about our own health in general, and vaccinations in particular, can be a difficult task. Typically, it involves n avigating an often intricate healthcare system, discussing the issue with a healthcare professional , researching the internet, consulting family members and peers, and trying to make sense of a vast amount information, which is likely to be incomplete and conflicting (Hunink, 2001) . A key challenge in health decision -making processes is weighing up the benefits of an intervention versus its potential harm. In the case of vaccination, this process can be particularly complex as it often entails the assessme nt of several disease -related variables including severity, likelihood of catching the pathogen and susceptibility to it, as well as vaccine attributes such as effectiveness, side-effects and safety, among others (Serpell and Green, 2006) . Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of vaccines are normally conveyed in statistical terms, a language that has proven to be difficult to grasp for most people. For example, results from an experimental study showed that 16% to 20% of highly educated participants answ ered incorrectly relatively simple questions about risk magnitudes (e.g., which represents the larger risk: 1%, 5%, (Lipkus, Samsa et al., 2001) . Therefore , it is conceivable that a significantly larger proportion of less educated individuals, who constitute a majority of the population, are likely to misunderstand this type of data. As described in Chapter 1, people rely on a limited number of heuristics when asse ssing risk, which reduce the complexity of calculating probabilities and predicting outcomes to simpler mental operations (Meehl, 1954; Simon, 1957; Kahneman and Tversky, 1973). By its very nature, the use of heuristics can be efficient and accurate in som e occasions, but it can also lead to cognitive errors and flawed decision making when used in circumstances that require thorough logical analysis (Kahneman, Slovic et al., 1982) . Furthermore, individuals' judgement is often influenced by their context and personal or family experiences, whether these are conscious or not (De Martino, Kumaran et al., 2006) . Health decisions in general, and vaccination decisions in particular, can also be significantly influenced by patients' trust in healthcare professional s and the latter's ability to communicate risk effectively (Alaszewski and Horlick -Jones, 2003) . 91 As noted in Chapter 4, although some qualitative studies have explored aspects of influenza vaccination decisions in the UK (Telford and Rogers, 2003; Evans, P rout et al., 2007; Kwong, Pang et al., 2010) , thus far, little research has investigated how participants' own contex t, experiences and risk assessment approaches influence their vaccination decision -making process over time. 5.1.1 Study aims The overarching aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the socio -psychological factors influencing the uptake of influenza and tetanus vaccines in the UK, by exploring how people's context and experiences shape their beliefs, attitudes and behaviour toward these vaccines. A secondary objective was to develop more effective methods to elicit such data. Specific ally, I aimed to: i) elicit the wider constellation of socio -psychological factors likely to influence adult vaccination decisions over time; ii) explore how health services and immunisation communications im pact vaccination behaviour; iii ) evaluate differences and commonalities between vaccines ; and iv) assess whether vaccination decisions are driven by scientific facts or heuristics . 5.1 Methods The methods of t his study are described fully in Chapter 4. I detail below the conceptual framework and developm ent of the \"journey to vaccination \" approach, as well as the procedures and analyses specific to this approach. 5.1.1 Conceptual framework This research sits well within the constructivist (or interpretivist) paradigm, which is concerned with people's experiences from the perspective of those who live them, and whereby the researcher and participant \"jointly create findings from their interactive dialogue and interpretation\" (Ponterotto, 2005) . From an epistemological point of view, however, my position draws from both constructivism and positivism, in that I recognise there is a degree of bias introduced by the researcher's experience when creating knowle dge, b ut the researcher endeavour s to be objective and to elicit the participant's experience in an unprejudiced manner (Sciarra, 1999) . The methodology of this study rests on two theoretical approaches: heuristics and biases, specifically the availabilit y heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973) Bitner, 1992; Kingman -Brundage, 1992) . These approaches are described in detail in Chapter 1. 92 5.1.2 Development and testing of a new approach: journey to vaccination Most qualitative studies in the field of vaccination decision -making have elicited barriers and enablers to vaccination using traditional methodological approaches such as explicit enquiry (e.g. why di d you vaccinate?) and indiscriminate use of probes, often within a focus group setting. A key shortcoming of these approaches is that the influence of individuals' personal circumstances and past experiences on vaccination decisions over time is seldom exp lored. Thus, researchers may fail to notice participants' tendency to fall back on readily available information and report post - decisional rationalisations of their behaviours rather than actual drivers. In an effort to address these shortcomings, a new qualitative approach call ed \"journey to vaccination \" was developed in collaboration with Ipsos MORI . Anchore d on the two complementary lines of thought described above and nested within the quali tative research tradition, the j ourney to vaccination is a vi sual exercise in which the interviewer and the participant jointly build a timeline that captures salient events that led the participant to get or not to get vaccinated. The exercise starts with a participant's latest influenza or tetanus vaccination expe rience as an adult; it then extends backwards to the participant's first memory of such experience. The participant is asked to describe these events, which in turn allows the interviewer to indirectly elicit a range of factors that affected positively or negatively the decision to get vaccinated. Importantly, this exercise enables the participant to produce a personal historical narrative, through which vaccination decisions are discussed as a continuum and not in isolation from each other or from other im portant health, or lifestyle -related decisions. The j ourney to vaccination approach was designed to comprehensively capture psychological but also social influences on vaccination decisions , and to better understand the interplay between these influences and health services and immunisation communications . Participants were, therefore, asked to recall key actors who were involved in the vaccination process (e.g. their family or GP ) and how they influenced the process. Emotional aspects of the decision maki ng were also explored and taken into account. The j ourney to vaccination section of my interviews lasted approximately 20 minutes. Two versions were used: one for vaccinated and one for non -vaccinated participants (see Appendices 8 and 9). Key interview questions included: 1) How would you describe to a friend how you came to have (or not to have) the vaccination? What things happened that meant you ended up getting vaccinated?; 2) What would you say happened at that point that triggered t hat change? And why was that important? 3) How did you know where to go for the vaccination? How did you book an 93 appointment and fit it into your plans? What other things were competing for your time?; 4) Before you were vaccinated, do you remember any tim es when you thought about or started the process toward being vaccinated but didn't end up getting vaccinated? (only for vaccinated); 5) Of all of those things, which would you say was the most important thing that led to you not getting vaccinated? And the second most important thing? And the third? (only for non-vaccinated) 5.1.3 Data Analysis As reported in Chapter 4, the recorded interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy by Ipsos MORI. To ensure reliability of coding and interpretation, all the transcripts were analysed by mysel f and 50% of the transcripts were double -coded independently by Dr Anam Parand (Pope, Ziebland et al., 2000) . Differences were resolved through dialogue until consensus was reached. The data was analysed using an ideographic strategy - investigating indivi duals in personal, in -depth detail to achieve a unique understanding of them (Allport , 1962 ; Barlow and Nock, 2009 ). Based on the customer journey mapping approach described in Chapter 1, previous evidence on vaccination behaviour (Chapters 2 and 3) and a spects emerging from the data analysis , an initial linear coding framework was proposed. This was comprised of three stages and a number of touchpoints through which the individual interacts with immunisation services: 1) pre -vaccination period (appointment with a healthcare professional , information - websites, news, vaccination campaigns - and reminders from healthcare professionals ); 2) the vaccination experience itself (location, consultation experience and vaccination experience); and 3) a post -vaccination experience (vaccine quality - e.g. side -effects, effectiveness - and post -vaccination advice or information from healthcare professionals and other official sources) (Dunn and Davis, 2002; Shaw and Ivens, 2002; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 20 13). An important component of a j ourney to vaccination is a cue to action or trigger, which consists of an internal or external stimulus (e.g. salient health related experiences, advice from a relative) that prompts individuals to vaccinate or not to vac cinate , as proposed by the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, Strecher et al., 1988) . Existing evidence suggests that vaccination triggers may usually take place during the pre -vaccination stage and could sometimes overlap with vaccination touchpoints (Wheel ock, Thomson et al., 2013) . For example, a vaccination reminder letter from the general practitioner would be both a trigger and a touchpoint, if participants explicitly mention that the letter prompted them to vaccinate. All triggers were coded under the relevant vaccination stage and touchpoint, when applicable. 94 The j ourney to vaccination section of the transcripts was analysed alongs ide the hand drawn journeys. A j ourney to vaccination or non -vaccination for influenza and one for tetanus were produced fo r each participant. Differences and commonalities emerging from these data were identified and synthesised, and typical journeys proposed. 5.2 Results The characteristics of the sample are described in the previous chapter. Briefly, participants were classifie d as regular (N=8), intermittent (N=5) and unvaccinated (N=7) influenza; and injury -led (n=9), mixed (N=3) and unvaccinated (N=4) for tetanus. Findings from this study are reported using this classification. Although each journey to v accination or non -vaccination was unique, I found important sub -group commonalities in the reported triggers and touch -points and the order in which these took place (see Figur e 5.1 ). 5.2.1 Influen za vaccination journey s Most regular influenza vaccinators had their first vaccine following a consultation with their GP, where they had been diagnosed with a chronic health condition (e.g. diabetes), and all were eligible for a free vaccine. The majority reported receiving a routine GP reminder to g et the influenza vaccine before the beginning of the influenza season and felt their relationship with their GP was generally positive. Except for one participant who vaccinated to protect a vulnerable family member, all regular influenza vaccinators also recalled feeling vulnerable to the disease at the time of vaccination. \"I just know, and I can always [tell]. I t's literally when it just starts getting cold and the hot weather stops and then it's colder weather ... My chest starts getting worse and stuff like that, so I just go and get it done and th en I'll ask if I'm due for one... I don't really like needles and someone said I'm quite nervous and everything, but it's just a load off your mind and I don't really have to think of it that m uch, because it's o nce a year.\" (P16) 95 Tetanus vaccination Influenza vaccination \"[Tetanus is] not really common or anything like that, so I wouldn't really see the need. Plus, other than my asthma, I do have quite a good immune system .\" (P16) \"I was chatting to the nurse... you get talking about what you do: 'well, it's about time you had a tetanus booster'. I've had tetanus jabs for as long as I can remember, from my footballing days .\" (P17) \"I was bit ten by a dog... I went to A&E and they asked: 'when did you last have a tetanus?' I really couldn't remember so they said: 'if you want we'll give you another tetanus just to make sure' .\" (P3) \"Well, [tetanus] is quite a frightening thing to have... I always knew it was quite bad because my mother was very hot on making sure you had tetanus jabs and things .\" (P14) \"I feel well now; why should I have an anti -flu jab and then it might not make me seriously ill but it might make me feel under the weather and I don't want to feel like that.\" (P14 ) \"[I would do] Anything to make my life better, anything... Flu and diseases wreak havoc with my epilepsy .\" (P5) \"As a student I had the flu... I kept sort of having flu jabs after that, but then I kind of forgot and I was more interested in the children's health .\" (P7) Consultation Experience Vaccination location HCP reminder Information (media, official sources) HCP Vaccine Quality Vaccination Experience Advice/information (HCP, official sources ) Healthcare touchpoint Vaccination trigger Non-vaccination trigger HCP = healthcare professional HJ = heuristic judgement PRE-VACCINATION VACCINATION POST -VACCINATION Regular Intermittent Unvaccinated Injury -led Mixed Unvaccinated Consultation Experience Vaccination location HCP reminder Information (media, official sources ) HCP Vaccine Quality Vaccination Experience Advice/information (HCP, official sources ) Preven tive Chronic condition Felt vulnerable or had influenza Mostly positive Felt vulnerable - Chronic condition - Ill relative Felt vulnerable or had influenza Did not feel vulnerable (HJ) - Jab side -effects (HJ) - Jab effectiveness (HJ) - Not eligible - Jab side-effects (HJ) - Did not feel vulnerable (HJ) - Unaware of need - Only if injured - Mother's warning in childhood (HJ) - Peers or relatives' advice - Mother's warning in childhood (HJ) - Chronic condition (felt vulnerable/fear of severity) - Travel Injury Childhood trauma (HJ) - Felt vulnerable - Fear of severity - Chronic condition (felt vulnerable/fear of severity) Injury - Felt vulnerable - Fear of severity Figure 5.1 Journeys to vaccination 96 Some regular vaccinators noted the vaccine was not \"100% effective\" and mentioned they had also experienced influenza -like symptoms after vaccinating, but they felt the alternative (i.e. catching influenz a) was worse. \"Yes, because I guess the people that you have to trust, because it's their field, would say, 'Well, you've been unlucky first of all and who knows how bad it would've been if you'd not had t he jab to lessen the effects of [influenza].\" (P17) Similarly, intermittent vaccinators reported getting their first influenza vaccine after being diagnosed with a chronic illness, after experiencing a severe bout of influenza -like illness or to protect a vulnerab le relative . Most also felt vulnerable due to their underlying condition or their recent influenza experience . Yet , they did not recall receiving a GP reminder. When asked about how they felt during the seasons they had not vaccinated , most mentioned they had not felt particularly vulnerable to influenza , thus vaccination had not been a priority or need. \"Then I think I've probably got rather blas\u00e9... You're brought up sharp when you have had something like cancer, you think 'crikey, yes' your own mortality and all that, and then slowly, although it is always there, but slowly you regain some of your nonchalance about things. \" (P18) A perceived lack of susceptibility to influenza was common among those who had not vaccinated , particularly if they did no t belong to a high -risk group . Unvaccinated p articipants who were eligible for an influenza vaccine received regular vaccination reminders from their GP , but had ignored them , and some expressed negative feelings toward healthcare professional s. \"It's a practice, and every time I go I see somebody di fferent and they're all the same GPs. Pen in hand ready to write you a prescription, rather than...they don't have time to perhaps really discuss if you have a problem. \" (P9) A third of those who had not vaccinated recalled a traumatic health -related experience during childhood, including painful vaccination, allergy to (injected) penicillin or frequent tonsillitis ( that required penicillin injections), which had left them fearful of needles. \"Somehow I feel children need to be more protected than adu lts, because they don't have a say in really what happens to them. Adults can refuse, and the children go with their parents not knowing what's going to happen, that they're going to have a needle stuck in them and it's going to hurt, and they could be ill . Yes, I have [had a bad experience with 97 injections]. Throughout my life I've had a lot of allergies, and so I had to have lots of injections as an older child, not a young child. I used to go to somebody who was not very gentle and just did a lot of stabb ing with the needle, so yes\" (P9) Yet, p eers or media reports about the side-effects of the influenza vaccine (mainly influenza -like symptoms) or its partial efficacy were the most salient concerns among unvaccinated participants . \"Yes, I've also heard various people have been ill after having the injection. I think it's meant to give you a bit of flu for you to bu ild up antibodies or something... I thought, well, I feel well now; why should I have an anti -flu jab and then it might not make me seriously ill but it might make me feel under the weather and I don't want to feel like that. \" (P14) Influenza vaccinators' decision -making was generally driven by facts, whereas the vaccination behavio ur of intermittent and unvaccinated participants was based on a combination of logic and heuristic reasoning. The latter was employed when evaluating the benefits of the vaccine versus its costs - which were generally magnified and supported by anecdotal evidence. 5.2.2 Tetanus vaccination journey s Participan ts who reported having tetanus boosters preven tively felt susceptible to tetanus due to a chronic illness such as diabetes, or felt likely to get it due to life -style choices such as travel or gardening. They also reported feelings of fear toward the disea se triggered by memories of their mothers' warnings about tetanus during childhood. \"I remember years ago, I think my brother fell over, I don't know if he banged his head or something and he cut himself, and I remember them saying he had to have a tetanu s... I just always remember my mum saying 'You've got to have a tetanus now, you haven't had a tetanus since you were little, and you need your tetanus' .\" (P19) Similarly, those who had a booster after an injury mentioned they had gone to A&E and accepted it for fear of contracting a life -threatening disease. Most also recalled their mother's warnings during childhood about the dangers of contracting tetanus. Conversations with peer s or advice from relative s to get a tetanus booster was also mention ed by injury -led vaccinators as important vaccination trigger s. Yes, yes, because some of us sometimes would have to be using massive hammers and we were knocking down walls and stuff like that, and sometimes something would come and it would cut and then I'd th ink, yes, this cut here could be a tetanus cut. So, we would joke 98 and we'd say, 'Oh, you've got a cut. Hope you had the jab. You've probably got tetanus but that's fine'...\" (P15) Unvaccinated participants were either not aware of adult boosters or reported that they had not had tetanus -prone injury that required vaccination . Only one participant mentioned that tetanus was uncommon, so vaccinating was unnecessary. None of the participants reported concerns about the boosters' safety or efficacy. \"As I say, I always thought of it as something when, you know, if the dog bit you, well, 'Ooh, you need to go for a tetanus injection'. I hadn't ever thought of it really in terms of preventative.\" (P18) Decisions around tetanus vaccination were generally based on logi c, insofar as they were aligned with what participants perceived to be healthcare professional s' position. However, in some cases, childhood memories triggered a strong protective response which may have not been proportionate with participants' actual risk. 5.3 Discussion This study explored the social and psychological factors underpinning adult vaccination upta ke over time, alongside partici pants' experience of health and immunisation services. It also gauged differences and similarities of vaccination journeys across vaccines and vaccination status, and assessed whether vaccination decisions were made using lo gic, heuristics or a combination of both. The j ourney to vaccination methodology allowed me to narrow down on the most important triggers to vaccination and non -vaccination, and to uncover new ones. I found that participants' perceived susceptibility to in fluenza and perceived susceptibility to and severity of tetanus were key triggers to vaccination. These two factors formed an \"emotional prism\" through which the vaccines' costs and benefits were assessed. Those who felt vulnerable to influenza, for exampl e, although still able to recognise the vaccine's side -effects and partial efficacy, were more likely to receive the influenza vaccine than those who did not feel vulnerable. The latter, on the contrary, were more prone to focus on the vaccine costs than i ts benefits. A striking psychological finding of this study is that previous experiences related to injections, particularly during childhood, had both a positive and a negative influence on vaccination uptake. One-third of influenza unvaccinated particip ants reported having had a traumatic experience with vaccines, injections or medication in the past, which they stated had influenced their decision to not 99 vaccinate against influenza. This resonates with previous research which showed that painful neonata l experiences such as circumcision or Heel Stick Capillary Blood sampling in neonates can magnify the experience of pain later in life (Chamberlain, 1989; Taddio, Katz et al., 1997) . Similarly, some tetanus vaccinators recalled that the memory of their mot her's warnings about the danger of contracting tetanus in childhood had influenced their decision to have a tetanus booster. These findings suggest that pain (caused by needles) and fear (of contracting a severe disease) during childhood could become both a potent vaccination deterrent and enabler in adulthood , thus vaccination behaviour should be viewed as a continuum - from childhood to adulthood. More research in this area is needed. My r esults showed that tetanus vaccination was practically a non -decis ion; none of the participants had refused a booster. This may be explained by the combination of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, particularly after an injury, and the widespread belief that tetanus boosters were stable in their com position and \"tried and tested\", therefore safe. This research also shed light on the opportunity offered by healthcare touchpoints to harness vaccination triggers and defuse non -vaccination ones . For influenza vaccination, a clear diagnosis of a releva nt chronic illness and a subsequent vaccine recommendation from a healthcare professional , regular vaccination reminders and a positive consultation experience, resulted in regular vaccination . Conversely, those who had not vaccinated were more likely to have had a bad experience with vaccines or injections in childhood (during a consultation with a healthcare professional ), were more prone to focus on negative information about the influenza vaccine and to ignore vaccination reminders . This suggests that, for some individuals, these three pre -vaccination touchpoints are ineffective at best and detrimental to vaccination uptake at worst. In the case of tetanus , healthcare touchpoints appeared to be less important than vaccination trigg ers. Although a recommendation from a healthcare professional and information from websites (e.g. NHS, pharmacies) were the most mentioned touchpoints among preventive vaccinators, feeling concerned and vulnerable during a visit to A&E was the most common vaccination trigger among injury -led vaccinators. For both vaccinator types, the memory of their mother's warning about tetanus during childhood acted as a powerful immunisation trigger , often more effective than currently available information about the v accine. This, again, indicates that memorable events during childhood can impact adult health behaviours in general and vaccination in particular. The findings suggest that while some decisions are based on medical advice and scientific information, vaccin ation behaviour is often influenced by heuristics. For example, as reported in 100 Chapter 4, most participants agreed that influenza is a severe disease and vaccinating against it is important, yet the majority were either intermittent or unvaccinated partici pants . As noted above, it is possible that the dissonance between participants' beliefs and actions is mainly due to their perceived lack of susceptibility to the disease, but also their apprehension toward the vaccine. This is supported by previous quanti tative evidence which found little or no association between perceived severity of influenza and vaccine uptake among healthy adults or those who do not feel susceptible to influenza (Weinstein, Kwitel et al., 2007) . It is also consistent with findings fro m past research showing that people tend to perform cost -benefit analyses when assessing influenza vaccination (e.g. threat of influenza vs. threat of the influenza vaccine), which significantly affect behaviour (Chapman and Coups, 1999) . In many cases, however, these perceptions were unfounded and may have driven participants to make decisions which were potentially detrimental to their health. 5.3.1 Limitations of this study In line with the limitations discussed in Chapter 4, although qualitative explorations enable us to gain in-depth understanding of a particular issue, such data may not be representative of the target population. Thus, quantitative research is needed to ev aluate whether my findings are generalisable. Furthermore , a new approach such as the j ourney to vaccination should be further tested across vaccinations and populations, and potentially other health behaviours, to assess its usefulness and possible appli cations. The journey to vaccination revealed the use of heuristic reasoning in vaccination decisions. However, in order to robustly evaluate the importance of specific heuristics in vaccination behaviour, an experimental design is required. Finally, althou gh journey to vaccination is designed to facilitate data extraction by mapping out vaccination -related events in an open and comprehensive manner, some past memories may have not been readily accessible or easy to recall. Therefore, some facts, particularl y those related to distant or inconsequential events, may have been imprecise or overlooked. 5.3.2 Summary and implications for further research This study showed how specific stages and touchpoints of the vaccination journey can facilitate or hinder vaccinati on uptake. It also revealed the main internal and external triggers to vaccination and non-vaccination , many of which were aligned with service touchpoints . The journey to vaccination approach demonstrated that whil e some vaccination decision are based on logic and scientific knowledge , other s circumvent facts . An interesting finding which deserves 101 further reconsideration is the importance of childhood experiences in adult vaccination decisions. These results have a number of implications for rese arch and immunisation policy and practice , which will be discussed in the final c hapter (Chapter 8). Drawing on t he findings reported here and the previous chapters, I now move on to report the development and testing of instruments aiming to capture quantitatively the determinants of adult influenza and tetanus vaccination behaviour , and to predict uptake. 102 6 Determinants of influenza vaccination in the UK: a survey study 6.1 Introduction As stated in Chapter 1, multilateral efforts to identify factors wh ich affect confidence in vaccines have gathered pace (NVAC, 2013; LSHTM, 2014; Vaccines Europe, 2014; WHO (2), 2014) . Such efforts stem from unquestionable evidence that the uptake of biomedical prevention approaches, specifical ly vaccination, not only dep ends upon availability and access, but is increasingly influenced by socio -psychological factors (Larson, Cooper et al., 2011; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) . Therefore, i n order to improve vaccination coverage, immunisation programmes should be conceive d as a combination of safe and efficacious biomedical produc ts, effective communication strategie s and behavioural interventions aimed at addressing the public's concerns. This holistic approach, which has been successful in HIV prevention (UNAIDS, 2010) , is particularly important when introducing novel vaccines for existing diseases and in response to the new epidemics (WHO, 2005) . Two essential features of effective communication and behaviour change strategies are: 1) the extent to which they align with the needs of the population they are aimed at; and 2) their ability to adapt when these needs change (Government Social Research Unit, 2008) . Thus , the development of instruments which can reliably capture vaccinat ion sentiment and its impact on vaccinatio n uptake, and can be periodically deployed to tr ack variations in perceptions, should be an integral part of the design and evaluation of immunisation programmes . Previous studies have attempted to develop such instruments, yet most have been concerned with testing health behaviour theories rather than the ability of the instrument to predict behaviour. Furthermore, f eedback received from policy and industry forums as part of this ongoing project indicate that although there is interest in instruments wh ich are predictive and insightful, too often these are lengthy, thus costly to roll -out on an annual basis , and difficult to translate into policy (Sevdalis and Wheelock, 2013 ; al., 2014 ). Consequentl y, the focus of this chapter is to identify the most predictive socio -psychological determinants of influenza vaccination and to propose a compact set of items which can be easily incorporated into national immunisation surveys. 103 Important lessons can be drawn from the wealth of data on the factors underpinning seasonal influenza vaccination, which I have synthesised in Chapters 2 and 3, but also from empirical findings reported in Chapters 4 and 5 . First, influenza vaccination decis ions are shaped by socio -psychological aspects such as social influence, influenza risk perceptions, the benefits and risk perceptions of the influenza vaccine, habit, general attitudes toward health and vac cines, awareness and knowledge , and altruism. Sec ond, the wording of survey items matter s, particularly those measuring risk perceptions. For example, measures which are specific and concern the individual are generally better predictors of vaccination behaviour than generic ones . Third, there are a num ber of potentially relevant constructs from health behaviour models and theories which remain largely untested. A case in point is the Protection Motivation T heory (PMT) , which postulates that a process of threat appraisal and a process of coping appraisal , in which the options of minimising a threat are evaluated, can lead to either adaptive or maladaptive coping (Rogers, 1975) . Maladaptive coping mechanisms include avoidance, denial and fatalism, whereas active coping leads to protective behaviours (e.g. vaccination). These mechanisms are yet to be tested in the context of influenza vaccination. Additionally, Chapters 4 and 5 showed that childhood experiences may influence adult vaccination behaviour, a novel finding which deserve s further testing. 6.1.1 Study aims Drawing on findings from Chapters 2 -5, the primary aim of this study is to develop and test a tool to identify the determinants of influenza vaccination in the UK and to predict vaccination behavio ur. Secondary objectives are : i) to assess whether socio -psychological factors are better predictors of influenza vaccination than population characteristics and practical barriers; ii) to test whether generic items, which could predict the uptake of multiple vaccines, are equally effective at predicting influenza vaccination as influenza -specific items; and iii ) to propose a compact set of socio - psychological items which can be easily incorporated into national immunisation surveys. 6.2 Methods The instrument described in this c hapter was tested alongside a comparable instrument developed to capture the determinant s of adult tetanus vaccination, the results of which are discussed in the following c hapter . Thus, this section describes the methods employed in the design and testing of the overall survey -tool. This study was approved by the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (see App endix 3 ). All participants provided consent after being informed about the nature of the study and anonymity of their responses (see Appendix 10). 104 6.2.1 Sampling and recruitment st rategies A nationally representative adult sample was sought, using stratified random sampling (Groves, Fowler Jr et al., 20 09). This sampling strategy involves dividing a population into a number of strata. Each stratum is comprised by a random sample of individuals who share specific attributes, which is proportional to the overall population. Interlocking quotas based on gender , age and socioeconomic status were set (ONS (1), 2014; ONS (2), 2014) . In addition, to ensure national representativeness, regional, settlement type (rural / urban) and ethnicity non -interlocking quotas were put in place (ONS, 2012; ONS (1), 2013; ONS (1 ), 2014) . Sample size calculations were based on the intended objective of assessing associations between self-reported vaccinatio n uptake and participant s' demographic, socio -economic, health -related and socio -psychological characteristics. The minimum s ample size to test the null hypothesis of no significant correlation between dependent and independent variables was calculated using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder et al., 2009) given the most conservative assumption that the correlation coefficient between the variables in the population is in the region of 0.1 (a \"low\" effect size). A bi-directional test wit h 95% significance level reached a standard 80% power level at a minimum sample of N = 782 subjects (Cohen, 1998) . Online and telephonic surveys were emplo yed. Self -completion online surveys were sent to an online market research panel and random -digit dialling was used to recruit the subset of participants who were interviewed telephonically (12% of the sample). The telephone -based survey was identical to the online survey but included instructions to moderators to aid the completion and ensure consistency. Telephone interviews were administered to a proportion of the 65+ age category and those falling into the D/E socio -economic groups, since these two popu lations are less represented on online panels and have more limited access to or are less familiarised with internet -based applications (Duffy, Smith et al., 2005; Callegaro, Baker et al., 2014) . 6.2.2 Procedure Double Helix (DH), a market research company, wa s responsible for programming the online survey and conducting the interviews. Before the piloting stage, we collectively tested the online survey to ensure it was usable, logic, correctly worded and appropriately formatted. 105 6.2.2.1 Pilot Face -to-face pilot inte rviews were conducted with seven purposively selected members of the general public to test the survey's face and content validity (i.e. it appears relevant to participant s and it covers all important aspects of the vaccination decision making process, res pectively), acceptability and ease of completion. Interviews lasted 45 minutes and were conducted by a trained DH researcher. A live broadcast of the interviews was transmitted to other members of the team, including myself, viewing from an adjoining room and interviews were audio recorded. All members of the team were able to view the participant's screen as the survey was being completed (See figure 6.1) . Participants were asked to answer the online self -completion survey noting down any questions that were unclear or confusing. Upon completion of the survey, participants were asked questions related to the ease of completion, language and format of the survey. Questions which were unclear or generated hesitation (self -reported or observed) were reviewed with the participant to understand the cause of the difficulty. Following the initial face -to-face pilots, the study team conducted a thorough review of the study materials and reached a consensus regarding minor amendme nts and finessing of the instrument. Three additional interviews were conducted over the telephone with the aid of a screen sharing platform. Findings from the telephone pilots confirmed the results from the face -to-face pilot interviews with few additio nal changes. Figure 6.1 Indicative image of interviewing facilities used for survey piloting 106 Overall, the pilots showed that the survey was easy to fill out and to understand, and the majority of the questions were clear. Most of the refinements to th e study materials were related to wording and programming changes. Questions were also re -ordered and grouped into themes to facilitate the timely completion of the survey. 6.2.2.2 Fieldwork and q uality assurance Responses to telephonic interviews were entered into a computer -assisted telephone interviewing system (CATI) in order to reduce inputting errors. Telephone interviews were longer in duration (~40 min) than online versions (~20 min) and participants were able to pause mid -way through and complete it at a later time if they were unable to do so in one session. Furthermore, to reduce cognitive effort and improve the interview flow, telephone participants were asked to draw a scale from 0 -10 and focus on it when stating their level of agreement or disagreem ent with the relevant survey items. This study employed a quota system to ensure that the composition of the final sample was similar to that of the general adult population . Therefore, if a particular quota was full, some participants became non -eligible, despite opening the email and completing the screener. The benchmark for adequate response rates used by market research companies for this kind of sampling strategy is based on the number of participant s who drop out before completing the surv ey. For the online survey, 16 stopped doing the survey once they had passed the screener and f or the telephone interviews 10 were incomplete. These small numbers indicate a good response rate. As an additional quality control measure, the data was monitored throughout the fieldwork and participants who classified as 'speeders' and 'flat -liners' were removed and replaced, as their responses are likely to be unreliable . From the initial launch, the ave rage time for survey completion was 16 minutes. A 'speeder' was defined as a participant who completed the survey in half of the average time (i.e., in under eight minutes). Flat -liners were those who completed the survey in under 10 minutes (i.e., half of the optimum survey length of 20 minutes) and also ga ve homogeneous responses ( i.e., entered the same code throughout a particular section or throughout the survey). Two members of the study team (DH) reviewed flat -liner data and came to a consensus before agreeing to keep or remove these participan ts. 107 6.2.3 Instrument In order to meet the aims of this study, I developed an instrument which sought to achieve a number of psychometric properties (Anastasi and Urbina, 1997; Rust and Golombok, 1999) . The properties sought and the steps to attain them are described below. Face validity is the perceive adequacy and relevance of an instrument. As described above, this property was achieved during the pilot phase by eliciting participants' views regardin g the clarity, appropriateness and importance of the included items, and finessing the instrument as a result. Internal consistency is a measure of reliability used to evaluate the degree to which different survey items that measure the same construct produce similar results. This property was attained by including a number of items which are conceptually associated with key broader constructs that predict influenza and tetanus vaccination. The attainment of this property was tested by calculating Cronb ach's alpha coefficients for each of the assessed scales. Content validity is the extent to which a n instrument captures every single domain of interest. This property was achieved by identifying the array of drivers and barriers to influenza vaccination through a narrative review (Chapter 2), a systematic review and meta -analysis (Chapter 3), qualitative research (Chapters 4 and 5) , this study's pilot and expert advice from Sanofi Pasteur (Marketing, Advocacy, Influenza and Tetanus Divisions) , and DH. I se lected socio -psychological constructs (and items) which had consistently predicted influenza and, to a lesser extent, tetanus vaccination in adults (only two articles meeting the eligibility criteria were identified), based on the above sources and relevan t theories of health behaviour specified in Chapter 1 , notably the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Protection Motivation Theory ( PMT ). Additional constructs from health behaviour theories and risk communication research, which had scarcely or never been tested in the context of vaccination, were also included (see blocks 7 and 8 of Table 6.1). Demographic, socio - economic and health -related characteristics which had previously been associated with influenza vaccination behaviour were prioritised . Predict ive validity is the extent to which a n instrument predicts a given outcome, in this case, influenza and tetanus vaccination behaviour. This was attained by including items which have consistently predicted influenza, and to a lesser extent, tetanus vaccina tion behaviour in adults, as well as well as testing new items which may be significantly associated with this health behaviour. This property was tested by conducting hierarchical logistic regression analyses and calculating the extent to which the result ing model was able to discriminate the vaccination status of participant s. 108 Table 6.1.

The survey comprised a total of 120 items: 19 demographic, socio -economic and health -related items, 26 socio -psychological general items, 42 socio -psychological items about influenza and the influenza vaccine, and 33 socio -psycho logical items about tetanus and the tetanus vaccine (see the full survey in Appendix 11). In an effort to reduce the number of variables included in the model (a minimum of 10 participants per item (Field, 2013) ), some items added by Sanofi Pasteur were excluded from this thesis (see Appendix 11), as they were untested variations of items which were included in the analyses. All survey -items were left in the survey for reference. I used 11 -points likert scales (0 -10) for the majority of socio -psychological items, as these are recognised for their reliability and ease of completion (Saris and Gallhofer, 2007) , and multiple - choice items and alternate -choice items when appropriate. In sections w here thematic hierarchy 110 (e.g. from specific to general) was not im portant, items were rotated to minimise response bias due to item ordering. Some items were routed depending upon participant s' vaccination status. For example, only those who had received an influenza or tetanus vaccine in the past were asked about how th ey usually remembered to get it. These items were not included in the model. 6.2.4 Data analysis In order to enhance the usability, transparency and translational nature of the instrument , all analyses were conducted using single items rather than multi -item cons tructs or factors. Yet, given that blocks 3 -6 were also overarching constructs comprised of more than three scale -items (see Table 6.1) , Cronbach's alpha tests were conducted to explore correlations between items and test the reliabili ty of these const ructs (Rust and Golombok, 1999; Eisinga, Grotenhuis et al., 2013) . Fisher's Exact test was used to evaluate differences between the final sample and the general population (p < 0.05 was considered significant ). Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi -square (categorical variables) and t -tests (interval or continuous variables) were computed to gauge the relationships between each of the assessed variables and vacci nation behaviour (p < 0.05 was considered significant ). The outcome measure was having received an influenza vaccine in the last 6 months (latest influenza season). Since the outcome measure was categorical, logistic regression analysis was conducted to uncover the pred ictors of influenza vaccination. Logistic regression does not make many of the ke y assumptions of linear regression. Some assumptions, however, still apply. These are: 1) the dependent variable is dichotomous; 2) the categories are mutually exclusive and exhau stive, that is, a case can only be in one group and every case must b e a memb er of one of the groups; 3) the model should be fitted correctly, thus overfitting or underfitting should be avoided; 4) the model should have little or no multicollinearity; and 5 ) sample sizes are large; a minimum of 10 cases per predictor (Hosmer Jr and Lemeshow, 2004; Field, 2013) . Although stepwise regression is widely used in logistic regression, in recent years, the purposeful selection of variables has been favoured over deterministic model -building methods. This is because the latter rely on autom atic selection of variables based upon mathematical criteria, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting the model (Hosmer Jr and Lemeshow, 2004; Field, 2013) . Therefore, t o achieve a parsimonious model, that is, one that offers the simplest explanation to vaccination behaviour, I used a force d entry, hierarchical approach. The specific procedure employed is described below. 111 When predictors are correlated, as it is often the case, the order of variable entry can have an effect on the parameters calculate d. Variables were , therefore, entered in \"blocks \" using a hierarchical approach based on previous evidence (Field, 2013) and my aim of assessing whether socio - psychological factors are better predictors of influenza vaccination than population characterist ics and practical barriers . Blocks of variables which had predicted vaccination uptake in the past were entered first and those which had seldom or not been explored before were entered last (Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Nagata, Hernandez -Ramos et al., 2013; Wheelock , Thomson et al., 2013) . Priority was given to demographic, socio -economic and health -related variables, and practical vaccination barriers to evaluate the extent to which they contributed to explain the variance in vaccination behav iour before socio -psychological variables were incorporated . Consequently, e ight blocks of explanatory variables were entered in the following order: 1) demographic, socio -economic and health -related variables ; 2) practical barriers to influenza vaccination; 3) social influence; 4) influenza perceptions; 5) influenza vaccine perceptions; 6) trust and disposition toward vaccination and vaccination stakeholders; 7) general perceptions and constructs ; 8) previous vaccine and health -related experiences. Two goodness -of-fit tests were used to assess the overall model and each of the 8 models (blocks) : chi-square and Nagelkerke R\u00b2 . If the chi -square of any given model was not significant (p>0.05), that is, the contri bution of such model over the previous one was statistically negligible, its variables were systematically excluded one at a time , starting from those which were not significant, and regressions rerun until significance was attained (Field, 2013) . Non -significant variables from models with a significant chi -square (p<0.05) were also excluded one at a time and regressions were rerun . If the predictability of the overall model decreased by more than 1%, the excluded variable was added back. This process conti nued until all of the important variables appeared to be included in the model. I then added back all the excluded variables to identify those which may not have been significant by themselves, but could be important in the presence of other variables (Hos mer Jr and Lemeshow, 2004) . An overall model with a Nagelkerke R\u00b2 a value cl ose to 1, which indicates optimal predictability, was sought. Odds ratios for the hierarchica l logistic (logit) model, together with the standard errors, significance levels and co nfidence intervals, as well as the predictidibility of the model, are presented (p < 0.1 was considered significant ). Thorough checks to ensure the robustness of the model were conducted, including variance inflation factor (VIF) to a ssess collinearity, standardised residuals to detect and evaluate outliers and Cook's distance to identify influential cases . All analyses 112 were conducted by myself using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 . Regression analyses were also carried out by expert statistici ans (Kerry O'Neill, solutions -2) who validated the results reported in this c hapter. 6.2.4.1 Variable coding For bivariate and logistic regression analyses the variables age, eligible health condition (including pregnant or breastfeeding women) , marital status, level of education and ethnicity were dichotomised, both to aid interpretation and ensure there was a fair number of subjects in each cell for validity (a minimum of five per cell ) (Greenland, 1989). For logistic regression analysis , 11 variables with \"I do not know\" responses were also recoded as dummy variables in order to maximise the number of observations, as follows: values expressing agreement with a given statement (6 -10) were coded as 1 = \"yes\" and the rest (0 -5 and \"I do n ot know\") were coded as 0 = \"other than yes\" (see recoded variables in Table 6.3). 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Participants Participants were surveyed in March 2014. The online survey was completed by 791 participants and 100 participants were interviewed via the telephone. Recruitment flow diagram s for the online and telephone samples are presented in Figures 6.2 and 6.3 , respectively. Response rates were calculated by dividing the total number of surveys completed by the number of opened emails or int erviews attempted minus the number of ineligible individuals (surveys completed / opened emails or interviews attempted - ineligible individuals) ( American Associatio n for Public Opinion Research, 2008) . Online response rates were 20% , in line with average rates for interne t-based surveys (Nulty, 2008), and t elephone response rates were 9%. Telephonic interviews targeted older people and those belonging to D/E socio -economic strata, two populations with particularly low response rates (Sheldon, Graham et al., 2007) . 113 Figure 6.2 Online sample recr uitment flow diagram Figure 6.3 Telephone sample recruitment flow diagram 807 completed screener 16 did not complete the survey 53,656 email invitations sent 42 emails that bounced back 9,925 opened emails 706 surveys included in sample 791 surveys completed 9,118 did not complete screener 5,909 stopped due to full quota 2,902 stopped voluntarily 299 did not provide consent 8 were not eligible 85 were excluded 35 due to speeding 10 due to flat -lining 40 were practicing HCWs 9,927 random telephone numbers 703 unusable 675 not working 28 fax 9,224 working residential telephone numbers 100 interviews completed 1,472 did not pass screener 466 were not eligible 1,006 refusals 7,641 unscreened 7619 no contact 22 language barrier 1,583 interviews attempted 114 The initial sampling strategy included healthcare professionals for the purpose of the wider research programme of which this study is a part . However, as noted in previous chapters, evidence suggests that their views and motivation to vaccinate may differ from those of the general public, thereby rendering them a different sample (Riphagen Dalhuisen, 2012) . Therefore, descriptive statistics an d t-tests were computed to explore whether the relationships between key socio -psychological factors (social influences, influenza and influenza vaccine perceptions) and the vaccination behaviour of this professional group were comparable to those o f the rest of the sample or not. The analyses confirmed that, for a number of variables, the perceptions of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare professionals were not significantly different, unlike those of the general public (see Appendix 12). Further, I found that healthcare professionals were more motivated (or compelled) to vaccinate to protect others (32%) than the rest of the sample (19%) . Consequently, healthcare professionals were excluded from the final sample. To minimise sample bias, pregnant or breastfeeding women were included , as they were only 1% of participants and exploratory regression analyses (with and without this sub -group) confirmed their inclusion did not significant ly affect the results. The characteristics of the final sample (N = 806) were fairly representative of the UK population except for education: 9% of the study sample had no formal education and 24% had achieved A levels vs. 23% and 12 %, respectively, in th e general population (see Table 6.2 ). However , this difference did not warrant data weighting , which may augment sampling error (National Council on Public Polls, 2014) , as this characteristic has seldom been associated w ith adult vaccination behaviour . Average influenza vaccination rate among 65s in the study sample was very close to the national coverage for that group (75% vs. 74%). Statistics for influenza vaccination coverage for the 18-64 age brackets are not publically available in the UK. A formal request for these data was submitted (and followed up) to Public Health England ( Begum, Personal communication, April 24, 2014 ), but there was no reply.

Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. *The sample was significantly different from the population (p < 0.05). \u00a5Census data on qualifications include 16 and 17 year olds. 6.3.2 Descriptive, bivariate and reliability analyses I also enquired about vaccination triggers and vaccination venue to test the findings from Chapters 4 and 5. As illustrated in Figure 6.4 and consistent with previous findings, the most important vaccination triggers were a recommendation from a GP or midwife (38%), followed by adverts in pharmacies or GP practices (15%) and remembering to vaccinat e without being prompted (15%) . Being reminded to vaccinate by relatives, the news, at work or when feeling vulnerable were all equally important (8%), but significantly less frequent than the former triggers. As shown in Figure 6.5, the majority of participants vaccinate at their GP p ractice (79%), yet a sizeable 21% receive their influenza vaccine elsewhere. 116 Note: participant s were allowed to choose more than one trigger . Figure 6.4 Influenza vaccination triggers (N =442) Figure 6.5 Influenza vaccination venue (N =442) Three additional vac cination drivers from previous c hapters were also explored here. The first was \"altruism\", which was evaluated by asking vaccinators whether they had mainly vaccinated against influenza to protect others. Almost a third of participants strongl y disagreed (29%), 17% disagreed, 19% neither agreed nor disagreed, 16% agreed and 19% strongly agreed. Other items measuring altruistic behaviours (see items 72 and 51 in Table 6.1) among both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were also tested in b ivariate analysis and multiple regression. The second driver was the importance of flu -like symptoms for those who had vaccinated in the past. When asked if they had felt strong flu -like symptoms after vaccinating, 36% of participants who had vaccinated o nce or twice in the past strongly disagreed, 18% disagreed, 11% neither agreed nor 38% 15%15%8%8%8%7%1% GP or midwife Pharmacy or GP adverts I remember on my own Relatives News Work When feeling vulnerable I do not have it anymore 79%7%5%2%2%1% 4% GP Work Pharmacy Supermarket or shopping centre At a hospital University Other117 disagreed, 20% agreed and 15% strongly agreed. In contrast, 47% of p articipants who vaccinated regularly strongly disagreed, 21% disagreed, 7 % neither agreed nor disagreed, 16% agreed and 10 % strongly agreed. The third was whether those who had vaccinated in the past had become h abitual vaccinators. Although nearly half of the sample reported they vaccinated every year (45%), the majority had either vaccinated once or twice ( 40%) or vaccinated almost every year (15%). I chose having received an influenza vaccine in the last 6 months (latest influenza season) as the outcome variable for both bivariate and regression analyses, since it yielded similar results to the alternative four -points variable exploring vaccination frequency. Chi-square and t -tests' results showed that most of the responses of vaccinated and unvaccinated participant s were significantly different ( p < 0.001 - 0.05 ), except for the following variables: gender, marital status, income, education, knowing someone who experienced a vaccine adverse reaction, maladaptive coping (influenza), being allergic to the vaccine, trusting alternative medicine and information about the influenza vaccine from social med ia sources, not understanding how vaccination works, optimism, pessimism, risk -taking, information av oidance, shared decision -making (relatives), having had a bad experience with healthcare professionals as a child, positive experiences with healthcare as a child, a bad experience with vaccines or healthcare professionals in adulthood and having had positive experiences with heal thcare as an adult (Table 6.3). Those who had received an influenza vaccine were more concerned about the risks of influenza and less concerned about the risks of the vaccine (p < 0.001 - 0.05 ), and were also more trusting of vaccination in general and vaccine manufacturers and providers than unvaccinated participant s (p < 0.001) . Similarly, vaccinated participants reported having a better understanding of vaccination in general (p < 0.001) , were more likely to agree that vaccination is a personal choice (p < 0.05 ), felt unhealthier (p < 0.001) , were more information seeking (p < 0.001) and more prone to let their GPs make decisions a bout their health than unvaccinated ones (p < 0.001) . Finally, unvaccinated participant s were more likely to have had a bad vaccine or injection -related experience as a child (p < 0.05 ), and less likely to have had a scary health -related experience in chil dhood and adulth ood ( p < 0.001) than vaccinated participant s. As shown in Table 6.4, the asse ssed scales showed very good internal reliability ( = 0.8 0 - 0.90) (Cortina, 1993; Kline, 1999) , when excluding poorly correlated items (Corrected Item -Total Correlation below 0.3 0) (Field, 2013) . 118 Table 6.3 Determinants of i nfluenza vaccination by vaccination status Explanatory variables Min Max Vaccinated Unvaccinated SE 95% C.I. t/X2 df 1.

All variables in Table 6.3 were included. Table 6.5 shows the associations between influenza vaccination and the assessed variables. From the eight blocks of variables entered only six significantly contributed to the model. None of the variables in block 2 (practical barriers) and block 6 (trust and disposition toward vaccination and stakeholders) significantly contribute d to the model. The beginning model 0 (null model), which evaluates the model with onl y the constant in the equation, showed that it was 63% accurate in predicting vaccination behaviour. This is based on the distribution of the outcome measure (63% did not vaccinate) and equivalent to the accuracy of random guessing . The first model (M1) comprised socio -demographic and health -related variables and classified 79% of the cases correctly , an improvement in predictability of 16% compared to model 0 . Although M1 was (3) , Nagelkerke R\u00b2 was only 0.372, which indicates that the model fits the data moderately and is able to explain only 37% of the variance. Models M2 to M6 contained socio -psychological variables which significantly contributed to explain the variance in vaccination behaviour. The final model (M6) comprised 16 variables and correctly classified 91% of the cases, 94% of unvaccinated participant s and 86% of vaccinated ones. The model was significant \u00b2 (20) 702.369, p< 0.001 and Nage lkerke R\u00b2 was 0.796, which indicates that the model is a very good fit of the data and can explain approximately 80% of the variance in behaviour . None of the excluded predictors became significant when these were reincorporated into the model. Collinearit y diagnostics showed that only one item (trust in vaccination) had a VIF above 5 (5.44), (Bowerman and O'Connell, 1990) , as it was highly correlated with three other items (vaccination part of healthy life -style, vaccination importance and vaccination favo urability). This item was, therefore, excluded from the regression analyses. Standardised residuals were examined to identify outliers. Less than 5% of the cases had standardised residuals above 2 and no more than 1% had absolute values higher than 3, thus there was no need to eliminate or transform cases (Field, 2013) . Cook's distance statistics were evaluated to identify cases exerting excessive influence on the model. No values were higher than 1, which indicate there is not cause for concern (Cook and W eisberg, 1982) . The final model showed that older people (p < 0.05), those who reported having one or more of the assessed eligible health conditions (p < 0.001) and were living in a partnership (p < 0.05) were more likely to have received an influenza vac cine during the 2013/2014 i nfluenza season. 123 Table 6.5 Logit regression determinants of influenza vaccination (N = 801) M1 M2 M3 Independent variables OR SE 95% C.I. bed 1.523 Coping - influenza over influenza 0.739 0.050 0.670 0.815 Vaccine contents - dangerous Anticipated regret - influenza Self-efficacy - influenza vaccine Shared decision -making - GP Scary vaccine experience - child Scary health experience - child Predicted unvaccinated 85% 86% 92% Predicted Scary health = standard error; CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio; SE = standard er ror; CI = confidence interval; * p < 0.1; * *p < 0.05; p < 0.01; p < 0.001. Note: t he change in model fit as indicated by chi -square tests for each block of variables (M1 -M6) was significant for all blocks (p < 0.05 ). 124 The model also indicated that when controlling for participant characteristics, socio -psychological variables predict 12% of influenza vaccination behaviour. Specificall y, those who reported that their GP (p < 0.001) thinks they need to get vaccinated against influenza, who felt they were more likely to catch influenza (p < 0.001), who believed they would spend more days in bed if they catch influenza (p < 0.05), who repo rted influenza -specific coping behaviour (p < 0.001), who perceived they were less likely to avoid influenza without a vaccine (p < 0.001), who were less worried about the contents of the vaccine (p < 0.001), who reported anticipated regret of not vaccinat ing (p < 0.001), who reported higher vaccine -specific self -efficacy (p < 0.001), who were more likely to let GPs make decisions about their health (p < 0.01), had not had a bad experience with vaccines or injections as a child (p < 0.05) and who had had a scary health -related experience as a child (p < 0.01), were more likely to report having been vaccinated in the same time period. Influence from relatives and perceived vulnerability to influenza were not significant, but were retained as they contributed to the model. 6.4 Discussion This c hapter aimed to identify the determinants of adult influ enza vaccination in the UK , and to predict influenza vaccination behaviour . This research ultimately sought to propose a set of highly predictive items to be used in nat ional immunisation surveys or other immunisation tools aimed at improving influenza vaccination uptake . Although responses from vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were significantly different for most variables in bivariate analyses, only 14 items predicted vaccination uptake in multiple regression analysis. The model that best fitted the data was comprised of 16 items which captured key socio - demographic, health and socio -psychological factors associated with influenza vaccination. It predicted 91% of self-reported vaccination behaviour overall and correctly identified 94% of unvaccinated and 86% of vaccinated participants . The results from this study support finding s from previous studies and add new insights to the evidence -base. Socio -demographic and health variables explained 37% of the variance in vaccination behaviour . As expected, older participant s, those who reported having a n eligible health condition and living with a partner were more likely to receive an influenza vaccine. Previous resea rch, mostly from the US, has consistently found that age and health status predict influenza vaccination, yet it is less conclusive regarding marital and socio -economic status, private insurance and education (Chapman and Coups, 2005; Winst on, and Draper , 2008 ). 125 To my knowledge, this is the first study showing that marital status predicts influenza vaccination uptake in the UK. Higher vaccination rates among participant s living with a partner may be explained by people's tendency to protect their significant other or encouragement from partners to get vaccinated , yet more evidence is needed to substantiate this assertion . The lack of association between influenza vaccination, private insurance, i ncome and education may be explained by the UK healthcare system, which, unlike in the US, provides universal access and free of charge vaccination for those at higher risk. Consistently, practical barriers such as lack of access, time and affordability we re not significantly associated with influenza vaccination. Although ethnicity was not associated with vaccination in multiple regression analysis , bivariate analyses suggest that populations from ethnic minorities may be less likely to vaccinate against i nfluenza. Thus far, there is no published evidence of differences in influenza vaccination uptake across minority populations in the UK. However, ethnic disparities in human papillomavirus vaccination in England may be indicative of a similar trend across other vaccines (Roberts, Brabin et al., 2011) . This potential health inequality warrants further research among these populations us ing adequately powered samples. Socio -psychological factors explaine d most of the variance behaviour (43%) . Encouragingly, u nlike socio -demographic and health factors can be modified . Further, socio -psychological factors are likely to be more pivotal and discriminant within high risk grou ps, as age may be less predictive of vaccination among over 65s and health status may be less important among younger people with eligible health conditions. Understanding and monitoring the socio -psychological determinants of vaccination is, therefore, es sential to develop behaviour change interventions and targeted communication strategies, particularly among those at higher risk. In line with previous research , this study confirmed that GPs ' opinion significantly influence vaccination behaviour (Kohlham mer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) . Consistent with this finding , most of those who vaccinated reported that they were prompted to do so by their GP, adverts in GP practices or pharmacies, which further support the relevance of GP-led vaccination communi cations . Yet, I should note t hat this study's sample included younger individuals who are not eligible to get vaccinated at a GP practice and have probably not received a GP recommendation to vaccinate; h ence, th e variable \"GP thinks I should vaccinate\" may be less discriminant among high -risk groups. Interestingly, almost half of those who had vaccinated in the past did not develop the vaccination \"habit\" reported in previous studies (Wheelock, Thomson, et al., 2013), which su ggests that this construct may not be as important to vaccination behaviour as triggers such as a GP reminder. 126 My results compare well with those from previous studies showing that t hose who feel at greater risk of contracting influenza are more likely to vaccinate (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007; Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) . Interestingly, perceived severity of influenza was only significant when measured as a number of days in bed, rather than degree of seriousne ss. This resonates with previous evidence and findings from Chapter 3, which show that perceived disease severity, usually measured as disease seriousness, is not as strongly correlated with vaccination as perceived likelihood of and susceptibility to the disease (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . It is, therefore, recommendable to use more realistic measures based on common experiences to capture and communicate perceived severity . When evaluated concurrently with perceived likelihood and severity of influenz a, perceived vulnerability to influenza was not significant. Again , this echoes previous research which suggests that perceived likelihood of and vulnerability or susceptibility to influenza may be viewed by participant s as interchangeable concepts (Brewer , Chapman et al., 2007) . In multiple regression analysis, however, perceived likelihood was a better predictor of influenza vaccination uptake ; thus, its inclusion in future surveys should be encouraged . Anticipated regret if not vaccinated and perceived vaccine -specific self -efficacy , two important constructs which have seldom been explored in the context of influenza vaccination, also predicted uptake (Chapman and Coups, 2006; Liao, Cowling et al., 2011) . Given that an individual's perceived ability to engage in a particular behaviour may depend upon psychological but also contextual factors (Strecher VJ, DeVellis BM et al., 1986) , a clearer understanding of the factors underpinning vaccine -specific self -efficacy is needed . Coping, a novel concept in im munisation research, but widely used to evaluate how people manage difficult circumstances or health conditions (Penley, Tomaka et al., 2002) , too was a vaccination predictor . This indicates that activel y protecting oneself against influenza is normally as sociated with vaccination as opposed to other prevention strategies (e.g. washing hands, avoiding crowds). In contrast, participant s who felt more able to avoid influenza despite not being vaccinated and those who were more inclined to make health decisio ns independently from their GP , were less likely to vaccinate against influenza. These finding s indicate that p erceived control of the disease and health decisio n-making styles and preferences can affect influenza vaccine uptake and, therefore, should inform future immunisation interventions. To my knowledge, this is the first study exploring the association between these two dimensions and influenza vaccination. 127 Concerns around the vaccine's contents were significantly more prevalent in unvaccinated participant s and the only negative vaccine perception predicting vaccination behaviour. As shown in Table 6.4 , this concern was closely related with the perception that t he vaccine can cause influe nza, but was a better predictor of vaccination uptake. These findings resonate with those of previous studies and Chapters 2 and 3 (Chapman and Coups, 1999; Kohlhammer, 2007; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013) , and suggest that the current strategies to assua ge the public's concerns regarding the safety of the influenza vaccine have a limited effect. Furthermore, I found that those who seldom vaccinated were more likely to report having experienced strong influenza -like symptoms after vaccination. This may par tly explain why they discontinued vaccination. A striking qualitative finding reported in Chapter 5 held true when tested quantitatively in this chapter . People who had had a bad experience with vaccines or injections in childhood were less likely to rec eive the influenza vaccine in adulthood. As previously discussed, trau matic experiences can linger th rough to adulthood and significantly influence our health decisions. This is further confirmed by the finding that those who reported having a scary health -related experience in childhood were more likely to vaccinate , which , again, may be explained by a lasting perception of vulnerability triggered by a childhood event that results in enhanced preven tive behaviours. Alternatively, this health -related event in childhood may have had a real impact on individuals' health throughout their lives . To the best of my knowledge, this is the first quantitative study that has linked adult vaccination behaviour with childhood experiences. Lessons can also be drawn from constructs which did not predict vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness, for example, which has been previously highlighted as a key vaccination determinant, was found to be less relevant than other apprehensions around vaccines. Another behaviour which did n ot predict vaccination in the present study, but was associated with influenza vaccination uptake in a recent study , is altruism (Shim, Chapman et al., 2012) . This study, however, was conducted among university employees, most of whom do not belong to a hi gh-risk group, thus their motivation may be more related to both their and their students' class attendance than their own risk. Further, one of the two items used to measure altruism ('If you were to receive the influenza shot this Autumn, how worried wou ld you be about infecting people at work with the influenza ?') was rather complex and may have confused participants . The present study suggest s that although people may indeed worry about infecting others, altruistic behaviour does not predict influenza vaccination in the general population, and supports the supremacy of self -interest in influenza vaccination decisions. Likewise, g eneral perceptions and personal characteristics, most of which have not been previously tested in the context of a dult vaccination, were not linked to vaccination status in bivariate analyses , 128 except for information seeking, which was found to be significantly higher in vaccinators. This characteristic, however, did not predict vaccination in multiple regression analy sis. Similarly, t rust in vaccination and key vaccination stakeholders does not appear to predict influenza vaccination, over and above influenza and vaccine -specific perceptions. Trust in the information provided by GPs about the influenza vaccine, for exa mple, was not as predictive as a GP recommendation. This indicates that the contents and delivery of the recommendation may be less important than the recommendation itself. Although the HBM (Rosenstock, 1966) and the PMT (Maddux and Rogers, 1983) have ma ny commonalities, t his study shows that the latter may better explain influenza vaccination behaviour. As described in Chapter 1, the PMT proposes that information sources (verbal persuasion, observational learning, personality variables, prior experience, etc.) initiate cognitive activity, which leads to protection motivation and later to health protective behaviour. Since intention to vaccinate is highly correlated with vaccination, f or the purpose of this research I omitted the protection motivation comp onent of the model. In this study, the impor tance of information sources was reflected by the influence of GPs and relatives, health decision -making preferences, and previous childhood experiences on vaccination behaviour. The PMT also postulates that a p rocess of threat appraisal (perceived severity of and vulnerability to the threat, and fear) and a process of coping appraisal (perceived self -efficacy, perceived response effectiveness and perceived response cost), in which the options of minimising a threat are evaluated, can lead to either adaptive coping (protection motivation) or maladaptive coping (response that may lead to health risk - e.g. avoidance). My results also support this notion, yet some of the components differ. Severity and likelihood of influenza predicted vaccination behaviour whereas vulnerability and fear were not important components of the threat appraisal process. Similarly, perceived s elf-efficacy, coping behaviour, anticipated regret of no t vaccinating and concerns aro und the contents of the vaccine were predictive components of coping appraisal , yet v accine effectiveness was not relevant, thus it s relevance deserves further consideration . Finally, perceived control of influenza, a maladaptive response, was negatively a ssociated with vaccination. Encouragingly, the employed instrument showed good face, content and predictive validity. The assessed constructs also showed good internal consistency, an indication that the included items reliably measured the intended const ruct. Items which did not correlate well with other items were either measuring knowledge (\"frequency of influenza episodes\", \"severity of influenza (bed days)\", \"perceived knowledge of influenza\") or had not been tested before as part of their assigned construct ( \"Do not know much about the vaccine, but trust advice \", \"maladaptive coping - 129 influenza\", \"peer -experienced adverse reactions\", \"trust in influenza vaccine information - social media\" and \"trust in alternative medicine\"). The latter were both poor ly correlated with their construct and the outcome measure, as supported by results from bivariate analyses, which show that responses from vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were not significantly different for these items. The exclusion of these fo ur items from future surveys measuring influenza vaccination should be considered. 6.4.1 Limitations of this study In common with most studies in this field , for feasibility, influenza vaccination was self -reported. Although self -reported behaviour may lead to i nexact responses (Evans and Watson, 2003) , previous research comparing the accuracy of self -reported influenza vaccination to medical records found that these are accurate in approximately 90% of the cases (Hutchison, 1988; Nichol, Korn et al., 1990) . Further, since some people vaccinate at work or alternative facilities such as pharmacies, it remains unclear whether medical records are more accurate than self -reports. A second limitation of this study was the use of trained participant s from a market research panel. Despite efforts to exclude speeders and flat -liners, trained participant s may not have been as committed to providing accurate answers as \"fresh\" ones (Toepoel, Das et al., 2008) . Reassuringly, the results from this study were largely consistent with comparable findings from previous studies. A third limitation is the number of questions included in the survey. Lengthy survey tools may fatigue participant s, thereby affecting the quality of the data. Pilot results, however, indicated that participants did not feel the survey was long or difficult to complete . A fourth limitation is the dichotomisation of 11 continuous variables (yes/other than yes), as it may lead to a reduction in the statistical power to detect an association between the variable and the outcome measure, increase the risk of a positive result being a false positive , and underestimate the extent of variation in outcome between groups , among other problems (Altman a nd Royston, 2006) . Although dichotomisation is not recommendable, it was deemed acceptable due to the number of missing responses (\"I do not know\"), which in some cases reached 25% of the sample. Moreover, most of the affected variables were not statistica lly important, both when tested as continuous and dichotomised variables. The two items that were statistically significant (\"My GP thinks I should vaccinate\" and \" My relatives think I should vaccinate\") lent themselves to be dichotomised , as those who may influence vaccination decisions would normally be either supportive or unsupportive of their patient or relative being vaccinated . 130 A fifth limitation is related to the psychometric properties of the employed instrument. Although it showed good face, cont ent and predictive validity , as well as internal consistency, compromises were made which may have affected some of the instrument's psychometric qualities. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the present study was concerned with identifying the mo st predictive socio -psychological determinants of influenza vaccination. Face validity, c ontent validity and predictive validity were, therefore, prior itised over internal consistency . Consequently , the final tool was comprehensive but heterogeneous, since some dimensions, such as practical barriers, were best measured using alternate -choice items (yes/no) rather than rating -scales. Moreover, some constructs, particularly novel ones, were comprised of two items due to survey -length restrictions - three or m ore items per construct are recommended (Rust and Golombok, 2009 ). Therefore, I was only able to conduct partial reliability analyses. Promisingly , analyses outside the scope of this thesis show ed that most of the socio -psychological predictors reported in this study also predict ed influenza vaccination in the US and France. This indicates that the proposed set of items reliably predicts influenza vaccination behaviour across different settings . An additional limitation is that the sample was somewhat more educated than the general population, which may affect the generalisability of the results . A related drawback is the use of a standard list of chronic illnesses as part the survey tool, which did not specify liver disease and morbid obesity. This omission may have had an effect on the magnitude of the association between health status and vaccination uptake. Lastly , and consistent with other retrospective cross -sectional studies, causation cannot be inferred (Weinstein, 2007) . In other words, some of the assessed perceptions may have been generated or reinforced by individuals' vaccination behaviour and not the other way around. 6.4.2 Summary and implications for further research To my knowledge, t his is one of few empirical studies using regression analysis to evaluate a wide - ranging number of known and potential predictors of influenza vaccination behaviour. This chapter demonstrated that 16 survey -items can predict 91% of influenza vaccination beha viour overall and that social and psychological factors are at the heart of suboptimal influenza vaccination rates. The identified predictors can be used to forecast uptake and mon itor vaccination sentiment. They also provide an opportunity to develop and e valuate targeted interventions aiming to assuage concerns and dispel misconceptions. Yet, the variables associated with influenza vaccination should be assessed across different time -points to further test their reliability . I will discuss the wider 131 implic ations of this study and areas for future research in the main discussion of the thesis (Chapter 8). In the following chapter, I report the development and testing of an analogous instrument aimed at uncovering the determinants of tetanus vaccination in ad ults and predicting its uptake. 132 7 Determinants of tetanus vaccination in the UK: a survey study 7.1 Introduction Tetanus boosters are, together with influenza vaccination, routinely administered to all adults. As stated in Chapter 1, in the UK, adult tetanus boosters are not included in 'The complete routine immunisation schedule 2013/14' , yet it is recommended to those who are not fully immunised, those who are travelling to a country with limited medical facilities and pregnant women (NHS (3), 2014) . Although there are no publicly available statistics on tetanus vaccination uptake in adults, a previous study suggested that the success of the tetanus vaccination programme in the UK may be partly due to over -vaccination, specifically in emergency depa rtments (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) . The same study also highlighted the lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals regarding changes in tetanus immunisation policy and current recommendations. Research on the determinants of tetanus vaccination in the general population is largely missing in the UK, but also elsewhere. The low incidence of tetanus and lack of controversy around the tetanus vaccine, possibly due to its proven effectiveness and limited side -effects , may partly explain this gap in the literature (Miller, 1999; PHE (5), 2013) . Another reason may be that obtaining vaccination records or accurate self -reports could be challenging due to the recommended time -schedule of tetanus vaccination, usually every 10 years (PHE (5), 2013; CDC (2), 2 015). Emerging evidence, however, indicates that tetanus boosters are often administered afte r an injury rather than preven tively. A US study found that 74% of unvaccinated participants thought that vaccinating against tetanus was only necessary after an injury, whilst 51% reported that their doctor had not recommended it (Johnson, Nichol et al., 2008) . Similarly, a study conducted in Germany found that tetanus vaccination coverage was insufficient, particularly among older people and ethnic minorities, and that 34% of those vaccinated had been immunised after an injury (B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011) . Findings from Chapters 4 and 5 and the aforementioned UK study point in the same direction (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) . This is a cause for concern, since vaccination may not boost immunity in time to provide the required protection (Porter, Perkin et al., 1 992) . 133 7.1.1 Study aims The primary aim of this study is to develop and test a tool to uncov er the determinants of tetanus vaccination in the UK and to predict tetanus vaccination behaviour. Seco ndary objectives are: i) to evaluate the importance of socio -psycho logical factors in predicting tetanus vaccination; ii) to test whether generic items are equally effective at predicting tetanus vaccination as tetanus -specific items; and iii) to explore whether official immunisation recommendations are aligned with curre nt vaccination practices . 7.2 Methods The methods of this study are described in full in Chapter 6. The criteria used to design and test the instrument reported in this chapter and to attain its intended psychometric properties were analogous to those specified in the previous chapter. As there is little research on the socio - psychological factors underpinning tetanus vaccination, constructs were chosen based on relevant evidence on both tetanus and influenza vaccination (see Table 7.1). The tetanus ins trument was approved by the Imperial College Ethics Committee (see App endix 3 ) and tested concurrently with the in fluenza instrument (Chapter 6) using the same sample of participants. 7.2.1 Data analysis As reported in Chapter 6, analyses were conducted using single items and Cronbach's alpha tests for blocks 3 -6 were performed to explore correlations between items and test the reliability of the scales. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi -square (categorical variables) and t -tests (interval or continuous var iables) were computed to explore the relationships between the assessed variables and self-reported tetanus vaccination behaviour (p < 0.05 was considered significant ). The outcome measure was having received an adult tetanus booster (18 years old) in the past 10 years. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to uncover the predictors of tetanus vaccination (and validated by Kerry O'Neill, solutions -2). All analyses were performed by myself using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 . Following the same hierarchical approach described in Chapter 6, variables were entered in blocks. Given that the available e vidence on tetanus vaccines is limited (Johnson, Nichol et al., 2008; B\u00f6hmer, Walter et al., 2011) and that there is some overlap b etween the barriers and drivers of tetanus and influenza vaccination (Chapters 4 and 5) , the order of variable entry was based on previous research on both tetanus and influenza vaccines (Kohlhammer, 2007; Ward and Draper, 2008 ; Nagata, Hernandez -Ramos et al., 2013; Wheelock, Thomson et al., 2013), as well as my aim of assessing whether socio -psychological factors are better predictors of tetanus vaccination than 134 population characteristics and practical barriers . Thus, variables which had previously been associated with tetanus vaccination were entered first and those which could potentially predict it were entered last. Consequently, e ight blocks of explanatory variables were entered in the following order: 1) demographic, socio -economic and health -related variables; 2) practical barriers to tetanus vaccination; 3) social influence; 4) tetanus perceptions; 5) tetanus vaccine perceptions; 6) trust and disposition toward vaccination and vaccination stakeholders; 7) general perceptions and constructs ; 8) previo us vaccine a nd health -related experiences. The same data checks and procedures described in the previous chapter were replicated here. Odds Ratios for the hierarchical logistic (logit) model, standard errors, significance levels and confidence intervals, a s well as the discriminating ability of the model, are presented (p < 0.1 was considered significant ).

Similarly, 11 variables with \"I do not know\" responses were recoded as dichotomous or dummy variables to maximise the number of observations included in logistic regression analysis. Values expressing agreement with a given statement (6 -10) were coded as 1 = \"yes\" and the rest (0 -5 and \"I do not know\") were coded as 0 = \"other than yes\" (see recoded variables in Table 7.3). 7.3 Results 7.3.1 Participants Participants were surveyed in March 2014 . The recruitment strategy and response rates are described in the previous chapter. The characteristics of the sample are analogous to those presented in Table 6.2 (Chapter 6) . Almost half of the sample had not received a tetanus booster in the last 10 years (47%), 35% reported having been vaccinated in the same time -period and 18% were not able to recall whether or not they had vaccinated. 7.3.2 Descriptive , bivariate and reliability analyses To test the qualitative findings presented in Chapters 4 and 5, tetanus vaccination triggers, setting and motivation were explored. As shown in Figure 7.1 and in line with qualitative findings, most participant s vaccinated against tetanus because it was offered after an injury (31%), followed by remembering to vaccinate on their own (20%) and a GP recommendation (19). A minority vaccinated prompted by the news (11%), feeling vulnerable (10%), relatives (6%) or work (3%). Although most participant s vaccinated at a GP practice (61%), an important min ority received a tetanus booster at a hospital (32%). A small number of participants vaccinated at work, a walk -in clinic, a pharmacy or travel clinic (2% each) or other setting (1%) (Figure 7.2). The majority reported having been injured as the main motiv ation for seeking tetanus vaccination (31%), followed by travel (18%), a recommendation from a GP (15%) and feeling it was important to keep up to date with their boosters (12%), whereas a minority could not recall why they had vaccinated or selected \"othe r reason\" (8%), vaccinated because it was recommended by the NHS (7%), worked in construction (6%), had a eligible health condition (influenza) (2%) or wanted to protect others from acquiring pertussis (1%) (Figure 7.3). 137 Note: participants were allowed to choose more than one option Figure 7.1 Tetanus vaccination triggers (N = 379) Note: participants were allowed to choose more than one option Figure 7.2 Tetanu s vaccination setting (N = 379) Note: participants were allowed to choose more than o ne option Figure 7.3 Tetanus vaccinatio n motivation (N = 379) 31% 20%19%11%10%6%3% Offered post-injury On my own GP News When feeling vulnerable Relatives Work 61%32%2%2% 2%1% GP Hospital Work Emergency or walk-in clinic Pharmacy or travel clinic Other 31% 18%15%12%8%7%6%2% 1% Injury Travel Recommended by GP Important to keep to date Don't remember or other Recommended by NHS Work in construction Chronic condition Protect others - pertussis138 A summary of the results from Chi -square and t -tests provided in Table 7.2, is provided next. Those who had a tetanus booster in the last 10 years were more likely to have a private insurance (p < 0.05), higher income (p < 0.05) and a higher educational level (p < 0.05), and felt it was easier to access gain access to boosters and find time to vaccinate (p < 0.001) than those who had not. Vaccinated participants were also more likely than unvaccinated ones to report that their GP and relatives thought they should get a booster (p < 0.001) , and to know someone who had experienced an adverse reaction after having a booster (p < 0.001). Those who had vaccinated felt more vulnerable to tetanus, likely to acquire it and fearful of it than unvaccinated participants (p < 0.001). Perceived severity of and susceptibility to tetanus were also higher, albeit marginally, in vaccinators (p < 0.05), as was their reported tetanu s-specific coping behaviour (p < 0.001). Similarly, perceived knowledge of the tetanus vaccine and trust in vaccine - related advice (p < 0.001), perceived vaccine effectiveness (p < 0.01), anticipated regret and vaccine - specific self -efficacy (p < 0.001) we re higher in vaccinated participants. Conversely, those who had not received a booster in the past 10 years were more likely to report higher perceived control over tetanus (p < 0.001) and were more concerned about the contents of the vaccine (p < 0.01). Further, vaccinated participant s were more likely to trust vaccination in general, to be in favour of it and to feel that vaccination in general and paediatric tetanus vaccines are important (p < 0.001). They were also more prone to trust the NHS (p < 0.01) , the information about the tetanus vaccine provided by the latter (p < 0.001) and to a lesser extent by G Ps (p < 0.01). Equally, trust in vaccine manufacturers and medications was more prevalent in those who had vaccinated. Finally, good perceived health (p < 0.001), optimism (p < 0.05), self -efficacy (p < 0.01), risk -taking (p < 0.01), information seeking (p < 0.05) and shared decision -making with relatives (p < 0.01) were also more common in vaccinators. Those who had vaccinated were also more likely to let their GPs make decisions about their own health (p < 0.05). Previous vaccine and health experiences were not correlated with tetanus vaccination. The asse ssed scales showed good internal reliability ( = 0.7 0 - 0.90) (Cortina, 1993; Kline, 1999) , when excluding poorly correlated items (Field, 2013) , which accounted for nearly half of tetanus and tetanus vaccine related items (see Table 7.3) 139 Table 7.2 Determinants of tetanus vaccination by vaccination status Explanatory variables Min Max Vaccinated Unvaccinated SE 95% C.I. t/X2 df 1.

All variables in Table 7.2 were included. Table 7.4 shows the associations between tetanus vaccination and the assessed variables. From the eight blocks of variables entered, only f ive blocks significantly contributed to the model (blocks 1 -5) and only 10 variables were retained in the final model . None of the v ariables in blocks 6 ( trust and disposition toward vaccination and stakeholders) , 7 (general perceptions and psychological constructs ) and 8 (previous vaccine and health -related experiences ) significantly contributed to the model. The beginning model 0 (null model), showed that it was 57 % accurate in predicting vaccination behaviour. The first model (M1) comprised participant characteristics and classified 59% of the cases correctly , an improvement in predictability of 2% compared t o model 0 . Although M1 was significant \u00b2 (2) = 11.415, p<0.003, Nagelkerke R\u00b2 was only 0.024 , which indicates that the model is a poor fit of the data and able to explain less than 3% of the variance in behaviour . The second model (M2) comprised practical barriers and classified 62% of the cases correctly. The model was significant \u00b2 (3) = 42.139, p< 0.001 , yet Nagelkerke R\u00b2 was 0.085, representing a modest improvement compared to M1. Models 3 to 5 contain ed socio -psychological variables which significantl y contributed to explain the variance in vaccination behaviour. The final model, M5, correctly classified 72% of the cases, 81% of unvaccinated participant s and 59% of vaccinated ones. The model was significant \u00b2 (10) = 165.426, p< 0.001 and Nagelkerke R\u00b2 was 0.305, which suggests that the model fits the data moderately well. None of the excluded predictors became significant when these were reincorporated into the model. Collinearity diagnostics showed that the item 'trust in vaccination' also had a VIF ab ove 5 (6.02) (Bowerman and O'Connell, 1990) , therefore, it was excluded from the regression analyses. Standardised residuals were examined to identify outliers. Less than 5% of the cases had standardised residuals above 2 and no more than 1% had absolute v alues higher than 3, thus there was no need to eliminate or transform cases. Cook's distance statistics were lower than 1 (Cook and Weisberg, 1982) , hence, all cases were retained. The final model showed that those who had private insurance and higher edu cation (p < 0.1), those who felt it was easy to get to a vaccination site (p < 0.05), reported that their GP thought they should vaccinate against tetanus (p < 0.001), felt more vulnerable to tetanus (p < 0.01), reported tetanus coping behaviour (p < 0.001 ) and vaccine -specific self -efficacy (p < 0.05), and did not know much about tetanus but trusted the advice they had received (p < 0.05), were more likely to have had a 144 tetanus booster in the past 10 years. Conversely, participant s who felt more able to a void tetanus without the vaccine (p < 0.05) and were more concerned about its contents (p < 0.001) were less likely to have received an adult tetanus booster.

Note: t he change in model fit as indicated by chi -square tests for each block of variables (M1 -M5) was significant for all blocks (p < 0.05 ). 145 7.4 Discussion This study aimed to uncover the determinants of adult tetanus vaccination in t he UK and to predict tetanus vaccination behaviour . The model that best fitted the data retained 10 item s, all of which were significantly associated with vaccination uptake. Socio -economic factors explained only 2% of the varianc e in vaccination behaviour, perceived access barriers explained 6% and socio - psychological factors explained 22% of vaccination behaviour. The final model predicted 72% of tetanus vaccination behaviour status overall, correctly identifying 81% of unvaccina ted and 59% of vaccinated participants . To my knowledge, this is the first study evaluating and modelling the socio - psychological predictors of adult tetanus vaccination in the UK and elsewhere. Results showed that only two socio -economic factors predicte d tetanus vaccination , albeit weakly : education and private health insurance. T hose who had a higher education degree were more likely to vaccinate. As previously discussed, the UK vaccination programme against tetanus is difficult to grasp and not widely advertised (NHS (3), 2014) . It is, therefore, plausible that those who are more educated are also more able to access and understand adult booster recommendations. Participants who had private health insurance were also more likely to have had a tetanus bo oster . This may be because private health insurers actively advertise and offer travel vaccines (BUPA, 2015 ; AXA, 2015 ), which is further supported by the finding that an important self -reported motivation to vaccinate against tetanus is travel . Consistent with the above findings, perceived ease of access, tetanus coping behaviour and vaccine - specific self -efficacy also predicted tetanus vaccination, further suggesting that personal resourcefulness and motivation may significantly influence tetanus vaccinat ion uptake. Alternatively, these predictors may reflect a degree of confidence characteristic of those who have received a vaccine that is not consistently recommended, which vaccination -na\u00efve individuals may not yet possess. This study also demonstrated that GPs significantly influence tetanus vaccination uptake and, consequently, most people receive a booster at a GP practice. However , my findings revealed that both the main indication and motivation to vaccinate was having had an injury. As hypothesised , these results suggest that tetanus vaccination in the UK is often used therapeutically rather than preventively, in both acute and primary care (Savage, Nash et al., 2007 ). Perceived vulnerability to tetanus was the only disease risk perception that predicted uptake. Interestingly, tetanus severity was not an important concern, yet it would not be unreasonable to 146 assume that participant s who reported they would feel very vulnerable if they contracted tetanus could also have had in mind the potential seriousness of the disease. Understandably, tetanus likelihood did not predict vaccination. Participant s' low p erceived risk of infection is consistent with tetanus incidence in the UK (HPA, 2014) and the low profile of this disease in official communication outlets. Low perceived likelihood of acquiring tetanus is also consistent with participant s' perceived control over the disease , a belief which was negatively associated with tetanus vaccination. Similarly, only one vaccine -related r isk perception (concerns around the vaccine contents) was negatively associated with the uptake of tetanus boosters. Lack of concern around tetanus boosters is not surprising, as this vaccine has a good safety and efficacy profile (Miller, 1999; PHE (5), 2 013) , and has been successfully administered to infants, adolescents and adults for several decades (PHE (1), 2013) . This notion is also supported by t he propensity of vaccinators to trust a booster recommendation d espite not knowing much about the vaccine . The results from this study are largely comparable with analogous findings from emerging research. A US study exploring the reasons for not having been vaccinated against tetanus, found that 74% of participant s thought they only needed a vaccine when in jured, 60% mentioned they did not need one because they were healthy, whereas others reported that either their doctor had not recommended it (51%), they did not know when to get it (37%) or they did not visit their doctor regularly (30%) (Johnson, 2008). Concerns about side -effects (22%), needles (20%), lack of insurance coverage (17%) or affordability (13%), and lack of effectiveness of the vaccine (13%) were mentioned by a minority of participants. Although this study only reported descriptive statistics and focused on unvaccinated participants, its findings reson ate with those presented here; n otably, the widespread belief that tetanus vaccines are administered after an injury, the lack of information and tetanus vaccine's recommendation during medical c onsultations and fewer concerns around the vaccine. A large study conducted in Germany, where tetanus vaccines are also included in the adult routine vaccination schedule, found that higher socio -economic status, having statutory health insurance and recei ving advice from a GP predicted vaccination uptake in multiple regression analysis, whereas, perceived general health, having an underlying chronic illness and feeling sufficiently informed about the risks of vaccination were not significant (B\u00f6hmer, Walte r et al., 2011) . However, this study also showed that gender (male), age (60) and living in less populated areas also predic ted vaccination, whilst having private health insurance was non -significant. The differences between these findings and those repor ted here may be due to the size of the sample (over 20,000 people), which enables the detection of relatively small variances, but also to country -specific vaccination policies. Notably, in Germany, tetanus boosters are routinely recommended every 10 years and free 147 for all. Further, 90% of Germans are covered by the statutory health in surance, whilst those who have private insurance have to pay for the tetanus vaccine out -of-pocket, which may explain why having the latter did not predict vaccination (Nation al Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds , 2015) . As stated in the previous chapter, lessons can be drawn from constructs which did not predict tetanus vaccination. First, this study suggest s that structural barriers, such as access, as well as ot her related confounders which were not measured, may be more relevant to tetanus vaccination than disease or vaccine -specific perceptions. This is supported by the finding that those who vaccinated 'did not know much about the vaccine but trusted the advic e they had been given', and resonates with results from Chapter 4, which showed that tetanus vaccination appears to be a 'non -decision'. It is indeed plausible that most people will readily accept to be vaccinated against tetanus due to their perceived thr eat of the disease, which may be heightened after an injury, and the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Th e overriding effect of an imminent threat may also explain the lack of association between previous vaccine and health related experiences and tetanu s vaccination. Although general constructs were not sig nificant in multiple regression analysi s, patterns of associations observed in bivariate analyses are worth mentioning. For example, tetanus vaccinators were generally more trusting of vaccination and vaccination stakeholders, yet there was no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants regarding trust in GPs and tetanus information from mass and social media sources. This further confirms the lack of controversy around the vaccine, but also suggests that tetanus boosters are not exempt from general mistrust toward vaccines, vaccine manufacturers and providers. Consistent with findings from Chapter 6, the Protection Motivation Theory (Maddux and Rogers, 1983) could also be useful in explaining tetanus vaccination behaviour , albeit preliminarily. This is because, as discussed above, the limited predictability of the model suggests the presence of endogenous variables which remain uncovered . Sources of information (GP influence and tru st in the received advice), threat appraisal (vulnerability to tetanus) and coping appraisal (perceived self - efficacy, coping behaviour, concerns about vaccine contents and lack of access) predicted vaccination. The maladaptive coping behaviour \"perceived control of influenza\" was also negatively associated with vaccination. Unlike the instrument reported in the previous chapter, the survey evaluated here showed good face validity, but only moderate content and predictive validity. This is mainly due to th e lack of evidence on tetanus vaccination behaviour, which often left me with more questions than answers. 148 However, the assessed constructs showed good internal consistency, in other words, they measured what they intended to measure. Moreover, several ite ms which did not correlate well with other items were analogous to those reported in the previous chapter. These were perceived knowledge of tetanus and perceived knowledge of the vaccine both in relation with being capable of making informed decisions and trusting the received advice, maladaptive coping (tetanus), peer -experienced adverse reactio ns (vaccine), trust in tetanus vaccine information from social media and trust in alternative medicine. Bivariate analyses show that responses from vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were not significantly different for perceived knowledge of tetanus, maladaptive coping (tetanus), peer -experienced adverse reactio ns (vaccine), trust in tetanus vaccine information from social media and trust in alternative medic ine. Thus, the exclusion of these four items from future surveys measuring tetanus vaccination should be considered. Puzzlingly, perceived tetanus severity, perceived control over tetanus, perceived vaccine effectiveness, self -efficacy and anticipated regr et of not vaccinating were also poorly correlated with their respective constructs. Further research exploring the underlying latent constructs of tetanus vaccination behaviour is warranted. The present study indicates that over a third of adults have rece ived a booster in the past 10 years, a sizeable number when taking into consideration that adult tetanus boosters are not routinely recommended in the UK. For example, in the US, where tetanus boosters are routinely recommended, only 53% of over 65s and 6 4% in the 18 -49 age bracket had received a booster in the same period of time (Williams WW, Lu P -J et al., 2014 ). Further, results show that a GP recommendation is the most important predictor of tetanus vaccination, yet around a third of vaccinators recei ved a booster in acute healthcare settings as a result of an injury. In line with results from Chapters 4 and 5 and previous research (Savage, Nash et al., 2007) , these findings suggest that people may be both over and under -vaccinated, depending upon whet her or not they travel or have been injured (or both), and support the need for a simpler and standardised tetanus vaccination policy. 7.4.1 Limitations of this study This study shares the methodological limitat ions discussed in the previous c hapter. Additionally, the quality of the data may have been affected by recall bias, as some participant s might not accurately remember events that occurred five or 10 years ago. Moreover, participants who had not vaccinated in the last 10 years were class ified as \"unvaccinated\" , yet they may have still vaccinated in the past. Thus, it is possible that the magnitude of the effect of certain predictors (e.g. risk perceptions) may be even larger . Importantly, most of the employed socio -psychological measures were designed to capture current beliefs and perceptions. Given the potential time -lag between vaccination and 149 survey completion, it is possible that the factors driving tetanus vaccination decisions in a state of arousal (i.e. after an injury) may differ from those reported when cognitive processes are less influenced by emotion (Abelson, 1963) . Lastly, I should note that the included variables accounted for a limited proportion of the variance in behaviour. Further testing is necessary to identify other p redictors which could improve the predictive validity and reliability of the survey or to confirm the limited predictability of tetanus boosters in the examined policy context and elsewhere. However, a s reported in the previous chapter, analyses using data from the US and France showed that most of th e socio -psychological factors predicting tetanus vaccination in the UK, also predicted uptake in these countries . This demonstrates that the set of items identified here also predict s tetanus vaccination behaviour across different high -income settings . 7.4.2 Summary and implications for further research This is the first study , to my knowledge, investigating the determinants of tetanus vaccination among the UK adult general population . This c hapter showed that 10 survey items can predict 72% of tetanus vaccination behaviour . These items can be used to monitor the adequacy of the administra tion of tetanus boosters and address inconsistencies between policy and practice. An important proportio n of the variance in vaccination behaviour, however, could not be explained by the variables evaluated in the survey. Thus, further research is required into the determinants of tetan us vaccination in adults. Additionally , the predictive validity and re liability of the variables which were associated with tetanus vaccination should be assessed across different time -points and settings. In the next and final chapter of my thesis , I will summarise my findings and discuss how the results from this study compare to those described in Chapter 6 . I will also discuss the strengths and limitations of my work , propose areas for future research and consider the wider implications of my research for immunisation policy and practice. 150 8 General discussion Improvin g adult vaccination rates remain s an important public health challenge . Recent efforts to understand the causes of inadequate vaccination uptake have shed light on the importance of socio - psychological factors in vaccination decisions . These factors, howev er, are not robustly monitored nor used as a basis for effective service delivery and communication strategies. Building upon the existing knowledge -base , this programme of research set out to improve our understanding of the factors that drive or hinder adult influenza and tetanus vaccination in the UK , and to develop better instruments to capture them . Following an introductory section to set the context for my thesis (Chapter 1), the specific objectives (Section 1.6) were achieved through two reviews of the literature (Chapters 2 and 3) and four empirical studies: two qualitative explorations (Chapters 4 and 5) and two large survey studies (Chapters 6 and 7). In this final section, I summarise the findings of my research under each of the four research aims outlined in Chapter 1, discuss its limitations, propose areas for further research and consider the implications of my work for immunisation policy. The c hapter ends with concluding remarks. 8.1 Summary of findings I began by conducting a narrative review in order to gain a general understanding of the socio - psychological factors underpinning influenza vaccination in high -income countries , and to identify the most reported reasons for accepting or refraining from inf luenza vaccination (Chapter 2). This study showed that social influence, perceived disease and vaccine -related factors, habit, general attitudes toward health and vaccines, awareness and consideration, and to a lesser extent, practical barriers and motivat ors, and altruism, were frequently associated with influenza vaccination uptake. The review also revealed that published research on the socio -psychological determinants of influenza vaccination has proliferated in the US, but remains limited in the UK and other developed countries. Based on the findings from Chapter 2, in Chapter 3, I conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis of four dimensions which have consistently predicted influenza vaccination behaviour: influenza risk perception, influenza v accine risk perception, perceived vaccine effectiveness and reported physician recommendation. I originally intended to include reports on tetanus vaccination, but none of the three articles retrieved met the review's inclusion criteria. The aim of this st udy was twofold: first, to better understand the effects of these dimensions on vaccination by focusing on 151 studies using similar measures and second, to evaluate the quality of such measures in order to inform my empirical research. My findings confirmed t he hypothesised associations between the assessed dimen sions and vaccination behaviour, and offered new insights into the importance of certain vaccine risk perceptions , notably post -vaccination influenza -like symptoms and unspecific side-effects . The review and meta -analysis also revealed that the existing evidence is highly heterogeneous , and highlighted the importance of using standardised and specific measures to attain a more accurate understanding of the magnitude of the relationships between vacc ination behaviour and its determinants. Drawing on the findings from Chapters 2 and 3, in Chapter 4 I explored in depth the social and psychological factors that drive or hinder adult vaccination in the UK, specifically influenza and tetanus, and evaluate d whether these factors were comparable between vaccines or vaccine - specific. This research showed that the uptake of influenza and tetanus vaccines was largely driven by people's risk perception of influenza and tetanus (e.g. likelihood of contagion), re spectively, and that a recommendation from a trusted healthcare professional influenced vaccination acceptance, particularly influenza. It also revealed that perceptions are largely age, disease and vaccine specific . For example, I found that a ttitudes tow ard childhood vaccines were often discordant with views on the adult versions of the same vaccines. Further , the tetanus vaccine was viewed as sufficiently tested and safe, whereas the changing composition of the influenza vaccine caused uncertainty and distrust. This study confirmed the importance of using specific measures to evaluate the public's perceptions about disease s and vaccines. It also indicated that tetanus vaccination , which is not routinely recommended in the UK, is commonly administered and readily accepted, particularly after an injury, thereby suggesting that both acute and primary care healthcare professionals may not always be following current tetanus vaccination guidelines . To better understand vaccination decision -making process es and how these are shaped over time, together with market research experts from Ipsos MORI, I developed and tested a novel approach called journey to vaccination . This approach allows the researcher and the participant to jointly build a timeline that capture s salient events which led the participant to get or not to get vaccinated. It is designed to capture both psychological and social influences on vaccination decisions over time. Journey to vaccination also enabled me to assess the differences and similari ties of vaccination journeys across vaccines and vaccination status, to narrow down on the most important vaccination and non-vaccination stages, touchpoints and triggers, and to evaluate whether vaccination decisions are driven by facts or intuition, or a combination of both. 152 This study showed that disease risk perceptions formed an \"emotional prism\" through which the vaccines' co sts and benefits were assessed; if a disease was deemed harmful, participants were inclined to minimise the drawbacks of the as sociated vaccine. A novel finding was that some childhood experiences influenced adult vaccination decisions. For example, a traumatic vaccine or needle -related event in childhood led to vaccination av oidance or refusal in adulthood, whereas mothers' warni ngs about the dangers of tetanus in early age triggered tetanus vaccination uptake. My research also illustrated the role of specific healthcare touchpoints and triggers in vaccination uptake . For example, being diagnosed with an eligible health condit ion and receiving a vaccine recommendation from a healthcare professional, followed by regular vaccination reminders and a positive consultation experience, resulted in regular influenza vaccination, but only if these were accompanied by feelings of vulner ability (triggers). Similarly, both preventive and injury -led tetanus vaccination took place after accessing relevant NHS information (website) or receiving a recommendation from a healthcare professional , yet injury -led vaccination was often coupled with feeling concerned and vulnerable. Lastly, my findings indicate d that while some decisions are based on scientific fact , vaccination behaviour is often driven by heuristics. A case in point is refusing to be vaccinated due to a perceive d lack of susceptibi lity to influenza or unsubstantiated concerns about the vaccine's safety. Drawing on the abov e findings, in Chapters 6 and 7 I reported the development and testing of two instruments designed to capture the determinants of influenza and tetanus vaccination in adults and to predict vaccination behaviour. Findings from Chapter 6 show ed that it is possible to attain a compact set of variables which can highly predict influenza vaccination uptake (91% accuracy ). This study confirmed my hypothesis that socio -psychological factors account for most of the variance in vaccination behaviour, over and above demographic, socio -economic, and health -related factors . It showed that social influences, and both disease and vaccine -related risk perceptions remain im portant determinants of influenza vaccinati on uptake. Additionally, I found that anticipated regret and self -efficacy, two psychological constructs seldom explored in the context of vaccination, predicted vaccination. Lastly, this study uncovered f ive nove l psychological predictors of influenza vaccination: coping behaviour , perceived control over influenza, health decision -making preferences, scary experiences with vaccines or injections and scary health -related experiences during childhood. Findings from Chapter 7 showed a similar albeit less complete picture. Although, the final model was 72% accurate in predicting vaccination behaviour , it fitted the data only moderately. Consistent with 153 findings from Chapter 6, socio -psychological variables also predict ed the majority of the variance in tetanus vaccination behaviour. These results are promising, particularly when taking into consideration the lack of evidence on tetanus vaccination behaviour. However, further work is needed to uncover other predictors th at may explain the variance in behaviour which the model could not account for. The studies reported in Chapters 6 and 7 demonstrated that socio -psychological factors are the most important determinants of vaccination behaviour. They also showed that whil e some socio - psychological predictors are vaccine -specific , a considerable number of them are comparable across vaccines . For instance, five of the seven socio -psychological predictors of tetanus vaccination also predicted influenza vaccination : a GP recommendation, disease -specific coping behaviour, perceived control over the disease , concerns about the contents of the vaccine and vaccine -specific self- efficacy. This suggests that while some of the factors influencing vaccination depend upon the particular characteristics of a given disease or vaccine (e.g. the severity of influenza ), others may be deep -rooted in people's belief system (e.g. \"vaccines are dangerous\") or are an integral aspect of their personality (e.g. overconfidence), and hence span across vaccines. 8.2 Strengths and l imitations of the research This thesis has drawn upon a combination of methodologies, including two reviews of the literature and a meta -analysis, qualitative methods for depth and quantitative methods to gauge aspects of interest. Specific methodological issues of each study have been discussed in the respective chapters. Here I present the methodological strengths and limitations that are both substantive and relevant across multiple studies within this thesis. 8.2.1 Existing evidence This thesis was built upon a methodologically disparate body of evidence in the case of influenza, and a very limited evidence -base in the case of tetanus. One of the most important gaps in the literature is that studies evaluating the l ink between socio -psychological factors and vaccination using multiple regression analysis are few and far between. Therefore , the extent to which a variable predicts vaccination in relation to other important variab les is often unknown. The articles that do report these sort of analyses usually include a limited number of predictors (Chapman and Coups, 1999 ; Weinstein , Kwitel et al. , 2007; Irving , Donahue et al., 2009; Liao, Wong , et al., 2013), which can result in omitted variable bias, whereby the model compensates for t he missing variables by over or underestimating the effect of the included variables . 154 Further, many studies focus on testing health behaviour models, which is indeed important from a theoretical perspective. Yet, few studies aim to predic t behaviour, which is equally important, both for theory and practice. Studies which have aimed to predict behaviour, however, frequently include proxies of vaccination uptake such as past vaccinati on or intention to vaccinate as predictors, thereby artificially boosting the predictability of their model without necessarily explaining real - world behaviours (Gen\u00e9, Esp\u00ednola et al., 1992; Chapman and Kragstrup et al., 1999) . Another methodological shortcoming is t hat a majority of studies use inappropriate measures (e.g. general perceived risk rather than individual's own perceived risk) and small convenience samples, which calls into question the generalisability of their findings (Brewer, Chapman et al., 2007) . My research has aimed to address these gaps by using a mixed -methods approach, employing appropriate measures, using a sample representative of the population of interest (UK adult population) and building multivariate model s to explain and predict vaccina tion behaviour . However, my work is not without its limitations. These are described below. 8.2.2 Study design and sample composition My empirical studies were cross -sectional and retrospective in their design. This has important implications with regard s to the collected data. First , cross -sectional designs are restrictive to the point in time in which the d ata is collected. However, the j ourney to vaccination re ported in Chapter 5 provided an in-depth account of participants' vaccination experience overtime, wh ich partially remedied this limitation. Secondly, causality could not be demonstrated. Therefore, it is possible that some of the assessed socio -psychological factors may have taken root after vaccination (i.e. \"I vaccinated, therefore the vaccine must be effective\"). Time allowing, the directionality of key associations would have been examined using experimental designs. Lastly , the accuracy of participant s' reports about their perceptions and experience of tetanus vaccination may have been compromised du e to the time lag between vac cination and interview and survey completion. The sample size of the qualitative studies reported in Chapters 4 and 5 was small (N =20) and purposive , albeit appropriate for research of this nature (Pope and Mays, 2006). Hence, findings may not be generalisable. Encouragingly, key results from my qualitative explorations (Chapters 4 and 5) , both novel and previously reported, held true when tested quantitative ly (Chapters 6 and 7). For example, a traumatic experience with vaccines or injections in childhood predicted adult influenza vaccination. This emphasises the importance of using in -depth methods of enquiry to better understand preventive behaviour and unc over important issues which need addressing. 155 Finally, since the quantitative studies aimed to examine the socio -psychological determinants of both influenza and tetanus vaccination, a sample which was representative of the UK adult population was considered an acceptable comp romise. This is because it provide d coverage data for tetanus vaccination, which was not publically available at the time of the submission of this thesis. However , focusing on populations at higher risk of developing influenza -related complications may have provided more relevant and actionable insights . 8.2.3 Outcome measures Both my qualitative and quantitative studies relied heavily on self -report. Although using an objective outcome measure may have been preferable, this was not possible due to resource and time constraints, but also feasibility. In the case of influenza vaccination, for example, one in five vaccinated participant s did not usually vaccinate at their GP practice. Therefore, their medical records wo uld probably be incomplete . Discrepancies between actual and recorded tetanus vaccination are likely to be even more important , as only 61% of participant s who vaccinated reported h aving received a tetanus booster at a GP practice. Encouragingly , self -reported vaccination has proven to be fairly accurate. US studies comparing self-reported to actual influenza vaccination found that self -reports matched medical record s in approximately 90% of the cases (Hutchison, 1988; Nichol, Korn et al., 1990) . These findings suggest tha t, in the absence of integrated vaccination records, the use of self-report may be a methodological strength rather than a limitation. 8.2.4 Multi -partnered approach As stated in the beginning of this thesis, my research was undertaken in partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and two international market research companies: Ipsos MORI and Double Helix. Each partner brought different skills, which, in my opinion, enriched both the research process and outcomes. As with any collaboration, this joint endeavour was not wi thout challenges . Although the design, data collection, analysis and write -up of the research was my responsibility, the other partners, particularly Sanofi Pasteur, wer e involved in each stage of the research and often challenged my ideas and assumptions. While frustrating at first, the majority of the times this had a positive effect on my command of the literature and the quality of the research . Moreover, managing a complex project and the expectat ions and needs of a diverse team provided me with valuable experience, which will undoubtedly prove useful in the future. 156 8.3 Further directions for the research Future research should endeavour to address the limitations of my work, but also to build upon it in a number of different directions. These are discussed below. 8.3.1 Using cross -theoretical approaches Instead of adhering to a particular health behaviour theory, which may have restricted my findings, the design and analysis of my studies were underpinned by a number of theoretical approaches which were either well validated within influenza vaccination behaviour research or were considered relevant to a specific research aim. The overall aim of this thesis, however, was to identify the socio - psychological de terminants of influenza and tetanus vaccination, and predict vaccination behaviour. Therefore, my focus was on developing more effective in -depth forms of enquiry and testing relevant constructs rather than model testing. Among the employed theoretical ap proaches, however, I found Roger's Protection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1975; Maddux and Rogers, 1983) a useful lens to analyse vaccination behaviour. It is a model that allows the mapping out of information sources, personality variables and cognitive mediating processes, and their interplay, which hinder or lead to health protective behaviour. The PMT has been used to predict and understand other health behaviours such as sexual risk behaviours, alcohol abuse and dental hygiene (Milne, Sheeran et al., 20 00). Puzzlingly, aside from the research reported here, no application of this model to vaccination has been published since it was first conceived. This may be explained by the similarities between the PMT and the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1966), a nd the fact that the latter offers a simpler approach which may be easier to use and communicate (Prentice -Dunn and Rogers, 1986). The PMT, however, enables a more comprehensive understanding of the factors un derlying preventive behaviours. Further testing of this model within the context of va ccination should be encouraged. Future studies borrowing constructs from the HBM and PMT to explain influenza vaccination behaviour , but also other protective behaviours, should also consider incorporating perceived likelihood of a health threat , perceived control of the threat and anticipated regret of not performing the assessed protective behaviour (e.g. vaccination) as part of threat appraisal or dis ease risk perception constructs . Research testing these and other novel factors, such as traumatic childhood experiences, across different vaccines and populations is needed to ascertain their generalisability . For example, my fi ndings show that those who had had a negative experience with vaccin es or injections during childhood were less likely to vaccinate against influenza, but not against 157 tetanus. A mixed -methods study could investigate whether this link is specific to influenza vaccination in the UK or whether it is replicable across other va ccines (e.g. HPV, hepatitis, etc.) and countries, and the reasons why. Similarly, heuristics and biases (Meehl, 1954; Simon, 1957; Kahneman 1992; Kingman -Brundage, 1992), the two theo retical approaches underpinning journey to vaccination , allowed me to uncover the importance of recent and past emotionally charged experiences on vaccination decisions, and to identify the points within the vaccination pathway or journey which require att ention. Journey to vaccination , however, require s further exploration to ascertain its value across different contexts and health behaviours. 8.3.2 Measuring and predicting vaccination behaviour Due to the methodological heterogeneity and quality of the existing evidence, it would be unwise to provide conclusive recommendations regarding measures and study design based on findings from Chapters 2 and 3. However, some important lessons can be drawn from previous resear ch and Chapters 6 and 7. First , measures conc erning the individual (e.g. influenza can make me seriously ill) are more likely to represent participant s' own perceptions and circumstances, hence these should be prioritised over general measures (e.g. influenza is a serious disease) . Secondly , vaccine and disease -speci fic measures are more predictive of vaccination behaviour than generic measures [e.g. vaccine -specific self -efficacy (I can get an influenza vaccine if I choose to) vs. generic self -efficacy ( I am confident I can achieve anything I set my mind on )]. Thus, their use should be encouraged. Thirdly, in order to uncover the true importance of the factors influencing vaccination and to predict this prev entive behaviour, multiple regression analysis and, when possible, evidence -based hierarchica l approach es should be employed . Fourthly, dichotomising scales when analysing data should be avoided, as this strategy may inflate results. Lastly , in order to truly understand and predict vaccination behaviour, and reliably monitor changes over time, researchers should endeavour to employ tools comprised of all the constructs (and items) which have consistently predicted uptake. 158 Importantly , findings from clinical trials testing long -lasting universal influenza vaccines, capable of attacking a part of the virus that changes little from year to year, have invigorated the field (Gilbert, 2013). I anticipate that once such a product becomes available, some of the predictors revealed in this thesis may no longer be relevant and new ones could emerge. Explor atory r esearch evaluating changes in perceptions toward novel influenza vaccines should be encouraged. 8.3.3 Evaluating the validity and reliability of the employed research instruments in other contexts As stated in Chapter 1 , this thesis is part of a large -scale multinational programme of research aimed at developing instruments to explain and predict vaccination uptake in different contexts. The qualitative studies reported here were replicated in five additional countries: the US, France, Brazil, India and C hina. Preliminary analyses of the qualitative data -set indicate that although there are similarities between countries, key drivers and barriers of adult vaccination are context -specific, and there are important differences between developing and deve loped settings . Due to resource constraints, the survey -tool was originally tested in the UK, the US and France. Encouragingly, although initial analyse s also show country -specific differences, the predictability of the tools and the determinants of vaccination are largely comparable across these three settings. Given these promising results, additional funding was approved to test the influenza instrument in Mexico (2014/2015) and China ( 2015/2016 ). Based on these preliminary results, for certain countries the proposed instruments may require the addition of new items which capture specific practical barriers, religious beliefs or cultural traits. Therefore, future research exploring whether the findings from this thesis hold true in other contexts and across vaccines , and to what extent, is warranted. 8.3.4 Employing experimental and interventional study designs to test the findings This thesis was concerned with understanding and predicting adult vaccination behaviour in the UK. The next step is to design and test cost -effective interventions to change behaviour. I propose two directions f or future research in this area . First, since correlations cannot be interpreted as causal effects (i.e. it is not known whether a particular percep tion caused the vaccination behaviour or vice versa), experimental designs should be considered to explore whether specific modifying predictors, typically in isolation, can lead to a change of behaviour. Experiments could investigate, for example, whether vaccine -specific self -efficacy or coping behaviours lead to vaccination or vice versa. 159 Developing i nterventions using well -designed behavioural randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should also be encouraged. This is because RCTs enable effective control o f sources of bias (blinding) a nd unknown confounders (randomis ation), thereby enhancing the degre e of confidence in the results. My findings indicate that future interventions could evaluate the effect of tailored risk communications (according to age and health status) and different recommendation approaches on vaccination uptake. For instance, emerging evidence on how doctors initiate a paediatric vaccine recommendation showed that parents are more likely to resist the advice if the doctor uses a particip atory ( e.g. \"What do you want to do about shots?\" ) rather than a presumptive initiation approach (e.g. \"Well, we have to do some shots \") (Opel, Heritage et al., 2013) . Future research could test the replicability of these findings on adult vaccination and further explore the role of health decision -making preferences on doctor -patient communication about vaccines. Interventions around tetanus vaccination should focus on addressing the gap between national recommendations and practice. Developing clearer i mmunisation policies and guidelines , and ensuring these are adequately implemented, should be prioritised. 8.4 Wider implications of my research Despite the limitations of this body of work, I believe my findings have a number of implications for research, immunisation policy and practice. I discuss these below. 8.4.1 Exploring wider transferability The wider usability of my research has started to become apparent. In addition to the roll -out of the influenza vaccine instrument (Chapter 6) in Mexico and China, my supervisor and I have been asked by Sanofi MSD (a sister company of Sanofi Pasteur) to be involved in the development of a similar tool to identify the determinants of the uptake of the newly introduced Herpes Zoster or shingles vaccine in the UK. We are, of course, testing key findings from the present research. Sanofi MSD became aware of my research through a publication reporting findings from Chapter 2, a positive indication of the relevance of this work. I was also approached by a US research group in terested in using the journey to vaccination (Chapter 5) as part of a longitudinal qualitative study exploring the drivers and barriers of the human papilloma virus vaccine. Lastly, US and UK senior scientists conducting HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials have asked me to provide advice on the development of instruments to uncover the determinants and predict the uptake of this novel preventive approach. 160 8.4.2 Improving surveillance Although efforts to understand and address vaccine hesitancy and its det erminants are gathering pace (NVAC, 2013; WHO (2), 2014), thus far, socio -psychological factors are not routinely monitored at a national level. An exception is the US, which, for the past two decades, has recorded the main reason why Medicare beneficiarie s (public health insurance program for 65s and younger people with certain disabilities or chronic illness) have not vaccinated for each vaccination they have not received (CDC, 2004). Yet, as highlighted in this thesis, this sort of explicit and one -sided enquiry, although easier to undertake, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Governments' lack of understanding of the socio -psychological factors underpinning vaccination may partly explain why influenza vaccination rates have remained stubbornly below the minimum 75% coverage recommended by the WHO and the Council of the European Union (56th World Health Assembly, 2003; Council of the European Union, 2009), particularly in younger high -risk groups. I argue that national strategies to sustain and increase v accination uptake should be built upon an evidence -based understanding of the beliefs and attitudes of the public and healthcare professionals toward vaccination, and should include longitudinal evaluation of their impact, as others too have proposed (Cair ns G, MacDonald L et al., 2012). As noted in Chapter 1, failure to recognise the importance of these aspects in vaccination decisions, and to act upon it, have great health -damaging potential, particularly after the emergence of novel virus strains or vacc ination scares (Wakefield, Murch et al., 1998; Bone, Guthmann et al., 2010). Through an evidence -based, mixed -methods approach, this thesis has demonstrated that socio - psychological factors are not only important predictors of vaccination uptake, but they explain most of the variance in vaccination behaviour. My research also showed that it is possible to build predictive and insightful models with a relatively small number of variables, some of which were comparable across vaccines, thereby making data co llection and analysis simpler and cheaper (see Box 8.1) . As a first step, national immunisation surveys and policy evaluation tools should include the vaccination predictors reported in this thesis, and make additions or adjustments over time depending up on resource availability and fluctuations in vaccination sentiment. A second and equally important step is to engage in a multi -level dialogue, from the GP practice to national campaigns, aimed at addressing people's concerns or misconceptions around vacci nes, and in turn, preventing morbidity and mortality. 161 Box 8.1 Predictors of influenza and tetanus vaccination Vaccination predictors Influenza Tetanus Age Eligible health condition Private health insurance Marital status Education Vaccine access GP thinks I should vaccinate Likelihood of catching the disease Vulnerability to the disease Severity of the disease (bed days ) Disease -specific coping behaviour Perceived control over the disease Not knowing much about the vaccine but trusting advice Vaccine contents - dangerous Anticipated regret of not vaccinating Vaccine -specific s elf-efficacy Shared decision -making - GP Scary vaccine experience - child Scary health experience - child 8.4.3 Tailoring risk communications and improving the consultation experience 8.4.2.2 Evidence -based risk communications An important body of knowledge has demonstrated that communicating risks effectively is a challenging endeavour, particularly in an era of hyper -connectivity and readily available information . This is because the way we make decisions depends upon our ability to understand the risk and benefits of a given option, how we feel about a particular information source, our awareness of the limitations of our knowledge , the extent to which our interpretation of information is influenced by emotional factors, among other aspects (Berry, 2004) . This is consistent with findings from Chapter 5, which showed that vaccination dec isions are often driven by heuristics rather than rational thinking , possibly due to both cognitive ability and affective factors . For example , most u nvaccinated interviewees did not feel at risk of ca tching influenza or developing complications , regardless of their current health status , and some were deterred from protecting themselves against influenza due to an unrelated traumatic experience during childhood . Consequently , risk communication s at a national (i.e. mass campaigns) and local level (i.e. consultation) aiming to address prevalent beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination should not only 162 present facts in a way that takes into account our cognitive limitations , but should also harness the power of emotional appeals . Importantly , risk communicators ought to adopt evidence -based approac hes which have proven effective, such as providing population data alongside real -life stories, using data on absolute risk rather than relative risk, presenting information in pictographs which are less c ognitively demanding, etc. (Berry, 2004; Visschers VH, Meertens RM et al., 2009 ). Based on my findings, I provide below recommendations for developing and delivering more effective communications about influenza and tetanus, and their corresponding vaccine s. 8.4.2.3 Bridging the gap between the perceived and actual risks of influenza As demonstrated throughout this thesis, risk perceptions about both influenza and tetanus are often misaligned with the real risks posed by these diseases. In the case of influenza, I argue that r isk communications ought to evolve from generic messages about its severity , such as those used in Public Health England's campaigns (NHS, 2015) , toward tailored messages which take into consideration the needs and characteristics of different at-risk population s. For example, influenza - related complications in young diabetics may differ from those prevalent among individuals undergoing cancer treatment or elderly people. Therefore, specific messages will allow individuals and their families to better identify risks that are relevant to their condition and, in turn, may compel them to take preven tive measures (Brewer and Hallman, 2006) . A possible conduit for these communications is the tried and tested system of vaccination reminders. Reminders have been effective in increasing vaccination rates in primary care practices in the UK and elsewhere, yet their utilis ation remains insufficient, particularly for younger eligible patients (Thomas, Russell et al., 2010; Dexter, Teare et al., 2012) . Tailored messages could also be delivered in combination with general communications based around key vaccination determinants (Chapter 6 ). For example, a national campaign could focus on the likelihood of catching influenza, its severity (number of bed -days , morbidity and mortality for different at -risk populations ), the limited effectiveness of avoidance strategies (e.g. taking vitamins, or evading crowds) and potential feelings of regret for not having vaccinated. In line with the above implications , and as discussed in Chapter 6, decision -making styles should be taken into consideration when designing immunisation communications; while those who are more prone to delegate health decisions to their GP may not require additional information, some risk commu nication efforts are likely to be better spent on those who prefer to make decisions about their heath independently. Further, w ith increased information availability and discerning capability, strategies to engage with information -seeking individuals that take into account the prevalence of 163 heuristic judgement in vaccination decisions, should be a priority . One such strategy could be the provision of internet -based information about the influenza risks vs. the vaccine risks using well - established framing t actics (Halpern , Blackman et al., 1989; Gurm & Litaker, 2000) ; for example, employing a negative frame to present the risks of contracting influenza (e.g. 20% of people (or 1 in 5) contract influenza every year) and a positive frame for risks associated wi th the vaccine (e.g. 999.999.999 out of 1,000,000 people will only present mild symptoms such as soreness and redness in the arm after getting the vaccine). 8.4.2.4 Employing a combination of trusted and effective information channels Trust in the NHS and widespread use of its information resources should be harnessed to support the delivery of tailored vaccination messages in the UK , alongside a more extensive use of social media channels. These messages could be reinforced during consultations or vaccination -related correspondence. My research also showed that mass media is an important source of information about diseases and vaccines, particularly influenza (Chapters 4 and 6) . Thus, as suggested by May (May, 2005) , in order to avoid sensationalism or misrepresentation of the truth, the scientific and public health community should recognise the importance of educating science reporters and presenting facts in a manner that will be underst ood and remembered by the intended audience s. Although mass -media campaigns and official information outlets are important, the existing evidence -base and findings from this thesis show that the role of primary care healthcare professionals is pivotal in s ustaining vaccination rates. V accine -hesitant parents, for example, report that reassurance and information from their child's doctor is the main reason behind their decision to vaccinate their child (Gust, Darling et al., 2008) . More generally, studies ha ve demonstrated that patient -doctor interactions and health outcomes improve when patients are regarded as experts of their own condition and are given a voice to express their fears, preferences and expectations (Stewart, 1995) . However, in a context of reduced public spending GPs and nursing staff have limited time and resources to ad dress specific concerns. Given that vaccination is one of the most successful and cost -effective public health interventions ( WHO, UNICEF et al., 2009) , increased investment in the provision of training, adequate communication materials and decision a ids to enhance patient - doctor communication are urgently needed and much deserved. Efforts to develop more effective and cost -effective communications could also benefit from synergistic strategies to deliver vaccination messages . For example, the importance of vaccination could be communicated as part of a wider health plan tailored around specific health conditions. 164 Since very few people appear to be fa miliar with the adult imm unisation schedule, as described in Chapter 4, a key aspect of such communications should be introducing the concept of life course vaccination in the public's mind (Gusmano and Michael, 2009). 8.4.2.5 Addressing vaccine risk perceptions Concerns about vaccines remain a significant challenge for immunisation programmes . Yet, communication campaigns seldom address prevailing vaccine risk perceptions such as the belief that the vaccine causes influenza. People's anxieties around vaccine safety, both regar ding its infectiousness and toxicity, ought to be addressed explicitly through clearer communication from trusted sources (e.g. NHS, GPs) about what to expect after being immunised, as these perceptions question the very purpose of influenza vaccination an d can seriously thwart immunisation efforts. My research has demonstrated that although some vaccine risk perceptions are more pervasive than others, there is val ue in unpacking and addressing specific concerns deterring individuals from vaccinating (i.e. is it fear of pain? influenza -like symptoms? Or vaccine contents?) . This could be achieved using short screening tools before or during th e consultation and engaging in relevant dialogue to tackle specific issues. Given the lasting effect of negative past experiences with needles, support to help GPs to make all childhood encounters with injections as easy as possible may be a good investment in the success of vaccination programs in the future. Furthermore, the epidemiological and societal impact of the newly introduced paediatric influenza vaccine should be monitored closely, as it can affect future adult vaccination rates . Aversion to needles in adults should be elicited and talked about openl y and in an unprejudiced manner, also as part of the consultation or a vaccination reminder, but it could also be incorporated into mass communication strategies. Although vaccine effectiveness was not a predictor of vaccination uptake, it was associated with vaccination in bivariate analyses and ha s been linked to vaccination acceptance in previous studies. Therefore, it is advisable that the advantages of newer vaccines, such as quadrivalent influenza vaccines that provide broader coverage, are emphasised at local and national levels. It should also be stress ed that although vaccination may not always prevent influenza due to the potential mismatch between the vaccine and circulating virus strains , it can reduce the risk of more serious outcomes. 165 8.4.3.1 Improving tetanus vaccination policy, communicatio ns and training My thesis revealed that approximately 30% of the UK population has received an adult booster, a sizeable figure for a vaccine which is not currently included in the UK routine adult immunisation schedule. Moreover, around 30% of vaccinator s received a booster after an injury. Tetanus vaccination appears to be recommended by GPs and emergency doctors alike to protect individuals from acquiring the disease after a potentially risky injury. However, as discussed in Chapter 7, vaccination may n ot boost immunity in time to prevent infection (Porter, Perkin et al., 1992). Instead, Public Health England recommends a course of tetanus immunoglobulin (PHE (5 ), 2013) . A clearer adult tetanus immunisation policy should be considered, alongside an effective dissemination plan for healthcare professionals - as current national tetanus immunisation guidelines appear not to be followed in practice. Additionally, the vertical integration of vaccination records is advisable, particularly when immunisatio n is taking place in both tertiary and primary care settings. My findings also showed that, unlike influenza vaccination, tetanus vaccination is readily accepted once it has been recommended by a healthcare professional. This is because of the potential seriousness of the disease, but also the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Further, in some cases, vaccination is actively requested by individuals who feel they may be at risk of acquiring tetanus. A simpler, standardised tetanus immunisation po licy (e.g. one adult booster for all adults) may lead to better informed vaccination decisions, help to minimise under and over -vaccination and reduce unnecessary A&E visits . 8.4.4 Learning from well -accepted vaccines Efforts to develop a universal influenza va ccine , which could see the implementation of a long - lasting and more efficacious product in the next decade (Gilbert , 2013) , can draw valuable lessons from tetanus vaccination. This is because the characteristics and schedule of such product may resemble t hose of tetanus boosters. On one hand, concerns around effectiveness and side -effects are likely to lessen due to a more stable (and tested) vaccine composition, which may in turn increase uptake. On the other hand, monitoring coverage, keeping records and developing a reminder system for long -lasting vaccines may prove challenging. If and when the universal influenza vaccine becomes available, these potential barriers should be considered in cost -effectiveness analyses and implementation research. 166 8.4.5 Translat ing research into practice A key goal of this multidisciplinary collaboration was to propose barometer -style monitoring tools which can be used by academics, policy -makers and industry to track vaccination sentiment and predict uptake. Results from this re search were presented to the CEO of Sanofi Pasteur (November 2014) and disseminated to its affiliates worldwide. A second output currently under development is an influenza vaccine simulator, which seeks to translate findings from Chapter 6, as well as those from France and the US, into an interactive and user -friendly internet -based tool (see simulator draft in Appendix 13). The simulator will enable vaccination stakeholders to modify predictors and visualise in real -time the consequent changes in vacci nation rates. This tool aims to improve knowledge and facilitate immu nisation policy prioritisation, and could also be used by clinicians to understand and predict p atients' vaccination behaviour. 8.5 Concluding remarks The studies within this thesis collectiv ely improve our understanding of the importance of socio - psychological factors on adult vaccination behaviour, specifically influenza and tetanus. My research has shown that using an evidence -based systematic approach, it is possible to explain and predict vaccination behaviour. Importantly, my findings have demonstrated that socio -psychological factors are more predictive of adult vaccination behaviour than other factors. This sole finding warrants their inclusion in all aspect of immunisation policy. Although my research is not without its limitations, I believe it has a number of implications for policy and practice, and ultimately for improving public health. Monitoring public sentiment by including socio -psychological variables i n national immunisation surveys could enable decision - makers and practitioners to improve their understanding about vaccination behaviour, predict uptake, develop better communication strategies and more effective interventions, and evaluate immunisation policies . These efforts c ould, in turn, improve at best or sustain at worst current vaccination rates. Due to the high mobility of European citizens, a concerted multi -national strategy in this direction could bring a huge return on investment. Lastly, on a personal level, carrying out this research as part of a multi -disciplinary team has been an invaluable e xperience , which has not only improved my knowledge, research and management skills, but has also strengthen 'softer' skills such as communication, cooperation and forbearance . I hope that beyond the academic and translational initiatives which have arisen from this work , my research can contribute to improve immunisation programmes and vaccination experience. 167 References 56th World Health Assembly (2003).

Before you decide to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being d one and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the f ollowing information carefully. What is the purpose of the study? When individuals are vaccinated, their immune system is strengthened to prevent them from getting a specific disease. This is a very effective way of protecting their health and that of their communities. However, not everyone who is eligible for vaccinati on gets vaccinated. The purpose of this study is to understand why some adults vaccinate and some do not, particularly for seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine and tetanus. This study will also form part of a PhD. Why ha ve I been chosen? You have been chose n because of the vaccinations you have or have not had and your personal characteristics (for example, your age and gender). Do I have to take part? It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. What will happen to me if I take part? If you decide to take part in the study you will be asked to answer the following: 1. Questions abou t your personal characteristics 2. Questions about your views on gener al health and adult vaccination What are the possible disadvantages and risks of ta king part? There are few disadvantages of taking part because the research only involves an interview. It does not involve any use of a drug and is not trying to sell any kind of medication. Taking part in the study may involve some loss of privacy for you, in that your responses will be known to the intervie wer carrying out the interview. However, the information that you provide will be kept anonymous and confidential and only the research team will see it. The other disadvantage of taking part is the time this interview will take, which is 60 minutes or le ss. 200 What are the possible benefits of taking part? We will collect and analyse information about the reasons why people do or do not vaccinate. We hope the results of this study will be published in academic journals and used to inform national and interna tional vaccination policy and communication strategies. We will also be giving you a gift as a thank you f or taking part in the research. What if something goes wrong? We do not foresee anything going wrong. However, if there are any problems you are free to terminate your participati on from the study at any time. Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential? Information that is collected about you during the course of this interview will be kept strictly confidential and will only be seen by Im perial College, icare and Ipsos researchers. Anything you say will be anonymous when reported. The data will be kept securely. What will happen to the results of the research study? The results of the research will be written up as a research report. It ma y be published in a research journal and presented at conferences. You will not be personally identifiabl e in any report or publication. Who is organising and funding the research? The study is funded by Sanofi Pasteur and designed and organised by Imperia l College London and Ipsos. Ipsos is helping to design the research, recruiting participants to take part in it, conducting the interviews, and then analysing and reporting on the findings alon g with Imperial College London. Insurance and indemnity If you are harmed by taking part in this research project, there are no special compensation arrangements. If you are harmed due to someone's negligence, then you may have grounds for a legal action. Regardless of this, if you wish to complain, or have any conc erns about any aspect of the way you have been treated during the course of this study then you should immediately inform the Investigator Nick Sevdalis (n.sevdalis@imperial.ac.uk). If you are still not satisfied with the response, you can contact the Imp erial AHSC Joint Research Office. Who has reviewed the study? The Imperial College Research Ethics Comm ittee has approved this study. Contact for Further Information If you would like further information about this study please contact Ana Wheeloc k (a.wh eelock@imperial.ac.uk). You will be given a copy of the research information sheet and a signed consent form to keep, if you wish.201 Appendix 8 Interview schedule vaccinators Section title Key questions and probes Interviewer prompts and probes Aims and objectives of section and notes Time: 60 min A.
