The COT set up a new working group, theWorking Group on Variability and Uncertainty in Toxicology (VUT), to consider the issue. The membershipof the Working Group is listed in Appendix 7. The first meeting of the Working Group was on 14thNovember 2003 and it subsequently met on five further occasions throughout 2004, 2005 and 2006. Thefinal report of the Working Group was endorsed by the COT on 2nd March 2007. 1.2 The terms of reference of the Working Group were: /circle6To review the evidence of the bases and range of variability in response to toxic chemicals. /circle6To consider sources of uncertainty in hazard identification and characterisation. /circle6To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to extrapolate toxicological data from animals to humans. /circle6To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to allow for variation withinthe human population, including specific subgroups such as children. /circle6To consider other methods that might be used in setting acceptable or tolerable intakes for chemicalsin food, consumer products and the environment. /circle6To consider how to express the level of confidence that one can have in the risk assessment. 1.3 In this report the terms \"variability\" and \"uncertainty\" are used as defined in the context of chemical risk assessment by the International Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS, 2004): /circle6Variability was defined as observable diversity in biological sensitivity or response, and in exposureparameters. /circle6Uncertainty was defined as imperfect knowledge concerning the present or future state of an organism,system or (sub)population under consideration. 1.4 Risk analysis comprises three stages. These are risk assessment, risk communication and risk management. Risk assessment involves hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, and riskcharacterisation. Each of these steps is subject to variability and uncertainty in the available information.This report focuses on uncertainty and variability in hazard identification and characterisation, and doesnot consider those in exposure assessment. Hazard identification and characterisation are the steps inwhich the complete database on the toxicity of a chemical is evaluated and used to set a health-basedguidance value (sometimes termed a reference dose). 71. Executive Summary1.5 Health-based guidance values are the levels of exposure that are regarded as causing no appreciable harm in exposed people. They are determined during hazard identification and characterisation. These valuesinclude the acceptable daily intake (ADI), the tolerable daily intake (TDI) and the acute reference dose(ARfD). The report considers several approaches (e.g. No Observed Adverse Effect Level - NOAEL, andthe Bench Mark Dose Level - BMDL) used in establishing health-based guidance values. In particular, itfocuses on the sources of uncertainty and variability involved in the process, and the application ofuncertainty factors to compensate for these. 1.6 After a general introduction (Chapter 2), this report summarises in Chapter 3 the risk assessment process and describes the general background in which uncertainty and variability in the available data andinformation need to be considered. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 describe the sources of variability in the differenttypes of biological data available, and sources of uncertainty are considered in Chapter 7. The effect ofvariability and uncertainty in relation to using human data is described in Chapter 8. Since they are areasof particular public concern in relation to infants and young children, Chapters 9 and 10 respectivelyexplore variability and uncertainty in the context of neurodevelopmental toxicity and endocrinemodulation. The adequacy of the existing risk assessment methods to deal with uncertainty and variabilityis evaluated in Chapter 11. Alternative approaches that may refine risk assessment are addressed in Chapter12. The Committee's conclusions and recommendations are summarised in Chapter 13. 1.7 The conclusions are set out below, under the respective terms of reference: To review the evidence of the bases and range of variability in response to toxic chemicals 1.8 Variability in response to chemicals is determined by the fate of the chemical within the body (toxicokinetics) and the toxicity of the chemical and its metabolites (toxicodynamics). Variability in bothtoxicokinetics and toxicodynamics arises from a combination of factors that are inherent to the individual(or organism), and other factors that relate to the physiology and environment of the individual and whichchange over time. Inherent characteristics include species, sex and genotype. The modulating factorsinclude age, stage of development and functional maturation of organs and systems, co-exposure to otheragents and compounds (e.g. nutrients), lifestyle, and environmental factors, and disease. In principle,variability is measurable, and any lack of knowledge of variability is a source of uncertainty. 1.9 Recent scientific advances have led to greater insight into genetic factors responsible for susceptibility. It is now becoming possible to explain some variability in terms of genetic polymorphisms and post-genomicmolecular biology. However, genetic heterogeneity and gene expression are not new forms of variation.They have always existed as part of the underlying differences between individuals, and as such wouldhave been part of the variability that has informed the development of current methods that are appliedto deal with variability in risk assessment. 1.10 The range of human variability in response to chemicals cannot be measured directly in all sectors of the population. It is inferred from studies in different animal species, and from knowledge of the differencesbetween humans and animal models in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. 8Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.11 Each source of variability results in a distribution of activity or functionality amongst individuals of a population, leading to either increased or decreased susceptibility to the toxic effect. The overallresponse to a toxic chemical is determined by the combination of the many different sources of variability.The factors contributing to variability are, unless linked, unlikely to all act in the same direction. To consider sources of uncertainty in hazard identification and characterisation 1.12 Uncertainty in hazard identification or characterisation relates to incomplete knowledge of the relevance of the results of studies conducted in animals and experimental models, or of human populations, and ofpossible effects that have not been adequately investigated or recognised. 1.13 The few available direct data relating to human variability are largely derived from studies in young men. Thus, the extent to which these data reflect the susceptibilities of women, older people, the conceptus,or children is uncertain. 1.14 Often there is uncertainty about the association of early exposure with particular health effects later in life. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of such effects might enable identification of earlypredictive markers of significant adverse effects that would reduce this uncertainty. 1.15 There is more uncertainty in the hazard identification and characterisation of contaminants and natural constituents in foods because, unlike food additives and pesticides, they are not subject to a formalapproval process requiring systematic studies to support safety assessment. 1.16 Another source of uncertainty relates to interpretation of studies giving apparently contradictory results with no obvious explanation. There is a need for an agreed robust mechanism for assessing the results ofstudies that give contradictory results, and demonstrating clearly, how the hazard characterisationresolves such problems. To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to extrapolate toxicological data from animals to humans 1.17 Differences between the animal species used in laboratory experiments and humans derive from anatomical and physiological differences, as well as the variation in genetic factors that occurs within aspecies. Data from the available research in which compounds have been studied in both animals and mansuggest that the default uncertainty factor of 10 allows adequately for interspecies differences. 1.18 The question of special vulnerability of the developing nervous system to neurotoxicity is addressed by current regulatory testing with specific consideration of neurobehavioural and neurodevelopmentoutcomes. Similarly, data derived from developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in animals can beextrapolated to humans in considering other effects on the fetus and infant. Results suggest that thecurrent approaches and uncertainty factors are adequate. However, it is recommended that this area bekept under review. 9To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to allow for variation within the human population, including subgroups such as children. 1.19 Inter-individual differences in the activity of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes are often characterised in well defined populations of subjects, focusing only on the pathway of interest. Whilst 10-fold or greaterdifferences have been demonstrated between groups, there are frequently no comparable differences inthe overall kinetics of the parent chemical, because of compensation by alternative pathways. 1.20 The default uncertainty factor for interindividual variability has been explored empirically on a number of occasions. This has usually been performed with pharmaceutical agents, but these studies can be relatedto other chemicals, and they suggest that the default uncertainty factor is generally appropriate. 1.21 With a few exceptions, particularly susceptible subgroups cannot be identified by genotype. Some subgroups are potentially vulnerable due to physiological, dietary or environmental factors. With respectto infants and children, it is recognised that the young can be either more susceptible or less susceptiblethan adults to the toxicity of particular substances. Since more information on newly introduced humanpharmaceutical agents will be expected to be derived directly from observations of treated children, itshould in future be possible to test the adequacy of current uncertainty factors in protecting youngchildren. 1.22 The possibly increased susceptibility of the elderly and the consequences of a lifetime of exposure are representatively investigated in chronic toxicity studies. Even so, there is a need for better characterisationof the uncertainties related to possible altered susceptibility arising from environmental, physiologicaland metabolic changes during the course of life and in older life. An additional uncertainty factor for thisis probably unnecessary in most cases but should be considered and decided during hazardcharacterisation on a case-by-case basis. To consider other methods that might be used in setting acceptable or tolerable intakes for chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment 1.23 The COT uses current internationally-accepted methods in its risk assessments. These make good use of state-of-the-art knowledge and of the methodologies available to take account of variability and sub-group vulnerability in toxicological data. Given the wide range in primary data quality and the frequentoccurrence of critical data gaps, it is not possible to propose the use of any single approach to riskassessment, but rather it is necessary to continue with the present flexible use of the assessmentmethodology best suited to the specific data set available. As a continuing process, the COT will considerimproving and refining the methods and approaches it uses. 1.24 In vitro studies have important roles to play in hazard characterisation and investigations of toxicological mechanisms. However, there remain uncertainties with regard to the extrapolation of the results of in vitro studies to humans. Complete replacement of animal tests in toxicology is not possible at present. 1.25 Application of the default 100-fold uncertainty factor, which allows for 10-fold factors each for inter- and intra-species variation continues to be a reasonable approach, in the absence of better information. Insome instances, e.g. if there is good evidence that humans are not more sensitive than animals, application 10Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentof the full 100-fold factor is not necessary. Subdivision of the default uncertainty factors to incorporate chemical-specific toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic adjustment factors should be used, whenever dataallow. If chemical-specific adjustment factors are used, the adequacy of the remaining default factorsshould be explicitly considered. 1.26 Statistical and modelling approaches, including physiologically-based pharmaco- or toxicokinetic models, have been used to refine the risk assessment process. Greater use of such methods, when suitable dataare available, would support a more systematic approach to risk assessment. Probabilistic models couldbe used to explore and quantify uncertainty. 1.27 Description of assumptions and uncertainties in the evaluation is important for transparency of the risk assessment: /circle6Systematic reviews of the relevant toxicology and epidemiology literature are important tools in hazardidentification and hazard characterisation and for the presentation of data. /circle6There should be a description of the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies in a review and detailsof the uncertainties and variabilities in parameters of interest in both the test subjects (e.g. laboratoryanimals or human cohorts) and the human population of interest (e.g. consumers or exposed workers). /circle6The choice of critical event used to set guidance values should be justified. /circle6The validity and robustness of biomarkers of exposure, intake, susceptibility and outcomes should bediscussed, along with environmental and lifestyle factors that might impinge on these factors. /circle6Vulnerable groups of people should be identified To consider how to express the level of confidence that one can have in the risk assessment 1.28 The degrees of variability and uncertainty at each stage of a particular risk assessment should be clearly described and communicated to those involved in risk management. This should include identification ofwhether all relevant responses were investigated. Particular attention should be given to statingassumptions and subjective elements in the risk assessment, justification of the choices of uncertaintyfactors used, and of the selection of the adverse health effects used as the basis for risk assessment.Transparency in these factors aids an informed assessment of uncertainty and enables risk managers tocommunicate this to stakeholders. Furthermore, such transparency is particularly important in reconcilingdifferences in risk assessments reached by different expert groups. Recommendations 1.29 There is a need to introduce methods to increase the transparency and reproducibility of hazard identification and characterisation. Several recommendations are made for future areas of research andchanges in policy to ensure such transparency and reproducibility. 111.30 Research needs relate to the following areas: Addressing the best use of existing data: /circle6Exploration of methods for assessing the quality of the toxicological evidence and the sources of uncertainty and variability. /circle6Development of a framework for transparent expression of uncertainty in hazard characterisation, suchas addressing and identifying critical data gaps. Vulnerable sub-groups: /circle6Improved understanding of the relevance to susceptibility of the genetic polymorphisms that have been identified in human populations. /circle6Evaluating whether there are specific subgroups not protected by the default uncertainty factors, dueto genetic, physiological (e.g. early and older life) or environmental sources of variability. /circle6Developing valid mechanism-based biomarkers of uptake, effect and susceptibility that would help toidentify subgroups at risk. /circle6Better characterisation of hazards to older people to determine whether current uncertainty factorsare appropriate. Mixtures of substances: /circle6Improve understanding of the combined effects of chemicals occurring in food. 1.31 In relation to policy and practice, it is recommended that: Hazard characterisation: /circle6Hazard identification and characterisation should take into account variability and uncertainty, using a systematic approach that will facilitate transparency and confidence. /circle6Greater use should be made of statistical and modelling approaches, including probabilistic andphysiologically-based pharmaco- and toxicokinetic models. Use of such methods, when suitable dataare available, would support a more systematic approach to risk assessment allowing for variabilitywithin the human population. /circle6Subdivision of the default uncertainty factors to incorporate chemical-specific toxicokinetic andtoxicodynamic adjusted factors should be used, whenever data allow. 12Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentRisk communication: /circle6The development of a framework for transparent expression of uncertainty in hazard characterisation would enable COT and other committees that perform toxicological evaluations to improvecommunication of the sources of variability and uncertainty in their risk assessments. Particularattention should be given to describing assumptions and subjective elements of the risk assessment,clearly describing where contradictions in information occur and how the resultant uncertainty isresolved. 132.1 In 2003, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) identified a need to review the approaches that are currently used, or that might in future be used, foridentifying and compensating for variability and uncertainty in the biological data utilised in the riskassessment of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment. The COT set up a new workinggroup, the Working Group on Variability and Uncertainty in Toxicology (VUT), to consider the issue. TheGroup did not consider issues relating to assessment of human exposure to substances, as their remitcovered only variation and uncertainty in toxicology. However, it was recognised that exposure wasanother major area (along with toxicology) in which variation and uncertainty could affect the outcomeof risk assessments. The membership of the Working Group is listed in Appendix 7. The first meeting ofthe Working Group was on 14th November 2003 and it subsequently met on four further occasionsthroughout 2004, 2005 and 2006. The final report of the Working Group was endorsed by the COT on2nd March 2007. 2.2 Biological data, including those used for risk assessment, are subject to variability and uncertainty. The Working Group adopted the definitions the terms \"variability\" and \"uncertainty\" that have been used inthe context of chemical risk assessment by the International Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS, 2004): /circle6Variability is defined as observable diversity in biological sensitivity or response, and in exposureparameters. Variability is due to inherent biological differences between species, strains, sub-strains andindividuals, which cannot be reduced. Variability in response to toxic chemicals is determined by thefate of the chemical within the body (toxicokinetics) and the toxicity of the chemical and itsmetabolites (toxicodynamics). Variability in both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics relates to acombination of factors that are inherent to the organism, and other factors relating to the physiologyand environment of the individual, which change over time. The inherent characteristics includespecies, sex and genotype. The modulating factors include the physiology of the individual (e.g. age,stage of development, disease or nutritional deficiency, environment and lifestyle factors) and otherchemical exposures originating from diet and lifestyle. In principle, variability is measurable, and lack ofknowledge of variability is a source of uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty about the variability). /circle6Uncertainty is defined as imperfect knowledge concerning the present or future state of an organism,system or (sub) population under consideration. Uncertainty refers to lack of knowledge, which canoften be reduced by undertaking appropriate studies or by increasing the sophistication or power ofstudies. 2.3 Recent scientific advances are leading to increased understanding of sources of biological variability. Furthermore, some sectors of society have become increasingly concerned about possible health effectsof chemicals, and they doubt whether public health is adequately protected by current health basedguidance values and safety assessments. The COT therefore established a working group (VUT) to revisitthe approaches for dealing with variability and uncertainty in the biological data used in risk assessmentof chemicals in food, to establish whether these methods are still appropriate. 2.4 The principles described in this report may be applied to other chemical risk assessments, such as for occupational exposure. However, there are differences in exposure, opportunities for control of exposureand in population variability that are beyond the scope of the current review. 2 General Introduction 14Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment2.5 The terms of reference of the working group were: /circle6To review the evidence of the bases and range of variability in response to toxic chemicals. /circle6To consider sources of uncertainty in hazard identification and characterisation. /circle6To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to extrapolate toxicological data from animals to humans. /circle6To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to allow for variation withinthe human population, including specific subgroups such as children. /circle6To consider other methods that might be used in setting acceptable or tolerable intakes for chemicalsin food, consumer products and the environment. /circle6To consider how to express the level of confidence that one can have in the risk assessment. 153.1 \"Risk assessment\" is part of the process of risk analysis. Other, subsequent, components of the process are risk communication, and risk management. The Society for Risk Analysis defines \"risk analysis\" as: a detailed examination, including risk assessment, risk evaluation and risk management alternatives,performed to understand the nature of unwanted, negative consequences to human life, health, propertyor the environment; an analytical process to provide information regarding undesirable events; the processof quantification of the probabilities and expected consequences of identified risks (SRA, 2006). 3.2 A paradigm for risk assessment of chemicals for effects on humans has evolved since the 1950s and is widely accepted both nationally and internationally. Its primary purpose is the protection of humanhealth. Risk assessment is a scientific process comprising four stages. These are hazard identification,hazard characterisation, exposure assessment and risk characterisation. Exposure assessment, which itselfis subject to significant uncertainty and variability, and risk characterisations were beyond the scope of theCOT Working Group remit as were risk communication and risk management. Hazard Identification 3.3 A hazard is \"the set of inherent properties of a substance or mixture of substances that makes it capable of causing adverse effects to humans, other organisms or the environment\" . An adverse effect is \"a changein morphology, physiology, growth, development or lifespan of an organism which results in impairmentof functional capacity or impairment of capacity to compensate for additional stress saw increase insusceptibility to the harmful effects of other environmental influences. Decisions on whether or notsome types of effect are adverse or adaptive are likely to require expert judgment\" 3.4 A risk is \"the possibility that a harmful event (death, injury or loss) arising from exposure to a chemical or physical agent may occur under specific conditions.\" The most important element is the recognition ofthe potential adverse effects on human health relevant to exposure to the chemical concerned. 3.5 Hazard identification is \"the identification of the type and nature of adverse effects that an agent has as inherent capacity to cause in an organism, system or (sub)population.\" It needs a full appraisal of availableinformation to identify toxic effects that the chemical, or its metabolites, may have at tissue and cellularfunction levels. Both human and animal model data are used but information is obtained predominantlyfrom animal studies. Some of these are systematically acquired through specific studies (see below) andthis applies particularly to regulated compounds, including for example chemicals that are proposed asfood additives. Other data may be acquired more opportunistically, such as from case studies, andincident reports. This is more often the case for contaminants and pollutants. As a principle, whereverpossible, data from human experimental or observational and epidemiological studies are preferred.Studies in vitro and analysis of structure-activity relationships (SARs) may also be useful. 3.6 The endpoints assessed in regulatory animal studies that involve regulated compounds are those that were available when regulatory toxicology was developed in the 1950s and which have been subsequentlyrefined in the light of emerging knowledge. In general, the databases are likely to be less complete forcompounds that were assessed and introduced to the market many years ago, when testing requirementswere less stringent, than they are for those subjected to more recent toxicological investigations.3 Introduction to Risk Assessment 16Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment3.7 A comprehensive set of data from such studies would now include: toxicokinetic studies in experimental animals and man; acute, short-term and long-term repeat dose toxicity studies; studies of genotoxicity in vitro andin vivo ; carcinogenicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies (fertility, developmental effects and peri-natal toxicity), and investigations of neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Additionally, and usuallynot relevant to exposure via food, skin irritancy and sensitisation are usually evaluated for regulatedcompounds e.g. pesticides. In some instances, it may be considered that some studies can be omitted, butthis is not usual. 3.8 The studies commonly carried out and the endpoints assessed for chemicals such as pesticides and food additives, which are subject to premarketing authorisation systems, are listed in Table A1 of Appendix 1. Itshould be emphasised that for food contaminants, many of the studies in Table A1, as well as studies ofabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, will not be available. 3.9 Neurotoxicological studies that have been added to the standard data package include both single dosing and repeat dosing (13 weeks) which are undertaken with a battery of functional observationalneurobehavioural tests. At examination post mortem brain weight is recorded and the brain and spinalcord are subjected to detailed histopathological examination. Peripheral (e.g. sciatic, sural and tibial)nerves are also examined. A recent introduction has been developmental neurotoxicity testing forpesticides (see Chapter 9). 3.10 The molecular techniques of toxicogenomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being used increasingly in toxicological research, but have not yet been incorporated into guidelines for regulatory toxicologystudies. The COT and its sister Committees on Mutagenicity (COM) and Carcinogenicity (COC) regularlyreview developments in this area. Their most recent opinion confirmed that these techniques arepotentially valuable adjuncts to conventional toxicology studies, but further research and validation isrequired before they can be considered for routine use in regulatory toxicological assessments(COT /COM/COC, 2004). Some of the research needs listed in Chapter 13 of this report do, however,involve aspects of risk assessment in which markers derived from such techniques might be useful. Hazard Characterisation 3.11 Hazard characterisation is the quantitative consideration by dose-response evaluation for the population studied of the nature, relevance and mode of action of adverse effects produced by a chemical.It includes investigation of the ways in which a chemical is dealt with in the body (absorption, distribution,metabolism and elimination, collectively referred to as toxicokinetics) and the toxic effects of thechemical on the body (referred to as toxicodynamics). As was mentioned above, information is obtainedpredominantly from animal studies, but also, where possible, from human experimental and/ orepidemiological studies. Toxicokinetic and metabolic studies may enable the matching of toxicologicalexposure to adverse effects, as well as help to establish whether metabolites or the parent compoundsare responsible for effects. Furthermore, such studies may aid in understanding species and interindividualdifferences in toxicity. This stage should result in the identification of a health-based guidance value andan account of the uncertainties inherent in the derivation of that value. 173.12 Hazard characterisation may include evaluation of mechanisms of action and of species differences in response, where such data are available. Provided that it can reasonably be assumed that the toxicity issubject to a threshold, i.e. below a certain level of exposure, the substance is thought not to exert adverseeffects, this threshold exposure may be used to derive a health-based guidance value. In very generalterms health-based guidance values are obtained by dividing a level of exposure found not to causeadverse effects (the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)) by an uncertainty factor (sometimesknown as a safety factor) that represents the uncertainties in the accuracy of NOAEL and extrapolating itto sensitive subgroups of the population (see below under the heading \"Health-based guidance values\"). 3.13 An important assumption where animal data form the basis of the assessment, is that humans are more sensitive than the most sensitive test species, and (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) that themechanism of action is relevant to humans. It is also assumed that not all individuals react in the sameway to a chemical, and safety guidelines (or advice) produced as a result of a risk assessment attempt toprotect the most sensitive individuals within a population by taking into account the potential for inter-individual variability. Health-based guidance values 3.14 The acceptable daily intake (ADI), tolerable daily intake (TDI) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) are often collectively termed health-based guidance values or reference doses. Customarily, the term\"acceptable\" is applied for chemicals permitted to be used in food production, and \"tolerable\" is appliedfor those unavoidably present, such as contaminants. The ADI or TDI is defined as the daily intake of asubstance in food that, in the light of present knowledge, can be consumed every day for a lifetime withno appreciable harmful effects. With some substances, notably pesticides, the ARfD, is also calculated,often from shorter-term studies than those that would support the ADI. The ARfD is defined as theamount of a substance in food that, in the light of present knowledge, can be consumed in the course ofa day or at a single meal with no adverse effects. At present most ARfDs for pesticides are conservativesince data from subchronic studies (e.g. 90-day studies) may have to be used if specifically designed acutestudies have not been performed: exceptions to this are pesticides reviewed or placed on the market veryrecently. 3.15 The NOAEL based approach is that most frequently used to establish a health based guidance value. This is particularly true with assessments of chemicals subject to pre-marketing authorisation regulatoryprocesses. However, there is no obligation to use this method and other methods for hazardcharacterisation are discussed in Chapter 12. The NOAEL is generally sought in animal studies, although, ifdata were available, a NOAEL based on human data would be preferred. However, such data are rarelyavailable for ingested chemicals except for epidemiological studies on some food contaminants andexperimental human volunteer studies on some pesticides and some substances that have beendeveloped as human medicines. Furthermore, some countries will not for ethical reasons use humanexperimental data in hazard characterisation (see Chapter 8). It is sometimes stated that the most relevantNOAEL should be derived from a study in the species most closely resembling humans, but in practice theavailable data are from a limited number of species (mainly rodent, and sometimes dog or rabbitdepending on the regulatory requirements for different products and for different toxicological tests). 18Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentThe No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) 3.16 In any given study, the NOAEL is the highest tested dose at which no adverse effect is observed. The concept of the NOAEL uses a single point (one of the experimental doses tested) as an estimate ofthreshold. Formally, the rest of the dose response relationship is ignored, although the experiencedtoxicologist will look at other dose groups to see whether there is a credible dose-response relationship(see also Chapter 7). The NOAEL is dependent on appropriate measurement of likely adverse outcomes.Typically a compound or its metabolites may exert a range of different adverse effects. Usually, the oneoccurring at the lowest dose or exposure is selected as the critical effect, and its corresponding NOAELis used to derive the guidance value. It is possible, however, to select from the range of adverse effectsthat a compound has, another critical effect for risk assessment that is used to set the guidance value.Since each effect may have its own particular NOAEL and associated uncertainty, it is feasible to derivemore secure and perhaps lower guidance values from effects other than that which occurs at the lowestlevel of exposure. 3.17 For nutrients such as vitamins and minerals, the health-based guidance value that is indicated by applying the uncertainty factor might be less than the reference nutrient intake. Furthermore, variability in theresponse of individuals has the potential to result in a situation in which a given level of exposure couldbe essential for some individuals but toxic for others. The Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) 3.18 Sometimes it is not possible to identify a NOAEL from the available experimental or epidemiological information. When this happens, it might be possible to use the LOAEL to derive the health-basedguidance value. The LOAEL is the lowest administered dose of a substance found to cause an adverseeffect. The best circumstances in which to use this approach is when the size of the adverse effect at theLOAEL is small or the shape of the dose response curve implies that the NOAEL would be found at a dosethat was slightly less than the LOAEL, or both of these characteristics. It is sometimes possible to combinestudies, or to look at preliminary range-finding studies, to obtain some idea of where the NOAEL is likelyto be. Like the NOAEL, the LOAEL is dependent on appropriate identification and measurement of likelyadverse effects. The Uncertainty Factor 3.19 The use of uncertainty factors in chemical risk assessment by UK Government departments and agencies recently has been reviewed by the Interdepartmental Group on the Health Risks from Chemicals - IGHRC(IEH, 2003). For over 40 years, an uncertainty factor of 100 has usually been used for extrapolatingexperimental data from the NOAEL for the critical effect in animal studies to produce health-basedguidance values/reference doses (Lehman and Dourson et al. , 1996) for substances such as food additives, pesticides, veterinary medicines and food contaminants. Theuse of an uncertainty factor is not practical for all substances. For instance, with natural toxicants it mightnot be possible to reduce exposure to the level suggested by applying the uncertainty factor. Similarly, fornutrients such as vitamins and minerals the health based guidance value that is indicated by applying theuncertainty factor might be less than the reference nutrient Intake. Furthermore, variability in the 19responses of individuals has the potential to result in a situation in which a given level of exposure could be essential for some individuals but toxic for others. 3.20 The 100-fold value is considered to comprise a 10-fold factor for interspecies extrapolation and a 10-fold factor to cover human variability (WHO, 1987). It is noteworthy that this approach to uncertainty is alsoapplied to veterinary pharmaceutical agents to extrapolate results from laboratory animals to the animalspecies to be treated. Thus the species differences and variability relate to the species of interest, whichmay be farm animals, pets, etc. 3.21 It has been suggested that the 10-fold factor for the variability of the human population may be insufficient to cover certain subgroups in the population, for example children, the elderly and those withcertain genetic polymorphisms (see below), having certain illnesses or taking certain medicines. Therecognition that the single value of 100 provides no mechanism for exploiting partial knowledge on themagnitude of inter-species and interindividual differences led to the concept of subdividing each of thetwo 10-fold uncertainty factors into toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic components (Renwick, 1993). Thisallows relevant chemical-specific data to be introduced into risk assessment (see Chapter 12). 3.22 The concepts discussed above illustrate the need to bear in mind that variations in the toxicokinetics and/ or toxicodynamics of a compound may result from differences in the age, diet, physical well-beingand genetic make up of individuals. In addition the environment may contribute to differences. Moreovermany differences in the toxicokinetics of compounds and/ or toxicodynamics also exist between species,illustrating that care must be taken when extrapolating toxicological data from model animal species tohumans. These factors must be borne in mind when selecting uncertainty factors as part of a riskassessment. Attempts have been made to quantify what proportion of the human population uncertaintyfactors would cover and these are discussed in Chapter 11 (paragraph 11.8). 3.23 The default 100-fold uncertainty factor may be increased if there are additional uncertainties in the data, for example if the toxicological data that are available for evaluation are poor and in some othercircumstances (see Table 3.1). Inevitably this will involve expert appraisal and judgement. Compounduncertainty factors may be used: thus the JMPR ADI for carbaryl was based upon the LOAEL for vasculartumours in mice, which were considered to arise by a non-genotoxic mechanism, with a 2000-folduncertainty factor (FAO/WHO, 2002). This large uncertainty factor comprised of the usual 10-fold sub-factors for interspecies and intraspecies variation and an extra sub-factor of 20 to account for uncertaintyabout the NOAEL. The meeting was mindful that these were rare tumours and that no NOAEL had beenestablished. 20Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentTable 3.1 Typical uncertainty factors currently used in regulatory toxicology. Uncertainty factors Use Value Intra-species When extrapolating long term studies to provide acceptable daily intakes or short 10 (interhuman) term studies to produce acute reference doses in the same species Inter-species When extrapolating, from one species to another, long term studies to provide 10 acceptable daily intakes or short term studies to produce acute reference doses Subchronic to chronic Where no adequate chronic study is available Up to 10LOAEL to NOAEL If the critical effect in the critical study is a LOAEL Up to 10 (often 3 based on dose spacing) Incomplete data base Where the standard data package is not complete Up to 10 Steep dose-response Where the dose-response curve for a compound is steep, a small error in See text curve extrapolation would have dramatic consequences 3.24 When the critical toxicological endpoint has been particularly serious, an extra uncertainty factor has on some occasions been used (Renwick, 1995). An extra factor might be required in certain situations thatmight include non-genotoxic carcinogenicity (especially for rare tumours where is unknown), teratogenicity, fetotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity 1in the absence of observed maternal adverse effects. The extra uncertainty factor might give additional assurance thatpeople exposed at doses less than the health-based guidance value will not subsequently suffer seriousirreversible adverse effects. The main problem in using extra uncertainty factors is the subjectivity of theirapplication and the values involved. The process itself is a source of uncertainty. For example, Renwick(1995) has drawn attention to the illogicality of responding to a serious adverse effect which occurs at ahigher exposure level by increasing the uncertainty factor used to set a guidance value from a NOAEL foranother effect that had been identified as the critical effect. An example of this was the assessment ofthe pesticide triazophos, where the 1991 JMPR temporary ADI was based on plasma and erythrocytecholinesterase inhibition and a safety factor of 500, because of \"uncertainty regarding the potential oftriazophos to cause delayed neurotoxicity\" , despite there being no evidence of such a problem in therelevant dog study (FAO/WHO, 1991). 3.25 The carcinogenicity of compounds that are not genotoxic is an issue for which there has previously been a lack of consistency in deciding on the need for an additional uncertainty factor. There is a developingconsensus that knowledge of the mechanism of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis should be used in the riskassessment. If another form of toxicity is seen at doses below those causing cancer, then the health-basedguidance value should be set using the NOAEL for that toxicity and the default uncertainty factor, and thiswould also be protective against cancer. Recent evaluations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)are an example of this (COT, 2001). 3.26 An extra uncertainty factor of up to 10 has been proposed where no adequate chronic study is available. This is unlikely to be the case with substances subject to pre-marketing approval because approval would 211 There is comparatively little experience of developmental neurotoxicity tests at present and consequently consensus has yet to emerge on the appropriate regulatory response to results of these tests.not be given until the data were available, but may well be the case with food contaminants. However in the case of drugs, Lumley and Walker (1986) suggested that studies of greater than 6 months did not addsignificantly to knowledge of the safety of the compounds, with the exception of carcinogenicityendpoints. Other workers have suggested smaller uncertainty factors than 10: Kalberlah et al. (2002) suggested factors based on decreases in effect concentrations of 3.2 (for extrapolation from subacute tosubchronic exposure), 2.7 (subchronic chronic) and 6.6 (subacute chronic), after analysing 46 technical reports of subacute, subchronic and chronic studies of respiratory toxicants that wereperformed as part of the United States National Toxicology Program (NTP). 3.27 More obvious is the need for an extra factor (typically up to 10), where the critical effect in the critical study is a LOAEL rather than a NOAEL (see paragraph 3.15). The magnitude of this factor would logicallydepend upon how near, in the toxicologist's judgement, the LOAEL is to the undetermined NOAEL. Itwould be inappropriate to use a LOAEL to set a health-based guidance value/reference dose if theundetermined NOAEL were to be judged to be more than ten times less than the LOAEL. Also, if theeffects seen at the LOAEL are considered to be indicators of mild damage (e.g. biochemical changes), asmaller additional uncertainty factor might be indicated compared to a situation where gross pathologicaldamage is seen at the LOAEL. 3.28 Where the standard data package for a regulated chemical is incomplete, an additional uncertainty factor may be required. The reason for this is that an incomplete data package, or one dependent on studieswhere endpoints that might prove critical were not measured, might produce a higher critical NOAEL thanwould be provided by a more complete data package. A particular problem with food contaminants isthat the data on reproductive toxicity are often poor. 3.29 A steep dose-response curve (i.e. when a small increase in exposure is associated with a large response in the adverse effect) has occasionally been used to justify an extra uncertainty factor (reviewed in Renwick,1995). Where the dose-response curve for a compound is steep, there could be more seriousconsequences for those exposed to intakes above the health-based guidance value: a corollary of this isthat a steep dose-response curve would give greater confidence in the NOAEL (Renwick and Walker, 1993). Exposure Assessment 3.30 Intake assessment comprises the measurement or estimation of exposure to a chemical by any route for the population or subgroups thereof (e.g. toddlers, children, adults, ethnic groups). It includesconsideration of the pattern, frequency and duration of exposure and is subject to considerableuncertainty and variability. The overall risk assessment is affected by uncertainty and variability in both theexposure assessment and in the toxicological data. This document deals only with variability anduncertainty in toxicology as this was the remit given to the VUT, but it is recognised that variability anduncertainty in exposure assessment is also a major influence on the risk assessment process and this hasbeen addressed by EFSA (EFSA, 2006a). 22Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentRisk Characterisation 3.31 Risk characterisation is the combined consideration of hazard identification, hazard characterisation and exposure assessment to predict whether effects in humans are likely and the probable nature and severityof such effects. If data permit, it may include identification of the proportion of the population affectedand the existence of any vulnerable sub-populations. Risk characterisation is the synthesis of exposureassessment and hazard characterisation, and therefore incorporates two sources of uncertainty andvariability. Use of Risk Assessment 3.32 Risk assessment may be used to help suggest appropriate risk management measures, to inform policy development, to advise politicians or communicate with the public. In all instances the recipient of therisk assessment will need to be made aware of the variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment.Where chemicals are subject to pre-marketing authorisation, risk assessment is usually mandated as partof the regulatory process. Pesticides, biocides, human and veterinary medicines, food additives and animalfeed additives are examples of regulated chemicals. A major difference exists between such chemicalsthat are authorised for direct or indirect food use and have a sponsor, and those that do not e.g. foodcontaminants. In the case of the former, authorities can require the sponsor to fill gaps in the databaseprior to approval, whereas with the latter, there is no obvious person or organisation responsible for fillingany gaps in the database. Nevertheless, risk assessment is required to support the establishment ofregulatory limits for contaminants in food, and to underpin advice on food consumption. There is aconsiderable degree of agreement on what data are required for toxicological evaluation of chemicals.Large gaps in the database might necessitate a precautionary risk assessment. Chemicals in food 3.33 Committees such as the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF), the International Co-operation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH), theJoint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the Joint FAO/WHO ExpertCommittee on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) have produced guidance for the evaluation of food additives,contaminants and residues of veterinary medicines or pesticides (EC, 2001; VICH, 2005; WHO, 1987; 1990;1994). These specify the range of toxicological tests that are generally required, as listed in Table A1 ofAppendix 1. However, no fixed programme is defined and the studies required will depend on the chemicalnature of the additive, its (proposed) uses and levels in food. A full set of toxicological studies may notbe considered necessary if substances are metabolised to normal constituents of the diet or body. 3.34 In addition to laboratory tests, it may be possible to use human data derived from epidemiological, occupational or volunteer studies. Human studies should not be used to establish general safety of a foodadditive and should only be proposed if there are adequate data from animal and other studies todemonstrate the likely safety of the proposed level of exposure. They may be used to investigate humantoxicokinetics, in support of establishing the relevance of animal data. They may also be used forinvestigating tolerance to a substance, for example by investigating symptoms (e.g. headaches,gastrointestinal discomfort) that cannot be studied in animals. There may be specific requirements 23depending on the population that is likely to be most exposed. For example, evaluation of an intense sweetener is likely to include studies of tolerance in diabetic subjects, who may be expected to havehigher than average dietary exposure. 3.35 There are reduced requirements for the testing of certain classes of substances, such as flavouring agents, for which dietary exposure by humans is often very low. The procedure followed by JECFA for non-genotoxic flavouring agents (WHO, 1997) is similar to the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC)approach described at paragraph 3.42. 3.36 Standard testing protocols do not adequately model feeding in the neonatal phase with infant formulae and the ADI is not generally considered applicable to infants under 12 weeks of age. If an additive isproposed for use in infant formula, a special dosing regimen might be required to fully establish its safety.This could involve animal studies using oral administration direct to the offspring, from birth through toweaning. Tests on specific groups of pesticides 3.37 With specific groups of compounds certain additional endpoints are measured in the standard studies, notably for organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate anticholinesterase pesticides, acetylcholinesteraseactivity in erythrocytes and/ or brain and butyrylcholinesterase activity in plasma or serum are measured.Also, with certain groups of compounds, extra studies may be routinely carried out. An example is the testin hens for the potential of OPs to cause OP-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP). In this test, hens aredosed singly and repeatedly inter alia at doses causing severe acetylcholinesterase depression, while being treated with atropine and a pyridinium oxime cholinesterase reactivator to allow them to survive such highand otherwise lethal doses. The endpoints measured are clinical (eg. any ataxia), histopathological(characteristic changes of OPIDP in peripheral nerves spinal cord) and biochemical (inhibition ofneuropathy target esterase). OPIDP is discussed further in the section below entitled \"Risk assessment incircumstances where it is not possible to set a health-based guidance value/reference dose\" . Risk assessment in the UK 3.38 There is a considerable degree of agreement on risk assessment strategies between the UK Agencies and Government Departments that undertake risk assessment of the health effects of exposure to chemicals,although there are some differences in detail. This consistency is facilitated by the work of theInterdepartmental Group on Health Risks from Chemicals (IGHRC) and the documents it publishes. Theseinclude a review of the use of uncertainty factors in chemical risk assessment by UK Government andagencies (IEH, 2003). This agreement extends to study design where internationally-agreed protocols arewidely adopted (IEH, 1999a & 1999b). International harmonisation 3.39 Internationally, there has been harmonisation of data requirements for food additives, veterinary medicines and pesticides, under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. There has beenharmonisation between the EU, USA and Japan of data requirements for drugs under the International 24Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCo-operations on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH) and International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements forRegistration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). There has also been international harmonisation ofstudy guidelines at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Risk Assessment in Circumstances where it is not possible to set a Health-Based Guidance Value Events elicited during hazard identification where an As-Low-As-Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) approach may be adopted. 3.40 For substances that are genotoxic and carcinogenic, it is not considered possible to identify a threshold, because there could be some risk, albeit small, at any level of exposure (COC, 2004). In these instancesthe Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC)advises that exposure should be as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). This means that genotoxiccarcinogens are not usually permitted as substances subject to premarketing authorisation processes,particularly those used in food production. Establishment of ALARP for genotoxins that are unavoidablecontaminants of the diet (e.g. aflatoxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, acrylamide) is a riskmanagement issue, and setting maximum permitted levels takes into account what can reasonably beachieved (and monitored) in different types of food. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on FoodAdditives (JECFA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have recently proposed a Margin ofExposure (MOE) approach to help prioritise risk and support risk management decisions in such situations(WHO, 2005; EFSA, 2005a). In some other countries, notably the USA, different approaches such asquantitative risk assessment based on tumour incidences in animals and the estimation of a \"virtually safedose\" are used. 3.41 Likewise, with OP insecticides (in pesticides and veterinary medicines), the propensity to cause OPIDP is usually considered a reason for refusing approval for marketing them. OPIDP has a clear dose-effectthreshold, but the reason for not approving marketing of OPs that cause OPIDP is the irreversible anduntreatable nature of the neuropathy. In the case of the delayed polyneuropathy produced by some OPssuch as tri-orthocresylphosphate (in the past a human food contaminant), there is good evidence fordifferential sensitivity across species. Rats and mice, although not completely resistant to morphologicalsigns of damage, did not develop motor signs of a neuropathy. Some species, such as ferret, cat andbuffalo, proved as susceptible as humans, but are not generally used for routine toxicological testing. Thecustomary species for toxicological testing is the hen (Johnson, 1975) since hens show clear motor signs atsimilar doses to humans and are relatively easy to use in routine testing. The relationship between theprimary biochemical action associated with induction of the delayed neuropathy (ageing of neuropathytarget esterase) and the development of pathology is very similar across species, although the dosesrequired and the motor manifestations of the effect are more variable. However, it is difficult toextrapolate from hens, as a result of greater toxicokinetic variability and uncertainty in hens than inconventional laboratory animals such as rats. An example of this is the difference between geneticallydissimilar chickens in the doses of OPs needed to cause OPIDP (de Oliveira et al. , 2002). 25Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) 3.42 The aim of the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach is to allow preliminary risk characterisation of chemicals for which there are few or no toxicity data. The TCC approach might bemore useful for contaminants or pollutants than for regulated chemicals, such as pesticides or foodadditives, as there is less opportunity to obtain toxicological data. The TTC is a conservative,precautionary approach that can be used when experimental data are scarce, which allows risk managersto identify a level of human exposure that is unlikely to cause harm. In general, the extent of toxicitytesting considered to be necessary for risk assessment is related to the extent of human exposure, with afull database necessary for a commonly used food additive but less extensive data for a chemical forwhich there is lower exposure (WHO, 1987). The TTC balances an absence of chemical-specific toxicitydata against a level of exposure that is so low that toxicity is unlikely to occur. TTC values are based onanalyses of the distribution of toxicological potencies for all compounds with similar chemical structuresthat have been evaluated for general toxicity and carcinogenicity. By grouping chemicals into broadcategories on the basis of a number of structural features, different thresholds can be identified for thedifferent groupings. Exceptions for which a practical TTC cannot be set are dioxin-like compounds, heavymetals (because they were not included in the database used to derive the TTC values) and very potentgenotoxins (aflatoxin-like, azoxy- and N-nitroso- compounds) (Kroes et al. , 2004). Variability and uncertainty are taken into account since the established risk assessment approaches (linear low-doseextrapolation or the use of uncertainty factors as appropriate) are incorporated into the derivation of theTTC values. Based on structural considerations, a decision tree has been developed which allows safeexposure levels to be established for compounds for which there are few or no data. The TTC approachhas had greatest use in the risk assessment of the thousands of flavouring agents that are used at very lowlevels. The decision tree proposed by Kroes et al. (2004) might be useful for potentially genotoxic compounds to which exposure cannot be avoided (e.g. some contaminants) and for which acarcinogenicity study is not available so far. (The decision tree of Kroes et al. , 2004, is reproduced at Appendix 6.) Present regulatory approach to vulnerable subgroups in the population Embryo, fetus and children 3.43 At present, developmental toxicity studies are carried out for most regulated chemicals. Such studies investigate the potential consequences of exposure of embryos and fetuses in utero and a (rodent) multigeneration study evaluates the ability of exposed offspring to develop, mature, mate and suckle theirown offspring. A further regulatory development, specifically related to the nervous system, is thedevelopmental neurotoxicity study (Chapter 9), which is now sometimes required by regulatoryauthorities. 3.44 There is often particular concern over the health risk to infants and children exposed to potentially harmful substances. One of the reasons for this is that a serious adverse effect that would haveconsequences on the affected person for the rest of their life would affect more years if the exposureoccurred during childhood than if it occurred in adult life. In addition to this there is concern that infantsand/ or children might be more susceptible to some chemicals than adults. A proposal was made in the 26Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentFood Quality Protection Act in the United States (USA, 1996), that an additional uncertainty factor should be required for the calculation of health-based guidance values/reference doses of pesticides for infantsand children. Whether or not this is required partly revolves around the problem of whether the 10-foldintraspecies default factor is adequate to cover pregnant mothers and their embryo/fetuses, infants andyoung children. An extra uncertainty factor may not be needed if age-related differences are tested foradequately in the animal species (Renwick et al. , 2003). The particular concern about pesticides that led to the USA's Food Quality Protection Act requiring the 10-fold extra uncertainty factor might have beenthe possibility that effects on the nervous system (and some other organ systems) that in adults might bereversible could, in immature organisms be irreversible (for review see National Research Council, 1993).This would be an example of using a larger uncertainty factor because of the severity of the adverseeffect. In this context, it should be noted that many pesticides, especially insecticides, are neurotoxic.However, it has been pointed out that in long-term studies, dietary intake in young animals is typicallyabout twice what it is in adults and therefore an extra two-fold safety factor is already incorporated inthe risk assessment in respect of the young (Luijckx et al. , 1994). The issue of how to deal with the risk to vulnerable subgroups is covered in more detail in Chapter 4. Short-comings of present methodology for Risk Assessment 3.45 Variability and some degree of uncertainty cannot be avoided. However, efforts can be made to reduce uncertainty. Toxicological studies in animals are performed under tightly-controlled conditions specifiedby test guidelines that are designed to minimise some of the physiological variation that may affect theidentification and characterisation of a hazard and its dose-response relationship. Age and sex of test andcontrol groups must be matched to minimise such factors interfering with hazard identification. 3.46 In this report recent developments in hazard identification and characterisation are discussed. Present test methods may not be adequate to detect hazards in some areas of potential concern, such asdevelopmental neurotoxicology and endocrine disruption. These areas of toxicology are discussed inChapters 9 and 10, respectively. Furthermore, there is a need to consider if other concepts and approachesto uncertainty and variability in data used for risk assessment improve the handling and transparency ofrisk assessment. Such methods include physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, wheredata are available, the replacement of the NOAEL with the benchmark dose and refinement of uncertaintyfactors (see Chapter 12), probabilistic approaches and Bayesian methodology. Furthermore, the value ofmore structured literature reviews and acquisition of data in hazard identification and characterisationneed to be considered. Risk Management 3.47 As has been stated, risk assessment, risk communication and risk management are the three components of risk analysis. A risk assessment that concludes there is a risk to public health at existing or proposedlevels of exposure to a substance indicates the need for risk management action. The risk assessor shouldalways try to communicate and explain the variability and uncertainty of a risk assessment to the riskmanager. Risk management procedures may include the establishment of maximum use levels in differentfoods, measures to reduce exposure, setting a maximum residue level/limit (MRL) or refusal to allow aregulated chemical on to the market. Risk management decisions often need to take into account aspects 27beyond the risk assessment, such as proportionality of the action and availability of control measures. Risk managers need to consider the possible new risks that might result from the introduction of measures todeal with a source of risk. For example, the adverse effects of chelating agents, that are used to removeradioisotopes from the body, have to be balanced against the risk from the radioisotope remaining in thebody. Benefits should be balanced against risks, eg. the nutritional advantage of eating oily fish fromomega-3 fatty acids compared with the risk from the presence of dioxins in oily fish (for further detailssee SACN/COT, 2004). It should be recognised that there might be uncertainty about the benefits as wellas about the risks. Risk managers also need to communicate the risk and its management to allstakeholders, including the public. 28Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentIntroduction 4.1 The term variability, as used in Chapters 5 and 6, is sometimes called type A uncertainty, aleatory uncertainty, inherent uncertainty or irreducible uncertainty. The term \"variability\" is preferred because itcan be reproducibly quantified and as such is not uncertain. A variable quantity represents trueheterogeneity amongst individuals and thus may have a range of different values. This heterogeneity hasto be considered in setting to guidance values to ensure that they accommodate the natural divsersity ofpopulations. Examples of this heterogeneity include physiological conditions and states, e.g. pregnancy,the functional maturation of organs, body weight and composition, respiratory rate and foodconsumption. Thus variability in toxicological responses between species and between individuals arisesfrom inherent biological differences between species and individuals. This variation in the humanpopulation cannot be reduced and has to be accommodated in hazard characterisation. Attempts aremade to minimise within-species and within-strain variability in toxicological studies on animal models,e.g. by using defined or in-bred strains where available, to improve the ability of the study to detect andcharacterise effects and to reduce the statistical variance in the dose response. The impact of the within-species variability in a study can be minimised by making the exposed and control groups as similar aspossible both in genetic make-up and environmental conditions, eg. by randomising the allocation ofanimals to different groups and housing conditions during the study. A potential disadvantage of such tightcontrols of experimental conditions is that this approach reduces the chance of detecting an adverseeffect that occurs only in a sub-group of the experimental animals. The use of larger groups of moreoutbred animals might increase the chance of detecting such groups, but this could not be guaranteed. . Sources of variability 4.2 The major sources of variability in toxicological assessment relate to the use of animals for hazard identification and characterisation and the variation between humans. These two areas, speciesdifferences and human variability are the foci of much of the following discussion. Historically they havebeen taken into account by the use of uncertainty factors (see Chapter 3). Lack of information about therelevance of study design and animal model as well as high dose extrapolation is a source of uncertainty,rather than variability. Other sources of variability in animal studies relate to factors such as diet andhousing, which can be reduced by standardisation. Variability between species and strains is discussedfurther in paragraph 5.1. Toxicokinetics 4.3 The sequence between exposure to a chemical and the generation of an adverse effect can be divided into two main aspects: toxicokinetics, the effect of the body on the chemical and delivery of the active formof the chemical to its site of action (see Figure 4.1), and toxicodynamics, the response at the site of action. 4.4 Toxicokinetics, in the context of chemicals in food, is the study of the processes of intestinal uptake and transfer (ie. absorption) of substances by the body, the biotransformation such substances undergo, thedistribution of the substances and their metabolites in the tissues, and the elimination of such substancesand metabolites from the body (WHO, 1994). Both the amounts and the concentrations of the chemicalitself and its metabolite(s) are studied, and the changes in concentration in blood and body tissues after4 Variability In Hazard Characterisation - General Considerations 29a dose can provide important information for risk assessment. Toxicokinetic studies are especially helpful for resolving the intricate relationships between the amount given or the intake (the external dose), theamount entering the body (the internal dose, i.e. the body burden or absorbed dose) and the amount atthe site of toxicity (the target-organ dose). The term \"exposure\" is also used, often loosely and with severaldifferent meanings such as the total external dose from all sources/routes, for the internal dose to atarget tissue. Toxicokinetics provides the link between the external dose of the toxicant, the levels in bodytissues over time, and the production of adverse health effects. The possibility of generating relevantkinetic data from studies at non-toxic doses in humans means that issues of variability between speciesand between individuals can be investigated directly in vivo or by the use of in vitro data. Figure 4.1: The toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of chemicals in food Note: the broad arrows represent routes leading to toxicity. Toxicodynamics 4.5 Toxicodynamics is the process of interaction of chemical substances with target sites and the subsequent events leading to adverse effects (WHO, 1994). Each of the stages in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics isa potential source of variability and uncertainty.Chemical in food Direct effect on GI tractingestionNot bioavailable Absorbed intact LIVER unchanged EXCRETION REPAIR TOXICITYCirculatory systemActive/reactive Extrahepatic organ systems (further activation cell constituents/functionsModified by GI mucosa, secretions and microflora 30Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentOther sources of variability 4.6 Information on variability in toxicokinetics in humans is mostly available from studies on therapeutic drugs, because controlled human studies are required as part of the approval process. Information ontoxicodynamic variability also comes from studies on therapeutic drugs (Evans and McLeod, 2003) andalso recreational drugs and, to a lesser extent, occupational exposure to industrial chemicals. This isbecause these are the situations involving high exposure levels where some individuals may experienceadverse effects. Chapters 5 and 6 therefore cite examples of studies on these types of compound,although there may be some uncertainties with respect to the relevance of acute effects to long term,low level exposure to chemicals in food. Data for therapeutic drugs are useful because many of theunderlying metabolic and physiological processes are relevant to low molecular weight organic chemicalspresent in food. 4.7 Sources of variability may be physiological, e.g. age, nutritional status, obesity and exercise, disease related (e.g. diabetes mellitus), or genetic, i.e. species, strain, sex, polymorphisms (genetic variants where the lesscommon allele appears in at least 1% of the population). Characterisation of the human genome andemerging techniques in molecular biology are increasingly enabling identification of genetic variability, andthis is a subject of numerous research publications. Chapters 5 and 6 therefore describe such studies withconsideration of their relevance to the risk assessment process. Polymorphisms are particularly relevantto interindividual variation in the human population. Clearly, these genetic factors will apply throughoutan individual's life, whereas physiological and environmental sources will vary at different times andlifestages. 4.8 Variability may also relate to environmental and social factors - e.g. co-exposures, smoking and alcohol and other recreational drugs. Vulnerable subgroups 4.9 Certain groups in the population may have the potential to be particularly vulnerable to chemicals in food. One that is of particular concern is that comprising the embryo, fetus and child. Present regulatoryresponses to these concerns are discussed in Chapter 3. Embryo, fetus and children 4.10 Particular consideration is often given to possible effects of exposure to the fetus and children, because of the potential long-term impact of adverse effects. There are numerous examples of toxicants that aremore toxic to the embryo and fetus than to adult humans. Children are commonly exposed to higheramounts (expressed on a bodyweight basis) of chemicals in food because, adjusted to their bodyweight,their energy and nutritional requirements are greater than those of adults. This difference in intake viafood and the potentially greater exposure to chemicals from non-food pathways since young childrenspend more time on the floor have to be taken into account under the exposure assessment aspects ofrisk characterisation (and therefore are not considered further in this report). 4.11 Chemicals may act directly on the embryo/fetus or indirectly by producing maternal effects. The former will depend upon the chemical gaining access to the embryo/fetus, and this in turn is largely a function 31of (low) molecular weight and (high) lipophilicity, because high molecular weight or ionised compounds will cross the placenta poorly. The nature and prevalence of the effect will depend on the developmentalstage concerned (Schardein, 1993). Exposure very early in gestation might kill the embryo. At certain stagesof pregnancy, structures such as the nervous system and endocrine system are developing rapidly andexposure may produce irreversible developmental abnormalities (see review by Weiss, 2000). 4.12 In the past, some particular susceptibilities were missed in toxicological assessments (e.g. the human developmental toxicity of methylmercury, thalidomide and valproate). This was because the assessmentswere based on a restricted testing scheme that did not detect some hazards. Current testing guidelineswould have identified these susceptibilities. The testing schemes now used for regulated chemicals takesome account of special susceptibilities. However, it is not possible to predict human adverse effects withtotal accuracy using any test system. For example thalidomide has very limited teratogenic potential inmost species used for toxicity testing. In rabbits thalidomide only induces malformations at highexposures that also produce much fetal death, and it only produces phocomelia (limb abnormalities) inprimate species, by a mechanism that is still not understood (Kalter, 2004). Hence it is not wise to assertthat the best modern testing regimens would not miss such agents nowadays. Nevertheless, safety testingcan only use the best test systems currently available. Post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilancesystems are used in order to detect any adverse effects that were not foreseen by the pre-marketingsafety testing of regulated substances. Regulatory authorities respond by taking measures (eg. withdrawalfrom sale) to limit the amount of harm that might be caused by unexpected adverse effects on the rareoccasions that they occur. 4.13 The concerns regarding exposure of children to toxicants are similar to those concerning the embryo and fetus, in that systems (e.g. the nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system) are immature andthat adverse effects may disrupt the development and maturation of systems and that effects that inadults might be reversible are not so in children. In the case of breast-fed infants, the blood-milk barrierprovides some degree of protection, however lipid soluble compounds such as organochlorinecontaminants partition into the fat of breast milk. 4.14 Infants may be sensitive or resistant because of immaturity of enzymes and other processes involved in the elimination of chemicals (toxicokinetics), whilst infants and young children may show increasedsensitivity at receptors or other macromolecules where toxins exert their effects (toxicodynamics).Renwick et al. (2000) reviewed published toxicity data from studies in vivo and concluded that neonatal rodents were not necessarily more sensitive than adults (although they sometimes were) and thatalthough there was the possibility of greater sensitivity in the neonate there was also evidence of moreefficient repair and recovery mechanisms. Renwick et al. (2000) concluded that the available data did not provide a scientific rationale for an extra uncertainty factor for infants or children based upon anyinadequacy of the default inter- and intraspecies uncertainty factor. The uncertainty factors forextrapolating from adult animals to adult humans are also appropriate for extrapolating from younganimals to young humans. 4.15 There is concern that exposure to environmental agents in early life might have a role in the pathogenesis, amongst other things, of developmental abnormalities affecting neurodevelopment and behaviour,endocrine and immune function, and carcinogenesis. Whereas it is true that such outcomes are 32Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentparticularly concerning, this does not necessarily mean that the developing human, both in utero and post delivery, and possibly preconception, has an increased susceptibility to environmental hazards. Suchconcerns do, however, emphasise the need for transparent systematic risk assessments for environmentalagents that are sensitive to the vulnerability and uncertainty associated with the developing and maturingorganism. 4.16 Growth, changing body composition, and differentiation of tissues and organs in early life, childhood and adolescence may lead to a different susceptibility to environmental agents compared with adults, butalthough in some instances the consequences of exposure are more severe this does not necessarily implythat the threshold of effects will be lower. Y oung animals, including humans, may be able to metabolisesome agents better than do adults, and have a better ability to recuperate or compensate for adverseevents than adults in whom the capacity for architectural and functional regeneration of organs andtissues is reduced. For example, young animals, rodents in particular, are more sensitive than adults tomorphine, tetracycline, novobiocin, isoniazid, methotrexate (Done, 1964). Another example of reduced sensitivity in the young is paracetamol, which is discussed in paragraph 5.14 and 11.7. 4.17 Animal studies may enable assessment of specific aspects of variability and uncertainty in the identification of hazards and of their assessment, but they may not be good models for developmentaloutcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes (see Chapter 9). Influence of Body Composition and Function 4.18 The systemic metabolism and compartmentalisation of agents in the embryo and fetus, and during early life, particularly the first year, differ from the equivalent parameters in adults for a variety of reasons. Thesize of the lipid-soluble pool is relatively larger in immature animals than in adults, and this has particularimplications for neurodevelopmental hazards (Chapter 9). In early life, the potential metabolising systemsin the liver, placenta, intestinal mucosa, and kidney may differ from those in later life. This has beenvariably characterised. There might be substantial metabolism of xenobiotics by the maternal liver, beforethey reach the placenta or the fetus. In the fetus, however, the role of the liver in xenobiotic metabolismis secondary to that of the placenta. Hepatic metabolism is further limited in the fetus because in the fetalcirculation blood returning from the placenta bypases the portal circulation. This represents thepreferential direction, in the fetus, of oxygenated blood to the brain, which is another factor in anypossible susceptibility to neurodevelopmental outcomes. Until about six years of life the human brain andits lipid compartment is relatively larger than in adults. Key issues/Conclusions 4.19 There is a need to understand if a developing human has a distinctive susceptibility to toxicants compared with adults, and whether any difference is reflected adequately by age-related differences in the testanimal species. This information would allow assessment of the adequacy of current uncertainty factorsas they are applied in risk assessment and setting of exposure limits. 4.20 Ideally, data would be available on the dose-response for all toxicological effects in all age groups. However, it is not always practicable to generate such data and some extrapolation across age groups may 33be necessary. An additional x10 factor is probably unnecessary in many cases, such as children, since novel or irreversible toxicity does not necessarily mean that the threshold for effects of agents is lower. It isalways better to determine safe exposures directly, rather than by using adult end points and applying auniform safety factor. The necessity for an additional safety factor should be decided on a case-by-casebasis. For instance, in a case in which it is clear that there is a common mechanism (eg. cholinesteraseinhibition) for both developmental neurotoxicity and acute neurotoxicity in the adult, there is no need foran additional safety factor unless required for toxicokinetic reasons. 4.21 The elderly may be more susceptible to toxicants by virtue of impaired function of organs such as the kidney. Failing health often means that the elderly are given several different medicines, some of whichmight interact in complex and unpredictable ways and contribute to the uncertainty about the responsesof the elderly to exposures to substances. With an ageing population, the health status of older peoplecan also have major impacts on society and risk managers need consideration of this sub-group in riskassessments. However, the elderly are not a homogeneous group and those most likely to succumb arethe frail elderly. There is a need for better characterisation of the uncertainties related to chemical risksto the over sixties. 4.22 The tests that are routinely carried out on regulated chemicals should detect most of the toxicological effects of a chemical, including those that occur late in life. However, it is conceivable that certain typesof toxicity might not be readily detected. For instance, a developmental toxicity that was manifested onlylate in life would not be identified by a multigeneration reproduction study, a developmental toxicitystudy, or any other of the tests that are routinely performed. 34Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentSpecies and strain Differences 5.1 In most cases, toxicological data from animal studies are used as the basis for risk assessment. Interspecies differences in toxicokinetics are important when effects in animals are used to establish safe levels ofintake in humans. Species differences in toxicokinetics can affect each of the main processes, i.e.absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. There can also be marked variations in susceptibilitybetween strains within a species, and an understanding of the mechanisms involved in this can aidextrapolation to man (Pohjanvirta et al. , 1999). It has been proposed that replacement of a single strain of outbred rodent with an equivalent number selected from several different inbred strains may provide amore robust model of the genetic heterogeneity present in humans (Festing et al. , 2001), although the appropriate uncertainty factors for such a design have yet to be defined. There would also be practicalproblems in maintaining sufficient stable inbred strains. Absorption from the gut lumen and metabolism by the gut flora 5.2 The gastrointestinal micro-organisms are collectively metabolically active and those in the human distal bowel have an important role in the degradation of substances that have escaped digestion andabsorption in the the upper intestine. Some of these activities are clearly relevant to the metabolism ofchemicals in food (Paragraph 5.24) but there is little systematic information on the effect of the intestinalmicroflora on the fate and systemic uptake of chemicals in foods. Differences in pH and gut microflorawithin the gastrointestinal tract can result in differences in absorption and metabolism between testspecies and humans. For example, the gastric pH in rats is about 4-5, compared with about 1-3 in humans,and the higher pH results in a significant bacterial flora in the upper intestine of rats. Lipid solublecompounds that are absorbed in the upper intestine could be subject to bacterial metabolism in rats butnot humans. In addition, rats have a large caecum, which is a major site of bacterial metabolism in thelower bowel. Distribution 5.3 The tissue distribution of chemicals is determined by a large number of factors, including the physicochemical properties of the molecule and the body composition of the exposed organism (e.g. theamount of fat). In some cases the route of exposure may influence distribution. Because the structure andcomposition of body tissues in other animals and humans are similar, there are not major differences indistribution for many chemicals, once differences in body weight have been allowed for. There is a goodcorrelation between the apparent volume of distribution (a measure of the extent of tissue distribution)and body weight (Boxenbaum, 1984; Bachmann, 1989), and inter-species scaling is carried out assuming thatscaling generally is a function of body weight raised to the power of one. However, there are sometimesmajor interspecies differences in the extent of plasma protein binding and these differences should betaken into account when scaling. In addition, for some chemicals, distribution is influenced by activetransport into or out of cells. This is mediated by influx or efflux transporters and can show markeddifferences between species.5 Sources of Variability in Toxicokinetics 35Metabolism and elimination 5.4 The metabolism and elimination of chemicals usually entails two phases. The first is the enzymatic alteration of the chemical and the second phase is the formation of a complex (conjugation) of thechemical or more usually the products of the first phase of its metabolism with an endogenouslysynthesised compound to form a product that can can excreted by the body. Enzymes involved in theseprocesses are called Phase I and Phase II enzymes. The products of Phase I and Phase II metabolism arepolarised water-soluble entities that can be eliminated from the body by the kidneys or via thehepatobiliary tract. Polymorphisms of these enzymes, particularly the Phase I metabolising enzymes, cancause variability in the metabolism and elimination of chemicals. 5.5 The complexity of the overall detoxification and elimination systems partly explains the difficulty in reaching generic conclusions about how these affect risk, particularly in humans. A major and consistentquantitative species difference, which affects the elimination of most chemicals, is the relatively greatercardiac output and perfusion of the liver and kidneys in smaller animals. The higher perfusion rateenhances delivery of the chemical to the organs of elimination, the consequence being a shorter half-lifecompared with humans. More rapid elimination results in less accumulation during daily intake, and alower body burden at steady-state for a given daily dose. In addition, the rodent liver has higher enzymeactivity for many of the major pathways of foreign compound elimination than does human liver. Inter-species scaling for elimination processes has been proposed using body weight to the power 0.75 (Bonatiet al. , 1985), and metabolic processes scale to surface area rather than body weight (Calder, 1981; Boxenbaum, 1984; Bachmann, 1989). 5.6 In addition to the quantitative differences outlined above, there may be qualitative differences in the enzymes themselves. Some human cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase enzymes (CYPs 2) appear to differ considerably from the corresponding rodent proteins in their specificity for compounds despite theirsequence similarity (Chang and Waxman, 1996). However, this is often a consequence of the complexityof the subfamily involved, members of which can display marked species and tissue differences in theirexpression. An example can be found in enzymes of the CYP2A subfamily. In mouse and human liver, therespective members sub-family, CYP2A5 7-hydroxylation ofcoumarin. rat, CYP2A1 is expressed in liver. This enzyme, though closely related structurally to theCYP2A forms in mouse and human, does not catalyse coumarin 7-hydroxylation but does catalyse the 7 /H9251- and 15 /H9251-hydroxylation of steroids. In the mouse, a second form of CYP, CYP2A4, catalyses these reactions and is expressed in liver. In the rat, the form of CYP orthologous to mouse CYP2A5 and human CYP2A6 isCYP2A3. This is expressed only in extrahepatic tissues, such as the olfactory mucosa. This enzyme has highcoumarin 7-hyroxylase activity. In and CYP2A5 share very high homology (98%), yetdiffer markedly in their substrate specificity. 36Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 2 \"CYP\" denotes the family of microsomal cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase enzymes. Sub-families of these enzymes are indicated by \"CYP\" followed by a number and a letter (eg. CYP2A). Individual enzymes are indicated by \"CYP\" followed by a number, a lette r and a number (eg. CYP2A5).5.7 Phase II conjugation reactions also differ between species: for example. Steensma et al. , (1994) demonstrated that 7-ethoxycoumarin was converted into equal amounts of glucuronide and sulphate conjugates incynomolgus monkeys, guinea pigs and humans, whereas in the rat it was predominantly sulphated. 5.8 The actions of known inhibitors and inducers of foreign compound metabolism can vary between species. The distribution of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XMEs) can differ between test species and humans,as indicated above by the example of the CYP2A subfamily. CYP1A1 is not normally expressed, or is presentat only very low levels, in the tissues of experimental species and humans. However, following exposureto an inducing agent, such as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, CYP1A1 levels are increased in liver andextrahepatic tissues such as the lung of rodents and cynomolgus monkeys but primarily in extrahepatictissues of humans and marmosets with little or no induction in liver. Studies of lung tissue from smokersand non-smokers have confirmed that smoking increases the activity of CYP1A1-related activities in thistissue (Doehmer et al. , 1993). In most species, including human, CYP1A2 is constitutively expressed, almost exclusively in the liver. However, in the cynomolgus monkey, there is no constitutive expression of CYP1A2and, unlike in rodents, marmosets and humans, it is only very weakly inducible by agents such as polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins (Edwards et al. , 1994). 5.9 There are well-established species differences in the molecular weight thresholds that determine whether xenobiotic excretion is renal or hepatobiliary. This is due to differences in the expression and propertiesof the transporters located in the canalicular membrane, which determine the composition of bile(Ishizuka et al. , 1999). These transporters include P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein [MRP2 (ABCC2)], the bile salt export pump [BSEP (ABCB11)], and the breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP(ABCG2)] (see Chandra and Brouwer, 2004). The bile is the main route of excretion for large molecules; foranionic compounds the molecular weight threshold for significant biliary excretion is 325 in rats but is 500in humans (Hirom et al. , 1976). A consequence of this is that chemicals and their conjugates with a molecular weight between 325 and 500 may undergo significant enterohepatic circulation in the rat, butnot in humans. There are species differences in the clearance of chemicals eliminated in urine, but theseare often due to differences in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow (Walton et al. ,2004). 5.10 Species differences must be taken into consideration when human risk assessment is based on toxicological data obtained from studies carried out in laboratory species such as rodents. Ideally toxicitystudies would be conducted in the animal species exhibiting toxicokinetics for the substance of interestthat most closely resemble those in humans (especially similarity in the metabolites formed); however, inpractice this is not always feasible, and rodents and a restricted range of other species are commonlyused. This is based on availability and practicability and the existence of an extensive historical database,particularly with respect to histopathology. The final choice of species will nevertheless be guided bysimilarity in toxicokinetics of the test species to humans, to the extent possible. 5.11 When substances are given to food producing animals (eg. veterinary drugs, feed materials) human consumers might be exposed to both the substance administered and its metabolites when eating foods derived fromthe treated animals (eg. meat, milk, eggs). In such cases, the role of metabolism by the food-producing animaland its gut microflora needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating consumer safety. 37Physiological Factors Affecting Human Variability 5.12 There are many sources of variability in the toxicokinetics of compounds in different human individuals that need to be taken into consideration when describing uncertainty in the risk assessment. Outlinedbelow are the major sources of variability in kinetics. Many of the examples are drawn from thepharmaceutical literature, because that is where there are the greatest number of data, however suchexamples are relevant to many other xenobiotics. Age 5.13 Age has an important influence on hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, both of which are major pathways of foreign compound clearance. Age-related changes in kinetics occur both in laboratory animalspecies and in humans. The kinetics of water soluble agents and metabolites might be limited by the slowerrenal elimination of metabolites and toxicants of the maturing kidneys during the first two to four monthsof life, and by different binding characteristics of protein binding in the circulation in the same period.Toxicity studies in animals are designed to cover the extremes of age by means of developmental studiesand chronic toxicity studies. The following text relates to the influence of age in humans, since this is amajor source of human variability in metabolism. Brent (2004) pointed out that although there was a vastnumber of animal toxicology studies carried out on pregnant animals and adult animals, there were fewanimal studies utilising newborn, infant, and juvenile animals. Reviewing relevant data, Brent (2004)concluded that although many studies showed that infants and developing animals might have difficulty inmetabolising drugs and were more vulnerable to the toxic effects of some chemicals, there wereexceptions that indicated that infants and developing animals might indeed be less vulnerable than adultsto some drugs and chemicals. Thus the generalisation that developing animals are always more sensitive toenvironmental toxicants is not valid. None-the-less, increasing understanding of metabolic programming,epigenetic influences and other influences of early life events generate interest in the possibility thatproblems seen in adults affecting growth, endocrine function, neurobehavioural endpoints, andoncogenesis might be related to exposures to chemicals including drugs during development. 5.14 There is a low elimination capacity in human neonates compared with adults, primarily due to immaturity of metabolising enzymes, especially some of the CYP enzymes and glucuronyl transferase and also ofrenal function. Adult levels are reached by 6-12 months of age (Dorne and Renwick, 2004). Immaturity inmetabolic pathways in neonates is commonly considered to result in increased susceptibility to toxicants,although a relative functional deficiency of some metabolising systems in the liver may be at leastpartially offset by the relatively larger size of the organ in early life. However, under some circumstances,the immaturity of certain metabolic pathways in neonates may actually result in a lower susceptibility tocertain toxicants. For example, high levels of paracetamol can cause fatal hepatotoxicity in adults, butbabies born to mothers with high levels of paracetamol, which will also have elevated paracetamol levelsin their blood, do not sustain liver damage, probably because of low hepatic levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1,the enzymes the active hepatotoxin N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine(Rumack, 1984: Lesco and Mitchell, 1999). It has been observed that the half-life of paracetamol in bloodof the offspring of poisoned mothers is longer than in the mother (Roberts et al. , 1984), presumably because of lower conjugation capacity. 38Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment5.15 Not all enzymatic pathways are immature at birth and the isoenzyme pattern may change rapidly post- partum. For example, CYP3A7 is the major form of CYP3A in human fetal liver whereas CYP3A4 is the mainform present in adult liver (Pelkonen et al. , 1998; Wrighton et al. , 1996). 5.16 In the case of the synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin, toxicokinetics vary markedly with age. Thus, although lethality in rats was found to occur at closely similar brain concentrations of the insecticide in both 72 dayold adults and 11 day old neonates, these concentrations were achieved at 16-fold lower oral doses in theneonates (Sheets et al. , 1994). At the intermediate age of 21 days, pups were 7 times more sensitive to the lethality of deltamethrin than adults. In contrast to this, at sub-lethal doses that did not saturate metaboliccapacity there were no differences between neonates and adults. Hence, there was no need to proposeany inherently greater susceptibility of neonates to the acute toxicity of deltamethrin, but the capacity ofyoung rats for metabolic detoxification of large quantities of deltamethrin was clearly markedly less thanthat of adults. Unfortunately, such informative toxicokinetic data in neonates is rarely available. 5.17 Elimination by children often exceeds that by adults when expressed on a body weight basis, largely because of the proportionally higher hepatic and renal blood flows. 5.18 Renal and some hepatic functions tend to decline in humans with age beyond about 20 years by approximately 1% per year, resulting in slower elimination of foreign compounds by the elderly. Slowerelimination of medicines has also been reported between young adults and elderly individuals. Forexample, the elderly show impaired elimination of the anti-arthritis drug benoxaprofen due to a declinein renal function with age and an increased risk of adverse effects (Koch, 1982). Chronic animal studiesinclude aged animals, and therefore risk assessments based on such data will have taken into account theinfluence of ageing processes. Other physiological sources of variability Body weight and weight change 5.19 Large weight differences can contribute to variability in toxicokinetics, particularly in the pattern and extent of distribution immediately after ingestion of a chemical. For example, in rats, after administrationof a single dose of TCDD, it takes about 3 days for blood and adipose tissue to reach equilibrium, and evenlonger would be required for humans. The extent of distribution influences the rate of elimination,elimination of chemicals that accumulate in adipose tissue tending to be slower than that of those thatdo not. Distribution is of less importance during repeated intake, because the steady-state concentrationsin blood and tissues depend on the rates of absorption and of clearance from the blood, which isdetermined by processes such as metabolism and excretion, and not tissue distribution. The tissuedistribution, which can be influenced by body composition, determines the relationship between theconcentrations in blood and tissues and the total body burden. The steady-state body burden, which hasbeen used in the risk assessment of TCDD, is determined by the steady-state concentration in theblood/plasma and the extent of tissue distribution, as indicated by the apparent volume of distribution,which can vary between species and between different individuals. 395.20 Changes in weight, for example during rapid weight loss, result in lipid mobilisation, with the release into the blood of chemicals that have accumulated in adipose tissue during chronic intake. This redistributionof chemicals stored in adipose tissue can result in a small increase in the concentrations present in non-adipose tissues and an increase in risk of acute effects. This may be of greatest importance for chemicalswith very long half-lives due to a large apparent volume of distribution (Vd), such as dioxins, where lossof weight in the months preceding or during pregnancy could produce a sustained increase in thecirculating concentrations to which the developing fetus is exposed, thereby increasing risk. 5.21 During lactation, highly lipid soluble chemicals may be mobilised from lipid stores in the body and accumulate in breast milk, from where they can be transferred to suckling infants by lactational transfer.An example of this is the finding of persistent environmental contaminants such as organochlorinecompounds in human breast milk. Also, lead might be redistributed from bone to milk if calcium isredistributed during lactation. Such redistribution of chemicals will result in high and variable exposure ofboth the neonate and the target tissues of the mother during lactation. 5.22 Morbid obesity has been reported to result in the up-regulation of hepatic CYP2E1, which may be associated with liver disease (Emery et al. , 2003). By contrast the activity of CYP3A4 decreases in obesity, while the effect on other forms is inconclusive (Kotlyar and Carson, 1999). Exercise 5.23 Exercise is another physiological factor that can affect toxicokinetics, although the results are minor and inconsistent (although exercise can greatly increase inhalational exposure). Apart from a change in leanbody mass, which could influence distribution, there are no clear trends to indicate that the eliminationof chemicals is either increased or decreased in those who undertake regular exercise (Persky et al. , 2003). Changes in gut flora 5.24 The gut microflora can cause reductive and hydrolytic reactions, including certain reactions (eg. nitroreduction) that are not readily performed by systemic or gut mucosal enzymes. Other reactions canalso be catalysed, including oxidation and ring scission. Certain species of gut bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, produce \u00df-glucuronidase, which readily hydrolyses glucuronide conjugates of xenobiotics excreted via the bile into the intestinal tract. Depending on its physicochemical properties (pKa and lipid solubility), theliberated aglycone may then reabsorbed the reactions catalysed bythe gut microflora include azo- and produced gut microflora can degradenaturally occurring xenobiotics, such as flavonoids. Changes in gut flora will alter these processes andcontribute to variability. There are species differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora andin their distribution along the gut lumen. The upper gastrointestinal tracts of humans, dogs and rabbits arealmost sterile, while significant numbers of largely aerobic bacteria are present in the rodent stomach andsmall intestine. The gut microflora has a greater role in digestion and metabolism in animals with a rumen(eg. cattle, sheep, goats) or caecum (eg. horses, rabbits, rodents) than in other animals (eg. humans, dogs,cats, pigs). The site and composition of the microflora can influence the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamicsof substances in the diet, and the composition of the gut flora can in turn be affected by diet and disease.This can add to the uncertainty in extrapolating results from one species to another. 40Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentDisease processes 5.25 The main diseases that influence toxicokinetics are those involved with the basic processes of absorption and elimination, i.e. diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys. The tissue distribution ofchemicals can be affected by diseases that alter the concentrations of plasma proteins, such as albumin,which is decreased in liver disease and renal failure, and /H92511-acid glycoprotein, which is increased in inflammation. Infections and inflammatory stimuli also cause changes in the toxicokinetics of compoundsby affecting the activities and expression of various CYPs in the liver as well as in other tissues such askidney and brain (Morgan, 1997). In most cases, CYPs and their activities are suppressed, but some areunaffected or induced under these conditions. CYP suppression can increase circulating levels of thesubstrate and result in increased clinical toxicity of drugs with a low therapeutic index. Environmental, Social and Dietary Factors Affecting Human Variability 5.26 Environmental factors such as co-exposure to drugs or other chemicals, the composition of the diet and lifestyle choices can all influence kinetics. Exposure to chemicals other than the one of interest canmodify the expression or activity of enzymes of toxicant metabolism. Where compounds are high affinityligands for an enzyme they may act as competitive inhibitors of that enzyme, for example some flavonesinhibit CYP1A2. However, other compounds can inhibit the enzymes non-competitively, in a reversible orirreversible manner. This may be due to tight binding of the compound to the enzyme, for example anumber of amino and dioxo compounds are inhibitors of certain forms of CYP by forming tightly boundcomplexes with them. Other compounds act as mechanism, or suicide, inhibitors of the enzyme. Suchcompounds serve as substrates and the product is chemically reactive such that it binds to and inactivatesthe enzyme, often with subsequent degradation of the protein. In the case of CYP, binding may be to thehaem moiety or to the apoprotein. For inactivates and inactivates Such inhibition requires de novo synthesis of enzyme before activity is restored. 5.27 Many drugs can inhibit enzymes of drug metabolism, for example ketoconazole and CYP3A4, CYP2C19. that can inhibit enzymes of drug metabolism include bergottamin derivatives in grapefruitjuice, quercetin (found in apples, onions and tea), certain other flavanoids, 3,3-diindolylmethane (found incruciferous vegetables) and 8-methoxypsoralen (found in many plant species such as celery, figs, parsnipsand limes). In a study using twenty-four healthy adult volunteers the effect of grapefruit juice consumptionon the pharmacokinetics of the antihistamine drugs fexofenadine and desloratadine were compared.Treatment with 240 ml of double-strength juice three times daily reduced the rate and extent of absorptionof fexofenadine by 30%. In contrast, the bioavailability of desloratadine was unaffected by grapefruit juice(Banfield et al. , 2002). This effect was largely due to inhibition of intestinal mucosal CYP3A4. 5.28 Many of the enzymes of drug metabolism are inducible by xenobiotic compounds. This usually involves activation of transcription factors, up-regulation of mRNA and increased enyme expression. However,other mechanisms can be involved, including mRNA and protein stabilisation. For example induction ofCYP2E1 often involves post-transcriptional effects. There has been much progress recently in identifyingtranscription factors involved in the induction of enzymes of drug metabolism. These include several 41nuclear receptors, such as pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive receptor alpha (PPAR /H9251), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear receptor factor 2 (NRF2). Induction involves activation of the receptor, either by direct binding (in the case of PXR,PPAR/H9251and AhR) or indirectly (in the case of CAR and NRF2). The receptor then forms a heterodimer with a second transcription factor (retinoic acid X receptor (RXR), in the case of CAR, PXR and PPAR /H9251; aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) in the case of AhR). The resulting dimer binds to aspecific enhancer or response element upstream of the transcription start site and increases transcriptionleading eventually to more active enzyme. Examples of inducers include terpenoids and dioxins (such asTCDD) which are potent inducers of members of the CYP2 family (CYP2B and CYP2C) and CYP1 family(CYP1A and CYP1B), respectively. Compounds present in certain dietary components can induce enzymesof drug metabolism. These include flavanoids in cruciferous vegetables and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons in barbecued food. for example phenobarbitone,carbamazepine, rifampicin and isoniazid. Inducers can also be found in environmental pollutants (e.g.polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), occupational exposures (e.g. organic solvents such as acetone) andherbal remedies (e.g. St John's Wort). 5.29 As the above examples demonstrate, both inhibition and induction are selective, restricted to only certain members of a family of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes. However, particularly in the case of induction,the enzymes affected by a single agent may come from different families, e.g. CYP and GST. Hence, thenet effect will depend on the relative efficacy of induction of the respective enzymes together with thecontribution of the induced enzymes to the overall fate of the active species (i.e. between activation anddetoxication). 5.30 Both macronutrients and micronutrients in the diet can affect the activities of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, although the effects of deficiences or excess are relatively minor except in cases of severedeprivation. Neither vitamin C deficiency nor supplementation in ascorbate non-deficient subjects hasany appreciable effect on CYP-dependent activity. In ascorbate-deficient subjects, vitamin Csupplementation causes a modest increase in CYP-dependent activity. High doses of vitamin C (>1 g/ day)can cause sufficient depletion of intestinal epithelial sulphate levels to increase the bioavailability ofcompounds normally subject to pre-systemic metabolism by this route, e.g. tyramine. Pyridoxine is aprecursor in the synthesis of pyridoxal 5 -phosphate, which is an important co-factor in the enzyme dopa decarboxylase and dietary supplementation with pyridoxine appears to increase this activity (seeWilkinson, 1997). Dietary selenium can increase the activity of some primarily phase II enzymes, includingglutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferases. In contrast, dietary selenium reduces the activitiesof some forms of CYP in the rat. The extent to which selenium affects drug metabolising enzymes inhumans is not known. 5.31 While the liver is often the main organ affected, there can be important changes in the enzymes of the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract (especially of the small intestine). In rodents, there is good evidencethat dietary micronutrients can markedly affect small intestinal CYP levels: iron restriction results in arapid decline in intestinal enterocyte CYP content to levels that are undetectable and selenium deficiencyhas similar though less marked effects. Reduction of vitamin A content of the diet increases intestinalCYP-dependent activities. Conversely, dietary supplementation with vitamin A results in a decrease inintestinal CYP-dependent activities (see Kaminsky, 1991). However, the extent to which these changes 42Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentoccur in humans is not known. There can also be changes in the composition or the gut microflora. Such effects can, in turn, alter the presystemic metabolism of compounds, affecting their bioavailability or thehydrolysis of conjugates excreted via the bile and hence enterohepatic recycling, leading to changes in thetoxicokinetic profile. 5.32 Those on unusual or restricted diets, which may include vegetarians or those on low protein diets, also exhibit variability in the metabolism and/ or clearance of drugs. For example Caucasians who eat meatregularly have a significantly greater clearance and shorter plasma half-life of some compounds, e.g. theanalgesic drug antipyrine, than those who eat meat less frequently such as Asiatic vegetarians. It shouldhowever be remembered that ethnic differences may complicate this difference and the magnitude ofsuch effects is often quite small. Nutritional deficiencies, such as occur with pan-malnutrition, canincrease the hepatotoxicity of paracetamol due to altered metabolism. Dietary deficiency of calcium canlead to increased absorption of divalent metals such as lead (see review by Ballew and Bowman, 2001). 5.33 Individuals' chosen lifestyles can also influence the toxicokinetics of compounds; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke induce in liver and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in extrahepatic tissues.Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) over a period of time enhances the expression of CYP2E1 (Lewis, 1997)whereas acute ingestion results in inhibition of the enzyme. Certain recreational drugs can also affectenzymes of drug metabolism. For example, methylenedioxymethamphetamine in cannabis can also reduceenzyme activity. Various drugs, such as cimetidine, which is commonly used for treating gastric andduodenal ulcers, inhibit the activity of a number of forms of CYP. Genetic Factors Affecting Human Variability Polymorphisms 5.34 A polymorphism is a genetic variant in the DNA sequence where the less common allele appears in at least 1% of a population (Miller et al. , 2001). This usually gives rise to a variant of the corresponding protein. Proteins such as enzymes, receptors and transport proteins may all exhibit polymorphism andenzymic and transporter polymorphisms may be sources of toxicokinetic variability (receptorpolymorphisms are potential sources of toxicodynamic variability and are dealt with in paragraphs 5.58 to5.61). Polymorphisms that alter the amino acid sequence of the protein product of a gene and hence theaction of the protein are readily understood. In other cases polymorphisms may be found in the non-coding regions of genes, affecting mRNA splicing or the control of transcription. In some casespolymorphisms have been identified which do not directly affect either the primary sequence of a proteinor the control of gene expression, yet appear to be related to altered susceptibility to diseases or toxiceffects. In these cases it is necessary to consider the possibility of genetic linkage to functionalpolymorphisms, whereby the non-functional marker polymorphism is inherited in tandem with an as yetunidentified functional polymorphism. It should also be noted that the complete absence of a geneproduct (called a null genotype) may also be classified as a polymorphism. As genetic polymorphisms canaffect either the toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics of xenobiotics, an understanding of geneticpolymorphisms is important because it facilitates the process of understanding variability in responsewithin the population. It may, in some cases, be possible to identify and protect a particularly susceptible 43subpopulation. It was with this in mind that the Environmental Genome Project (based at the National Institute of Environmental Health, NC, USA) was initiated (Olden and Guthrie 2001; Olden et al. , 2001). Genotyping and phenotyping 5.35 The genotype of an individual refers to his/her genetic characteristics i.e. which alleles are carried. Phenotype refers to the biological expression of the genotype, e.g. the activity of a particular enzyme,level of a receptor or expression of a particular physical characteristic. The methodology used todetermine genotypes and phenotypes in a pharmacogenetic setting has recently been reviewed by Daly(2004); key points regarding methodologies are summarised below. 5.36 Many polymorphisms affect the amino acid sequence of a protein, although some affect the non-coding regulatory regions of genes (see paragraph 5.34). Thus, polymorphisms which affect amino acid sequencemay be detected either at the level of nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence. Polymorphisms thataffect non-coding regions may be detected at the nucleotide sequence level or by looking at mRNAexpression or protein expression. Polymorphisms that affect function may, of course, be detected bymeasuring the function (e.g. enzyme activity). Techniques that investigate the nucleotide sequence directlyare called genotyping methods whereas those that address expression and function are known asphenotyping approaches. 5.37 Traditional methods for examining polymorphisms in toxicokinetics, particularly those in xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, involve measuring enzymatic activity using diagnostic substrates. The advantage ofthis approach is that it addresses the actual function of the enzyme, but it has become less popular inrecent years because it is more labour intensive than genotyping (see below at paragraph 5.38). In addition,phenotyping requires the use of relevant tissue samples (where possible, samples from the target tissue);this has implications in terms of access to material for analysis and the willingness of volunteers toparticipate in epidemiological studies. 5.38 Genotyping involves direct examination of the altered nucleotide sequences of polymorphic variants. This approach traditionally involved cloning and sequencing the gene of interest from differentindividuals, but recent developments in technology mean that genotyping is now usually undertaken usingpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods. These include allele specific PCR and PCR followed byrestriction digest to reveal restriction fragment length polymorphisms. A powerful new approach for theidentification of novel polymorphic variants involves the identification of single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs). Nonsynonymous SNPs result in amino acid changes whereas synonymous SNPs donot lead to alterations in the amino acid sequence of the protein produced. Taking both the synonymousand non-synonymous classes into account, SNPs are found in the human genome at a frequency ofapproximately 1/1000 base pairs. 5.39 All of an individual's cells (except for red blood cells because they have no DNA) contain the same genomic DNA sequence, so the genotype can be determined by looking at any cell type. White bloodcells are usually used for this purpose since these may be obtained by relatively non-invasive methods.However, in order to look at levels of expression and function, it is important to identify and access thetissue of interest. In the case of polymorphisms which affect toxicokinetics, many of which affect hepatic 44Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentenzymes, this would entail obtaining liver tissue (i.e. by biopsy), and this is clearly impractical when looking at healthy populations. Attempts have been made to use surrogate tissues such as isolated white bloodcells to examine phenotypic variation in the expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes. Variable CYPexpression has, for example, been detected in leukopheresed white blood cells (Bernauer et al. , 2003), but it must be emphasised (and was acknowledged by the authors of this study) that this might not reflect thesituation in vivo . Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary, ie. that expression in white blood cells does not reflect that in the liver. 5.40 Another issue to be considered in examining phenotype is that the expression of a particular mRNA may not directly reflect the expression of the cognate protein. Many studies now use mRNA-based techniquessuch as TaqMan \"real time\" PCR, which is a simple and rapid method for quantifying the expression of aparticular mRNA. However, the results of these studies must be examined critically because of thepotential that differences in mRNA levels may not be reflected at the protein (and hence functional) level.For example, one study on microsomal epoxide hydrolase looked at 40 human livers (16 female, 24 male),examining variation in enzymatic activity, mRNA expression and protein expression (Hassett et al. , 1997). The results revealed an 8.4-fold variation in expression at the protein level; as expected, this correlated with themeasured enzyme activity. However, there was 49-fold variability in the expression of the correspondingmRNA and poor correlation between mRNA and protein expression. The lack of correlation was suggestedto be due to post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation such as control at the level of translation. Correlating genotype and phenotype 5.41 The use of genotyping methods to examine polymorphisms within the population is based upon the assumption that an individual's phenotype is a direct function of the genotype. It is usually the change infunction of a gene product that alters risk and this is clearly an important consideration in risk assessment.Thus, differences in genotype without alterations in phenotype usually have no impact on risk, whilstchanges in phenotype without genotypic basis can impact on vulnerability. In order to apply theassumption that phenotype is a direct function of the genotype it is necessary to demonstrate a clearcorrelation between genotype and phenotype. In fact, the relationship between genotype and phenotypeis complex and sometimes unclear. This is exemplified by paraoxonase (PON1), an enzyme that hydrolysesOP insecticides and nerve agents (Costa et al. , 2002: Mackness et al. , 2002). PON1 polymorphisms affect the rate of hydrolysis of some OPs, but currently phenotype is more predictive than genotype offunctional capacity to hydrolyse (Costa et al. , 2002: Mackness et al. , 2002) (see reviews by Costa et al., 1999; Costa et al. , 2003). With this enzyme, there are two isoforms of PON1 in humans at the relevant locus: the Arg 192(R) and the Gln192isoform (Q). The presence of two alleles within the population means that there are three possible genotypes: RR, QR, QQ. Within each genotype group, however, there is a 15fold variability in expression, with considerable overlap between different genotypes. Unfortunately PON1activity is very dependent on reaction conditions in the enzyme assay (O'Leary et al. , 2005). These factors mean that the identification of a susceptible population cannot be achieved by looking at the genotypein isolation. PON1 has roles in metabolism independent of OPs. PON1 polymorphisms are associated withdifferences in the prevalence of adverse outcomes independent of the OP exposure, including coronaryheart disease (Shih et al. , 2002). This might confound some of the studies in this area. 45Polymorphic xenobiotic metabolising enzymes 5.42 Polymorphisms exist among both Phase I and Phase II xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XMEs). When predicting the consequences of variation in xenobiotic metabolism for susceptibility to toxicity, it isimportant to understand the metabolic pathways involved and to identify the actual toxic agent. If theparent compound is the toxic agent, then the lower end of the activity range represents a risk factor sincethe population below the median is at greater risk, whereas if the metabolite is the toxic agent, the topend of the variability range may be at greater risk. The adverse impact of polymorphisms of XMEs thataffect metabolism will also depend on how critical the enzyme is in either the bioactivation or in theoverall elimination of the compound, and also whether alternative pathways exist. 5.43 Amongst the earliest known CYP polymorphisms is that associated with debrisoquine, an agent used in the treatment of hypertension. Most humans are able to hydroxylate this drug, but about 5-10% of theCaucasian population excrete the drug virtually unchanged and are termed \"poor metabolisers\" (Gonzalezand Nebert, 1990). These individuals will have higher circulating levels of the active drug when prescribeda clinical dose of debrisoquine and will be more prone to adverse reactions from this or other drugscatalysed by CYP2D6. XME polymorphisms may affect a number of and summarised inAppendix 2. 5.44 The majority of studies on polymorphic variation and risk of toxicity or disease have, for scientific and resource reasons, concentrated on one or two key genes. However, in practice, susceptibility to toxicagents almost always involves many factors. Redundancy within xenobiotic metabolising pathways meansthat, if the activity of one enzyme is reduced, potential toxic agents may still be eliminated by otherpathways. For example, if the polymorphic pathway contributes 50% to overall elimination, evencomplete deletion of this pathway would result in only a two-fold decrease in clearance. These otherpathways may compensate for the loss of activity, or may lead to the generation of a reactive intermediatewith enhanced toxic effects. For example, in smokers, various CYPs, GSTM, GSTT, GSTP, NAT1 and NAT2may exert combined effects on DNA adduct formation and cancer susceptibility. The epidemiologicalstudies required in order to understand the roles of all the possible polymorphic variants of theseenzymes would need to be enormous. A number of these polymorphisms appear to have some impacton cancer susceptibility (see review by Thier et al. , 2003), although their impact on susceptibility to acute toxic effects is often less well understood. Cancer susceptibility 5.45 An example that illustrates the role of polymorphic XME in cancer susceptibility is bladder cancer induction by exposure to aromatic amines. Carcinogenic aromatic amines are subject to acetylation by N-acetyltransferases NAT1 and NAT2. A number of methods are available for the determination of NAT2genotype by PCR, and this has facilitated epidemiological analysis of the NAT2 polymorphism in bladdercancer. Individuals may be classified as either fast or slow acetylators depending on which alleles of NAT2they carry, and epidemiological analysis has suggested that slow acetylators have an increased risk ofbladder cancer. It is believed that the increased susceptibility of these individuals is due to decreased 46Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentdetoxification of aromatic amines by N-acetylation. A recent meta-analysis considering 2000 cases and 3000 controls indicated that the slow acetylator phenotype causes an increase in risk of ~40% withexposure to aromatic amines (reviewed in Brennan, 2002). This increased risk in slow acetylators of lessthan 2-fold is adequately covered by the 10-fold uncertainty factor that is commonly used to allow forvariability in the human population (assuming that a 2-fold difference in response to the same level ofexposure indicates a 2-fold difference in sensitivity). 5.46 The role of NAT2 should not be considered in isolation, since susceptibility to bladder cancer is also modulated by interaction with other xenobiotic metabolising enzymes. The role of the other NAT isozyme(NAT1) is poorly understood: this isozyme, which is also polymorphic, is expressed in the urothelium andhas the capacity to metabolise aromatic amines, but it is as yet unclear what the consequences of thispolymorphism are for bladder cancer susceptibility. Part of the problem in terms of understanding NAT1and its effects on susceptibility is that this gene is both genetically polymorphic (having at least 26 allelicvariants) and subject to regulation by post-translational mechanisms, with the result that thegenotype/phenotype correlation for this gene is difficult to classify (Rodrigues-Lima and Dupret 2004).Furthermore, individuals who have high CYP1A2 activity in combination with the slow acetylatorphenotype are thought to have elevated risk of bladder cancer due to rapid activation and slowdetoxification of aromatic amines, and the GSTM1*0 null genotype further increases bladder cancer risk in slow acetylators. 5.47 Occupational exposure to aromatic amines, while being one of the better understood examples of cancer risk factors modulated by polymorphisms in XME, is by no means the only example. Other carcinogens towhich workers are occupationally exposed, such as styrene, also undergo polymorphic metabolicactivation, the rate of which is modulated by the genotype of the individual, to form genotoxic metabolites(Teixeira et al. , 2004). Nevertheless, the extent to which this influences risk has yet to be determined (there is no good evidence that styrene is a human carcinogen). It has been suggested that genotyping should beused to evaluate the individual genetic susceptibility of exposed populations; however, given that potentialsusceptibility is often mediated by a number of polymorphic genes (in the case of styrene, GSTP1, GSTM1and CYP2E1) it will prove difficult, if not impossible, to predict susceptibility on an individual basis.Furthermore, the role of the various implicated enzymes must be clarified. One recent study states that theincidence of chromosomal aberrations in workers exposed to benzene is influenced by a subset of XMEgenotypes including GSTM1 et al. , 2004); however, it is difficult to understand, for example, how NAT2 genotype can affect susceptibility to benzene given that benzene lacks an amine moiety, unless there is some as yetunidentified endogenous substrate for NAT2 that represents a risk factor! Susceptibility to the toxicity of industrial chemicals 5.48 Relatively few well-characterised examples of acute toxicity affected by polymorphic XMEs exist in the literature. One of the best to date is that of acrylonitrile, an industrial solvent which, in addition to beingcarcinogenic, is acutely toxic. There is significant inter- and intraspecies variability in response to the acutetoxicity of acrylonitrile (Thier et al. , 2001). Acrylonitrile is known to be metabolised via oxidative and reductive routes, mediated by CYP2E1 and glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) respectively. The reductiveroute, which leads to the excretion of mercapturic acid in the urine, is the primary detoxification pathway 47whereas the oxidative route, generating glycidonitrile and cyanide, is thought to mediate the carcinogenic and acute toxic effects of acrylonitrile. The role of polymorphisms in susceptibility to acrylonitrilepoisoning is incompletely understood, but studies on individual cases of acrylonitrile intoxication haveprovided some clues. An anecdotal report of the effects of acute exposure to high levels of acrylonitrilein two individuals, one of whom was classified as a \"non-conjugator\" suggested that levels of acrylonitrilein blood were higher in the non-conjugator as was the level hydrocyanic acid (Leng and Lewalter 2002). Arecent series of studies has addressed 59 individuals working with acrylonitrile within acceptableworkplace exposure levels (3 ppm under German regulations) (Thier et al. , 2001). The role of polymorphic xenobiotic metabolism in the response to acrylonitrile Val 104variant of GSTP1 were found to have an increased level of N-(cyanoethyl) valine adducts compared with those whohad two Ile 104(wild type) alleles. This was thought to be due to altered affinity of the enzyme for electrophilic substrates. Further studies on the same individuals examined the role of CYP2E1 inacrylonitrile toxicity (Thier et al. , 2002). It is known that humans have a higher level of CYP2E1-mediated oxidative metabolism of acrylonitrile than rodents, suggesting that humans may have increasedsusceptibility to acrylonitrile toxicity compared with rodents. By using PCR-RFLP (polymerase chainreaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism) to look for 7 polymorphic variants of CYP2E1 as wellas measuring levels of N-(cyanoethyl)valine in relation to acrylonitrile exposure, the authors identified atrend towards higher adduct levels in individuals with at least one copy of the A316G variant of CYP2E1,which is associated with lower levels of oxidative metabolism. The higher adduct level detected in theseindividuals may reflect the fact that more of the acrylonitrile is going via the reductive pathway and hencethat these individuals are protected against acrylonitrile toxicity. Although this study was too small to beconclusive, the combined results of the studies discussed above suggest that individuals carrying the Val 104 variant of GSTP1 along with the A to G316variant of CYP2E1 may be at reduced risk from the acute toxicity of acrylonitrile. Environmental exposure. 5.49 Polymorphisms may affect susceptibility to ingested environmental exposures due to altered uptake or clearance of toxicants from air, drinking water or food. Recreational drugs 5.50 Polymorphisms in important enzyme systems may affect susceptibility to the adverse effects of common lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption. Two enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehydedehydrogenase (ALDH) are involved in susceptibility to the toxic and addictive effects of alcoholconsumption. Individuals who carry the ALDH2*2 allele, which encodes an inactive form of ALDH,develop high peripheral blood acetaldehyde concentrations following alcohol consumption. Theaccumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood induces unpleasant effects that encourage the individual toconsume less alcohol than average, and they are therefore less likely to abuse alcohol or becomealcoholics. The activity of ALDH in the human brain is reduced in chronic exposure to alcohol causingincreased acetaldehyde concentrations in the brain upon exposure to alcohol (likely to be more severe inindividuals with the ALDH2*2 allele). It has been postulated that acetaldehyde and alcohol might actsynergistically affecting some of the the multiple neuropharmacological and behavioural effects ofethanol in chronic alcohol abusers, with acetaldehyde reinforcing the hypnotic and amnesic effects 48Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment(Quertemont 2004; Quertemont and Tambour 2004). Interestingly, Mexican American populations (which have an increased statistical risk of alcoholism) have an extremely low allele frequency of the ALDH2*2allele, in addition to a low frequency of ADH1B*2 and a high frequency of ADH1C*2 and CYP2E1c2 alleles(Konishi et al. , 2004). 5.51 Attempts have been made to use information of this kind to model the complex hereditary control of ADH, taking into account polygenic control and polymorphisms at two allelic sites. Development of aPBPK model (Sultatos et al. , 2004) has indicated that, while peak blood levels and time to peak are only marginally affected by ADH genotype, the AUC of the ethanol blood decay curve was very sensitive togenotype. The predicted AUC for any genotype including the ADH1B*2 (high activity) allele was muchsmaller than those for any genotype without this allele. The simulations undertaken showed thatindividual variability in alcohol disposition is affected by ADH and that the degree of variability predictedwas a function of dose. 5.52 Furthermore, chronic alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract (e.g. oesophageal) cancer. This appears to be due to acetaldehyde generated when ethanol ismetabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and heavy drinkers who are homozygous for the ADH1C*1(high activity) allele are predisposed to develop upper aerodigestive tract cancer, possibly due to elevatedsalivary acetaldehyde levels following alcohol consumption (Visapaa et al. , 2004). Polymorphic xenobiotic transporters 5.53 Xenobiotic transporters play a key role in toxicokinetics because they influence the oral bioavailability, distribution and excretion of xenobiotics (Fromm 2004). The recent discovery of the importance oftransporters, membrane proteins which mediate the cellular uptake and efflux of molecules, in controllingchemical transfer across lipid membranes is leading to an increasing awareness of the potential forinteractions at such sites. As an example, a number of compounds can inhibit P-glycoprotein, leading toan accumulation of ligands for this efflux transporter in certain cell types. As research in this areaprogresses, the importance and extent of this type of interaction will become more apparent. 5.54 There is a marked degree of interindividual variation in the expression of the xenobiotic transporter protein P-glycoprotein (MDR1) in the small intestine and liver, and furthermore there is polymorphicvariation in the sequence of the MDR1 gene. By the beginning of 2004, 29 SNPs had been identified in theMDR1 gene (Marzolini et al. , 2004a). A silent mutation (C3435T) is thought to be associated with low levels of protein expression, while two variants (G2677T / A) result in alterations to the amino acid sequence ofthe gene (Ala-Ser and Ala-Thr at amino acid 893). However, the functional significance of these amino acidvariants is unclear. 5.55 The role of MDR1 polymorphisms in responsiveness to xenobiotics remains to be elucidated (Eichelbaum et al. , 2004), although there is some evidence that the oral bioavailability of digoxin is increased in individuals with the C3435T allele. It has been suggested that the 3435T allele is associated withsusceptibility to Parkinson's disease in pesticide-exposed individuals, although this hypothesis is basedupon two major assumptions: (i) that pesticides are substrates for MDR1 and (ii) that pesticide exposuredoes, indeed, cause Parkinson's disease (Drozdzik et al. , 2003). Meta-analysis of case control studies tends 49to support the idea that pesticide exposure is associated with the development of Parkinson's disease, but this is by no means proven (Paolini et al. , 2004). Polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene are associated with marked species and strain differences in sensitivity to the toxicity of the avermectin group of veterinarydrugs and pesticides (e.g. ivermectin). Species/ strains affected include the CF-1 mouse, the collie dog andmurray grey cattle. 5.56 The importance of the MRP2 transporter in xenobiotic handling is illustrated by the rare autosomal recessive disorder Dubin-Johnson syndrome, in which the biliary excretion of conjugated anions fromPhase II metabolism is diminished leading to mild conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and the formation ofmelanin-like deposits in the liver. This is too rare to be classified as a polymorphism, but a number of otherSNPs have recently been identified in the MRP2 gene and their functional consequences are underinvestigation (Gerloff 2004). 5.57 Other drug transporters, including the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and organic cation transporter (OCT), have also been shown to be polymorphic 2004; Marzolini et al. , 2004b). OATP is localised in the liver, kidney, brain and intestine. Individuals with a variant form of OATP-C (OATP-C*15,Asp 130Ala174) exhibit reduced total and non-renal clearance of the drug pravastatin compared with individuals homozygous for the OATP-C*1b (Asp130Val174) allele. The OATP-A transporter, also polymorphic, is localised in the capillary endothelial cells of the brain and may therefore play a role in theCNS limiting the uptake and toxicity of drugs and toxicants. Similarly, polymorphisms have been identifiedin the OCT1 transporter, which mediates hepatic uptake cationic xenobiotics thus Receptor polymorphisms affecting toxicokinetics 5.58 One polymorphic receptor whose effects on a specific toxic response have been studied in detail is the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which appears to affect the toxicokinetics of lead. The VDR polymorphism maybe detected by a BsmI RFLP; the two alleles are identified as B and b, and individuals are characterised as BB, Bb or bb. The BB genotype is found in 7 - 32% of Caucasians but only 1 - 3% of Asians, and thisgenotype is associated with a reduction in bone mineral density. The VDR is associated with calciumabsorption through the gut and into calcium-rich tissues such as bone, and studies suggest that it mayaffect lead handling at these sites as well (Onalaja and Claudio 2000). 5.59 The VDR genotype of an individual is characterised as BB, Bb bb. Subjects who carry the VDR B allele (BB or Bb) have larger increases in tibial lead concentration with increasing age than bb homozygotes(Schwartz et al. , 2000a; Schwartz et al. , 2000b). 5.60 Lead also has effects on blood pressure in exposed individuals. In one study, battery workers with the VDR BB or Bb genotypes had higher mean blood lead levels than did bb homozygotes, and this was associatedwith higher systolic blood pressure when blood lead levels exceeded 40 /H9262g/ dL (Ye et al. , 2003). Lead workers with at least one B allele had systolic blood pressure 2.7 - 3.7 mm Hg higher than that of bbhomozygotes. The B allele was also associated with clinical hypertension with an odds ratio of 2 (Lee et al., 2001). 50Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment5.61 These epidemiological observations are interesting, but the mechanisms involved and their relation to risk are unclear. The functional significance of the BB allele is not obvious, since it is not a coding or splicingvariant. One possibility is that this polymorphism itself has no functional significance but is in linkagedisequilibrium with an as yet unidentified \"true\" risk allele. Sex 5.62 Sex-dependent differences in metabolism have been reported for some therapeutic drugs in humans but only minor sex-related differences in foreign compound metabolism have been reported (see below).More pronounced sex differences occur in rats than other laboratory species, and there are sexualdimorphisms in xenobiotic metabolism (Mugford and Kedderis, 1998). Female rats have 10-30% less totalhepatic CYP enzymes compared with male rats, and female rats metabolise many drugs and compoundsmore slowly than do male rats. The levels of CYP3A in rats are dependent on the sex hormoneenvironment of liver cells, with much higher activity in males than in females; the levels in males arereduced by castration and the activity in females is increased by the administration of testosterone.CYP3A enzymes are the major hepatic and intestinal forms of CYP in humans and are responsible for themetabolism of numerous therapeutic drugs and other xenobiotics; a sex-dependent difference is not seenin humans, although the database is inconsistent (Tanaka, 1999; Ghandi et al. , 2004). 5.63 Several members of the CYP2C sub-family are sex-specific in the rat, in contrast to the human forms of CYP2C (Blaisdell et al. , 1998). CYP2C11 (only expressed in male rats) is responsible for 2 /H9251- and 16 /H9251- hydroxylation of testosterone and progesterone, whereas CYP2C12 (only expressed in female rats) isinvolved in female-specific hepatic 15 /H9252-hydroxylation of C21 steroids 1993). This suggests that xenobiotics metabolised by CYP2C11 in male rats may be metabolised more slowly in female rats. 5.64 Differences in the metabolism of xenobiotics are less common in humans, but recent findings suggest that drug kinetics in women can differ from those in men. Where statistically significant sex differences havebeen reported for humans they are not usually more than 2-fold in magnitude, and the differences arereduced if the data are expressed on a body weight basis (Schwartz, 2003). Toxicokinetic differencesbetween men and women may arise from differences in body weight and composition, plasma volume,gastric emptying rate, plasma protein levels, drug metabolizing activity, drug transporter function (Morriset al. , 2003), and excretion activity (Ghandi et al. , 2004). Conclusions on Genetic Polymorphisms in Xenobiotic Metabolising Enzymes 5.65 The various re-sequencing programmes in the wake of completion of the human genome project have demonstrated that the human genome is highly polymorphic. On average, 1/1000 base pairs differsbetween any two individuals. These are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SNPconsortia have now identified several million SNPs. Hence, the question is no longer whether a given geneis polymorphic, but rather what are the consequences of the various polymorphisms identified in thegene. Technology has now reached the stage where it is relatively easy to determine the genotype formultiple polymorphisms whereas establishing the functional consequence of a polymorphism can oftenbe much more difficult. This has led to the application of SNPs in genetic association studies long beforethe functional implications of the polymorphisms are known. Whilst there are good reasons for doing this 51in studies of genetics, there are less sound reasons for doing it in a study of gene-environment interactions in toxicology, where unfounded inferences are likely to be drawn. 5.66 More problematic is the increasing ability to genotype for many alleles at multiple loci. Hence, perhaps six CYPs, two NATs, three GSTs and various other enzymes such as sulphotransferases (SULTs) andUDPGTs, together with some of the transporters (e.g. MDR1 and MRP2) and regulatory proteins such asAhR and CAR, are regularly genotyped in such studies. Some of the polymorphisms will have knownfunctional consequences but others will be equivocal, unknown, or even silent. Study design will often beof insufficient power to support all of the comparisons undertaken, with only a small number of eachcombination of genotypes per exposure group. The multiplicity of comparisons leads to an increasedprobability of a statistically significant result occurring by chance, particularly when the analysis givingsuch a result is a consequence of post-hoc considerations. In general, the literature on associationsbetween genotype for XMEs and risk from environmental chemicals has usually resulted in low andinconsistent relative risks (d'Errico et al. , 1999). 5.67 There is no doubt that the ability to analyse populations for many polymorphisms will lead to greater insight into genetic factors responsible for susceptibility to various diseases. However, in considering theimplications of genetic polymorphisms in risk assessment there are a number of points that need to beconsidered: /circle6Genetic heterogeneity does not represent a new form of variation within the population. It has alwaysexisted as part of the underlying differences between individuals. What is now becoming possible is toexplain some of that variation in terms of known genetic polymorphisms. /circle6The extent of interindividual variability has been explored empirically on a number of occasions. Whilstnot ideal (of necessity such studies have almost always been based on pharmaceuticals), these studieshave established that the default uncertainty factor (see Chapter 3) is generally appropriate. Hencegenetic variability must represent a component of this. /circle6A genetically-determined difference in metabolism does not necessarily translate into a similardifference in risk. Many other factors can contribute to variability and these are unlikely to all act in thesame direction. This has the effect of dampening the net effect of the genotypic separation of groupson the basis of metabolic activity. Many factors can influence variability in the toxic response throughan effect on the toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, exposure patterns or subtle psychological factors.Sometimes one factor can dominate, but often random variability in other factors will tend to reducethe clear separation between sub-groups classified on the basis of a single variable. Thus geneticepidemiology studies to date have all indicated odds ratios of less than 2 for susceptibility to toxicagents, supporting the use of the present uncertainty factors. 52Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment/circle6Phenotypic differences in the activity of XMEs between individuals are often characterised in well defined populations of subjects, focusing only on the pathway of interest. Whilst one can oftendemonstrate a 10-fold or greater difference between groups, this is frequently not reflected in acomparable difference in the kinetics of the parent, because of competing pathways. Hence, whilstthere are some examples of striking differences in kinetics due to genetic factors, for the majority ofcompounds such is not the case. /circle6One application of such information on genetic differences is to replace a component of theuncertainty factor with a compound specific adjustment factor. Information on the consequences ofgenetic differences may be used to derive chemical specific adjustment factors. Human variability couldbe modelled by a distribution (usually log-normal) and a percentile of the distribution could beselected (ie. use of a completely probablistic approach) and used for the derivation of health-basedguidelines. Before undertaking such an exercise it will be important to determine whether this isjustified in view of probabilistic estimates of the proportion of the population protected by thisapproach. For example, applying the maximum separation for kinetics, on the basis of a geneticpolymorphism, together with assuming a default (presumably) maximum difference for dynamics mightindicate that a large proportion of the population would be inadequately protected. However, on aprobabilistic basis, the chance of someone being at the extremes of susceptibility from bothtoxicokinetic and toxicodynamic perspectives or at opposite extremes of these perspectives Is small.None-the-less it is possible that some people might not be adequately protected by currentapproaches, and there is a need to consider how such variability should be characterised and dealt within the risk assessment. It is also noteworthy that this problem applies not only to variability in kineticsand dynamics: it is a general problem that also relates to other parameters in which there is variabilitywithin the human population (eg. consumption data). 5.68 Research findings regarding the impact of genetic polymorphisms on susceptibility to the acute and chronic toxic effects of chemicals should be monitored systematically with a view to determiningwhether particular susceptible groups may be identified and protected, thus reducing uncertainty withregard to interindividual variation within the human population. 536.1 Toxicodynamics can be defined as the process of interaction of chemical substances with target sites and the subsequent events leading to adverse effects (WHO, 1994). An important source of inter-individualvariability is genetic, but variability can also result from physiological factors and environmental factors.Once a chemical has entered the body, it can interact with one or more components of the body, forexample, enzymes, DNA or receptors, to produce a toxicological or pharmacological effect. Anunderstanding of molecular mechanisms is a great aid to understanding toxicodynamics and the ability toevaluate relevant molecular targets from humans and animals in isolation is a major advantage of in vitro approaches. Many factors can influence how the body reacts to chemicals. Individuals may reactdifferently to the same chemical in both quantitative terms, for example due to differences in sensitivity,or in qualitative terms due to anatomical and physiological differences, such as in males compared tofemales, or due to other inter-individual differences such as atopy (immune sensitivity). Large moleculessuch as peptides that target the immune system of one species may show a very marked inter-speciesvariation, but this is not the case for chemicals in general. Species Differences 6.2 The relevance of effects detected in animals to humans and species differences in sensitivity of the molecular target or response must be considered. When considering toxicodynamic variability, knowledgeof the mechanism of toxicity (including the site of action and active chemical entity) can allow the riskassessment to take into account known differences in target organ susceptibility. The presence andactivity of protective mechanisms such as glutathione conjugation can influence the sensitivity of thetarget to the active entity. 6.3 The relevance to humans of the mechanism of toxicity in a test species depends on the presence and importance of the critical target in human cells or tissues. The mechanism of toxicity for a particular effectmay not be relevant to humans, allowing this effect to be discounted in the risk assessment. For example,d-limonene causes kidney tumours in male rats via a mechanism that involves /H9251-2-u-globulin, which is specific to the male rat and is not found in female rats, which do not develop tumours, or in humans.Therefore the renal carcinogenicity of d-limonene in male rats is not relevant to humans (IARC 1999). 6.4 Sometimes it is not possible to discount completely an effect detected in animals that appears to have little relevance to humans, and the risk assessment should take account of this uncertainty. An exampleis the antioxidant food additive butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320), which can induce forestomachtumours in rats. It might be assumed that this effect could be discounted because humans do not have aforestomach. However the morphology of the rat forestomach mucosa is similar to that of the lower partof the oesophagus in humans so that the possibility of effects in the oesophagus needs to be considered.Such consideration needs to take into account the fact that BHA is a nongenotoxic carcinogen and thepattern of exposure of the respective tissues in rats and humans will be very different (Kroes and Wester,1986; COT 1992). 6.5 In most cases where there are clear differences in the in vivo response between animal species, it is not possible to determine whether the differences are due to toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics. In such casesthe sensitivity of humans compared with animals species cannot be measured directly, although insightsmay be possible from observational epidemiology studies, or from studies in human volunteers using6 Sources of Variability in Toxicodynamics 54Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentsensitive, mild and reversible biomarkers of response (Renwick and Walton, 2001) or from in vitro studies. Recent work by the Institute of Life Sciences International (ILSI), the International Programme on ChemicalSafety (IPCS) and others has led to the formalisation of the process of considering the qualitative andquantitative concordance between findings in experimental animals and in humans (Barton et al. , 2006; Carmicheal et al. , 2006; Cooper et al. , 2006; Doe et al. , 2006). This work is most advanced for carcinogens but is now being extended to non-cancer endpoints (Cohen et al. , 2004). Physiological Factors 6.6 Physiological factors including age and sex can result in toxicodynamic variability in both humans and animals. An example of variability in toxicodynamics due to physiological factors is the differencebetween adult humans and children in the reaction to phenobarbital. In adults phenobarbital acts as asedative, whereas in some children it induces a hyperactive response. It is possible that this paradoxicalresponse to phenobarbital is due to differences between adults and children in receptor-drug interactions(Roberts, 1992). Environmental, Social and Dietary Factors 6.7 The effects of environmental factors on toxicodynamics have been less well studied than those on toxicokinetics. In part, this is because it can often be very difficult to distinguish between effects ontoxicodynamics and those on toxicokinetics. An exception is the effect of therapeutic drugs, and for thisreason many of the examples, which show the potential for the environment to contribute to variabilityin toxicodynamics, relate to drug actions. By their nature, drugs are designed to produce apharmacodynamic response and there are a number of examples of their interaction with the effects ofother drugs. There are fewer examples of such effects involving other chemicals. The issue of interactionsbetween different chemicals to give additive or synergistic effects on their combined toxicity has beenconsidered in detail by the COT report \"Risk Assessment of Mixtures of Pesticides and Similar Substances(COT, 2002b) and in the COT Annual Report for 2004 (COT, 2004c). A clear example is the effect of non-selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant drugs on the response to tyramine,which is present in foodstuffs such as cheese, and which increases blood pressure if its metabolism isinhibited by the antidepressant. 6.8 Where the adverse effects of toxic substances are similar to those of physiological stressors, an interaction may be expected. Thus the additional metabolic demand within the auditory systemgenerated by noise can enhance the auditory system damage produced by exposure to high doses ofototoxic antibiotics, carbon monoxide, or dinitrobenzene, even though the noise exposure may itself bebelow the threshold for producing hearing loss (Ray, 1997). Axons repairing after damage have greaterphysiological demands and are similarly more sensitive to neurotoxic chemicals than normal. Suchphysiological-toxicological interactions are analogous to the greater effect of disturbed calciumhomeostasis during calcium deficiency (see section on polymorphic receptors), and similarly would onlybe expected to be significant when the physiological systems were stressed beyond their normal limits. 6.9 Nutritional status and other lifestyle factors can affect toxicodynamics. Changes in diet can cause increases and decreases in the prevalences of different types of tumours occurring in laboratory animals. 55Variation in the results of different studies that is caused by dietary factors could be eliminated by standardising the diet used in toxicological studies. People habituated to opiate analgesics such asmorphine have been known to tolerate up to 50 times the normal analgesic dose of that drug. Thisresponse is not due to a down-regulation of the opiate receptors or an increased metabolism ofmorphine. Instead the tolerance is due to an adaptive up-regulation of adenylate cyclase (produces cAMPfrom ATP) which counteracts the depression of this enzyme by the opiate receptors (Rang et al. , 1999). There is increasing evidence for receptor cross-talk within and between families. Hence, the arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) competes for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahreceptor and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF /H9251). Ligands for the AhR may thus modify the response to compounds inducing hypoxia. Similarly, there is cross-talk between the oestrogen receptor(ER) and AhR. Genetic Factors 6.10 Toxicodynamic variability due to genetic factors arises where there is more than one form of a target (receptor or enzyme) (i.e. polymorphisms - see above). For example depending on the genotype, twoforms of the same receptor may be expressed by different individuals, with one form having a higheraffinity for a toxic chemical. Individuals who express one form of the receptor may be more susceptibleto the toxic chemical than individuals expressing the other form. An example of variability in receptors isthat brought about by polymorphisms of the AhR (Wong et al. , 2001) (see below). An example of an enzyme that is important in target organ susceptibility to a toxicant and exhibits polymorphism is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which protects haemoglobin in red blood cells from the oxidative damagecaused by ozone, nitrogen dioxide, certain drugs and certain plants, notably broad beans. Individuals withlow activity of this enzyme will be more susceptible to this oxidative damage (Amoruso et al. , 1986). There is a substantial literature on the role of polymorphisms in genes involved directly or indirectly in DNArepair in cancer susceptibility. However, the extent to which such genetic variability contributes to cancerrisk from environmental chemicals is not known. A more recent example is that of abacavir, a nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus(HIV). Subjects with the polymorphic variant HLA-B57 are much more likely to develop a hypersensitivityreaction after administration of this drug (reviewed in Hosford et al. , 2004) Polymorphic receptors 6.11 Understanding of the role of receptor polymorphisms in determining susceptibility to toxic agents is much less complete than is the case with polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, and the literaturecontains few solid data regarding the role of receptor polymorphisms in toxicity. There are a number ofreasons for this; in particular, genotype-phenotype correlations are very difficult to determine forreceptors because viable intact cell systems are required for analysis. However, a number of attempts hasrecently been made to address this area; the methods used to date include in vitro induction in human lymphocytes, recombinant systems and population studies. The following section attempts to summarisethe current state of play, taking a \"broad brush\" approach and looking at the roles of receptors in a rangeof phenomena including susceptibility to adverse effects such as addiction as well as acute and chronictoxicity. 56Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment6.12 Polymorphic receptors are much less likely to be phenotypically expressed than polymorphic enzymes, as it is more likely that there will be compensatory mechanisms to bypass non-functioning enzymes. The aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR or Ah receptor) 6.13 One of the most important receptors involved in the response to toxicants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and PCBs is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). This receptor mediates the pleiotropic response to planar aromatic compounds, including the induction of CYP1A1, and probably also the carcinogenic response to thesecompounds. It has been known for many years that the AhR in mice is polymorphic, and that the form inC57BL/6 mice is highly inducible whereas that in DBA/2 mice is resistant to induction. Polymorphismshave recently been identified in the coding region of the human AhR. These are clustered in exon 10, thetransactivation domain, with polymorphism also existing in the 5' regulatory region of the gene (Harper et al., 2002). 6.14 Investigation of 91 Caucasian individuals has revealed seven mutations in the AhR, although expression studies in peripheral lymphocytes did not indicate any significant differences in AhR expression levelsbetween the different forms. It has been postulated that variants which markedly alter AhR expressionlevels could be incompatible with survival due to the role that AhR plays in cell cycle regulation and asthe affected individuals would be killed such effects would not be detected (Racky et al. , 2004). 6.15 Studies in placental tissue have indicated that the affinity of the AhR for TCDD varies by at least 10 fold between individuals; however, this cannot be explained by reference to the polymorphisms which havebeen identified to date. Furthermore, in vitro induction of CYP1A1 exhibits a heterogeneous distribution; it is unclear whether this is due to polymorphisms in the AhR or CYP1A1 itself. 6.16 The effects of the AhR polymorphism on susceptibility to toxins is unclear; its significance with regard to chloracne, the best understood toxic response to dioxin in humans, has not yet been clarified (Harper et al., 2002). Furthermore, despite intensive research over many years it is still unclear whether dioxin is actually carcinogenic to humans (COC, 2001), l et al. one what the role of the AhR in such an effect might be. Studies in China have failed to reveal any association between AhR polymorphisms and bladder cancersusceptibility, either in benzidine exposed workers or in individuals with no record of occupationalexposure (Zhang et al. , 2002). Furthermore, epidemiological studies on AhR polymorphisms and lung cancer have indicated no clear effect with regard to either CYP1A1 inducibility, lung cancer incidence orhistological type (Cauchi et al. , 2001). However, one rare combination of AhR variants (Lys 554/Ile570) abrogates CYP1A1 induction altogether, and theoretically this be associated with resistance topolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced carcinogenesis. 6.17 Further confusion is generated by the fact that the Ah-receptor nuclear translocase (ARNT) and the al. , 2002; Cauchi et al., 2003). Polymorphisms in the ARNT2 gene have been evaluated in relation to orofacial clefting, but were not found to be associated with either cleft lip or cleft palate (Barrow et al. , 2002). One recent study identified four polymorphisms within the AhRR gene, but examination of 171 lung cancer patients and 164controls did not indicate any key role of the AhRR in either CYP1A1 inducibility or lung cancer 57susceptibility in the population tested (Cauchi et al. , 2003). However, in a reproductive toxicity setting the Pro-Ala mutation at amino acid residue 185 of the AhRR has been linked to the development ofmicropenis, possibly because it is associated with an increase in susceptibility to the undermasculinisingeffects of dioxin exposure in utero (Fujita et al. , 2002). This finding should be treated with caution, though, because the functional effect of the Pro-Ala alteration on the AhRR protein was not evaluated. Hormone and neurotransmitter receptors 6.18 Although relatively little is known concerning the impact of receptor polymorphisms on toxic responses, some information about polymorphic receptors and xenobiotic responses can be gleaned from examiningthe pharmacology literature. 6.19 Polymorphisms have recently been identified in the androgen receptor (Oettel 2003). Three polymorphisms have been identified to date: G1733A, (GGC) nand (CAG) n. The last variant, which encodes a variable length polyglutamine repeat in the 5' end of the coding region of the first exon (CAG) 10-35, has been studied in some detail. In normal men the repeat length is 14-33; the length of the repeat sequenceis inversely proportional to the transactivation activity of the androgen receptor and may be associatedwith androgen insensitivity syndromes. Interestingly, differences in repeat length do not seem to beassociated with differences in serum testosterone levels. The consequences in terms of testosteronetoxicity remain to be elucidated, but this polymorphism has implications in terms of both clinicalandrogen treatments and the possible consequences of lifestyle choices such as the abuse of anabolicsteroids. 6.20 Adrenoceptors have been shown to exhibit a number of SNPs, some of which alter the signalling properties of the receptors or affect their rate of desensitisation (Lohse 2004). In the /H92521-adrenoreceptor there is a Ser-Gly polymorphism at amino acid 49 in the extracellular N-terminus and an Arg-Glypolymorphism at amino acid 389 in the fourth intracellular loop, which participates in G-protein coupling.In the /H92522 receptor there is a rare Thr-Ile polymorphism at amino acid 164 which reduces the efficiency of signalling and two polymorphisms in the N-terminus which affect agonist-induced down regulation.Finally, in the /H92512C adrenoceptor there is a deletion in the third intracellular loop which causes impaired signalling and seems to be associated with increased frequency/ severity of heart failure. The role ofadrenoceptor polymorphisms in xenobiotic responses remains to be clarified, although it has been shownthat the Arg 389variant is more responsive to /H9252-blockers than the Gly389form. The chronic response to treatment of heart failure may also be better in individuals carrying the Arg389variant. Polymorphic receptors and neurological disease 6.21 Polymorphic receptors may play a role in the response to neurotoxicants. One important group of polymorphic receptors comprises the ligand-gated ion channels, which mediate the influx into cells ofeither cations or anions in response to excitatory or inhibitory stimuli. Excitatory signals are mediated byneurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, whereas inhibitory signals are mediated by glycine or/H9253-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the case of acetylcholine, therefore, reduced receptor activity tends to lead to an attenuated response. Conversely, in the case of inhibitory receptors such as the glycine and GABAreceptors, reduction in the activity of the receptor can lead to an excessive or exaggerated response tostimuli because the inhibitory effect of receptor activation has been lost. A good example of this is a 58Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentgenetic disorder, hyperekplexia (\"startle disease\") in which sufferers exhibit an extreme response to alarming stimuli such as loud noises. This disease seems to be associated with mutations at codon 271 and 244 of the/H92511 subunit of the glycine receptor, and in one case with complete deletion of exons 1-6. Although genetic hyperekplexia is a familial disorder rather than a toxic response, it is of interest in the present contextbecause its effects are very similar to those seen in cases of strychnine poisoning (Vafa and Schofield 1998). 6.22 Neurotransmitter receptor systems have been implicated in the risk of various addictive responses. In European Americans, for example, a series of markers in the middle and 3' end of the GABA Areceptor gene has been linked to alcohol dependency (Covault et al. , 2004). Interestingly, a mutation in the GABAA receptor ( /H92523 Arg-His at amino acid 192) has also been linked to insomnia, possibly mediated via decreased GABAergic inhibition leading to hyperactivity; however, the prevalence of this mutation is unknown so itmay not fall within the category of a true polymorphism (incidence >1%) (Buhr et al. , 2002). 6.23 Polymorphisms in both the dopamine D4 receptor (120-bp VNTR polymorphism) and the catechol-O- methyltransferase enzyme (high activity Val 158variant) have been implicated in the risk of becoming a methamphetamine abuser (Li et al. , 2004). Furthermore, the dopamine D2 receptor, along with a polymorphic region linked to the serotonin transporter, may be a smoking-modulated genetic risk factorfor alcoholism (at least in Mexican Americans) (Konishi et al. , 2004), although this receptor apparently does not affect susceptibility to opiate addiction (Gareeva et al. , 2002). 6.24 Smoking is a clear case in which an understanding of genetic factors related to addiction would be beneficial. However, early results of looking at obvious candidate genes have been disappointing. Forexample, four polymorphisms in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNB2) have been examined innon-smokers and in smokers classified as having low or high levels of nicotine dependence, but none ofthe polymorphisms tested was associated with smoking initiation or progression to nicotine dependence(Silverman et al. , 2000). The /H9262-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) is an interesting example; only one gene encodes OPRM1, but differential splicing leads to the expression of functionally variant protein products.In addition, polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the gene increase the extent of interindividualvariability in response to opioids (Chevlen, 2003), and relatively common coding region polymorphisms(A118G (10.5%) and C17T (6.6%)) may affect responsiveness to both the addictive and acute toxic effects ofopioids (LaForge et al. , 2000a; LaForge et al. , 2000b). A recent case report examining side effects following morphine administration in patients with renal dysfunction compared one patient who was homozygousfor the A118G variant of OPRM1 with one who was homozygous for the normal allele. The A118Ghomozygote tolerated morphine well despite a high plasma level of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide, whereas the one homozygous for the normal allele did not tolerate the morphine well,experiencing severe sleepiness and drowsiness. This led the authors to suggest that the A118G allele is aprotective factor in morphine toxicity (Lotsch et al. , 2002). 6.25 Another example in which a receptor polymorphism may affect susceptibility to the side effects of neuroactive drugs is that of the serotonin receptor, 5-HT(1B). This receptor has a variant, Phe-Cys at aminoacid 124, which modifies its pharmacological properties. One of the consequences of this modificationappears to be increased susceptibility to coronary vasoconstriction which occurs as a side-effect ofsumatriptan therapy for migraine in a subset of patients with additional pathogenic factors such ascoronary heart disease (Kiel et al. , 2000). 596.26 Recent studies have implicated the endocannabinoid syst em (a series of receptors in the brain and elsewhere in the body that modulates the effects of primary signalling molecules such as dopamine, GABA, noradrenaline and seratonin) with substance abuse, including tobacco smoking. There is evidencethat polymorphisms of the CB1 subgroup of endocannabinoid receptors, involved in self-reinforcingbehaviour, may contribute to interindividual differences in addiction and substance abuse (Zhang et al. , 2004). Difficulties in making conclusions on polymorphisms of receptors 6.27 It will be obvious from the section above that our knowledge and understanding of the role of polymorphic receptors in interindividual variation in response to toxic agents, particularly in relation tothe classical toxic effects of ingested chemicals, is in a very immature state at present. In many cases thecomments above are based on very few publications, and sometimes only a single paper on a particulartopic has been published. This makes a critical review of current knowledge very difficult at the presenttime. However, the literature in this area is expanding at an ever-accelerating pace and it is to beanticipated that soon it will be possible to draw valid conclusions in a number of areas which are, atpresent, extremely confused. Identification of susceptibility factors 6.28 When considering risk assessment and risk management, it may be important to reflect upon whether reducing risk by limiting exposure is a benefit to a small number of high risk individuals or to thepopulation as a whole. For instance, an individual gene may have small impact on individual susceptibilitybut a large impact at the population level because it is highly prevalent (reviewed in Brennan 2002). Thus,on a population level, more can often be achieved by making small changes which affect the majority ofthe population rather than dramatic changes which affect only a small high-risk group. 6.29 It is also important to note that polymorphisms affect the probability of a particular event but do not directly indicate outcomes; it may never be possible to predict precisely which individuals will beaffected. In other words, identification of an individual with a \"susceptibility gene\" does not indicatewhether or not a toxic response will occur in that particular individual; conversely, the absence of asusceptibility gene does not guarantee resistance to toxicity. 6.30 Many preliminary epidemiological studies aimed at the identification of risk factors in humans are small, and even follow-up studies may only have 150-300 cases and controls (Brennan, 2002). This number issufficient to detect common polymorphisms which double risk, but will not detect rare polymorphismsor those that cause less than a doubling in risk. Much larger studies and/ or meta-analyses are required toreveal small increases in risk, but these would be of limited importance for risk assessment as they wouldbe covered by the usual uncertainty factor approach. It is also important to note that polymorphicvariants may be present at different frequencies within ethnic groups; for example, 45% of Caucasians butonly 10% of Japanese individuals are NAT2 slow acetylators. This may mean that the implications of theidentification of a particular variant has different implications depending on the ethnic makeup of theexposed population. It may not always be possible to extrapolate risk assessments from one ethnic groupto another (Renwick 1996). 60Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment7.1 Uncertainty, sometimes called type B or epistemic uncertainty or reducible uncertainty, refers to lack of knowledge, which could be reduced by further investigation. Thus an uncertain quantity is one that has atrue, but unknown, value. 7.2 Several types of uncertainty are recognised. Two examples are: i. Parameter uncertainty refers to data values that are not known with precision due to measurement error or limited observations (sampling error). This may be due to random (chance) variation or theremay be systematic error. ii. Model uncertainty arises because models are used to convert experimental or epidemiological data into an estimate of risk, for example during extrapolation from animals to humans. The amount ofuncertainty decreases the closer the model (experimental or epidemiological study) is to thepopulation of interest (eg. UK human consumers). In general, the amount of uncertainty increases in thefollowing order: human investigations, studies in primates, studies in rodents, in vitro studies. The uncertainty reflects the limited ability of mathematical models to represent the real world accuratelyand may also reflect lack of sufficient knowledge. 7.3 Uncertainty in hazard characterisation relates to the limitations of the available data, whether from animal studies, controlled human studies or epidemiological studies. With respect to toxicological studies, theuncertainty relates to lack of knowledge in areas such as: /circle6the quality of the toxicological data /circle6gaps in the toxicological database /circle6relevance of the endpoints of toxicity /circle6current state of knowledge 7.4 The quality and completeness of the data typically vary for different categories of chemical substance. For new chemical entities that are subject to regulatory review and premarketing authorisation there maybe a complete package of recent toxicological studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice(GLP) standards and complying with recognised test guidelines, but there may be little or no human data.For older synthetic substances and environmental pollutants, the existing toxicological data are likely tobe more variable, but there may be some human data, sometimes even human experimental data, that canbe used in risk assessment. For many naturally-occurring compounds, the toxicological database isextremely limited. 7.5 Emerging technologies and scientific understanding may also lead to uncertainties, for example in relation to the relevance of new data for the risk assessment process. This emphasises the need for the riskassessment process to continue to evolve and for appropriate expertise to be included in expert advisorycommittees.7 Sources of Uncertainty in Hazard Characterisation 617.6 In some areas of science, sensitivity analysis has been used to describe which sources of uncertainty and variability have the greatest effects on the overall conclusion. Sensitivity analysis is not normally used intoxicology, where it is prudent to make conservative conclusions that ensure the safety of potentiallyexposed people. However, the COT has stated that physiologically-based pharmacokinetic ortoxicokinetic (PBPK/PBTK) models could be valuable for performing sensitivity analysis as part of the riskassessment process (COT, 2003a). Quality and Reproducibility of the Data 7.7 The guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the International Co-operation onHarmonisation Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary MedicinalProducts (VICH) give advice on testing regimes for assessing the safety of human and veterinary medicines.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines define the design,conduct and reporting of toxicity and toxicokinetic studies in a regulatory context. If such studies areconducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), including quality assurance audit, then itis possible to judge the quality of the study and the accuracy of the reporting. Older regulatory studiesmay have been conducted in accordance with earlier guidelines, perhaps involving smaller groups ofanimals, less sensitive measures of toxic effect and not according to GLP. Similar problems also frequentlyapply to research studies reported in the scientific literature. In particular, GLP is generally not used inacademic establishments, and studies not generated for regulatory purposes may be less rigorouslycontrolled. There may be doubts about whether reported observations are treatment-related, or whetherall possible effects were adequately investigated and reported. Furthermore features of the studyimportant to regulators, such as purity of the test material, may not have been reported. Investigators mayalso have focussed on dose levels that are expected to produce effects, and therefore fail to identify aNOAEL, which is often needed for risk assessment purposes. Some of the reporting deficiencies may bebeyond the author's control: well-controlled research published in renowned scientific journals will havebeen subject to editorial control, which may restrict the amount of methodological detail and negativedata that can be included, and this may render interpretation of the results difficult. There have beenoccasional instances of scientific fraud in both regulatory studies and those published in the generalscientific literature. GLP was a response to the former and is used in toxicological contract facilities, whereit provides an audit trail, which makes falsification of data difficult. Measures are in place to prevent fraudin research facilities in a few countries e.g. USA (http:// ori.dhhs.gov/), but there is no formal mechanismin the UK. Consideration of the reputation of the laboratory or researchers may sometimes be taken intoaccount, but of necessity this will involve subjective judgements. However, overall limitations in thequality of study design and reporting frequently result in uncertainty with regard to the accuracy ofreported observations. There is a systematic approach available for evaluating the quality of experimentaltoxicological data (Klimisch et al. 1997). The Klimisch Scale gives criteria for establishing reliability categories for toxicology studies, based on a consideration of the level of information detailed in thestudy/publication. 7.8 In some areas of toxicology (eg. rodent studies examining endocrine modulating effects - see Chapter 10) there have been problems in obtaining consistent reproducible results, even when the studies fit the 62Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentcriteria for them to be regarded as being of good quality. There is a need for a pre-planned robust mechanism for assessing the results of studies that give contradictory results. Uncertainties in the reference point on the dose-response relationship used for hazard characterisation 7.9 Although health-based guidance values are often set on the basis of a NOAEL, the NOAEL is not identical to the threshold of toxicity. There needs to be a certain amount of response before a difference betweenthe responses of the control group and the test group can be identified. Modelling of the possiblemagnitude of response in toxicity studies has indicated that there can be about a 5% response at theNOAEL (Gaylor 1992; Leisenring and Ryan 1992; Allen et al. , 1994). Dose spacing adds further uncertainty as there is uncertainty regarding where the NOAEL lies on the curve in relation to the actual threshold ofresponse. The dose taken as the NOAEL (ie. the highest tested dose level below the lowest tested doseto have an adverse effect) will be lower than the highest dose that would not cause an observable adverseeffect if all possible doses had been tested. In addition, there is uncertainty about the significance ofexposures less or greater than, but close to the NOAEL. The choice of the critical effect is crucial whendetermining the NOAEL. The approach makes the assumption that if a NOAEL that is protective againstthe critical effect is used to derive an acceptable exposure level, this will be protective against all effects.However, while this is reasonable, there is uncertainty about the implications of exceeding the ADI/TDIif effects have different dose-response profiles. The above procedure assumes that the NOAEL for thecritical effect in humans will be greater than or equal to the critical NOAEL for experimental animalsdivided by the safety factor (usually 10) used to compensate for uncertainty about interspeciesdifferences. Of course, if an adverse effect were to occur in humans at doses lower than this, humans maynot be adequately protected. Then it would be necessary to identify the NOAEL for the critical effect inhumans and to set the ADI/TDI on the basis of it. 7.10 Uncertainty is increased because of the differing practices of toxicologists in defining the NOAEL. The NOAEL is frequently considered to be the highest dose where no adverse effect occurs as defined by apairwise statistical test between the test group(s) and the controls. There may be disagreement how toproceed if the dose group below that which shows a statistically significant pairwise difference from thecontrols shows a non-statistically significant difference. A p-value of 0.05 is usually regarded as the cut-off point for statistical significance (ie. p<0.05 is statistically significant). 7.11 The NOAEL depends critically on study design, the sensitivity of measurements of toxic endpoints, choice of doses, dose spacing and group size (statistical power) (Renwick and Walker, 1993). Thus two studies onthe same chemical that are identical in every respect except the doses used can identify different NOAELsbecause dose-spacing is a major determinant of the NOAEL. The existence of a dose-responserelationship increases the confidence in the NOAEL, although dose-response relationships are notfundamental for defining a NOAEL (in contrast to the benchmark dose level (BMDL), for which a dose-response is critical). Generally, dose response information from animal studies is limited as the OECDmethodological guidelines for toxicological studies were designed to identify a NOAEL rather than aBMDL. (The benchmark dose (BMD) and the BMDL are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12). The studiesoften use only three test groups, of which one is designed to be a no effect level, one of which must showan effect and an intermediate dose which may or may not show any response. Thus, some 'dose response 63curves' may consist of only two points. Study design can be greatly facilitated by knowledge of toxicokinetics and by the results of trial studies to determine suitable dose levels. 7.12 The NOAEL is itself the subject of statistical uncertainty and its reliability depends upon the power of the study. Confidence in the NOAEL could be increased by use of larger group sizes or smaller dose spacing(eg. by use of more groups at different dose levels). The recommendations given in methodologicalguidelines regarding the number of animals to be used per group and the number of groups to be used isnecessarily a balance between maximising the power of the study (by using larger groups sizes or moregroups) and ethical considerations that require the number of animals used in testing to be minimised.Experiments that use fewer animals tend to result in higher NOAELs associated with greater imprecisionin the determined NOAEL (i.e. increase the chance of a false negative [type II error] at any particular doselevel). Thus, a NOAEL derived using a small number of animals per dose group, results in additionaluncertainty about whether the NOAEL is actually below the true threshold of response (see Brown andErdreich, 1989). However, the selection of animal numbers per dose group is influenced by external driversother than scientific ones regarding power in defining the NOAEL. Notably the use of 4 or 6 dogs of eachsex per dose group (on animal welfare grounds), makes rigid adherence to formal statistical analysisinappropriate. Often, it is necessary to consider either trends, or the responses in individual animals,against the spectrum of effects observed in the study in question and other studies, before drawinginferences. A further problem is that the multiple endpoints studied in a typical toxicological studyincrease the possibility of type I errors (false positives). Yet another question raised by the concept of theNOAEL is what constitutes an adverse effect. For example with organophosphate anticholinesterases, itis generally considered that inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase in plasma is not an adverse effect(although indicative of exposure), but that inhibition of acetylcholinestase is an adverse effect. This isbecause butyrylcholinesterase does not have an essential physiological function, whereas erythrocyteacetylcholinesterase is the same gene product as the acetylcholinesterase that is vital for normal brain,nerve and muscle function. An additional difficulty is agreeing what degree of acetylcholinesteraseinhibition is considered adverse (FAO/WHO, 1999). 7.13 The LOAEL is subject to many of the statistical problems discussed above in relation to the NOAEL. As with the NOAEL, using a LOAEL means the information about the shape of the dose response curve is notused, although the steepness of the curve should be taken into account when selecting an additionaluncertainty factor to account for using a LOAEL rather than a NOAEL. Thus, when extrapolating from aLOAEL to a NOAEL there is uncertainty about how close the resulting figure is to the actual threshold foran effect. As is discussed below, where a health-based guidance value, such as a TDI, is defined by aLOAEL, an extra uncertainty factor of up to 10, frequently 3, is often used. 7.14 The use of any additional uncertainty factor lower than 10 would depend on a detailed study of the dose- response for the critical effect, to estimate how close the LOAEL is likely to be to the NOAEL. Forbiochemical or haematological endpoints this may involve looking for consistency between variableslikely to be disturbed together (eg. enzymes and plasma proteins in liver dysfunction), as well as the doseresponse. For histopathological endpoints a detailed consideration of the pathology report in terms ofincidence and severity of changes would be necessary. If the incidence of this effect and the severitygrading are both low, then the LOAEL is more likely to be close to the NOAEL. The report of the EuropeanCentre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC Technical Report 85) on how to 64Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentdistinguish adverse from adaptive effects is particularly useful in this regard, as it outlines a soundly based and robust framework for decision making in this complex area of uncertainty. Gaps in the Database 7.15 Adequate toxicology studies of appropriate duration are key to the toxicological evaluation of a compound. A complete database includes the studies referred to in Chapter 3. For many environmentalpollutants and naturally occurring chemicals there is a lack of adequate data, particularly oncarcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity: this is partly because there is nosponsor to remedy gaps in the database. Such gaps are uncertainties. Formal systematic reviews (seeChapter 12) can be used to test the completeness of the data available. 7.16 A review of studies conducted during development of new pharmaceutical agents indicated that chronic studies, with the exception of carcinogenicity studies, did not reveal any toxic effects that were notobserved in subchronic studies (Lumley and Walker, 1986). Investigations of other databases (the Germanauthorities, the company Bayer, and VICH looking at data on pesticides) found that the results of sub-chronic toxicity studies were not reliably predictive of the results of chronic toxicity studies. Therefore, itmay not be reasonable to make precautionary assumptions about the relationship between the NOAELfor non-neoplastic lesions in subchronic and lifetime studies, i.e. to extrapolate from short term to longterm exposure. Furthermore, additional endpoints of toxicity may be observed in studies conducted inpregnant or immature animals, or using specialised protocols. It is not justified to make assumptions onwhether developmental effects, neurotoxicity or immunotoxicity will be observed at similar, lower, orhigher doses to those causing other forms of toxicity in adult animals. 7.17 If key genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, then it may not be reasonable to assume a threshold since it would not be known whether the compound is an in vivo mutagen and hence a potential genotoxic carcinogen. The Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and theEnvironment (COM) advice is that for in vivo mutagens it is prudent to assume that there is no threshold for mutagenity (COM, 2000a). For such compounds the conclusion would be that exposure should beALARP (see Chapter 3). The COM/COC consideration of 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) is anexample of how further data can reduce uncertainty. In 1999, the COM considered that \"the in vitro data were positive and the available in vivo data were inadequate to provide reassurance that the activity seen in vitro was not expressed in vivo . It would be prudent to assume that 3-MCPD was an in vivo mutagen.\" (COT, 1999). However, completion of adequate and reassuring in vivo genotoxicity studies, together with consideration of a possible hormonal mechanism of carcinogenicity, led to the conclusion that a thresholdcould be assumed (COM 2000b; COC, 2000) and a TDI was subsequently established (SCF, 2001). Relevance of the Observations 7.18 There can be uncertainty about whether effects observed in animals are relevant to risk assessment in humans: conversely it may be impossible to reproduce certain human effects in animals: both areexamples of model uncertainty. Animal toxicity studies can be conducted at very high dose levels, at leastwhen a substance is relatively innocuous. This can lead to adverse effects resulting from disturbances ofhomeostatic and physiological processes, which are not relevant to effects that would occur at lower 65exposure levels. Such effects include tumours induced by non-genotoxic mechanisms. Administration to rats of high dietary concentrations of poorly soluble carbohydrates is known to cause mineral imbalancethat can lead to lesions in the caecum, kidneys, adrenal glands, etc. (FAO/WHO, 1983), which again areunlikely to be relevant to humans exposed to much lower doses. Nevertheless, animal data are assumedto be relevant unless there is good reason to think otherwise. Similar considerations of dose may apply toextrapolation of human data from poisonings or occupational exposure to exposure to the same chemicalin food. Human toxicokinetic data, when available, are likely to have been generated at single low doseexposures, and there may be uncertainty with respect to their relevance to repeated exposure at higherdoses. 7.19 Neurobehavioural studies have recently been introduced into regulatory toxicity studies. However, these tests are still undergoing development and there is relatively little experience of their interpretation.Although stress-related effects produced via adrenal activation can be modelled well in laboratoryspecies, disturbance of higher cortical function can probably only be modelled in primates. At presenthowever, we have been unable to find any examples of chemicals producing disturbance of higher corticalfunction (e.g. hallucinogens) that do not also produce adverse effects on lower levels of brain functionthat are detectable in non-primate animals (see also Chapter 9). 7.20 Endocrine modulation (sometimes referred to as endocrine disruption) is an example of an area where there is particular uncertainty with regards to the relevance of the results of animal studies to humanhealth effects. In part, the uncertainty relates to the importance of physiological differences betweenlaboratory rodents and humans. Endocrine modulation is discussed more fully in Chapter 10. 7.21 A number of syndromes that occur in humans cannot adequately be reproduced in animal models, and therefore cannot be predicted from the toxicological data currently generated in animals. These include,for example, food allergy and intolerance, nausea, headache and fatigue; there may be others yetunknown. For some of these symptoms, such as nausea, novel methods of assessment are beingdeveloped. Some indications may also be obtained from observations of lethargy and decreased foodintake. Consumers with concerns about wide-ranging symptoms frequently allege that various \"syntheticchemicals\" are to blame. There are no reasons to expect that the human body would react more adverselyto anthropogenic non-nutrient chemicals than to other non-nutrient compounds that occur naturally asfood constituents or are produced during normal food processes such as cooking. Studies In Vitro 7.22 To date, few in vitro tests have been validated for use in regulatory toxicology. Those currently validated are for genotoxicity, corrosivity and phototoxicity. However, it is anticipated that there will be a numberof additions to this list over the next few years. Notwithstanding the status of regulatory acceptance, in vitro approaches are invaluable adjuncts to conventional in vivo toxicity testing and to the design and interpretation of observations in humans, including epidemiological studies. Often, in vitro approaches are the most suitable and reliable for defining the metabolism and other aspects of the kinetics of xenobioticcompounds in humans. This information can either help in interpreting the toxicological database or itmight be used as the basis of chemical specific adjustment factors (see this paragraph and Chapter 12). In vitro models can be invaluable in exploring modes and mechanisms of action, either at the cellular or 66Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentmolecular level. Often, this is the only means of comparing key events of a mode of action in experimental animals and humans. The information can be used to help interpret in vivo studies, to assess the relevance of experimental findings for human risk and possibly to derive chemical specific adjustmentfactors. Such studies can also help in the identification of susceptible sub-groups and aid in thequantification of their difference in susceptibility. It might be possible to investigate human CYP-polymorphisms using genetically engineered batteries of cell lines expressing variants of some humanCYPs, but the results of such studies are difficult to interpret as they are often not predictive of in vivo effects. Finally, the results of in vitro studies are often a key source of information for populating toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models, particularly those that are physiologically based. In addition, itis often possible to obtain an estimate of parameter variability from such studies. Nevertheless, thereremain considerable uncertainties in regard to the extrapolation of studies in vitro to humans, so that, certainly at present, while clearly desirable, complete replacement of animal tests is not possible (see House of Lords, 2002). 678.1 Although the identification and characterisation of hazards is often based on data from experimental studies, human data may be available from volunteer studies, epidemiological studies, clinical trials orcase-reports. 8.2 Human studies can be classified into two broad categories: 1. Experimental, including: a. Clinical trialsb. Field trialsc. Community intervention trialsd. Controlled studies of exposed humans 2. Non-experimental or observational, including: a. Cross-sectionalb. Cohortc. Case-controld. Ecological 8.3 The fundamental difference between the two groups is that in human experimental studies there is an attempt to reduce variation by extraneous factors and to ensure that those exposed are exposed to aknown amount/ dose because the investigator has assigned them to that exposure. 8.4 However, many of the data collected and analysed are common to both types of study and include: /circle6Demographic and other baseline data on individual participants /circle6Information on health outcomes /circle6Measurements of exposure and/ or assessment of exposure for participants or groups of participants Data on other factors that may influence the Health Outcome 8.5 In epidemiological studies, it may not be possible to judge whether systematic error has been introduced or whether confounding factors have been adequately taken into account, due to restricted reporting inthe publications that do not necessarily reflect the quality of the actual study.8 Variability and Uncertainty of Data in Studies From Humans 68Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment8.6 Most agencies have expressed a preference for using epidemiological data rather than toxicological data for risk assessment where possible. It is therefore important to consider the nature of variability anduncertainty within these studies. In a similar way to experimental studies, variability in human studiesarises from true heterogeneity across people, places and time, and uncertainty in these studies arises froma lack of knowledge about factors that affect the observed results. Thus variability can affect the precisionto which results can be generalised, whereas uncertainty can lead to inaccurate or biased estimates. It isimportant to recognise that both variability and uncertainty are unavoidable and are often understated inepidemiological studies. Both qualitative and quantitative exploration of the importance and impact ofthe sources of variability and uncertainty, although time consuming, can lead to greater understanding andimproved decision making. 8.7 There is potential for variability and uncertainty to exist throughout the whole process of designing epidemiological studies, collection and analysis of data and in interpretation of results. The last is usuallydiscussed in a qualitative way with regard to various sources of bias and whether these might have animpact on the conclusions that can be drawn from a particular set of results. Important sources of biasinclude: i. Selection bias, in which the study group does not reflect the population to whom it is hoped to apply the results. This can be due to exclusion of certain subgroups, refusals, loss to follow-up, etc. ii. Allocation bias in which, in clinical trials, for example, participants are not allocated randomly to different treatments. Non-random allocation does not necessarily directly give rise to bias but coulddo so indirectly by distributing confounding factors unevenly between groups. iii. Information bias in which errors occur in the measurement or estimation of outcome, exposure and other data. This can impact on the magnitude and direction of the risk estimate and on thegeneralisability of the results. For example, if non-differential misclassification of exposure occursthen this has been shown to tend to attenuate the risk estimate towards the null value of noassociation between exposure and outcome. Information bias might be called measurement bias whenit relates to numerical data rather than nominal data. iv. Follow-up bias in which some of the participants are unable to be contacted or withdraw from a study, leading to incomplete evaluation. Follow-up bias may be regarded as a special case of selection bias. v. Confounding is a problem when, within the study sample, the exposure of interest is associated with a factor which independently determines risk of the outcome. A factor can also be associated withan outcome because it lies between the exposure and the outcome in the causal chain or because itoccurs as a consequence of the outcome. Furthermore, if the confounding factor has beensatisfactorily measured then it may be possible to elimiate its effect, even if it does not have the samedistribution in exposed and unexposed. Effect modification may affect the extent to which findingscan be extrapolated or generalised to other populations. vi. Analysis bias in which an inappropriate or limited analytical method has been applied to the data. 698.8 In addition to these potential biases, consideration of other potential limitations arising from the design of the study is also needed. For example, the size of the study i.e. the power, the adequacy of the periodof observation to detect the health outcomes of interest and the sensitivity of case ascertainment areimportant issues to be evaluated. 8.9 Qualitative analysis of uncertainty and variability in epidemiological studies can be valuable in that a systematic identification and discussion of major assumptions and the nature and magnitude of potentialerrors can be carried out. 8.10 Statistical methodology provides tools for describing uncertainty and variability in a quantitative way. Often these are limited to the presentation of results from statistical tests and confidence intervals. Theymay focus on random error and statistical variation by quantifying the scope for error from randomstatistical variation. For example the natural variation between individuals in terms of their reaction to agiven exposure, the inherent randomness in how a hazard is spread throughout a medium and in howindividuals come into contact with the medium, and the variation caused by sampling. 8.11 Quantification of uncertainty involves ideas of chance, randomness, risk, hazard and unpredictability. Probabilistic approaches in which mathematical or statistical models are developed facilitate theincorporation of (i) uncertainty analyses to examine the variation or imprecision in the output due to inputassumptions, and (ii) sensitivity analyses to identify those model parameters to which the output is mostsensitive, i.e. evaluation of the size of changes in model output as a result of changes of known size inindividual model inputs. Quantification of the uncertainty and/ or variability in the output from a modelcan be expressed as summary statistics or using probability-density or cumulative-distribution functions. 8.12 Mathematical and statistical models are most often used in epidemiological studies to characterise exposure and to describe the dose-response relationships between exposure and adverse healthoutcomes. Uncertainty in these models can be classified into three broad categories: scenario uncertainty,parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty. Scenario uncertainty can arise, for example, when carryingout an exposure assessment, from failure to take into account all sources of a hazardous exposure orassuming that populations are homogeneous in exposure patterns when there may be significantvariations in some subgroups. Parameter uncertainty may arise from measurement error (including randomerror and systematic bias), the use of generic or surrogate data, and random sampling error. Modeluncertainty arises through gaps in scientific theory or misunderstanding about the nature of therelationships and oversimplified representations of reality. Scenario uncertainty, parameter uncertaintyand model uncertainty are not totally distinct from one another. There is some overlap. For instance, ifnot all relevant sources or determinants of exposure are taken into account (scenario uncertainty), thereis potential for error in the assessment of exposure (parameter uncertainty). 8.13 Both classical and Bayesian probabilistic approaches are used in epidemiological studies as well as for risk assessment. The latter have the advantage of being able to incorporate expert opinion and uncertaintyabout this. For example, in models of retrospective exposure assessment there may be differing opinionsas to the technology used in the past and the likely magnitude of exposure experienced. 70Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment8.14 Bayesian approaches are also increasingly being developed in the field of meta-analysis. Systematic review and meta-analysis methods are well established in the area of clinical trials and involve the collation ofthe literature on a particular area of interest, assessment of the extent and quality of the studies foundand provision of a compilation of results, often including quantitative estimation of risk from thecombined studies. These methods facilitate transparency and reproducibility of the methodology andresults, and ease of updating. They can identify gaps in the knowledge base and areas for future research.Quantitative meta-analyses can give greater statistical power than single studies and provide a frameworkfor investigation of possible sources of heterogeneity between studies and biases such as publication andselective reporting bias. In spite of controversy over the opportunity for bias and other sources ofheterogeneity compared with clinical trials, these techniques are being increasingly used inepidemiological research and a number of guidelines have been produced recently on the topic. They arealso being used to combine toxicological studies. 8.15 Systematic review and meta-analysis methods also offer the potential to improve the transparency and reproducibility of the processes by which decisions are made, by expert committees, from large numbersof toxicological and epidemiological studies. Elicitation of expert opinion and inclusion of this instructured models would enhance the evaluation of the effect of lack of knowledge (individual orcollective) about a parameter, and would foster transparency of decision making. It would be appropriateto consider application of this methodology to some examples of concern to a committee to explore andevaluated the utility of this approach for standard setting. Molecular Epidemiology 8.16 The field of molecular epidemiology offers the opportunity to combine the scientific disciplines of epidemiology and molecular toxicology to investigate interactions between genetics factors andenvironmental and other factors in the cause of disease. In long-term studies of populations it has beenshown that exposures to relatively high levels of a hazardous exposure over long periods do not affect allindividuals equally and there is increasing evidence that genetic factors influence the susceptibility andresistance of an individual to disease. There has been increasing research into the multiple pathwaysinvolved in disease processes, e.g. to the process of carcinogenesis and the importance of interactions.These include simultaneous exposure to different causal and different protective factors, andhost:environment interactions including metabolic polymorphisms. Tools that are being rapidlydeveloped included genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc, often allowing investigation of a vast rangeof gene functions in simple, easy to use screening systems. Analysis and interpretation of results fromthese techniques is currently an area of on-going debate reflecting the lack of understanding of thefunction of many of the genes routinely investigated. This introduces a whole new dimension to theelicitation and interpretation of sources of uncertainty and variability. Future epidemiological research willneed to incorporate measurement of susceptibility to aid investigation of disease pathways and to detectgene-environment interactions. This will require collaborative teams of epidemiologists, toxicologists andspecialists in exposure measurement and assessment. 71Human Experimental Data 8.17 Human experimental data of interest to the toxicologist are of two main types. The first are studies of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, including studies using radiolabelled test compound.Such studies are much more frequently carried out with drugs intended for use in humans than with foodchemicals and in the UK administration of radiolabelled drugs at doses above a specified level ofradioactivity require the assent of the Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee(ARSAC). A second type of study that is undertaken in humans is that of tolerability and this is discussedbelow. 8.18 Human tolerability studies have been carried out with a number of food chemicals, and the design of such studies is primarily to confirm tolerability of proposed intakes. In addition, human data might be availablefor substances (mainly pesticides and veterinary drugs) that have been tested for possible developmentas human drugs. Many toxicological endpoints cannot ethically be elicited in human studies, and humanexperimental studies are of greatest value when there is a good biomarker of effect that can be measuredbelow the threshold for producing toxicity, such as cholinesterase inhibition for anticholinesteraseinsecticides. A substantial insecticides have JMPR ADIs andARfDs based upon human studies (Thomson and Richardson, 2004). In most cases, an uncertainty factorof 10 has been used, as the additional factor of 10 for interspecies variation is unnecessary. Many of theconsiderations in design of human studies are the same as those in animal studies e.g. adequate power todetect effects. It is worth reflecting however that the more complicated and the longer the study; thegreater is the likelihood of subjects withdrawing. This will have two effects; it will diminish the power ofthe study and increase the chances that the remaining subjects will not be representative. 8.19 In recent years, the procedures for human experimental studies have become increasingly structured, because of concern about past experimentation that may not have been truly voluntary. The Declarationof Helsinki of 1964 (WMA, 1997) set out ethical guidelines for inter alia non-clinical human studies. In the UK, guidelines were established by the Royal College of Physicians of London on research on healthyvolunteers (RCP, 1986) and on ethical Committees (RCP, 1990). Important points are that a detailedprotocol is required for the ethical committee, procedures must be justifiable in terms of the objectivesof the study, informed consent is required and volunteers may be paid for the inconvenience but not somuch that they would act against their better judgement (see review by Wilks and Minton, 2000). 8.20 Some countries, notably Germany and Austria, will not countenance the use of human volunteer studies on pesticides in risk assessment. Furthermore, there has been recent activity in this area both in the USA(eg the National Academy of Science review and the subsequent setting up a Human Studies ReviewBoard by the EPA) and in Europe (eg the unacceptability of the use of human data in pesticide riskassessment by the European Commission). Human studies can be particularly useful for identifyingNOAELs for the anticholinesterase activity of certain pesticides. If the investigation of this effect is limitedto animal studies, there will be more uncertainty about the guidance values subsequently established forsome pesticides. 72Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment8.21 Variability and uncertainty can affect the results of human studies in the same way as animal studies. A further consideration is that criteria for exclusion of volunteers are often drawn so tightly that it isdifficult to be sure that supposedly adverse effects are truly test-material related. Case Reports and Case Studies 8.22 Case reports of exposure and sometimes poisoning and case series (reports of more than one such case) are frequently included in toxicological dossiers. These are only of limited value in setting ADIs or ARfDs,but can nevertheless be helpful to the toxicologist. They can help to establish whether a particularpattern of exposure of humans (usually acute) produced similar effects to those seen after the samepattern of exposure in animals i.e. whether there are major qualitative differences in toxicity. With foodchemicals the intakes are rarely known with any exactitude, so it is difficult to establish quantitativerelationships. 73Introduction 9.1 An area of current concern to risk assessors is developmental neurotoxicity. This evolving area presents particular problems in hazard identification and characterisation. It is an example of model uncertainty inthat there is doubt that animal data can adequately model development of the human nervous systemespecially its high functions. Further, developmental neurotoxicity is an area of concern particularly withrespect to pesticide toxicology, because insecticides are known neurotoxins. 9.2 Developmental neurotoxicity in the human is a complex and poorly understood area. This is primarily due to the relative scarcity of information on the development of the human nervous system. It is known thatthe development of the central nervous system (CNS) is a long lasting and extremely complex process,but details on what exactly is happening are only currently emerging. The second major cause of the lackof knowledge in the field of human developmental neurotoxicology is the absence of well-controlledhuman studies (as the performance of such studies would be unethical) and the paucity of availableepidemiological studies. 9.3 This Chapter discusses the consequences of the ontogenetic events for developmental neurotoxicity and presents examples of developmental neurotoxicological effects in the human. Consequences of neuro-ontogeny for developmental neurotoxicity 9.4 The developmental processes in the telencephalon are summarised in Figure 9.1. It is clear that the development of the nervous system is a complex and long lasting process and that specific events occurduring specific periods of life. The presence of time-windows with specific neuro-ontogeneticcharacteristics has two important consequences for developmental neurotoxicity. Figure 9.1 Developmental processes in the telecephalon during human ontogeny Schematic representation of the age of occurrence of various developmental processes during ontogeny of the human brain. A bold line indicates that the process mentioned on the left side is very active, a broken line that the process is active but to a lesser degree. Note that the age a xis is drawn in arbitrary units. C = conception, M = months, B = birth, Y = year.Neuronal proliferation Neuronal migration Outgrowth of axons and Developmental Neurotoxicity 74Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment9.5 Firstly, the presence of developmental periods characterised by specific neurodevelopmental events results in windows of specific vulnerability for adverse influences. This means that the effect of exposureto a specific event or substance depends on the developmental period during which the exposure occurs.A well known clinical example of the age-dependent effect of an adverse condition during early life is thedifference in the effect of perinatal asphyxia in preterm and full-term infants. Perinatal asphyxia does notalways result in brain damage. When it does, the lesion in preterm infants usually is localised in theperiventricular regions, infants the cortical thalamus, basal ganglia andbrainstem show a specific vulnerability (Volpe, 2001). Examples of the differential effect of age at exposureon outcome in the field of developmental neurotoxicity are the effects of prenatal exposure to radiationand alcohol. Follow-up studies on the effect of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki revealedthat the highest risk of mental retardation occurred in children who had been exposed to radiation in utero at between 10 and 17 weeks after the last menstrual period, i.e. during the period of abundant neuronal proliferation. Exposure prior to this period did not result in an increased risk of mentalretardation and exposure during later phases of fetal life were associated with an only moderatelyelevated risk of low cognitive function (Otake & Schull 1984). Recent studies on the effects of prenatalalcohol exposure have indicated that alcohol exposure may interfere in particular with programmed celldeath (apoptosis). This means that exposure to alcohol during the second trimester of pregnancy isespecially likely to be associated with an adverse outcome (Olney, 2002). 9.6 Secondly, the age-dependent characteristics of the nervous system have consequences for the age at which evaluation should be carried out for adverse effects on its development. The continuous developmentalchanges in the nervous system are paired with continuous changes in function and, in case of dysfunction, inage related expression of dysfunction. Y oung infants can express dysfunction of the brain only by means ofgeneralised and non-specific dysfunction. For instance, an infant with a left-sided intraventricularhaemorrhage may respond with a generalised hypotonia, a generalised hypertonia, a hyperexcitabilitysyndrome, or an abnormal quality of all body movements (Prechtl, 1977; Hadders-Algra, 2004). Infants cannotexpress dysfunctions in specific cognitive functions, such as attention deficits or problems in reading, spellingor mathematics. In general, these dysfunctions first emerge at school-age (Hadders-Algra, 2002). Otherdisorders are first expressed in early adulthood. A case in point is the development of schizophrenia:evidence is accumulating that this disorder might be related to adversity during prenatal life, such asmalnutrition during the first trimester of pregnancy (Susser & Lin, 1992) or infection during the secondtrimester (Watson et al. , 1999). This means that the developmental sequelae of early exposure to a toxic substance may be first expressed after a latent or silent period of many years. On the other hand, the markeddevelopmental changes of the brain may induce disappearance of toxicologically induced dysfunctionspresent in early childhood (Hadders-Algra, 2002). Thus, the age of assessment of potentially adverse effectsof a toxic substance has a major effect on the outcome of the assessment, and this must be considered inthe design of developmental neurotoxicity tests. 9.7 Plasticity is a characteristic of the nervous system that helps to reduce the effect of insult. There is a great deal of duplication of function in the immature nervous system, much of which is subsequently reducedby programmed neuronal death and synapse elimination during development. This means that limited anddiffuse neuronal damage occuring prior to this elimination of duplicated functions may not have anyadverse consequences if it is restricted to those elements that would have been removed anyway duringnormal development. Additionally there is some plasticity within the adult nervous system, and this can 75mean that lost functions may be taken over by surviving neurones. A consequence of this is that the effects of a given developmental insult may be either reduced by favourable nutritional oreducational/ social factors, or increased by unfavourable ones that limit plasticity. Whilst plasticity hasoften been invoked to explain the resistance of the developing brain to mild generalised insult, insultsspecific to a particular brain area or function may disrupt the normal tightly integrated sequence ofdevelopment beyond the capacity for correction by functional plasticity. It has also been shown thatalthough plasticity may be sufficient to normalise unstressed function after neurodevelopmental insult,the response to challenge with pharmacological agents may still be abnormal - (based on data fromanimal studies) - see the section on \"Developmental neurotoxicology tests\" later in this Chapter(paragraph 9.30-9.32). Food 9.8 In this section examples of developmental neurotoxicological effects of two types of chemicals in food will be presented: the effects of some specific food components and the effects of some environmentalpollutants. 9.9 Currently, interest in the effect of early nutrition on the developing nervous system is growing. The interest has been inspired by the consistent finding that children who had been breast fed had an IQ advantage of3 to 6 points when compared to children who had been bottle fed, an effect which remained aftercorrection for confounders such as social class and parental smoking behaviour (Anderson et al. , 1999). The presence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in breast milk might be one of the factorsunderlying the developmental difference between breast fed and formula fed infants. Recent studiesindicate that LC-PUFAs indeed may exert a temporary beneficial effect on neurodevelopmental outcomeduring early infancy (Simmer, 2001; Bouwstra et al. , 2003; Dijck-Brouwer et al. , 2005). Other studies suggested that low prenatal LCPUFA status and high transfatty acid status was negatively associated withneurological condition during early infancy (Dijck-Brouwer et al. , 2005, Bouwstra et al. , 2004). 9.10 A topic of current concern in child psychiatry is whether low LC-PUFA status plays a role in the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and whether nutritional supplementationwith LC-PUFAs can improve behaviour in children with ADHD. Until now no consistent evidence has beenprovided that this is the case (e.g. Voigt et al. , 2001). 9.11 A similarly topical issue is whether food colouring chemicals affect the developing nervous system. Here some evidence has been furnished that a minority of children may have a specific sensitivity for foodcolouring, but this was inconclusive and not confirmed (reveiwed in COT, 2000). Further investigation isunderway (COT, 2002a). Developmental Neurotoxicology in the Human 9.12 Each substance known to affect the function of the adult human nervous system has the potential to have long-term effects on the developing nervous system (Swaab et al. , 1988). This means that many medical and 'recreational' drugs have a neuroteratogenic potential. However, relatively little is known on the exactnature of neurotoxicological effects of specific substances during human development. Studies in humans 76Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentwhich investigate associations between exposure to potential neurotoxicants and neurobehavioural changes are hampered by the fact that they have to be controlled for many confounding factors such associal class, parental education, the child's gender, and parental smoking. The best studies are prospectivein nature, which means that they have to follow individuals exposed during early life for many years. Thisis not an easy task in a mobile society. The studies available in general address the effects of prenatalexposure of a chemical or the exposure related to breast-feeding. Examples of neurotoxicological effectsof various groups of chemical substances are discussed below. Medical drugs 9.13 Antiepileptic drugs are the drugs of which the potential teratogenic effects have been studied most widely. During the 1970s it became evident that children who had been exposed prenatally to the antiepilepticdrugs phenobarbital and phenytoin (often used together as combined therapy) showed a distinct patternof physical abnormalities, including mid-face and digit hypoplasia, major malformations and growthretardation (Hill et al. , 1974). Gradually, the picture emerged that in utero exposure to antiepileptic drugs is associated also with an increased risk for a subtle degree of cognitive dysfunction (some points reductionin intelligence quotient (IQ) and an increased risk of attention problems; Van der Pol et al. , 1991, Gaily et al. , 2004). The risk appears to be associated with prenatal phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproic acid exposure,but not to exposure in utero to carbamazepine (Van der Pol et al. , 1991, Scolnik et al. , 1994, Gailey et al. , 2004). The risk increases when the fetus is exposed to multiple antiepileptic drugs. 9.14 Few studies have addressed the effect of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines or to antidepressant drugs. There is no consistent evidence that these drugs have an adverse effect on neurodevelopmentaloutcome in childhood (McElhatton, 1994, Nulman et al. , 1997, Casper et al. , 2003). Prenatal exposure to the alpha-adrenergic antihypertensive drug clonidine may be related in a dose-dependent way to thedevelopment of sleep disturbances in childhood (Huisjes et al. , 1986). Exposure in utero to the anticoagulant coumarin, in particular exposure during the second and third trimester of gestation, appearsto be related in a dose-dependent manner to the development of minor neurological dysfunction at theage of 7 to 15 years, but not to IQ deficit (Van Driel et al. , 2002). 9.15 Corticosteroids have been used in perinatal medicine since the 1970s, in particular in the form of two injections of corticosteroid into the mother before preterm delivery, as this treatment is associated with a reduction in respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal mortality and intraventricular haemorrhage.But evidence is gradually accumulating that repeated antenatal courses of steroids and high and/ orprolonged dosages of postnatal corticosteroid in preterm infants is associated with an increased risk ofneurodevelopmental disorder such as cerebral palsy. The risk may be higher for dexamethasone than forbetamethasone (Whitlaw & Thoresen, 2000). In this respect the findings of the MRI study of Murphy et al. (2001) is noteworthy. They demonstrated that preterm infants treated with dexamethasone for neonatal chronic lung disease showed a 35% reduction of cerebral cortical grey matter at term age. 9.16 Since the 1980s serious birth defects have been reported after exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy to isotretinoin, an analogue of vitamin A. Retinoic acid is in general prescribed for severerecalcitrant cystic acne The abnormalities of retinoic acid embryopathy of theear defects (microcephalus, 77hydrocephalus, reduction deformities of the brain) and cardiovascular abnormalities (conotruncal defects, aortic arch abnormalities) (Lammer et al. , 1985). Recreational drugs Alcohol 9.17 Prenatal alcohol exposure can have serious and permanent adverse effects in children (Mattson et al. , 2001). The most serious outcome is the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the diagnosis of which is based onthree criteria: a) growth deficiency manifested by small overall height and small head size (microcephaly),b) central nervous system disorder, and c) a distinctive pattern of abnormal facial features. Other childrenwith histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and a neurodevelopmental disorder do not meet thediagnostic criteria of FAS. These children are labelled as having fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Children withFAS and FAE are born to women who drink heavily in an episodic fashion or more regularly drinksubstantial amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. These types of prenatal alcohol exposure are associatedwith cognitive dysfunction. Children with FAS and FAE show deficits in intelligence quotient IQ scores,which range from borderline scores (lower 70s) to average scores (90-109). IQs of children with FAS aremore affected than those of children with FAE. Children with FAS and FAE in particular show deficits inexecutive functions, i.e. in a group of higher level cognitive abilities, such as problem solving and abstractthinking (Mattson et al. , 2001). In addition, it has been demonstrated that children with FAS and FAE are at high risk for behavioural disturbances, such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, delinquent behaviour, poorsocialisation and communication (Roebuck et al. , 1999). The neuropathological correlate of these neurobehavioural dysfunctions are an overall reduced size of the brain, and a specific reduction in size ofthe hippocampus, the basal ganglia (in particular the caudate nucleus), the corpus callosum, and theanterior part of the cerebellum (Roebuck et al. , 1998). Heroin and other illegal drugs 9.18 Studies indicate that prenatal exposure to heroin is associated with an increased risk of ADHD. It is also associated with mild impairments of cognitive function and impaired reading and arithmetic skills, butonly when the offspring is raised by the heroin dependent mother. When the exposed children areadopted at young age they do not have an increased risk of intellectual impairment (Ornoy et al. , 2001). There is uncertainty about whether the effects are due to pre-natal neurotoxicological effects orenvironmental factors or a combination of the two. It is possible that later environmental factors mightcounteract the effects of in utero exposure. 9.19 Similarly there is uncertainty about possible interactions between antenatal drug exposure and environment in children prenatally exposed to cocaine (Brown et al. , 2004). Prenatal exposure to cocaine is associated in a dose-dependent way with deficits in mental, psychomotor and emotional developmentin early childhood. The effect in males is larger than that in females (Lewis et al. , 2004). The cocaine related effects may be abolished by the provision of non-parental, more optimal care (Brown et al. , 2004). 9.20 The developmental neurotoxicological effects of the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) have not been investigated as yet. Prenatal exposure to ecstasy has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of congenital defects, in particular 78Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentcardiovascular anomalies and musculoskeletal anomalies (McElhatton et al. , 1999). Experiments in rodents suggest that prenatal exposure to ecstasy induces long-term changes in the monoaminergic systems,which are associated with increased locomotor activity in early adulthood (Koprich et al. , 2003). Smoking 9.21 Maternal smoking during pregnancy is related in a dose-dependent manner to subtle global cognitive impairment, specific learning disorders and ADHD in childhood (Batstra et al. , 2003a; Linnet et al. , 2003). Remarkably, a recent study indicated that the adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy on the child'scognitive abilities can be eliminated by postnatal breast feeding (Batstra et al. , 2003b). The results of a study of 13 to 16 year-olds indicated that prenatal exposure to marihuana does not have an effect on laterglobal IQ, but there is some evidence from one study that it does have a negative effect on tasks thatrequired visual memory, analysis, and integration (Fried et al. , 2003). However, it is possible that this apparent effect might have been due to differences between the groups of marihuana users and non-usersin societal factors such as family income, and proportion of married couples. A recent functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study indicated that these subtle cognitive deficits are mediated byaltered functional activity of both frontal cortices and the right premotor cortex (Smith et al. , 2004). Caffeine 9.22 The neurotoxicological effects of prenatal exposure to caffeine have been addressed in only one study (Barr & Streissguth 1991). The study did not find a negative effect of prenatal caffeine on parameters of IQand attention at 7 years of age. Contaminants that might be present in food Mercury 9.23 An example of a dramatic neuroteratogenic effect of an environmental pollutant was the outbreak of Minamata disease in the 1960s in Minamata, Japan. Pregnant women had been eating fish highlycontaminated with methylmercury. This resulted in a local large increase in the proportion of childrenwho were born with severe developmental disabilities including cerebral palsy, mental retardation andseizures. It has not been entirely clear whether lower levels of prenatal mercury exposure are associatedwith more subtle degrees of cognitive and motor impairment (Davidson et al. , 2004; JECFA, 2003; COT, 2004a) (see Appendix 3). Methylmercury is discussed in detail as an example of risk assessment inChapter 11 (paragraph 11.9) and in Appendix 3. Lead 9.24 Lead is another heavy metal which is highly neurotoxic. Y oung children are especially prone to lead ingestion as they explore the lead-containing environment by means of hand-mouth behaviour. Manystudies have consistently reported that blood lead level shows a strong negative correlation with IQ(Lidsky & Schneider, 2003; see also JECFA, 2000). 79Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 9.25 Other environmental pollutants which may affect the development of the human brain are the PCBs and dioxins. Prenatal exposure to these substances is associated with a reduction in IQ and attention problemsand subtle memory deficits in childhood (Patandin et al. , 1999; Jacobson & Jacobson 2004). The adverse effects of prenatal PCB exposure have been reported in particular in children who had not been breast-fed (Jacobson & Jacobson 2004). Follow-up of a cohort of perinatally exposed children at 6 years of ageindicated that early PCB-exposure at current environmental background levels possibly induces transientdelay in cognitive development rather than irreversible deficit (Winneke et al. , 2005). Conclusions on developmental neurotoxicity in the human 9.26 It is notoriously hard to determine developmental neurotoxicological effects in the human. The source of the difficulty lies in the complex and protracted development of the brain, which is affected not only byspecific chemicals but also by a multifactorial environment. However, this does not mean thatdevelopmental neurotoxicological studies are not possible. Animal data can offer insights into themechanisms of possible developmental neurotoxicological effects and thus provide assistance in thedesign of studies in man. Human studies usually require a prospective design, controlling for manyconfounding factors. 9.27 At present, some medicinal drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, retinoic acid, dexamethasone, coumarin), some recreational drugs (e.g. alcohol, heroin, cocaine, cigarettes) and some environmental pollutants (e.g.,mercury, lead, PCBs) are suspected of having a developmental neurotoxicological effect. Remarkably, someof the adverse neurotoxicological effects of prenatal exposure can be counterbalanced by environmentalfactors such as breast feeding or (in the case of drug-dependent parents) non-parental care. Extrapolation from animals 9.28 Since most data for regulatory developmental neurotoxicity assessment comes from experimental studies in rodents it is necessary to consider the uncertainties involved in extrapolating from rats or mice to man.Although the same general principles of brain development apply to all mammals, rodents are born at arelatively immature state. Approximately 10 days postnatal in rats or mice corresponds to the degree ofmaturity reached around the time of birth in humans, which means that the rodent brain is deprived ofthe protection of the placental barrier to toxic chemicals at an earlier stage of development than is thecase for man. However, not all brain systems develop in parallel, for example the rodent motor systemdevelops relatively rapidly and the auditory and visual systems develop more slowly. Hence there is noage at which the whole rodent brain can be considered to be at a stage of development equivalent to thehuman. These differences in the timing of development can, to some extent, be compensated for inexperimental studies by adjusting the timing of toxicant exposure to correspond with the approximatestage of development that is to be evaluated in man. However, since conception to weaning exposure isthe norm for the toxicological testing of most substances (human pharmaceuticals being an exception),the timing of exposure is usually not a critical consideration and internationally-agreed methodologicalguidelines for developmental toxicity studies performed for regulatory purposes require the timing of 80Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentadministration of the test material to cover the gestation period from implantation until the day prior to full-term of the pregnancy (OECD, 2001). 9.29 A more important factor that generates uncertainty in species extrapolation is the difficulty in finding measures for use in rodent developmental neurotoxicity screens that would be equivalent to some of themore complex disorders of human brain function, such as schizophrenia or autism, since these do nothave exact equivalents in rodents. Although several rodent neurobehavioural tests have been developedthat evaluate subtle functions sufficiently close to those disturbed in human schizophrenia to be of valuein the development of therapeutic drugs (Wolf & Leander, 2003), these require training of experimentalanimals, and would involve a considerable increase in the time and financial cost of developmentalneurotoxicity testing. In addition, some animal models of schizophrenia demonstrate absence of abnormalfindings in early life (when regulatory developmental neurotoxicology assessment is carried out), withsignificant derangement of behaviours characteristic of schizophrenia appearing only in (Al Aminet al. , 2000; Howland et al. , 2004). The relatively simple tests currently employed (habituation of open field activity and Morris water maze learning) do not always detect subtle schizophrenia-like effects(Flagstad et al. , 2005), but would however detect a more widespread disturbance of brain development especially at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) used in toxicological testing. Although several agents areknown that can produce subtle disturbances of brain development in man and rodents, higher doseexposure to these same agents also produces more widespread effects on the brain that would beexpected to be detectable by the measures currently used. The observation that the regulatory rodentdevelopmental neurotoxicity tests carried out on pesticides to date have not set health based guidancevalues lower than those already in place for other end points provides some reassurance. However thisobservation could be interpreted as either a demonstration of the lack of neurotoxicity at low doses orof the insensitivity of the regulatory tests to disturbance of higher cognitive function. Better infomationcomes from comparison of rodent test results with human health outcomes. The few toxic agents (asopposed to psychoactive drugs) that disturb higher brain function and have been evaluated both in manand in animals do provide reassurance that the current x10 interspecies factor provides adequateprotection (see paragraph 11.9 and Appendix 3 on methylmercury) without any need for an additionalfactor specifically for developmental neurotoxicity. However, there are at present relatively few suchexamples, and the area needs to be kept under review. Equally, few chemicals other than pesticides havebeen subject to specific developmental neurotoxicity testing, and the reassurance that can be derivedfrom standard reproductive and multi-generation toxicity testing is limited. Developmental neurotoxicology tests 9.30 Conventional toxicological studies measure some aspects of behaviour such as ability to eat, drink and reproduce. A number of studies have been carried out in which developmental neurotoxicity has beenevaluated by dosing the mother and measuring outcomes in the dams and offspring. The United StatesEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has requested such studies to a specific protocol to beundertaken with neuroactive pesticides, and, in 1991, the USEPA issued a standardised protocol for suchstudies, which has since been revised (USEPA, 1998). Such studies have also been undertaken in othersituations, with compounds such as drugs used in human medicine, although to very variable protocols. Inthe studies they surveyed, Middaugh et al. (2003) found that developmental parameters were more sensitive than maternal parameters in 15% of the studies and offspring behavioural parameters were 81affected by agents in the absence of maternal toxicity in only 3% of cases. These studies of developmental neurotoxicity are complicated and their practical aspects have been reviewed (Cory-Schlecta et al. , 2001). The key features are dosing of laboratory animals through pregnancy and the postnatal period, with directdosing by gavage of the offspring during lactation. In-life endpoints such as sensory function (sensorythresholds or visual processing) and motor function (changes in gait or presence or absence of tremors ormyoclonus) are investigated. Reflexes may test both motor and sensory function. Memory, learning andsocial and sexual behaviour may also be measured. The brains of offspring, depending on the guidelinesused, have to be examined histopathologically at the 11th, 22nd or 60th day post-natally (Garman et al. , 2001) and morphometric analyses carried out. Inevitably regulatory studies of this type represent acompromise between measurement of all endpoints that can be measured, and what is practicable (seereview by Mileson and Ferenc, 2001), and there remain numerous questions relating to the idealexperimental design. To date, nearly all of these studies have been done in the rat, and species other thanrodents and rabbits differ more from humans in respect to placental morphology (Page, 1993), so that therat is a logical choice of animal. Another contentious issue is direct dosing of the unweaned pups bygavage. Exposure of the human fetus depends on whether the xenobiotic crosses the placenta butexposure of unweaned babies may be from non-food sources, a fact which is used to justify direct dosingof the unweaned pups. Furthermore there are practical and logistical problems with such dosing and thereis concern that direct oral dosing of very young pups might result in injury or stress causing effects thatare unrelated to the chemical (Dorman et al. , 2001). 9.31 A corpus of data on the developmental neurotoxicity test in rats, conducted to the USEPA protocol, is being accumulated in the USA (Fenner-Crisp et al. , 2005; Makris, 2005). Some of the evaluations are already available and a draft retrospective analysis has been carried out(http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Developmental-Neurotoxicity-EPA12nov98.htm). One conclusionfrom this is that developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides has not been seen at lower exposure levelsthan has adult neurotoxicity, and that in consequence developmental neurotoxicity testing has notidentified a need to set lower exposure levels. In this respect the pesticides evaluated thus far haveproved less hazardous than agents such as lead or methylmercury. 9.32 One point in relation to neurodevelopmental toxicity that is a matter of controversy is the distinction made between developmental neurotoxicity in the absence or presence of maternal toxicity. Thus if anadverse effect in the young is seen in a developmental neurotoxicity study in the absence of maternaltoxicity it will attract an additional safety factor of x10 in the USA, under the Food Quality Protection Act(USA, 1996). However if the same adverse effect is seen in association with maternal toxicity, it does notusually attract this additional factor. This is because, when the effect is a consequence of maternaltoxicity, protection of the mother against adverse effects, using the default 100-fold safety factor will alsobe protective of the fetus. However, it is important not to assume that developmental effects seen in thepresence of maternal toxicity are consequences of such toxicity. This needs to be clearly establishedbefore concerns about the potential increased susceptibility of the fetus/newborn can be set aside. Thereis certainly evidence that maternal toxicity is very much a factor in human developmental toxicology(e.g. smoking). 82Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEndocrine Modulators 10.1 As with developmental neurotoxicity, endocrine modulation is an area of current concern to the media and the public. This is an evolving area that presents particular problems in hazard identification andcharacterisation. It is an example of model uncertainty in that there are doubts about the generalapplicability of some of the animal data to the human, there are doubts about the usefulness of certainendpoints that have been used in animal models and there are doubts as to whether or not changes insome of these endpoints can be taken as evidence of an adverse effect. For example, studies which haveinvestigated fetal exposure of rodents to estrogenic environmental chemicals may not be easilytranslatable to human health effects because of the very much higher levels of endogenous estrogensthat occur during normal human pregnancy in comparison to rodents. However, even this comparison isnot straightforward because in human pregnancy most of the circulating estrogen is bound to sexhormone-binding globulin (SHBG), whereas in rodents most of the circulating estrogen is in the freeunbound form. In this regard, it is worth noting that much of the concern for potential adverse effects ofestrogenic chemicals on reproductive development and health originates from experimental studies inlaboratory animals, although studies in humans revealed the consequences of fetal exposure todiethylstilbestrol (DES). It is well established in the literature that exposure to high levels of DES results inadverse development of the reproductive system and cancers in both male and female offspring.However, DES is relatively unusual in that it does not bind to SHBG and therefore has availability in thehuman when compared with endogenous estradiol. Other issues such as species differences inabsorption, metabolism and elimination of particular chemicals are also likely to occur depending on thenature of the compound and whether or not it binds to SHBG. Another aspect of the uncertainty relatesto the endpoints, such as ventral prostate weight, uterine weight, which are used in the assessment ofendocrine disruption potential in laboratory animal studies. It is uncertain whether a change in weight ofthese organs after exposure to a particular chemical indicates a truly adverse effect or one that maypredispose to later disease. In addition to these uncertainties, there are other issues related to lack ofreproducibility of results in different laboratories. This has particularly been the case for studies involvinglow dose effects of bisphenol A (Nagel et al. 1997), for which a satisfactory explanation has still not been made (discussed at paragraph 10.8). Possible explanations include differences in mouse strain, housing anddosing regimes. This issue has been the subject of considerable debate by expert groups around the world,most recently by EFSA (EFSA, 2006b). 10.2 Endocrine modulators (EMs) are compounds with the potential to alter hormone production, metabolism or action within the body. This is obviously a very broad and imprecise definition, as under its umbrellacould be included not only various synthetic man-made chemicals but also natural components of thediet such as carbohydrates and sugars, ingestion of which alters hormone levels within the body.Endogenously produced hormones play vital and widespread functions in our everyday lives. Althoughblood levels of various hormones harmlessly fluctuate to some degree as part of the normal functioningof the body, it is well established that for nearly every hormone abnormally low or highproduction/ action can result in disorders and sometimes even death (IPCS 2002). Unintentional exposureto an environmental chemical that is an EM is therefore potentially serious, assuming that the chemical inquestion is able to alter endogenous hormone production or action in a biologically meaningful way. Thepossible effects of plant EMs on health are discussed in the report \"Phytoestrogens and Health\" of theCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food Consumer Products and the Environment (COT, 2003b).10 Endocrine Modulation 83Whether EMs do in fact impact significantly on human health, or whether this is merely a theoretical possibility, is a hotly debated topic in which various factions have expressed strong, opposing views(Sharpe and Irvine, 2004). It is a complex area and one that has been changing dynamically over the pastfew years as new information and understanding emerges. However, there are still many uncertainties andconflicting datasets, which make definitive conclusions difficult to draw (IPCS 2002). Types of Endocrine Modulators 10.3 EMs can come in several guises. The first EMs to be identified, and the class in which more compounds fit than in any other, are those chemicals that have intrinsic hormonal activity i.e. they can bind to andactivate the relevant hormone receptor; such compounds are hormonal agonists (IPCS 2002). The abilityof chemicals to exhibit such activity can be detected in vitro using cell screening assays in which the cell in question expresses the relevant hormone receptor and some sort of response indicator. 10.4 The second class of compounds is similar to the first group in that the chemicals are able to bind to the relevant hormone receptor but in this case they are unable to activate its downstream signalling pathways.Instead, they occupy the receptor and block it from working; such compounds are classed as hormoneantagonists (IPCS 2002). The majority of environmental chemicals that are classed as hormone antagonistsare those that are able to bind to and block the androgen receptor (AR), examples being p'p'-DDE (the mainand persistent metabolite of DDT) and vinclozolin (a fungicide) (Gray et al. , 2001). Although such compounds generally have some measurable antagonistic activity at lower concentrations than do EMsthat are classed as hormonal agonists, it is a general principle that hormone antagonists have to be presentat extraordinarily high concentrations to be able to block action of the relevant endogenous hormone. 10.5 The third class of EMs includes compounds that do not have any intrinsic hormonal or anti-hormonal activity but instead have the capacity to alter the production or metabolism of an endogenous hormone,and thereby to cause an endocrine change within the body (IPCS, 2002; Sharpe & Irvine, 2004). There areseveral major and important differences between this type of compound and the other two groupsmentioned above. The most important difference is that such compounds cannot be detected by anysimple in vitro screening system, as their EM-activity does not involve any intrinsic ability to bind to hormone receptors. Another key aspect of such compounds is that they pose a theoretically greater riskof causing a disorder, because they have the capacity to alter the action of endogenous, potent hormones(Sharpe and Irvine 2004); it is well established that when actions of endogenous hormones occur therecan be health consequences. Another important consideration of such compounds is that because theyalter endogenous hormones, their effect is difficult to distinguish from an abnormality in production oraction of that particular hormone due to other effects in that individual, e.g. due to their lifestyle, geneticmakeup or disease. There are a few examples of environmental chemicals, that possess more than one ofthe above three activities, or the compounds may be metabolised to several metabolites whichindividually may exhibit different EM activity. Examples include PCBs (IPCS 2002). 10.6 There are numerous uncertainties about EMs and it is these that have largely been responsible for fuelling both concern about their potential action and the polarised debate between environmental pressuregroups on the one hand and the chemical manufacturing industries on the other. Screening programmescan be used to identify chemicals with intrinsic hormonal or anti-hormonal activity and this may then allow 84Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentsome degree of risk assessment provided that there are data available on human exposure levels for that chemical; in practice, such information is very often lacking or is inadequate (IPCS 2002). Whether or notsuch EMs do pose a significant risk to humans can however be resolved by undertaking well-structuredinvestigations that establish the level of human exposure and which then can enable estimation of riskbased on measures of hormonal potency derived from in vitro and simple in vivo studies. 10.7 In contrast, identification of EMs that do not possess intrinsic hormonal or anti-hormonal activity, but which perturb endogenous hormones, is more problematical. Such compounds are unlikely to beidentified by any simple screening system and therefore their identification tends to occur as a result oftoxicological or other research investigations using particular classes of compounds in laboratory animalstudies. A good example of how difficult it is to detect such compounds is illustrated by the fact thatidentification of the ability of certain phthalate esters to suppress testosterone production by the fetaltestis (Mylchreest et al. , 1999; Parks et al. , 2000), was only discovered five years ago, despite the well- established testicular toxicity of these compounds and several decades of preceding in-depthinvestigation of the toxicological effects of this class of compound in vitro and in vivo . Establishing the potency of such compounds is also laborious as it depends on rigorous dose-response investigations in vivo using test animals rather than the use of in vitro cell screening systems. 'Low dose' effects of EMs 10.8 One of the most contentious issues regarding EMs is that surrounding the so-called low-dose effects of bisphenol-A in developing male rodents (i.e. effects including increased prostate weight in adulthoodfollowing in utero doses of 20 /H9262g/kg or less). Such effects are disputed as not all studies have found them (IPCS 2002), and their relevance to human male reproductive health concerns is also unclear (Witorsch2002; Sharpe 2003). Hormone levels can also be affected by lifestyle and dietary factors and it is difficultto distinguish between these effects and small effects of exogenous chemicals on hormone levels. Whatis certain is that, if the low-dose effects are real, they cannot result from the intrinsically weakestrogenicity of the compounds in question. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that bisphenolic or otherweakly estrogenic compounds can individually exert effects in humans as a result of their intrinsicestrogenicity at probable levels of exposure. This does not of course rule out the possibility that suchcompounds might exert effects as the result of some other biological activity, but other forms of toxicityhave only been revealed at much higher dosages (in the mg/kg bw/ day range). Chemical mixtures and EM effects 10.9 Though the risk to human health of exposure to individual EMs probably does not pose insurmountable problems or raise any unsolvable uncertainties, this is not the case when considering the potential effectsof combinations of environmental chemicals. In the real world, humans are exposed throughout their livesto a large number of environmental chemicals and it is reasonable to expect that it is the summation ofeffects of various EMs that might be important rather than the level of exposure to any individualcompound (IPCS 2002). This is an intrinsically difficult area to investigate in a rigorous, scientific manner.To date only a few relevant studies have been undertaken, most of which have been in vitro (e.g. Rajapakse et al. , 2002) although there are a small number of relatively simple studies in vivo (Thorpe et al. , 2003; Tinwell and Ashby, 2004). The latter studies have been restricted to compounds which exhibit a similar 85class of activity (estrogenic agonist activity). These studies have shown that when such compounds are combined at doses for which each individual component is below the level at which it will exert an effectitself, the combination of compounds together is then able to induce an effect. The effect appears toexhibit concentration additivity (see COT, 2002b), based on the small number of available studies. 10.10 An even greater problem is posed by studies designed to evaluate the safety of chemical mixtures in which the chemicals that are used exhibit different classes of activity e.g. an estrogen agonist plus an androgenantagonist or with a suppressor of endogenous testosterone production. In such instances it is probablyimpossible to interpret results from such studies as being additive, non-additive or interactive because theendpoint under investigation will not be a simple one that measures the action of an individual hormonebut instead measures change in action of more than one hormone. This is not merely a theoretical issuebut poses a genuine practical problem. For example, there have been several studies (McKinnell et al. , 2001; Rivas et al. , 2002) which indicate that alteration of the balance between androgen and estrogen action in developing male laboratory animals can result in disorders of the reproductive system, and insuch instances it has been shown that it is the balance in action between the two hormones that isimportant, rather than the absolute levels of either hormone (Rivas et al. , 2002). As endocrine systems interact with each other, it is not difficult to imagine that effects of an EM in one system may haveconsequences for another system and that, via such effects, quite complex combined effects may emerge(IPCS 2002; Sharpe and Franks 2002). 10.11 The uncertainty in predicting the effects of mixtures of EMs is an example of toxicodynamic uncertainty, which is a major issue for future research. Mixtures of EMs also present problems for the regulation ofchemicals. On the presumption that chemical mixtures are shown to have effects in toxicological studiesat dose levels at which individual compounds do not have an effect, how will the individual compoundsthen be regulated? This is an issue which is yet to be addressed in any meaningful way but which isundoubtedly one that will become increasingly debated over the coming years. One possibility would beto base risk assessment on the defaults proposed in the COT report on Risk Assessment of Mixtures ofPesticides and Similar Substances (COT, 2002b), as agreed by COT in 2004 (COT, 2004c). Age of exposure to EMs 10.12 The potential effects of EMs depend not only on their potency and the level of exposure, but also on the age at which exposure occurs and perhaps the duration of exposure. Of the latter two, age is by far themost important issue as far as EMs are concerned. The effects of EMs in adults are likely to be reversibleupon cessation of exposure to the EM in question, whereas the exposure of the developing fetus to thesame EM has the potential to induce an irreversible effect which may have lifelong consequences. In the fetus/neonate, the endocrine systems are still developing and their levels of negative feedback control(and other feedback systems), are in the process of being established and thresholds set. Inappropriatelyhigh or low exposure to a hormone at a sensitive stage, may result in abnormal setting up of the endocrinesystem and/ or its feedback regulation. The consequence of such a change is that the endocrine system willfunction abnormally throughout life, this is therefore likely to lead to health consequences (IPCS, 2002). In contrast, exposure of an adult, in which the endocrine system is fully established and mature, will notresult in any reprogramming change even though it may result in a period of altered hormone action. Asmature endocrine systems are intrinsically homeostatic, they have the capacity to make adjustments for 86Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentaltered hormone production or action that may result from exogenous exposures, at least when the effects of such exposures are mild (IPCS, 2002). It is primarily because of this difference in the potentialeffects in fetal and adult life that the risk from EMs is widely accepted as being a developmental issuerather than an issue for adults. There are however exceptions to this. For example, in the aetiology ofbreast cancer, it is well established that lifetime exposure to estrogens is of primary importance andtherefore in this instance lifelong exposure to EMs with estrogenic activity is clearly an issue (Clamp et al. , 2002; The Endogenous Hormones & Breast Cancer Collaborative Group, 2002). Human Data 10.13 Though there are a small number of good examples that indicate that human exposure to environmental chemicals, as a result of accidents resulting in locally high exposure, can cause health consequences (e.g.Dhara and Dhara, 2002; Pesatori et al. , 2003), there are no unequivocal examples that illustrate such effects resulting solely from exposure to an EM and working via an endocrine mechanism. This absenceof clear, direct information is not necessarily conclusive as it can be extremely difficult in human studiesto establish whether or not exposure to a particular chemical has exerted a significant effect (IPCS 2002).Such investigations are epidemiological in nature and are notoriously insensitive when it comes to relatingchemical exposure to endpoint effects, the major stumbling block usually being the lack of goodquantitative exposure data. Even more problematical is the situation when fetal exposure to an EM isthought to exert a health effect that does not manifest itself until adulthood, as in this instance cause andconsequence may be separated by a period of 30 or more years (Sharpe and Franks, 2002). The two areasin which a potential role of EMs has been most debated and investigated has been in relation to breastcancer in women and to the occurrence of developmental disorders of the reproductive system in humanmales. EMs and breast cancer 10.14 As a wide range of common environmental chemicals, both man-made substances and natural plant constituents, have been identified as having intrinsic estrogenic activity, it is logical that due considerationhas been given as to whether human exposure to such compounds might contribute to life-time estrogenexposure and thus increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Most attention has been paid tobioaccumulative EMs that are lipophilic and thus accumulate with time in the fatty tissue of the breastwhere they may exert weak estrogenic action. The chemicals that exhibit such activities are primarilychlorinated compounds of one sort or another, such as organochlorine pesticides (DDT and relatedcompounds) and other chlorinated compounds (e.g. PCBs). The first such study to be undertaken in a smallnumber of women provided evidence of a link between increased exposure to chlorinated compoundsand subsequent risk of breast cancer (Wolff et al. , 2000). 10.15 However, a number of studies since this original one, many of which were much larger and covered longer periods of time, have failed to confirm a significant or conclusive role for such compounds in the risk ofdeveloping breast cancer (Calle et al. , 2002). The COC has reviewed the possible association between organochlorine pesticides and breast cancer on a number of occasions and its most recent statementconcluded that there was no convincing evidence that organochlorines are associated with the developmentof breast cancer (COT, 2004c). Though these findings are reassuring, they leave many uncertainties. For 87example, the potential of mixtures of estrogenic EMs to exert significant effects is a real possibility based on the limited numbers of in vitro and laboratory animal studies that have been undertaken (Rajapakse et al. , 2002; Tinwell and Ashby, 2004). There are a lso concerns about whether exposure to estrogenic EMs early in life, particularly during fetal life, might have a 'reprogramming effect' which might fundamentally altersensitivity of the breast to endogenous estrogens, thus increasing the risk of the individual subsequentlydeveloping breast cancer (Birnbaum and Fenton, 2003; Sharpe and Irvine, 2004). 10.16 Despite all the above uncertainties that relate to EM exposure and risk of breast cancer, it seems intrinsically unlikely that exposure to weakly estrogenic environmental EMs can play as important a rolein determining the risk of breast cancer as do the potent endogenous estrogens that are produced by thewoman herself throughout her reproductive life (Calle et al. , 2002). With this in mind, it is probably more logical to direct concern at exposure to EMs that do not have intrinsic estrogenic activity but which mighthave the ability to alter exposure to endogenous potent estrogens. Two such examples have beenreported in the literature, namely PCBs and certain polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon products ofcombustion. Both of these sets of compounds have been shown to be capable of suppressing the activityof endogenous estrogen sulfotransferase-1 (Kester et al. , 2000 which normally sulphates estradiol prior to its excretion. Suppression of the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result inprolongation of the half life of estradiol and thus alter its potential to act on estrogen-sensitive tissues,such as the breast; such changes would occur without there being any change in the actual production ofendogenous estradiol. However, it is unknown whether exposure to such compounds is sufficient toinduce significant changes to estrogen exposure via such a route in the human. 10.17 There is also growing evidence that local production of estradiol within breast tissue may be an important factor in regulating estrogen exposure of the breast and thus of influencing risk of developing breastcancer (Suzuki et al. , 2002; Simpson 2004). Therefore, intake of EMs that have the ability to alter activity of aromatase {e.g. tributyl inbreast tissue, may represent other routes via which estrogen action on the breast may be modulatedlocally (Zheng et al. , 2001; Coughtrie, 2002; Suzuki et al. , 2002). There are considerable logistic difficulties in distinguishing such effects from naturally occurring variation in estrogen levels between individualwomen, and at different phases of the menstrual cycle and at different phases of life. The potential forEMs that exert such effects to differentially affect individuals who may have differences in their ability tometabolise estrogens, for example due to a polymorphism in one or more genes encoding enzymesinvolved in estrogen metabolism (Coughtrie, 2002), is another area that merits investigation but which canonly be speculated about at present. EMs and Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome 10.18 The second area of human health for which effects of EMs have been debated is testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which comprises various reproductive disorders, notably low sperm counts and testiculargerm cell cancer in young adult men and incomplete testicular descent (cryptorchidism) and abnormalopening of the urethral meatus on the penis (hypospadias) (Skakkebaek et al. , 2001). The reason why EMs have been invoked as potentially playing a role in these disorders is not because of any conclusivedirect evidence but because it is established that abnormal hormone production or action in fetal life is an important factor leading to development of all of these disorders. Suppression of testosterone 88Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentproduction or action and/ or increased estrogen exposure during fetal life are risk factors for development of each of these disorders (Sharpe, 2003; Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 2003). Though humans are exposed tonumerous EMs which have intrinsic anti-androgenic activity (e.g. DDE, vinclozolin) or those with estrogenicactivity (e.g. bisphenolic and alkylphenolic compounds, chlorinated chemicals), it is probably unlikely thatexposure of the fetus to such compounds is sufficient to disrupt normal androgen-dependent malereproductive development (Sharpe, 2003). This conclusion is based largely on studies in laboratory animalsin which it has been shown that only exposure to very high doses of potent EMs with estrogenic or anti-androgenic activity is able to exert adverse effects on male reproductive development, and none of thesehas been shown to cause the combination of disorders comprising TDS (Toppari et al. , 1996; Sharpe, 2003; Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 2003). 10.19 In contrast, recent animal data has shown that exposure of rats during pregnancy to high levels of certain phthalate esters is able to induce in the male offspring a collection of disorders that is remarkably similarto TDS in humans (Mylchreest et al. , 1999; Fisher et al. , 2003), and this includes similar phenotypic changes to testicular structure and cellular development (Fisher et al. , 2003). Another change induced by phthalate exposure in fetal life in rats is a substantial reduction in anogenital distance, which is an androgen-dependent parameter, and which is normally approximately twice as large in males as in females. This isyet another example of a class of chemicals that do not have intrinsic hormonal or anti-hormonal activitybut which are able to alter production of endogenous hormones, in this case the production oftestosterone and insulin-like factor 3 by Leydig cells in the fetal testis. These two hormones are togetherresponsible for testicular descent and for wider aspects of the masculinisation process. Human exposureto phthalate esters is widespread as such compounds are present in air, rainwater and in numerousmaterials and formulations to which humans are exposed on a daily basis. A number of recent studies havebegun to document the level of human exposure to phthalate esters and these have indicated thatwomen of reproductive age and children may be particularly highly exposed (Blount et al. , 2000; Koch, 2003; NHANES, 2003). Nevertheless, the levels of exposure still fall substantially below those which havebeen used extensively in the above-mentioned laboratory animal studies. However, a recent study inhumans has produced preliminary evidence to suggest that phthalate exposure during pregnancy may beassociated with a reduction in anogenital distance in boys (Swan et al. , 2005). This finding requires confirmation, but if it should prove to be true it would indicate that far lower levels of phthalates are ableto exert 'anti-androgenic'effects in the human fetus than have been shown so far to occur in laboratoryrats. There are however several uncertainties. For example, humans are exposed to a mixture of phthalatesand therefore the summation of effects has to be taken into consideration; this poses some of theproblems discussed earlier relating to the evaluation of mixture effects. Second, it is possible thatexposure to phthalates may suppress endogenous testosterone and that such a change in combinationwith altered exposure to pregnancy estrogens (e.g. as a consequence of exposure to other EMs) mightinteract to increase the risk of developing TDS; interaction with other lifestyle effects or the geneticpredisposition of the mother or fetus might also be important factors. 10.20Aside from the data on phthalate esters, there are other pieces of information which more directly indicate that human exposure to environmental chemicals can result in permanent changes to thereproductive system/testis of the developing male with life-long consequences. First, two recentepidemiological studies have identified that male offspring born to woman who smoked during pregnancy have substantially smaller testes and lower sperm counts in adulthood than do the offspring 89of mothers who did not smoke (Storgaard et al. , 2003; Jensen et al. , 2004). The mechanism underlying this effect is not established but clearly points to altered numbers of Sertoli cells in the developing testis. Recent evidence from laboratory animal studies indicates that lowered androgen action during thisperiod in life can result in similar reduction in Sertoli cell number (Johnston et al. , 2004). Based on understanding of the interaction of some of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in tobaccosmoke with the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor provides at least a theoretical pathway via whichsuppression of androgen action in the fetal testis might be induced via an EM-like mechanism (e.g.. Kizu et al., 2003). Second, there are two recent studies which reported higher levels of organochlorine chemicals, such as PCBs, in mothers of men with testicular cancer, the latter being one of the manifestations of TDS(Hardell et al. , 2003 & 2004). 10.21 With all of the examples for which possible involvement of EMs in human disorders are debated, there is great uncertainty about how to distinguish such effects from those that may be due to altered diet,lifestyle and/ or social changes that have occurred dramatically during the last century or so (Sharpe andIrvine, 2004). These changes have undoubtedly had major impact on various aspects of human health andquite notably on endogenous endocrine systems. For example, the increased prevalence of obesity inWestern societies will have quite dramatic consequences on the endogenous hormonal environment.Most obviously it affects various aspects of the hormonal systems that regulate glucose metabolism andfat deposition but these also have important interactions with sex steroids in a number of different ways(Haffner, 1996; Sharpe & Franks, 2002). For example, the aromatase enzyme is expressed in fat cells and itis well established that increasing obesity leads to increased expression of aromatase in such cells withconsequent increase in capacity to produce estradiol from precursor androgens (Simpson, 2003). This willhave implications for the risk of developing breast cancer. Similarly, such alterations in pregnant womanand associated changes in insulin resistance (due to obesity and consumption of a diet high in refinedsugars) can lead to alteration in production of endogenous sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) to whichboth androgens and estrogens normally bind during circulation in the bloodstream. Alteration of SHBGproduction changes the bioavailability of androgens and estrogens and this may thus alter exposure of thefetus to these same hormones (Sharpe and Franks, 2002; Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 2003). However, this islargely theoretical speculation because of the considerable difficulties in establishing the extent to whichmaternal diet and lifestyle changes might affect hormone levels/ exposure in the fetus, and it is even moreproblematical to imagine how such effects might be distinguished from the potential effects resultingfrom exposure to exogenous EMs. Animal Data 10.22 There are several well-established examples in which exposure of certain wildlife species to environmental chemicals has been shown to result in health-related changes in individuals andpopulations as a result of disruption of one or more endocrine systems. Some of these might be directlyrelevant to man but in many instances they are probably not of direct relevance, for example those thatinvolve exposures of aquatic animals via water. The most dramatic effects of environmental endocrinedisrupters have been observed in aquatic systems. Though these are not be directly relevant to man interms of the exposures involved, they provide examples of the mechanisms via which widespread adverseeffects in vulnerable populations may be induced, and the lessons to be learned from these might berelevant to human concerns in this area. The two most clear-cut examples and those with the widest 90Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentprevalence are: 1) induction of imposex in certain marine snails, 2) the induction of intersex in male fish in various rivers in Europe and North America. 10.23 Imposex is a world-wide problem that results from exposure of susceptible species to organo-tin compounds, such as tributyl tin compounds, which are used as anti-fouling agents on ships (Evans &Nicholson, 2000; IPCS, 2002). Exposure to these compounds results in suppression of the aromataseenzyme in female snails with consequent build up of precursor androgens in these animals; this results indevelopment of the vestigial penis which in turn results in mating and fertility problems. This is anotherexample of an EM which has no intrinsic hormonal or anti-hormonal activity but which perturbs thenormal endogenous hormonal environment (Sharpe & Irvine, 2004). Another recent study has shown thatpregnant sheep that were reared on pasture fertilized using sewage sludge exhibited adverse effects ongrowth and testicular development in male fetuses. In this instance, there would have been exposure toa wide range of environmental chemicals that are present in the sewage sludge, and this could be viewedas to some extent mimicking the real world chemical environment in which we live. These examples arerelevant to man in a general sense but the obvious uncertainties are whether or not humans are exposedto the same mixtures of chemicals and at comparable levels as occur in the various situations in whicheffects on wildlife or experimental animals have been demonstrated. In contrast, induction of intersex inmale fish appears to result directly from exposure to EMs with intrinsic estrogenic activity. However, themain culprits in most instances appear not to be environmental EMs as such, but instead appear to be thepotent estrogens, estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (used in the contraceptive pill or in hormonereplacement therapy) that are excreted in the urine of women and which then find their way into riverwater via sewage effluent (Jobling et al. , 2002; IPCS, 2002). Though the exact mechanism via which this exogenous estrogen exposure results in intersex in fish is still unclear, it appears to involve adevelopmental mechanism and in certain general respects the resulting changes to the testis andreproductive tract in affected males have similarities to TDS in humans, as discussed above. Such parallelshave added to the debate and concern about EMs and have helped fuel speculation about whether similarEM exposure in the human might play a role in TDS. However, though the human fetus also inhabits anaquatic environment, the level of EMs in this environment is determined by the level of exposure of themother, rather than by the ambient EM burden. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to consider that the humanfetus may be exposed to the same potent (pregnancy) estrogens in its aquatic environment as are fishliving in river water in which sewage effluent is discharged. The extent to which the human fetus is actuallyexposed to pregnancy estrogens, and how this might vary depending on lifestyle or chemical exposuresof the mother (e.g. to EMs that affect estrogen metabolising enzymes) is unknown, but is potentiallyimportant (Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 2003; Sharpe & Irvine, 2004). 10.24There are a number of other examples in which disorders of reproductive/ sexual development and function in wildlife have been shown to occur with clear evidence of relationship to exposure toenvironmental chemicals and/ or EMs. Examples are alligators in Lake Apopka (Guillette and Gunderson,2001), and a variety of changes in birds and in top predator animals such as polar bears (IPCS, 2002; Skaareet al. , 2002; Oskam et al. , 2003). However, in many of these instances it is not clear whether individual chemicals are responsible for the observed effects or whether it is a combination of exposure to mixturesof chemicals that is responsible (IPCS, 2002). It might be argued that evaluation of top predators such asthe polar bear would be a wildlife animal model that has most parallels with the human. 91In Vitro Data 10.25 Large amounts of data are routinely generated comparing the effects of chemicals on binding to the estrogen receptors, transcriptional activation of estrogen related genes and proliferation of cells,mediated through ligand binding to their estrogen receptors, in vitro . However, no risk assessment process has been developed that allows those data to be used for human exposure to estrogen-like chemicals. 10.26A hygiene-based margin of safety (HBMOS) model for xeno-oestrogens exposure has been proposed for comparing chemicals with estrogen-like activity, mediated via the estrogen receptor, taking into accounttheir potency and comparing this to the levels of estogen-like potency for well establishes dietary intakesof phytoestrogens (the isoflavones genestein and daidzein), considered to be acceptable for humanconsumption (Bolt et al. , 2001). 10.27 This approach has been used to benchmark the potential endocrine modulating effects of chemicals with very weakly estrogenic activity, such as the parabenzoic acid esters, against the potent endocrinedisruptors diethylstilbestrol, and 17 /H9252-estradiol. This confirms the safety of human exposure to parabenzoic acid esters (Golding et al. , 2005). 10.28In terms of estimating the increased exposure of humans to estrogen-like food ingredients, the cumulative exposure and potency of estrogen-like substances has been modelled for exposure to isoflavones infortified food (Safford et al. , 2003). This exposure modelling is unique in that it considers both sexes and vulnerable subgroups within the population, based on their endogenous hormonal status, which differsconsiderably. It allows a consideration of the influence of additional estradiol-like chemicals/ingredientson the total estrogen body load for sub-populations using sensitivity analysis. Using this approach therelative variability in exposure measurements, and hence the uncertainty in likely biological effects, dueto exposure, can be estimated. However, there is growing evidence that the effect of phytoestrogens in vivo is dependent very much on the endogenous hormonal environment, such that in certain situations the phytoestrogens act as estrogen antagonists rather than agonists. There is presently uncertainty as towhat factors precisely determine whether or not the phytoestrogens will exhibit agonistic or antagonisticproperties and until our understanding is improved, this will mean that attempts to model such effectswill have their limitations. Conclusions on Endocrine Modulation /circle6It that alterations in androgen exposure play pivotal roles inthe aetiology of breast cancer and TDS disorders in humans. /circle6If environmental chemicals are able to alter estrogen or androgen exposure in humans, there is thepossibility that they may alter risk of developing these disorders. 92Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment/circle6Based on current understanding, and the comparative hormonal potency of EMs and endogenous androgens and estrogens, it seems most likely that factors which alter endogenous hormoneproduction or metabolism, and thereby hormone action, are intrinsically more likely to pose a healthrisk to humans. Such effects are perhaps more likely to result from changing lifestyle than fromexposure to EMs, but distinguishing one from the other is extremely difficult. /circle6If EMs do exert effects in humans, they are most likely to occur in fetal or perinatal life and such effectswould be likely to have life-long consequences. 93Introduction 11.1 Since the objective of regulatory toxicology is to avoid harmful exposures, it is difficult to investigate the adequacy of the procedures used, because if the risk assessment is correct, it will successfully prevent theadverse effects of interest. An \"absence\" of effects is thus necessarily difficult to evaluate and by the sametoken it is difficult to establish if the assessment was over-cautious. For chemicals that are present in foodor the environment, it would be less hard to detect insufficiently cautious assessments, but the difficultyin detecting adverse outcomes and retrospectively relating any suspected events to exposure or dosemeans that this is not always possible. Similarly a small increase in the incidence of a particular eventmight go unremarked or be dismissed as an intercurrent illness unless there was clear evidence of recentexposure to a particular chemical. Association between chronic and/ or delayed illness and exposurewould be less likely be suspected than if exposure was acute and the effects seems shortly thereafter.Consequently, opportunities for the validation of toxicity assessments by means of human healthoutcomes are rare. Thus risk assessment is particularly difficult to validate for food chemicals, in contrastto medicines, where dosage is likely to be known and a connection between exposure and adverse effectsis more likely to be made. 11.2 Sometimes toxic effects are seen in humans, and when the dose is known, these instances can be used to check the accuracy of extrapolations from animal studies. In other cases inadvertent over-exposuregenerates human toxicity data. Thus, for example, most cases of poisoning by over-dosage with the insectrepellent DEET were in young girls, a special sensitivity which was accurately reflected in studies in whichit was found to be especially toxic to female rats and to young rats, albeit at very high doses (Verschoyleet al. , 1992). 11.3 Two instances of well-defined poisoning incidents in which a known dietary exposure was excessive provide good evidence that the standard assessment was correct. Wu et al. (2001) studied four persons who developed acute cholinergic signs after consuming vegetables with abnormally high residues ofmethamidophos. The residue levels in leftovers from the meals of those poisoned were between 52 and510 times the JMPR maximum residue limit (MRL) for methamidophos residues in leaf vegetables (MRLs forother vegetables were set at the same or lower concentrations), which suggests that the MRL was notunreasonably high. In a second case, contamination of food with methomyl prior to cooking led to 107persons being poisoned (Buchholz et al. , 2002). In this case the dose consumed by those poisoned could be estimated from the level of contamination of the cooking salt and from salt usage, and the authorswere then able to estimate an ED 50for production of signs of poisoning (0.09-0.31 mg/kg). This may be compared to the JMPR ARfD for methomyl of 0.02 mg/kg (itself based on a human volunteer NOAEL of0.1 mg/kg). The clinical poisoning data (necessarily somewhat imperfect) indicate that a sufficient marginof safety was incorporated into the original toxicological assessment. Although five children became ill,adults were more likely to be poisoned than children (odds ratio 3.5) suggesting that children were not anespecially vulnerable group in this situation. 11.4 The most difficult challenges for validation of toxicological testing come from delayed or chronic effects, where the cause of the adverse effect may be hard to identify in man. This is particularly true forcarcinogens and teratogens, where there is a necessary delay between exposure and detection of effect.The potential for teratogenic effects of the anticonvulsant medicine valproate was first predicted on the11 Adequacy of Current Approaches 94Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentbasis of tests carried out in mice, which showed a smaller difference between the minimum teratogenic and minimum toxic doses for valproate than for phenytoin (Brown et al. , 1980). This prediction was unfortunately confirmed by subsequent epidemiological studies, which showed increased prevalence ofspina bifida and other birth defects in children born to mothers who took valproate during pregnancy(Kalter, 2004). 11.5 In the absence of measures of effect at low exposures it is occasionally possible to use tissue residues (internal dose) to compare animal and human exposures. Thus, concentrations of polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs) have been measured in brains and adipose tissue of rats used for toxicology assessments(Lilienthal et al. , 2000) and also in human still births, the only source of human brain material available (Lanting et al. , 1998). Comparing means with means and assuming that the four marker congeners make up about 60% of total PCBs in man, rats at the lowest adverse dose level have about 20 times higher tissuelevels than in human stillbirths. Thus an exposure margin of about 20 is obtained for a comparisonbetween mean rat data and a human population at the most susceptible stage of development. However,the relevance of this observation is limited since it cannot be related to functional consequences. Evaluation of the Default Uncertainty Factor 11.6 Good quality exposure data in humans are available only rarely so that a NOAEL can only exceptionally be estimated from human data. The 10-fold interspecies factor which is applied to the dose expressed ona body weight basis (e.g. mg/kg body weight) has to allow for both toxicokinetic differences in organblood flow and metabolic activity. This factor has been criticised on a number of grounds. The samegeneric 10-fold inter-species factor is applied to data from all test species, despite the fact that there aresmaller differences in many aspects of physiology and metabolism between dogs or primates and humans,than between rats or mice and humans. It has been suggested that uncertainty factors of about 4 and 10would be necessary for rats and mice just to allow for differences in renal and hepatic blood flowscompared to humans (Renwick 1993). It has been proposed that interspecies comparisons should be onthe basis of surface area rather than body weight (Davidson et al. , 1986; Calabrese et al. , 1992; Kalberlah and Schneider, 1998), which would result in a different default adjustment factor for each species. Theappropriateness of the 10-fold inter-species factor is difficult to assess without dose-response data fortoxic responses in humans, and fortunately such data are rare. Animal data would not be used for riskassessment in cases where relevant data on humans are available. 11.7 The use of a 10-fold uncertainty factor for interspecies differences is supported by the data on paracetamol, which undergoes metabolic bioactivation via CYP2E1 and CYP1A2. Differences in thisactivation step account, almost entirely, for the ten-fold higher sensitivity to paracetamol of mice,compared to rats (Tee et al. , 1987). A single dose of 1g has been taken safely by millions of people for its analgesic properties. There are marked species differences in sensitivity to the hepatotoxicity ofparacetamol due to differences in the rate of conversion to its cytotoxic metabolite. The mean activity ofhumans is less than that of the rat and even the most sensitive humans have lower metabolic activity thanthe mouse at activating paracetamol (Boobis et al. , 1992). The NOAEL in rat is >1000 mg/kg, whilst in mice it is 150 mg/kg. It has been estimated that the NOAEL in humans is around 200 mg/kg, although there isconsiderable inter-individual variability that relates to differences in the rate of activation, the amount ofglutathione available for conjugating the cytotoxic metabolite and the rate of its clearance. There are 95some subjects who can tolerate almost 1000 mg/kg without harm (Prescott, 2001). It is likely that the NOAEL in the average human is greater than 200 mg/kg, as this estimate is from patients who werehospitalised (Boobis et al. , 1992). These data suggest that humans are of similar sensitivity to the more sensitive species and support the use of a 10-fold uncertainty factor, which assumes that humans are 10-times more sensitive than the most sensitive test animal species. 11.8 There have been numerous reviews of the appropriateness of the 10-fold factor for human variability, based on human variability in kinetics and Attempts have been made to quantify what proportion of the human population would be protected by these safety factors. The analyses of Renwick and Lazarus (1998) indicated that the 10-folduncertainty factor for human variability would cover the vast majority of exposed individuals assuming anormal or a log-normal distribution 3(such models would not cover 100% of a population unless the uncertainty factor is infinity). Gaylor and Kodell (2000) suggested that these factors should ensure thatthe resultant health based guidance value (e.g. ADI) would be below the threshold value for harm inbetween 92 and > 98% of the human population. The studies of Dorne et al. , (2003 a,b; 2004 a,b; 2005) used a log-normal distribution to model human variability in kinetics and concluded that for compoundsdependent upon simple monomorphic processes for their kinetics, an even higher percentile of thepopulation would be protected by a toxicokinetic uncertainty factor of 10 0.5(see below). The data on therapeutic drugs indicate that the current uncertainty factor is a reasonable default value and wouldcover the normal human population to greater than 99%. However the usual 10-fold factor would notallow adequately for human variability when there is a genetic polymorphism in the main (>70% of thedose) route of elimination. Also differences between healthy adults and some subgroups of thepopulation (such as preterm infants), may not be covered adequately. Differences between humanneonates and human adults would not need to be allowed for by the uncertainty factor for humanvariability if there were a developmental study in neonatal animals, because the interspecies comparisonwould take into account any risk related to immaturity, providing that the neonatal rat was at least asimmature as the neonatal human. Methylmercury 11.9 Methylmercury is an example of a compound where there are toxicological data in both humans and animals (COT, 2003). Knowledge of the neurotoxicity of methylmercury in human adults predated anysystematic study of methylmercury toxicity in animals. The first animal studies (in the 1940s) reproducedthe neurotoxicity seen in adults, but potential developmental neurotoxicity was not investigated. Severaloutbreaks of unexpected human developmental neurotoxicity were described subsequently.Developmental neurotoxicity was reproduced in several species of experimental animal, although thedatabase in animals is, by comparison with regulated chemicals, defective in particular with respect todevelopmental neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, had it been necessary to set a Provisional Tolerable Weekly 96Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 3 The distribution of many biological variables are described by such models. An example is the height of humans, for which a no rmal distribution give a reasonable discription of the distribution of heights around the average but is less reliable for describin g extremes of height. A normal distribution suggests that a few people would be extremely tall (eg taller than 30 feet), which is clearly not the case. Intake (PTWI) on the basis of the animal data, it is likely that it would have been similar to or below that established by JECFA on the basis of the human data. This analysis provides support for the default 100-fold uncertainty factor, as described in detail in Appendix 3. 9712.1 In the conventional \"threshold\" approach that is frequently used in toxicological assessments, it is assumed that none of the adverse effects of the substance being assessed occur below a threshold doseand NOAELs from studies are used to identify health-based guidance values/reference doses. There areseveral alternative approaches that can be used in certain circumstances, such as situations in which athreshold cannot be assumed (eg. genotoxic carcinogens) or when there are insufficient data available toidentify NOAELs for all of the critical toxicological endpoints. Some of these alternative approaches arediscussed and compared with the conventional threshold approach in the text below and at the end ofthis Chapter in Table 12.1. Refining the Uncertainty Factor Approach Chemical Specific Adjustment Factors (CSAFs) 12.2 The recognition that the 100-fold safety/uncertainty factor could be considered to represent two 10-fold factors allowed some flexibility in its application, because different factors could be applied to theNOAEL from a study in humans and from a study in animals. The concept of chemical-specific adjustmentfactors (CSAFs) was introduced to allow appropriate data on species differences or human variability ineither toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics to modify the relevant 10-fold uncertainty factor. 12.3 Incorporation of toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic data becomes possible if each 10-fold factor is sub-divided into appropriately weighted factors (Figure 12.1). Figure 12.1. Subdivision of the 10-fold uncertainty factors to allow for species differences and human variability in toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics (based on IPCS, 1994) 100 - FOLD UNCERTAINTY FACTOR INTER-SPECIES DIFFERENCES 10 - FOLD TOXICO- DYNAMIC AD UF 100.4 DIFFERENCES 10 - FOLD12 Other Approaches 98Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Chemical specific data can be used to replace a default uncertainty factor (UF) by an adjustment factor (AF). A - animal to human; H - human variability; D - toxicodynamics; K - toxicokinetics12.4 The weighting given in the subdivision of each 10-fold factor was discussed at an IPCS meeting in 1994, and the values shown in Figure 12.1 were proposed as suitable defaults. The inter-species subdivision wasunequal to reflect the inherent physiological differences between rodents and humans in basic processes,such as renal and hepatic blood-flow which have been discussed above. The even subdivision of the humanvariability factor was based on an analysis of data on therapeutic drugs. The total uncertainty factor thatwould be used in risk assessment would be the composite value obtained on multiplying the CSAF, used toreplace one of the four sub-factors, by the remaining unmodified values for which suitable data were notavailable. In this way chemical specific data in one area, such as an inter-species PBPK model, could beintroduced quantitatively into the derivation of the ADI/TDI, and data would replace uncertainty. 12.5 The types of chemical-specific data that would be suitable to replace one of the default values has been discussed at a series of international meetings, held as part of an IPCS project on the Harmonization ofApproaches to the Risk Assessment of Risk from Exposure to Chemicals. The proposals have beenpublished and made available for comment on the IPCS website (IPCS, 2005). 12.6 The interspecies default factors could be replaced by data that adequately defined the difference in the mean parameter estimates between the test species in the study giving the NOAEL and adult humans. Thechoice of the appropriate parameter estimate for toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics would relate to thenature of exposure in the study giving the NOAEL and the critical effect that was the basis for definingthe NOAEL. Adequate data would provide a reliable measurement of the central tendency for theparameter in the test species at the NOAEL and in humans at relevant intakes, i.e. the predicted intake (seeIPCS, 2005 for further details). 12.7 The default factors for human variability could be replaced by data that defined the variability in the relevant parameter estimates in healthy human adults, including the influence of any functional geneticpolymorphism, and in addition the variations between different age groups if necessary (see above). Alsoallowance could be made for the fact that for highly lipid soluble compounds the ratio of tissueconcentration to body burden is likely to be influenced by fat as a proportion of body weight.A mathematical model of human variability would need to be defined and a percentile of the distribution,such as a 90th, 95th or 97.5th percentile selected to replace the default (see IPCS, 2005, for furtherdetails). 12.8 The concept of subdividing the 10-fold uncertainty factors has been used in two recent evaluations. In the case of dioxins, the interspecies comparison was based on body burden, such that the default interspecieskinetic uncertainty factor was not needed and AKUF became 1. It was considered that the tissue responsein the most sensitive human would be no greater than the test species, so that ADUF and HDUF became1. In consequence the total composite factor became 1 x 1 x 1 x 3.2 = 3.2. In this case the extensive databaseon dioxins could be used to provide a numerical interpretation in 3 of the 4 areas of uncertainty (JECFA, 2002). In the case of methylmercury, the critical data were derived from epidemiological studiesso that interspecies factors were not relevant (see Chapter 10). The default factor for human variability in toxicodynamics was considered not to be necessary because the NOAEL/BMD was based onconcentrations in blood or hair detected in a large epidemiology database of the most sensitive subgroupof the population, so that HD UFbecame 1 (IPCS, 2005). 9912.9 The proposed toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic approach has not been designed to accommodate information from in vitro and in silico studies. Further consideration of how such data may be taken into account is needed. Benchmark dose (BMD) 12.10 The benchmark dose (BMD) is defined as the dose producing a predetermined (e.g. 5% or 10%) incidence of an adverse effect, and is derived by statistical modelling of the dose response data (EPA, 2003). Bothquantal data (e.g. lethality, presence of tumours) and continuous data (e.g. change in liver weight in a dosegroup) can be evaluated with the BMD approach. The lower 95% confidence interval of the BMD isreferred to as the BMDL. Early references to this approach used the term BMD for the lower confidencelimit, but BMDL is now preferred as it is considered clearer (Crump, 1995; EPA, 2003) and this is beingadopted more widely (FAO/WHO, 2005; EFSA, 2005a). EFSA has set up a Scientific committee on the Useof the Benchmark Dose Approach in Risk Assessment to advise on the advantages and limitations of theuse of the BMDL in place of the NOAEL and to provide an opinion on the preferred approach to be usedfor risk assessments conducted by EFSA's Panels and Expert Groups (EFSA, 2005b). 12.11 The BMD approach is used as an alternative to the NOAEL. It makes use of all of the dose-response data (Crump, 1984). The NOAEL is an observed value that is dependent on study design and which makes littleuse of the effects detected at doses above the NOAEL, other than to identify the nature of the hazard.The BMD approach avoids the problems associated with the NOAEL (see Chapter 7) by fitting amathematical model to all of the dose-response data to derive the dose associated with a predefinedlevel of response (the benchmark response [BMR]) and its associated uncertainty. In consequence theBMD is less dependent on study design, dose spacing or even group size, while well conducted studieswith low variability are \"rewarded\" with higher BMDL values. Another major advantage of the BMDapproach is that an estimate of the BMD can be obtained using data from an otherwise satisfactory studyin which a NOAEL was not found and all dose levels produced some level of response above controls. 12.12 The validity of the BMD approach is dependent on the number of points to which the model was fitted, and ideally there should be 3-4 doses showing graded responses. One problem with the BMD is thatcurrent study designs and testing guidelines are designed to provide reliable estimates of the NOAELrather than defining the shape of the dose-response relationship. The BMD approach offers no advantagesin cases where the response is observed at the top dose only. An additional problem is selection of thelevel at which the BMR should be set. In the typical subchronic and long-term study on a pesticide, thehighest dose used is a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the lowest dose is designed to be a no-effectdose, so that the dose response curve is based upon the high and medium doses only. This situation is notideal for the calculation of a BMDL. 12.13 The BMD approach is reliant on statistics and the accuracy and validity of the model being used. As such, it is important to select the appropriate model structure for the data being analysed. For thresholdeffects, the BMDL can be used as an alternative to the NOAEL as the basis for calculating an ADI or TDI,by the application of the usual uncertainty factors (see above but the use of a BMDL raises acommunication difficulty, because it is not a dose apparently without any effect, but the lowerconfidence interval on the dose associated with a predefined response above controls). In reality, the 100Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentoutcome would be very similar to that derived using a NOAEL, but with a better characterised starting point. Indeed, the NOAEL may not be a level of intake at which there is a complete absence of anyresponse, it is simply the level at which a response is no longer observable under the experimentalconditions (see also Chapter 7). For non-threshold effects, such as (it is assumed) carcinogenicityproduced by a mutagenic compound, the BMDL can be used as the starting point for linear low-doseextrapolation or for calculation of a margin of exposure (FAO/WHO 2005). Characterising Uncertainty Margin of Exposure approach (MOE) 12.14 In some instances, where there are too many gaps in the toxicological data to allow a Tolerable Daily Intake to be established, scientific advisory committees have used a MOE approach, for example incommenting on dietary exposure to certain brominated flame retardants (COT, 2004b). The margin ofexposure (MOE) is calculated as the ratio between a defined point on the dose-response curve for theadverse effect, often the NOAEL or BMD, and the human intake. 12.15 In evaluating whether an MOE is high enough to conclude that a chemical is unlikely to cause harm the usual toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic uncertainties related to species differences and potential humanvariability associated with the data must be taken into account. Choosing the acceptable margin betweenthe critical point on the dose response curve and exposure presents similar difficulties to choosing an UFin an ADI calculation. When the starting point for the derivation of an MOE is the NOAEL or the BMD,there is very little difference in risk assessment using the MOE as compared with the ADI, and the choiceis often as much historical as scientific. It should be noted that with the MOE, the uncertainty factor isexplicit (the MOE) whilst for the ADI it is integral in the calculation since it is the factor used to derive theADI from the critical NOAEL or BMD. Nevertheless with both approaches the uncertainty factor shouldbe made explicit by toxicologists and risk managers. 12.16 In calculating the MOE, there is no necessity to use the NOAEL, and any appropriate defined point on the dose-response curve would be suitable. The MOE can be used without making any implicit assumptionsabout safety. This approach can be used for contaminants where there is evidence of a threshold responsebut not enough evidence to derive a TDI (in which case an MOE larger than 100 would normally berequired), or for non-threshold effects where the response at human exposures is not known, and cannotbe modelled appropriately. For non-threshold effects, the MOE provides a simple and practical approachthat avoids the scientific uncertainties associated with the selection of a mathematical model for low-dose extrapolation, and doubts about its biological relevance at low doses. The reliability of the MOE setfor a substance would depend upon the adequacy of the database, and the possibility of cytoprotectionand repair processes might need to be considered. When used for non-threshold effects, the MOE isintended to provide risk managers with more helpful information than the ALARP approach described inChapter 3. It can be useful as a tool for ranking the possible risks from a series of hazards or exposuresituations. 12.17 The MOE approach can be used in the risk assessment of mixtures of chemicals with similar modes of action but different potencies, by calculating the total margin of exposure (MOE T). Here the combined 101MOE (MOET) is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of the MOEs for the various compounds (Wilkinson et al. , 2000). 12.18 It is often said that the margin of exposure that would be considered acceptable is a societal judgement and should not be determined by risk assessors alone. Indeed, use of the MOE can enable completeseparation of risk assessment from risk management. The risk assessor would provide the risk managerwith the margin of exposure and the risk manager would decide on its acceptability. However, riskassessors have the responsibility to inform risk managers on the nature of the hazard, at the critical andpossibly other endpoints, the quality of the data, the uncertainties inherent in the data used for intakeestimates and the magnitudes of the margins of exposure. In evaluating the potential health consequencesof the MOE for a given exposure, due consideration needs to be given to the toxicokinetic andtoxicodynamic uncertainties in extrapolating across species and individuals. Probabilistic modelling 12.19 Probabilistic methods use mathematical or statistical models to express the relationship between factors and variables relevant for exposure assessment, hazard characterisation or risk assessment. Variability anduncertainty in the input values of the variables is expressed by using probability distributions of values, asdistinct from a single (eg. \"worst case\") value for each variable. Outputs are also expressed in terms ofprobability distributions that reflect the combined probabilities of the input data (eg. exposure data); it ispossible to use this output distribution to estimate the proportion of the population at a particularexposure level. This method may give a more realistic representation of the risk being assessed than currentmethods which use a single value or \"point estimate\" . In addition, probabilistic modelling facilitatessensitivity analyses of which factors have the most influence on the result. Probabilistic modelling has beenused for exposure estimations, where there is some evidence that they provide a more accurate estimateof exposure than the traditional deterministic paradigm, at least with pesticide residues (e.g. Boon et al. , 2003). Probabilistic modelling has been little used in toxicological risk assessment in the UK, although theseapproaches (Elder et al. , 2002) are increasingly being used in other countries such as the USA. 12.20 Probabilistic models may be used under a classical or Bayesian statistical paradigm. In the classical model, probability is regarded as a frequency that an event will occur, based on repeated sampling. 12.21 Monte Carlo simulation is the method most commonly used for both classical and Bayesian probabilistic modelling. This involves taking repeated samples from the distribution of the input variables, analogousto doing repeated experiments. Use of a probabilistic model means explicit acceptance of a finite degreeof adverse effect, which is not necessarily the case with the NOAEL approach. 12.22 Implicit in probability modelling is the need to define the probability density function of the parameters comprising the model. 12.23 Bayesian statistical methods are based on Bayes' theorem. According to the Bayesian approach, a probability is regarded as how likely it is thought to be, based on judgement as well as observational data, that an eventwill occur. Hence, unlike other methods, Bayesian methods do not assume that we are trying to identify the\"true\" value of a parameter, rather the intention is to refine the level of uncertainty about the parameter. 102Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentBayesian theory starts with a prior distribution, ie. a probability density function. This represents the knowledge and assumptions about the event of concern. This prior distribution is combined with thedistribution of a new set on data that are obtained, to give a posterior distribution of the updatedknowledge. Bayesian methods allow combination of multiple items of information and incorporation ofexpert judgement. Sensitivity analyses of both the data and the models can be carried out. 12.24 Uncertainties in probabilistic modelling may arise from the choice of range that has been modelled and the confidence in that range. The evaluation of the reliability of the models to extrapolate betweenanimals and humans and to determine the validity of the model is required. In addition, probabilisticmodelling is data intensive and for general applicability of the output for exposure estimates random, nottargeted, surveillance data are required (COT, 2002b). The outputs are determined by the mathematicalmodel used and it is important for the toxicologist to understand the nature of the model and itsconstraints. The relationship of the model to the underlying biological response can be unclear. Bayesianmethods have the advantage of being able to express variability and uncertainty in numerical form,incorporate lack of knowledge as well as knowledge, and can be easily updated when new data becomeavailable. They also offer the potential for enhanced transparency of the decision making process. 12.25 Experience in the use of probabilistic modelling is currently largely confined to exposure assessment. There have been attempts to apply probabilistic modelling to toxicological data such as toxic equivalencyfactors for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in order to reflect uncertainty. Probabilistic modelling of the doseresponse could indicate the proportions of individuals at risk at a given level of exposure. This possibilityhas been considered theoretically but has not yet been widely used in regulatory risk assessment (IEH,1998). However, it has been suggested that probabilistic modelling approaches should be explored andtheir usefulness evaluated in a parallel exercise comparing these approaches with current methods forselected risk assessment issues (IEH, 1998) Categorical regression 12.26 This is a mathematical model which uses meta-analysis techniques and which allows incorporation of information from different studies on how the incidence of response increases with dose and how theseverity of response increases with dose. Categorical regression uses regression of ordered categories oftoxic severity, to estimate the likelihood of a given category of severity at a given dose level. Categoricalregression involves statistical regression on the experimental doses associated with various severitycategories of overall toxicity (Hertzberg & Miller, 1985; Edler et al. , 2002). Categories of severity may be assigned to qualitatively different levels of effect, and the doses and their associated effects fromdifferent studies may be combined to predict effect severity. In this way, all categorised adverse effectsmay be taken into account rather than focusing on the critical effect only. A problem with this approachis that it is often used to combine different effects in different studies and even different species.Although the method provides a global picture, in the end the risk assessment will usually focus on theeffect seen at the lowest doses. The greatest use of categorical regression analysis is likely to be whenhumans are exposed to potentially toxic levels, and information is needed on what effects may beanticipated. 103Whole modelling has the potential to allow the prediction of tissue concentrations of chemicals for tissue dosimetry and to allowextrapolation between routes of administration, species, high to low doses and different exposurescenarios. PBPK/PBTK models are valuable tools for extrapolating findings in animals and other testsystems to humans and are accepted as part of hazard characterisation. The COT has concluded that theycan be used as part of the risk assessment process, and can be valuable in identifying those parametersexerting most influence on the behaviour of the compound (sensitivity analysis) and as a means ofexploring inter-individual variability (COT, 2003a). A simple empirical method of dealing with the problemof extrapolation from data obtained in species of low body mass to higher body mass is to use allometricscaling. Typically body mass to the power 0.75 has been used. Allometric scaling works best forcompounds where the elimination is dependent on basal metabolic rate. However many othercompounds of concern to COT rely upon specific enzymes or transporters for their toxicity or eliminationthat do not scale allometrically. Although allometric scaling sometimes reduces inter-species variability,this is not always the case (see Appendix 3, paragraph A3.24), and it is always preferable to use a data-based pharmacokinetic or mechanism-based factor for extrapolation 12.28 The use of PBPK modelling to improve study design is a significant feature of the new system for assessment of agricultural chemicals that has been proposed in the \"Agricultural Chemical Safety Assessment\" projectof the International Life Sciences Institute (Carmicheal et al. , 2006; Barton et al. , 2006; Doe et al. , 2006, Cooper et al. , 2006). While PBPK models require considerably more human and animal data than when using empirical approaches, they provide a mechanistic approach to both understanding the temporalbehaviour of compounds within the body and predicting what is likely to happen in plasma and tissuesover a wide range of conditions. 12.29 A PBPK/PBTK model comprises three components 1) a body of independent physiological, anatomical, and biochemical data - the system ; 2) substance-specific data overlaid on to the system; and 3) the model structure , this being the tissues and organs included in the model, their structural complexity and their anatomical arrangement. As knowledge of the system and how compounds interact with it increases, sowill the ability to predict the likely behaviour of compounds from relatively limited data on thecompound. To provide meaningful predictions, however, it is important to incorporate biologicalvariability and methodological uncertainty in parameter values throughout the modelling process. Unlikewith empirical models, compound-specific data from various sources, in silico , in vitro , and in vivo , can readily be incorporated into PBPK/PBTK models. However, it is critical to verify at every opportunity thequality and utility of the input data against events of interest in vivo . The PBPK/PBTK model approach is flexible in the sense that it has the potential to be continuously updated in the light of new information,whether physiologic, disease, or compound related. 12.30 PBPK/PBTK models aid in more precise and informative prediction of biodisposition in humans from in vitro data, and in the likely behaviour in different subpopulations. PBPK/PBTK models also allow the possibility of examining plausible and likely outcomes in situations where there are severe ethicalconstraints to experimentation, eg pregnancy. However, there is as yet no consensus as to the means orextent of validation required before a PBPK/PBTK model can be used for regulatory purposes. 104Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment12.31 The power and utility of physiologically based modelling would be further increased when linked with mechanistically based pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic models as well as probabilistic exposuremodels. When the PBTK model is linked to measurements of target organ response, such as enzymeinduction with TCDD, the resulting model covers both kinetics and dynamics and is a PBTK/TD(kinetic/ dynamic) model. 12.32 Obstacles to the wider use of PBPK/PBTK modelling include lack of user-friendly modelling software, lack of appropriate and easily accessible relevant physiological and related databases, and, of importance, lackof adequately trained researchers in such modelling. All, however, are soluble if there is willingness toaddress these obstacles (See Appendix 4). The Computational Toxicology Section (CTS) of the Health andSafety Laboratory, Buxton, has initiated a project to develop practical and rapid PBPK models, facilitatedialogue with industry and regulatory bodies and contrbute to the development of Good ModellingPractice. Use of Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Methods 12.33 As discussed in Chapter 8, although systematic review and meta-analysis techniques have been widely employed in evidence-based practice and clinical trial research and increasingly in epidemiology, their usein toxicology is still limited. A recent exploration has been the development of methods for combiningresearch from studies of different designs (cross-design synthesis) including approaches for combiningepidemiological and toxicological data. 12.34 Most risk assessments for setting health-based guidance values are based on narrative reviews of toxicological literature. An essential difference between narrative and systematic reviews is therequirement for the latter to set out in a standardised and explicit way the target research questions,methods and results, including any assumptions and judgements made. This provides transparency ofmethodology, allows reproducibility and facilitates updating. These methods should improve theelucidation and evaluation of sources of uncertainty and variability and ensure that decisions about theseare recorded in a systematic way. Several recent articles in the Lancet and British Medical Journal haveadvocated the use of systematic review and meta-analyses for assessing the literature on animalexperiments (Sandercock and Roberts, 2002; Roberts et al. 2002; Pound et al. 2004; Khan and Mignini, 2005; Macleod et al. , 2005). 12.35 Much of the focus of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate animal experiments has been on their use to decide whether to start clinical trials of an intervention in humans. However, in the last fiveyears there have been more published meta-analyses, and to some extent systematic reviews, where anenvironmental chemical is the main focus. 12.36 As part of systematic review it may be advantageous to synthesise (meta-analyse) results from several studies quantitatively. There are a large number of methods available for such quantitative synthesis ofevidence including classical frequentist and Bayesian methods (reviewed in detail by Sutton et al. , 2000). Meta-analyses offer the potential advantages of greater power, more precise estimates, a framework forinvestigation of sources of heterogeneity between studies and, using Bayesian methods, for expert 105judgement and/ or evidence from sources of evidence other than the study being analysed to be incorporated (Speigelhalter et al. , 2000). 12.37 Meta-analysis of animal experiments would facilitate assessment of heterogeneity and publication bias and would allow combination of data from experiments using different animal species and strains andexploration of the sensitivity of results to differences in these variables. This advantage has not so far beencommonly reported in the published meta-analyses of animal experiments. There is scope for future workin this area. In the epidemiological area meta-analyses facilitate investigation of the influence ofconfounding and effect modifying variables on the meta-analysed estimate and exploration of thesources of bias outlined in Chapter 8. There are also well-developed methods for exploring the issue ofpublication bias which is rarely addressed in reviews of toxicological literature. 12.38 The methylmercury example described earlier and in Appendix 3 is one where health-based guidance values have been set using human data but there is also a considerable amount of animal data. Therewould be an opportunity to apply systematic review and meta-analysis techniques to these data, forexample, to synthesise the animal data, the human data and potentially the animal with the human data.Elicitation and incorporation of expert judgement and differing prior beliefs from committee members,for example on their choice of key/important animal studies, preference for data from certain animalspecies or strains, judgement on quality of animal and/ or human studies could be explored using Bayesianmethods. These approaches address the question 'what if?' e.g. what would the outcome of the riskassessment be if the committee chose a different key study, made certain assumptions about a source ofuncertainty etc. They also introduce transparency and reproducibility by setting out explicitly theassumptions and the decisions made and by exploring the impact of sources of uncertainty and variability. Table 12.1: Strengths. Limitations and weaknesses of several alternative approaches (based on Edler et al ., 2002) Approach Strengths Limitations and Weaknesses Threshold Is simple to apply and readily understoodAssumes the existence of a threshold. The NOAEL does not exclude biologically significant effects belowthe sensitivity of the tests. The value of the NOAEL depends on the experimental conditions such asgroup size, sensitivity of measurementof the adverse effect, and dose spacing. Does not make full use of the dose-response information. Uses default uncertainty factors.Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR) and Threshold of ToxicologicalConcern (TCC)Avoids unnecessary animal testing Assumes that structure predicts toxicity. Depends on current exposure estimates for the population. 106Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentApproach Strengths Limitations and Weaknesses Categorical regression Takes all studies into account and not only the most sensitive ones. Allows the prediction of a severity effect category at a particular dose(eg. above ADI).Requires toxicological judgement for the categorisation. The interpretation of fitted model (different endpoints, observervariation, etc.) is difficult.Probablistic risk assessment Uncertainties associated with all aspects of the quantitative methods ofthe risk assessment process can betaken into account. Appropriate chemical-specific information can be incorporated toreduce uncertainty. Provides effect estimates at actual exposure levels.Requires use of default distributions in most cases.Benchmark Dose Level (BMDL) Makes full use of the dose-response data. Allows confidence limits for point estimates. An optimal experimental design may allow reduction of the number ofanimals tested (does not require alarge number of animals per group).Obtaining consensus defining a benchmark response level for theadverse effect (eg. 5 or 10%) is difficult. Is not applicable to studies with few dose groups or not showing a range ofresponses.Non-threshold Linear extrapolation is simple to apply. Linear extrapolation is thought to be highly conservative. The Linearised Multi-Stage (LMS) model cannot be validated as a modelfor low doses and extrapolation ismodel-dependent. Differing balances between reactivity and repair between low and highdoses are not accommodated.Chemical-Specific Adjustment Factor (CSAF) modellingChemical-specific data can be incorporated to reduce uncertainty.Depends on the validity of the subdivision of the 10-fold factors. Is a data intensive method. 107Approach Strengths Limitations and Weaknesses Physiologically-Based Toxicokinetic (PBTK) modellingIs able to model the time course of the amount of the active compoundat the target site. Is possible for any species, dose and for different exposure (eg. route toroute extrapolations) and lifetimeconditions. Allows extrapolation from animal to human without having to have humandata. Allows target organ dose-response relationships to be used for low doseextrapolation.Is a data intensive method. Does not address the toxicodynamics. 108Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions 13.1 The conclusions are set out below, under the respective terms of reference: To review the evidence of the bases and range of variability in response to toxic chemicals 13.2 Variability in response to chemicals is determined by the fate of the chemical within the body (toxicokinetics) and the toxicity of the chemical and its metabolites (toxicodynamics). Variability in bothtoxicokinetics and toxicodynamics arises from a combination of factors that are inherent to the individual(or organism), and other factors that relate to the physiology and environment of the individual and whichchange over time. Inherent characteristics include species, sex and genotype. The modulating factorsinclude age, stage of development and functional maturation of organs and systems, co-exposure to otheragents and compounds (e.g. nutrients), lifestyle, and environmental factors, and disease. In principle,variability is measurable, and any lack of knowledge of variability is a source of uncertainty. 13.3 Recent scientific advances have led to greater insight into genetic factors responsible for susceptibility. It is now becoming possible to explain some variability in terms of genetic polymorphisms and post-genomic molecular biology. However, genetic heterogeneity and gene expression are not new forms ofvariation. They have always existed as part of the underlying differences between individuals, and as suchwould have been part of the variability that has informed the development of current methods that areapplied to deal with variability in risk assessment. 13.4 The range of human variability in response to chemicals cannot be measured directly in all sectors of the population. It is inferred from studies in different animal species, and from knowledge of the differencesbetween humans and animal models in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. 13.5 Each source of variability results in a distribution of activity or functionality amongst individuals of a population, leading to either increased or decreased susceptibility to the toxic effect. The overallresponse to a toxic chemical is determined by the combination of the many different sources of variability.The factors contributing to variability are, unless linked, unlikely to all act in the same direction. To consider sources of uncertainty in hazard identification and characterisation 13.6 Uncertainty in hazard identification or characterisation relates to incomplete knowledge of the relevance of the results of studies conducted in animals and experimental models, or of human populations, and ofpossible effects that have not been adequately investigated or recognised. 13.7 The few available direct data relating to human variability are largely derived from studies in young men. Thus the extent to which these data reflect the susceptibilities of women, older people, the conceptus,or children is uncertain. 13.8 Often there is uncertainty about the association of early exposure with particular health effects later in life. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of such effects might enable identification of earlypredictive markers of significant adverse effects that would reduce this uncertainty.13 Conclusions and Recommendations 10913.9 There is more uncertainty in the hazard identification and characterisation of contaminants and natural constituents in foods because, unlike food additives and pesticides, they are not subject to a formalapproval process requiring systematic studies to support safety assessment. 13.10 Another source of uncertainty relates to interpretation of studies giving apparently contradictory results with no obvious explanation. There is a need for an agreed robust mechanism for assessing the results ofstudies that give contradictory results, and demonstrating clearly how the hazard characterisationresolves such problems. To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to extrapolate toxicological data from animals to humans 13.11 Differences between the animal species used in laboratory experiments and humans derive from anatomical and physiological differences, as well as the variation in genetic factors that occurs within aspecies. Data from the available research in which compounds have been studied in both animals and mansuggest that the default uncertainty factor of 10 allows adequately for interspecies differences. 13.12 The question of special vulnerability of the developing nervous system to neurotoxicity is addressed by current regulatory testing with specific consideration of neurobehavioural and neurodevelopmentoutcomes. Similarly, data derived from developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in animals can beextrapolated to humans in considering other effects on the fetus and infant. Results suggest that thecurrent approaches and uncertainty factors are adequate. However, it is recommended that this area bekept under review. To consider the appropriateness of uncertainty factors customarily used to allow for variation within the human population, including subgroups such as children. 13.13 Inter-individual differences in the activity of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes are often characterised in well defined populations of subjects, focusing only on the pathway of interest. Whilst 10-fold or greaterdifferences have been demonstrated between groups, there are frequently no comparable differences inthe overall kinetics of the parent chemical, because of compensation by alternative pathways. 13.14 The default uncertainty factor for interindividual variability has been explored empirically on a number of occasions. This has usually been performed with pharmaceutical agents, but these studies can be relatedto other chemicals, and they suggest that the default uncertainty factor is generally appropriate. 13.15 With a few exceptions, particularly susceptible subgroups cannot be identified by genotype. Some subgroups are potentially vulnerable due to physiological, dietary or environmental factors. With respectto infants and children, it is recognised that the young can be either more suceptible or less susceptiblethan adults to the toxicity of particular substances. Since more information on newly introduced humanpharmaceutical agents will be expected to be derived directly from observations of treated children, itshould in future be possible to test the adequacy of current uncertainty factors in protecting youngchildren. 110Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment13.16 The possibly increased susceptibilty of the elderly and the consequences of a lifetime of exposure are representatively investigated in chronic toxicity studies. Even so, there is a need for better characterisationof the uncertainties related to possible altered susceptibility arising from environmental, physiologicaland metabolic changes during the course of life and in older life. An additional uncertainty factor for thisis probably unnecessary in most cases but should be considered and decided during hazardcharacterisation on a case-by-case basis. To consider other methods that might be used in setting acceptable or tolerable intakes for chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment 13.17 The COT uses current internationally-accepted methods in its risk assessments. These make good use of state-of-the-art knowledge and of the methodologies available to take account of variability and sub-group vulnerability in toxicological data. Given the wide range in primary data quality and thefrequent occurrence of critical data gaps, it is not possible to propose the use of any single approach torisk assessment, but rather it is necessary to continue with the present flexible use of the assessmentmethodology best suited to the specific data set available. As a continuing process, the COT will considerimproving and refining the methods and approaches it uses. 13.18 In vitro studies have important roles to play in hazard characterisation and investigations of toxicological mechanisms. However, there remain uncertainties with regard to the extrapolation of the results of in vitro studies to humans. Complete replacement of animal tests in toxicology is not possible at present. 13.19 Application of the default 100-fold uncertainty factor, which allows for 10-fold factors each for inter- and intra-species variation continues to be a reasonable approach, in the absence of better information. Insome instances, e.g. if there is good evidence that humans are not more sensitive than animals, applicationof the full 100-fold factor is not necessary. Subdivision of the default uncertainty factors to incorporatechemical-specific toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic adjustment factors should be used, whenever dataallow. If chemical-specific adjustment factors are used, the adequacy of the remaining default factorsshould be explicitly considered. 13.20 Statistical and modelling approaches, including physiologically-based pharmaco- or toxicokinetic models, have been used to refine the risk assessment process. Greater use of such methods, when suitable dataare available, would support a more systematic approach to risk assessment. Probabilistic models couldbe used to explore and quantify uncertainty. 13.21 Description of assumptions and uncertainties in the evaluation is important for transparency of the risk assessment: /circle6Systematic reviews of the relevant toxicology and epidemiology literature are important tools in hazardidentification and hazard characterisation and for the presentation of data. /circle6There should be a description of the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies in a review and detailsof the uncertainties and variabilities in parameters of interest in both the test subjects (eg. laboratoryanimals or human cohorts) and the human population of interest (eg. consumers or exposed workers). 111/circle6The choice of critical event used to set guidance values should be justified. /circle6The validity and robustness of biomarkers of exposure, intake, susceptibility and outcomes should be discussed, along with environmental and lifestyle factors that might impinge on these factors. /circle6Vulnerable groups of people should be identified. To consider how to express the level of confidence that one can have in the risk assessment 13.22 The degrees of variability and uncertainty at each stage of a particular risk assessment should be clearly described and communicated to those involved in risk management. This should include identification ofwhether all relevant responses were investigated. Particular attention should be given to statingassumptions and subjective elements in the risk assessment, justification of the choices of uncertaintyfactors used, and of the selection of the adverse health effects used as the basis for risk assessment.Transparency in these factors aids an informed assessment of uncertainty and enables risk managers tocommunicate this to stakeholders. Furthermore, such transparency is particularly important in reconcilingdifferences in risk assessments reached by different expert groups. Recommendations 13.23 There is a need to introduce methods to increase the transparency and reproducibility of hazard identification and characterisation. Several recommendations are made for future areas of research andchanges in policy to ensure such transparency and reproducibility. 13.24 Research needs relate to the following areas: Addressing the best use of existing data: /circle6Exploration of methods for assessing the quality of the toxicological evidence and the sources of uncertainty and variability. /circle6Development of a framework for transparent expression of uncertainty in hazard characterisation, suchas addressing and identifying critical data gaps. Vulnerable sub-groups: /circle6Improved understanding of the relevance to susceptibility of the genetic polymorphisms that have been identified in human populations. /circle6Evaluating whether there are specific subgroups not protected by the default uncertainty factors, dueto genetic, physiological (e.g. early and older life) or environmental sources of variability. /circle6Developing valid mechanism-based biomarkers of uptake, effect and susceptibility that would help toidentify subgroups at risk. 112Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment/circle6Better characterisation of hazards to older people to determine whether current uncertainty factors are appropriate. Mixtures of substances:- /circle6Improve understanding of the combined effects of chemicals occurring in food. 13.25 In relation to policy and practice, it is recommended that: Hazard characterisation: /circle6Hazard identification and characterisation should take into account variability and uncertainty, using a systematic approach that will facilitate transparency and confidence. /circle6Greater use should be made of statistical and modelling approaches, including probabilistic andphysiologically-based pharmaco- and toxicokinetic models. Use of such methods, when suitable dataare available, would support a more systematic approach to risk assessment allowing for variabilitywithin the human population. /circle6Subdivision of the default uncertainty factors to incorporate chemical-specific toxicokinetic andtoxicodynamic adjusted factors should be used, whenever data allow. Risk communication: /circle6The development of a framework for transparent expression of uncertainty in hazard characterisation would enable COT and other committees that perform toxicological evaluations to improvecommunication of the sources of variability and uncertainty in their risk assessments. Particularattention should be given to describing assumptions and subjective elements of the risk assessment,clearly describing where contradictions in information occur and how the resultant uncertainty isresolved. 113Abel EL (1975).

Some of these tests do not yield NOAELs and cannot therefore be directly used for risk characterisation. Someof these are used for other regulatory purposes, including those for acute toxicity, skin and eye irritancyand skin sensitisation. Other studies, such as tests of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretionand mutagenicity data will help interpret and evaluate toxicity studies that provide NOAELs. A1.2 It should be emphasized that not all studies may be required with all regulated chemicals and that a sponsor may provide a reasoned statement explaining why he considers certain tests not to be required.In the case of food contaminants and natural constituents many of the studies will not be available. A1.3 The vast majority of the studies will have been carried out in rodents, rabbits or guinea pigs. Some study types should be performed in more than one species, with rats being almost always one of the species.Dogs are usually used as a non-rodent species for repeat-dose toxicity studies of pesticides and veterinarymedicines, rabbits are usually used as the non-rodent species for developmental studies and mice areoften used as a second species in carcinogenicity studies. Primates are rarely used. Table A1.

This was based primarily on recent prospective epidemiological studies of populations who eat large amounts of fish, and was set to protect against developmental neurotoxicity, considered to bethe most sensitive toxicological endpoint of methylmercury exposure. Previously the PTWI had beenestablished using human data from population poisoning incidents. However, there is also a range ofexperimental data available. A number of different data sets (e.g. animal studies versus humanepidemiological data) have led to different PTWIs being derived. A3.2 Toxicological data considered by JECFA and reviews by JECFA and other bodies, are drawn upon, together with papers in the peer-reviwed literature. The first section briefly summarises what is known aboutmethylmercury and how knowledge of its toxicity has developed. This is followed by a brief descriptionof the basis for the current JECFA PTWI established in 2003. This is then followed by sections whichconsider what PTWI would be indicated if based solely on the following data sets: /circle6Experimental data from animal and in vitro studies /circle6Experimental data from studies conducted prior to human poisoning incidents /circle6All data except epidemiological studies Background A3.3 Methylmercury is an organic form of mercury which is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 95% of the methylmercury ingested is absorbed and peak blood methylmercury levels arereached within 6 hours. Methylmercury is able to cross plasma membranes more readily than inorganicmercury compounds, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and the placenta. Animal studies haveshown that methylmercury is particularly able to enter the blood of the fetus, in which the blood-brainbarrier is not fully developed. In the brain methylmercury accumulates and is slowly converted toinorganic mercury. A3.4 Methylmercury is neurotoxic in humans and animals, though the mechanism by which this occurs is still unclear. Cases of neurotoxicity and some fatalities in humans have been reported since the late 19thcentury. However, the largest incidents by far were poisoning episodes in Japan and Iraq between the 1950sand 1970s, the former due to consumption of fish contaminated with methylmercury, the latter due toconsumption of bread made with grain dressed with methylmercury as a fungicide. A3.5 The first reported use of methylmercury in laboratory research was in 1863, which corresponds to the first reported human toxicity cases, severe disabling neurotoxicity progressing to fatality in two laboratoryworkers (Frankland and Duppa, 1863, cited in Hunter et al. , 1940). Methylmercury was first used as a fungicide for dressing seeds in 1914, and cases of neurotoxicity, with symptoms including severegeneralised ataxia, dysarthria and gross constriction of the visual fields, were reported in workers involvedin the manufacture of methylmercury for this purpose, apparently due to exposure via inhalation ofmethylmercury dust (Hunter et al. , 1940).Appendix 3 Case study of methylmercury risk assessment 154Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentA3.6 In the 1950s the first cases of methylmercury poisoning in the general population were reported, usually due to the consumption of methylmercury-treated grain. In one case report (from 1952) methylmercurypoisoning was reported in a 13-month old infant in Sweden, resulting from the use by a family of flourmade from methylmercury-treated grain to prepare porridge (Engleson and Herner, 1952). The mother wasasymptomatic, though mercury was identified in her urine; however, she subsequently gave birth to a babygirl who was severely affected. This appears to be the first piece of evidence that the developing nervoussystem of the fetus is more vulnerable to the effects of methylmercury. The symptoms in the baby girlincluded mental retardation, which was not seen in affected adults. The 13-month infant (exposed tomethylmercury from about 9 months of age) also showed mental retardation, though not as marked. A3.7 The poisoning incidents in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s through consumption of contaminated fish were the largest methylmercury poisoning incidents up to that time, and led to concern about mercury releasesinto the environment and ultimately exposure of the general population to lower levels of methylmercurythrough consuming fish from 'non-polluted' areas. The first incident was in and around the coastalJapanese town of Minamata in the 1950s. The residents of Minamata and surrounding villages relied largelyon fish caught in Minamata bay as a protein source. In 1932 a Minamata company began makingacetaldehyde, and inorganic mercury used as a catalyst in the production process began leaking into thebay. Some methylmercury was also produced in the process and released. In the early 1950s productionboomed, but signs of neurotoxicity began to appear in residents. This had reached epidemic proportionsby 1956. It was 1959 before methylmercury poisoning was diagnosed and linked to release of mercury intothe bay. Close to 100 affected people had been identified by that time, more than 20 of whom had died.Although exposure to the methylmercury ceased, more affected people were identified over thesucceeding years and children were born severely affected by the methylmercury, often to mothers whohad shown only transient paresthesia. The total number of people affected by the incident is unclear, butmore than 2000 people are officially recognised as having been affected. The neurological effects weresensory and motor impairment in exposed adults and mental retardation, cerebral palsy, deafness,blindness and dysarthria in individuals who had been exposed in utero . A3.8 In the mid 1960s a similar outbreak developed along the Agano River in Niigata, Japan. As a result of the Minamata incident the effects of methylmercury poisoning were quickly recognised and public healthmeasures taken to limit exposure (Myers et al. , 2004). Studies subsequent to these incidents consistently found elevated levels of methylmercury in fish from waters contaminated with mercury due to industrialprocesses. A3.9 Mercury is widespread in the environment due to its uses in many products and industrial processes, and natural release from the Earth's crust. Mercury entering the environment, in whatever form, is convertedinto methylmercury by aquatic microorganisms. The methylmercury is then able to enter fish eitherdirectly from the water or by being concentrated up the food chain. Larger, older fish, particularlypredatory species, contain the highest levels of methylmercury. Consumption of fish contaminated withmethylmercury is the major source of exposure of the population to methylmercury (National ResearchCouncil, 2000). A3.10As well as neurotoxicity, methylmercury exposure has resulted in adverse effects on the kidneys in humans and animals. Effects on the liver, the reproductive and immune systems have been reported at 155higher doses in animals. However, the most sensitive adverse effect, at least in humans, is considered to be developmental neurotoxicity. Some epidemiological studies have linked consumption ofmethylmercury-contaminated fish to cardiovascular disease, although results of case-control studies havebeen contradictory. The basis for the JECFA PTWI A3.11 Methylmercury was first considered by JECFA at its 16th meeting in 1972, and was subsequently considered at its 22nd, 33rd, 53rd and 61st meetings. A PTWI of 5 /H9262g/kg bw/week was derived for mercury in 1972, with two thirds of the PTWI (3.3 /H9262g/kg bw/week) allocated to methylmercury. This was retained in 1978. The PTWI was based primarily on human data from the Minamata and Niigata incidents of methylmercurypoisoning through consuming contaminated fish. The lowest hair and blood mercury levels reported inadults with neurological impairment were converted to a steady state mercury intake from the diet todetermine the PTWI. The conversion was based on data provided by several small human studies on therelationship between hair mercury content and mercury intake, and mercury level in blood cells andmercury intake. In 1989 JECFA noted that pregnant and nursing mothers were likely to be more susceptibleto methylmercury but the available data were insufficient to recommend an intake specifically for thosesubgroups and the PTWI of 3.3 /H9262g/kg bw/ day for methylmercury was retained. A3.12 The PTWI was again retained at the 53rd meeting in 2000, with JECFA noting that the fetus and infants may be at greater risk of toxicity. Data were available from epidemiological studies, including studies in theFaeroe Islands and the Seychelles; however JECFA concluded that these studies did not provide consistentevidence regarding effects on neurodevelopment in children of mothers with hair-mercury levels of 20mg/kg and below. The committee recommended that the issue be reconsidered when data on 8-yearneurodevelopmental evaluations of the Seychelles cohort were available. A3.13 In 2003 methylmercury was evaluated again. Maternal hair mercury concentrations corresponding to a NOAEL from the Seychelles study and to a benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL) for the FaeroeIslands study were calculated and averaged. This averaged hair concentration was converted to a steadystate dietary methymercury intake using a one compartment pharmacokinetic model which used valuesappropriate for pregnancy. The resulting intake was divided by uncertainty factors of 2 and 3 to accountfor intra-individual variation in hair:blood ratios and the association between blood mercuryconcentration and intake. The resulting PTWI of 1.6 /H9262g/kg bw/week was considered to be sufficient to protect the developing fetus as well as other groups of the population. If all human data are excluded A3.14 As described above, some human data on the toxicity of methylmercury have been available since 1863. In particular, a large amount of data has been provided by the tragic events in Minamata and Niigata inJapan and in Iraq, in which large numbers of people consumed methylmercury-treated grain in 1972, andthese have been key to risk assessments by JECFA and other bodies. However, a considerable body ofexperimental data (animal and in vitro studies) is also available. 156Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentA3.15 Considering only the available animal and in vitro studies, a number of hazards associated with methylmercury are identified. These hazards are listed in Table A3.1, which summarises the lowestexposures associated with the adverse effects and any NOAELs. This table is not a comprehensive list ofall studies on methylmercury.

Mixed results have been reported in in vitro studies. Studies in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA97, TA100 and TA1537 with and without metabolic activation in rats and hamsters negative to cause DNA damage in in vitro studies in Bacillus subtilis, cultured human nerve and lung cells, Chinese hamster V-79 cells and rat glioblastoma cells, and chromosomal aberrations aneuploidy inhuman lymphocytes (National Methylmercury was negative in sex-linked in vivo (NTP, http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov, accessed 22/02/05). Single doses of 2.2, 4.4 or 8.9 mg/kg bw methylmercurychloride to male Swiss mice resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of chromosomalaberrations and percentage of aberrant cells in bone marrow. In a study in cats, doses of 0.0084, 0.02 or0.046 mg/kg bw/ day for 39 months were reported to produce a significant increase in the number ofnuclear abnormalities in bone-marrow cells and to inhibit DNA repair, however, this was not dose related(National Research Council, 2000). A3.18 From the data in Table A3.1, the most sensitive effects identified, excluding possibly neuro- developmental toxicity, for which there is no clear NOAEL, appear to be renal toxicity in Wistar rats anddecreased body weight in monkeys. In both a 24-month chronic study in Wistar rats and a 52-monthstudy in Rhesus and Mullata monkeys, the NOAEL bw/ (Munro et al. , 1980; Kawasaki et al. , 1986). Clinical and histopathological signs of neurotoxicity occurred in monkeys at higher doses with a NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw/ day. A3.19 The lowest dose associated with effects on neuro-development was 0.04 mg/kg bw/ day in two studies: one in female macaque monkeys dosed for 198-747 days prior to mating, in which offspring showedincreased randomness in visual attention to novel stimuli when tested at 50-60 days of age compared tocontrols (Gunderson et al. , 1988); and one in rats in which dams were treated with methylmercury on days 6-9 of gestation by gavage, and offspring exhibited increased passiveness and decreased habituationto an auditory startle at is available from the Stoltenberg-Didinger and Markwort (1990) study in rats.However, the methylmercury was only given for 4 days of gestation. It is therefore not clear whether thisNOAEL is appropriate. A3.20 No NOAEL is available from studies on immunomodulation, however these have generally involved higher doses. Relatively minor effects (increased lymphoproliferative response to B and T cell mitogens)were apparent in offspring of mice treated with 0.075 mg/kg bw/ day for 10 weeks prior to mating,through gestation and lactation. A3.21 If the lowest reported NOAEL of 0.01 mg/kg bw/ day, from chronic oral feeding studies in both rats and monkeys, was used to determine a PTWI, and a total uncertainty factor of 100 was applied, the resultingPTWI would be 0.7 /H9262g/kg bw/week. This is lower than the PTWI derived by JECFA using human data (1.6/H9262g/kg bw/week). 159A3.22 It is possible that an extra uncertainty factor would be applied given that no appropriate NOAEL is available for neuro-developmental toxicity. However, the lowest dose associated with adverse neuro-developmental effects was 4 times the NOAEL used to derive this PTWI. Extrapolation between species on a body surface area basis A3.23 It should be noted that JECFA observed that extrapolation between species on a body weight basis gave nonsense values (for example doses of more than 1 mg/kg bw/ day were frequently used in rodentstudies with minimal effects, whereas this was in the range of intakes associated with severeneurotoxicity in a mass human poisoning outbreak in Iraq). JECFA noted that clearance half-lives formethylmercury increased with the mass of the animal species and considered that allometricextrapolation based on body surface area could be used to extrapolate between species. This was notapplied above since all human data, including pharmacokinetic data, were excluded and thus theinappropriateness of extrapolating between species on a body weight basis may not have beenidentified. A3.24 If scaling on a body surface area (body weight 0.75) basis were used, and bodyweights of 400 g for a rat and 5 kg for a monkey assumed: /circle6the NOAEL of 0.01 mg/kg bw/ day from the chronic rat study would be equivalent to a dose ofapproximately 0.108 mg in a 70 kg human, or 0.0015 mg/kg bw/ day. /circle6The NOAEL of 0.01 mg/kg bw/ day from the chronic monkey study would be equivalent to 0.36 mg ina 70 kg human, or 0.0052 mg/kg bw/ day. A3.25 If a total uncertainty factor of 100 was applied this would result in a PTWI of 0.11 /H9262g/kg bw/week from the study in rats or 0.36 /H9262g/kg bw/week from the study in monkeys. If the factor of 10 0.6for interspecies differences in toxicokinetics was removed from the uncertainty factor, resulting in an uncertainty factorof 25, the PTWI based on the rat study would be 0.42 /H9262g/kg bw/week (or based on the monkey study, 1.5 /H9262g/kg bw/week). Experimental data prior to the Minamata incident in Japan A3.26 Attempts to identify experimental toxicological studies prior to human cases of methylmercury poisoning have been unsuccessful. The scientific literature contains references to human case reports ofpoisoning with methylmercury and other organic mercury compounds as early as 1863 (Hunter et al. , 1940; Swensson, 1952), with clearly described symptoms of neurotoxicity. However, the earliest identifiedreport of experimental toxicological studies is the paper of Hunter et al. (1940). This section will therefore focus on experimental data available before 1959, i.e. prior to recognition of methylmercurypoisoning in Minamata, Japan, the first mass outbreak of methylmercury poisoning. A3.27 Hunter et al. (1940) described four case studies of methylmercury toxicity in individuals employed in the manufacturer of methylmercury seed dressings and also reported four animal experiments undertakento determine whether symptoms similar to those observed in the four patients could be reproduced in 160Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentanimals and to provide material for histopathological study. These experiments are summarised in Table A3.2. A3.28 Histopathological analysis of affected rats indicated that methylmercury caused, in the first instance, a severe Wallerian degeneration in the peripheral nerves, posterior spinal roots and trigeminal nerve,followed by degenerations in the posterior columns and the descending root of the trigeminal nerve. Theauthors concluded that the clinical course taken by the experimental animals followed so close aparallel to that shown in human poisoning cases that the pathological basis of the condition wasprobably parallel to both. Table A3.2. Summary of experimental studies performed by Hunter et al . (1940): Species/ strain Exposure Observed effects NOAEL A3.29 Lundgren and Swensson (1950) reported the probable lethal dose for methylmercury toluol sulphonate administered by single intraperitoneal injection to mice to be 27.5 mg/kg bw. Swensson (1952) reporteda series of acute and subacute studies on methylmercury in which the methylmercury was adminsteredintraperitoneally or intravenously. These are summarised in Table A3.3.None Weight loss, subdued and 'bedraggled' appearance towards end of study, became irritable, weak in the hindlegs and clumsy in movement.

These were reported to show \"cell injuries\" in the granular layer of thecerebellum, in the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and in the cells of the spinal cord. A3.31 No other experimental data prior to 1959 have been identified. From the limited animal data available, therefore, neurotoxicity was apparent as a key adverse effect. However, the studies were undertaken inresponse to cases of human toxicity, and no NOAELs are available from these studies for risk assessment.A PTWI could not therefore be derived from these data. Including all data except the recent epidemiological studies A3.32 The former JECFA PTWI of 3.3 /H9262g/kg bw/week was established prior to epidemiological studies being conducted in high fish-eating populations in New Zealand, the Faeroe Islands and the Seychelles. Thissection will re-examine the data which were used to determine the former PTWI. A3.33 Excluding epidemiological studies, a relatively large amount of human data is still available, primarily from the large poisoning outbreaks from methylmercury contamination of fish in Minamata and Niigata,and from Iraq in 1972 in which people were affected by methylmercury through using grain intended forplanting, which had been treated with methylmercury, to bake bread. A3.34 In its 1972 evaluation, JECFA used published studies on methylmercury-intoxicated patients from the Niigata area to identify the lowest hair and blood methylmercury concentrations at time of exposureassociated with symptoms. A3.35 The lowest blood and hair mercury concentrations in Niigata patients were identified. From small studies the half-lives of mercury in hair and blood were also identified. These were 50-108 days (median 66 days)in the hair of 8 patients, and 35-137 days (median 55 days) in blood of 7 patients. Using these half-livesthe hair and blood mercury concentrations were extrapolated back to those at onset of symptoms.JECFA noted that extrapolated hair concentrations in Niigata patients were usually between 200 and1000 /H9262g/g, but in one case the concentration was 50 /H9262g/g. Extrapolated blood mercury concentrations were between 0.2 and 2 /H9262g/g, equivalent to concentrations in blood cells of 0.4 to 4 /H9262g/g. The lowest 162Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenthair and blood mercury levels were associated with paraesthesia in some adults, although there were others with higher levels who showed no evidence of methylmercury toxicity. A3.36 JECFA used data from other studies which had investigated the relationship between mercury intake and mercury concentration in hair and blood cells to convert the lowest blood and hair mercuryconcentrations to daily mercury intakes. These corresponded to 3 mg/ day Hg, which could beconsidered a LOAEL. JECFA apparently used an uncertainty factor of 7 to derive a PTWI for mercury of5 /H9262g/kg bw/week. JECFA stated that two thirds of the PTWI, i.e. 3.3 /H9262g/kg bw/week, should be applied to methylmercury. A3.37 The PTWI of 3.3 /H9262g/kg bw/week was maintained by JECFA as recently as 2000. Although JECFA noted that the fetus and infants may be at greater risk of toxicity the available data were not consideredadequate to derive a PTWI that would be protective for these groups, pending the completion ofanalyses from an epidemiological study in the Seychelles. A3.38 Data from the Niigata incident were used as methylmercury poisoning was quickly identified in the Niigata area since the symptoms were widely known in Japan as a result of the previous Minamataincident. Hair and blood mercury levels were therefore analysed more quickly in Niigata patients,enabling a more accurate extrapolation of mercury levels to time of exposure. In Minamata patients itwas difficult to draw conclusions regarding exposure levels at time of exposure as measures of exposurewere only taken years after the poisoning. A3.39 The incident in Iraq resulted in approximately 600 deaths and at least 6000 cases of methylmercury poisoning; exposure, through consumption of methylmercury-treated seed grain, was more acute andhigher dose than that in Japan. Hair mercury samples were taken from exposed pregnant women and acohort of 81 children exposed in utero identified. The children were subsequently followed up and assessments of their neurodevelopment made (Marsh et al. , 1987). The data from this cohort have been re-analysed on various occasions. As these studies are epidemiological in nature they will not beconsidered further here. A3.40 It can be concluded that, if epidemiological studies are excluded, the developing central nervous systems of the fetus and infants can still be identified as being particularly susceptible to methylmercuryfrom the remaining human data from poisoning cases. However, it would not be possible to identify aPTWI protective of these groups without prospective studies measuring exposure in pregnant mothersand subsequently monitoring and assessing the children. Evaluation of the 2003 JECFA PTWI A3.41 A recently-published study provides some further validation of the 2003 JECFA PTWI. Blood mercury levels were measured in 474 older people aged 50-70 years and the subjects were assessed in 12 differentneurobehavioural tests (Weil et al. , 2005). The hypothesis behind the study was that older people are at increased risk of cognitive decline and may be more sensitive to the effects of methylmercury. 163A3.42 Analysed by multiple linear regression with adjustment for confounding factors, increasing blood mercury levels were associated with statistically significantly worse performance in one test (Reycomplex figure delayed recall, a test of visual memory) and better in another (finger tapping, a test ofmotor and manual dexterity). There were no differences in the other tests. The authors concluded thatdue to a large number of multiple comparisons, and because the differences seen were in differentdirections, it could not be excluded that these results were due to chance. The authors concluded thatthe study provided no compelling evidence that blood mercury levels in this group were adverselyassociated with neurobehavioural performance. A3.43 Blood mercury levels ranged from 0-16 /H9262g/L in this study. The median was 2.1 /H9262g/L. Using the model used by JECFA in 2003, this would correspond to a steady state intake of 0.4 /H9262g/kg bw/week, which is within the 2003 PTWI. The highest measured blood mercury level would correspond to a steady stateintake of 3.0 /H9262g/kg bw/wk. This exceeds the 2003 PTWI, but is within the previous JECFA PTWI, which was considered protective against non-developmental adverse effects. Conclusions A3.44 The exercise excluding all human data enables a comparison between the PTWI based on human data and the PTWI that may result using experimental data, and thus enables some validation of theuncertainty factors used in extrapolating from animal studies to the general human population. A3.45 The animal data indicate that there are significant interspecies differences for methylmercury, particularly in toxicokinetics. There are also some inadequacies in the database, for example indevelopmental toxicity. However, the resulting PTWI, derived using a total default uncertainty factor of100, was within the 2003 JECFA PTWI derived using human epidemiological data, indicating that the totaluncertainty factor was sufficient to account for the interspecies differences and data limitations, as wellas inter-individual differences for methylmercury. This exercise therefore provides support for thedefault 100-fold uncertainty factor. References The references to this appendix are included in the main Reference section (Page 165) 164Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentAppendix mathematical model is constructed that can be used to predict the likely tissue levels of a chemical with time in humans basedon animal data and in vitro data and scaling this information using human physiological parameters. Model predictions can then be compared with available experimental data, and the model parameters adjustedas necessary to minimise the discrepancy between predictions and observations. The model must includethe critical organ or organs as specific components and some knowledge of concentrations elicitingadverse effects in these tissues is critical to the application of any model to risk assessment. Aspects ofthe predictability of the model in humans can be determined experimentally for pharmaceuticals but thisis not possible for most other chemicals and there will be uncertainty arising from this limited validation.PBPK modelling aids in reducing uncertainty regarding exposure and in itself PBPK does not reveal anythingabout variations in susceptibility of a target tissue to exposure (toxicodynamics). If the mechanism ofaction is known however and data exist on the variability in the response with exposure within the targettissue, then the toxicodynamic (biological response) component can be characterised and modelled. Theresponse model may contain various sources of uncertainty; these will include any extrapolation of theresponse effect profile from isolated targets (receptors, enzymes, etc.) to the in vivo situation together with available knowledge on the variability and distribution of the target within the population. Thistoxicodynamic (biological response) model can be combined with a PBPK model to provide exposureeffect data, which would decrease the overall uncertainty in scaling data to humans. The sources ofuncertainty in the integrated model will be the combination of those in the individual models. A4.2 Whole-body physiologically based et al. , 2004) are of a fundamentally different nature. Here the philosophy is to overlay compound specific data, such as metabolic enzymatic activity and lipid solubility, onto an essentiallyindependent model structure, representing biologically meaningful and independently verifiablephysiological characteristics such as organ blood flow and tissue size. An attractive feature of thesemodels is that their structure is essentially common to all mammalian species, thereby facilitatinginterspecies scaling. In addition, as relevant physiological and morphological data becomes available, aswell as knowledge as to how compounds interact with the components of the system, the possibilityexists for efficient use of limited compound-specific data in order to make reasonably accuratepredictions as to the temporal profile of specific compounds, both within and between species, as wellas under a variety of conditions (Poulin and Theil, 2002; Rodgers et al. , in press). A4.3 As long ago as 1937, Teorell (Teorell, 1937) developed equations which describe the behaviour of foreign compounds in animal tissues. At the time such complex equations were essentially insoluble and hismodels were discarded for simpler compartmental representations. With the advent of powerful digitalcomputers interest in such models rekindled in the 1960s and increasingly sophisticated physiologicallybased models are now being investigated (Nestorov, 2003). In these PBPK/PBTK models each organ ortissue is represented by a differential equation based on mass balance of xenobiotic entering, leaving andresiding in that organ (Figure A4.1). This takes into account organ mass, organ blood flow, plasma proteinbinding, tissue affinity, membrane permeability, as well as enzymatic and transporter activity. Non-linearities are explained by features such as saturable metabolism or transport, enzyme induction, andchanges in organ blood flow secondary to pharmacological or toxic effects (Stenner et al. , 1997). More recently a range of different tissue models have been invoked to explain subtleties of spatial interactionbetween xenobiotic, eliminating tissue, and perfusing blood (Rommel et al. , 1998). An equation estimatingrate of change of toxicant concentration in arterial blood incorporates the rates of change of efflux from all other organs representing the circulatory nature of blood flow (Fig A4.2). Numerical integration ofthese differential equations allows prediction of the time course of toxicant in each individual tissue.Physiological and physicochemical parameter values are usually obtained from the literature or fromindependent in-vitro experimentation. Predictions can subsequently be compared with observedconcentration time data to confirm model structure. In practice, some parameters may be unknown andhave to be estimated by fitting the model to observed concentration time data (Smith and Evans, 1995). ABayesian approach may be used to incorporate information from both literature derived parameter valuesand from observed concentration time data to give both prediction intervals for tissue concentrationsrather than simply a mean value (Bernillon and Bois, 2000). The prediction intervals incorporate elementsof biological variability and of methodological uncertainty. Where discrepancy between observed andpredicted concentration measurements cannot be explained by biologically plausible parameter valuesthe model structure may come into question. It is common for there to be species differences in route ofmetabolism and accounting for these often improves agreement between observed and model predictedpoints (Lilly et al. , 1999). A4.4 If they are to be of more than academic interest PBPK/PBTK models require some form of validation (Edler et al. , 2002). Models in which all structural parameter values are obtained independent of model building have some face validity, and external validation is provided by agreement between predicted andobserved tissue concentration values. However, unlike the statistical procedures for fitting sums ofexponential terms to data, the concept of \"agreement\" is qualitative with no consensus as to what definesacceptable goodness of fit. As yet there has been little consideration of model misspecification, whatdegree of disagreement between predicted and observed data indicates this and how structuraluncertainty might be incorporated into the error bounds of parameter values and predicted tissueconcentrations (Tucker and Ferson, 2003). Using the model for data analysis to estimate parameter valuesideally requires an independent set of concentration-time data to provide validation (WHO, 2000-2001).Physiologically based models have large numbers of independent parameters some of which may beredundant in determining blood concentration time data but influential for local tissue or metaboliteconcentrations (Sweeney et al. , 2003). Theoretically at least, a model validated against blood concentration-time data alone might predict spurious local tissue concentrations. In practice models arevalidated by testing predicted concentration-time profiles against experimental data following a widerange of inputs and physiological conditions, as well as, for extensively metabolised compounds,measuring as many metabolite concentrations in as many tissues as possible (Andersen, 2003). In addition,insight into the relative influence of parameters on predictions can be gained through local and globalsensitivity analysis. However, it is also important to take samples for analysis at appropriate times thatallow the best chance of parameter estimation and testing of the model. PBPK/ PBTK models developedin animals can be used to predict tissue toxicant concentrations in humans by utilising the appropriatehuman physiological values. However, aspects that need to be kept in mind when extrapolating fromanimals to man, are going from high dose in animals to low dose in man, potential differences in route ofadministration, and differences in time scale of exposure. If there are known differences in metabolicpathways or specific transport mechanisms some adjustment to the structure of the model will also berequired. When PBPK modelling is used in drug development there is the luxury of validating theextrapolated model against observations in humans at least for those compounds that continue intoclinical phases (Levitt, 2002). In toxicology there is rarely the opportunity to have experimental data in 166Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentman but model predictions can be triangulated with observational data, such as those from sporadic cases of toxicity or concentration measurements obtained from individuals exposed to sub-toxic doses(Jonnson et al. , 2001). A4.5 A unique advantage of whole body PBPK/PBTK models is their facility to incorporate even hazy information about variability and uncertainty into predictions of tissue concentrations and hence toxicity(Nestorov et al. , 2002). There is also the potential to investigate the impact of physiological variability and how this is determined by age, sex, ethnicity, genetics and disease and how these effects propagatethrough apparently complex models (Gueorguieva et al. , 2004). A4.6 An attractive use of PBTK models is in the hazard characterization of essential nutrients such as vitamin A or that are toxic at higher doses. Here intakes associated with toxicity are often little greater than thatassociated with deficiency states (Dybing et al. , 2002) and an ultra-precautionary approach might result in malnutrition. The in-built conservatism of hazard characterization based on uncertainty factors isinappropriate as human tolerable intakes calculated from animal data may be less than reference dosesrequired to avoid deficiency (Renwick et al. , 2003). Even the normal uncertainty factor allowed to protect vulnerable subgroups within the human population is often abandoned (United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 2004a). A PBTK model has the potential to explore differences in tissue kinetics andhelp identify subgroups in whom the risk of toxicity exceeds that of deficiency. A PBTK model has beenproposed for manganese to explore the apparent discrepancy in approach to oral and inhaled exposureswith suggested uncertainty factors of 1 for the former and 1000 for the latter (Andersen, 2004). Althoughnot yet complete it demonstrates just how complex some models may need to be to satisfactorily explainthe full response to a toxicant. Retinoic acid A4.7 The example of retinoic acid teratogenicity illustrates the steps in using a PBPK/PBTK model for hazard characterization. Tretinoin is a potent teratogen in man (Lammer, 1985) but has therapeutic potential in thetreatment of leukaemia (Warrell et al. , 1993), acne, and photo-aging (Griffiths et al. , 1993). Sufficient drug is absorbed when small doses are applied topically for there to be justifiable concerns about possibleteratogenicity. At the request of the FDA a PBPK model was used to help clarify this risk before approvalwas given for its use to treat photo aging (Clewell, 1997). The initial model was developed in rats andincluded components to represent gut absorption, metabolism and placental transfer (Figure A4.3). As thebehaviour of many organs were not of specific individual interest they were lumped together as \"richlyperfused\" and \"slowly perfused\" groups and attributed common physiological parameters. As usual, eachtissue was represented by a differential equation derived from mass-balance considerations withphysiological values obtained from the literature. Refinements to the base model included enterohepaticrecirculation and saturable hepatic metabolism described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The modeladequately described observed plasma tretinoin concentrations after intravenous administration of 3 different doses in rats (Figure A4.4). The initial model was subsequently transposed to the monkey withappropriate recognition of the similarities in tissue distribution but differences in metabolism of tretinoinbetween rodents and primates, oxidation as opposed to glucuronidation predominating in the latter. Againthe model provided an adequate prediction of observed concentration after intravenous tretinoin dosing(Figure A4.5). As tretinoin is used in the treatment of leukaemia it was possible to obtain some human drug 167concentration-time data following oral dosing to confirm the adequacy of the human version of the model incorporating zero-order gastric emptying and first-order uptake of drug from the intestinal lumen(Figure A4.6). In the treatment of photo-aging tretinoin is applied topically and a dermal absorption modelwith diffusion limited equilibration between formulation and stratum corneum and subsequently viableepidermis was added to the earlier base model. Parameters describing dermal uptake were estimated fromin-vitro experiments with human cadaver skin. Predicted and observed total radioactivity after topicalapplication of 100mg tritiated tretinoin to non-pregnant volunteers is shown in Figure A3.7. For theassessment of teratogenic potential it was necessary to assume an appropriate tissue dose metric, inparticular the chemical species responsible for teratogenicity and the appropriate measure of exposurebest linked to teratogenicity. Comparing measured concentrations of parent drug and metabolites anddifferent measures of fetal exposure across mouse, rat and monkey each receiving the minimal teratogenicdose the Cmax of total active retinoids varied least and was therefore assumed to be the appropriatespecies and metric. The full model predicted a Cmax of total active retinoids in human fetus followingextensive topical application by pregnant mothers some 5 orders of magnitude less than that associatedwith teratogenicity observed in animals, and tretinoin is now approved for human use. Limits to the application of PBPK/PBTK A4.8 PBPK/PBTK models are data intensive: despite the power and mechanistic appeal of PBPK/PBTK models there are several practical issues that have limited their wide application, and which need to be addressed.Implicit in the application of these models is the need for verifiable and constantly updated physiologicaland biochemical data bases for both animals and human. While much such data exist for the morecommon animals studied, pertinent data are often lacking , and comprehensive, easily accessible, databases are still not readily available. Furthermore, while it is common to find mean data, information aboutthe underlying variability in physiological parameter values is less available, and covariance estimatesalmost never. Sometimes there are differences in quoted values due to the various methods employed intheir estimation; this is particularly true of tissue blood flow. Also, the software for both estimation andsimulation, of which there is a variety is generally more complex and sophisticated than that used forcharacterising empirical models, such as the sum of exponentials, and in turn requires the user to begenerally an experienced modeller. The number of researchers with the necessary skills is currentlylimited, and training of more researchers in the area is needed (Rowland et al. , 2004). A4.9 PBPK/ PBTK models are valuable tools for extrapolating findings in animals to human and are an accepted part of hazard characterization (Aarons, 1999). Model building and essential validation can involve a greatdeal of work. Using these models raises issues that are dealt with implicitly in other methods of hazardcharacterization. These include knowledge of the proximate site of action, the critical chemical species,the appropriate tissue dose metric, and the dose metric response relationship. Nevertheless PBPK/PBTKmodelling increases understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity and in some cases the results obtainedare sufficient to form the basis of hazard characterization (United States Environmental Protection Agency,2004b). 168Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentReferences Aarons L, Clewell HJ, Conolly RB, Delic Jarabek AM, G, HJ, GT (1999).

An approach to dose-response assessment that aims to be more quantitative than the NOAEL process. This approach constructs mathematical models to fit all datapoints in the dose-response study and uses the most appropriate model tointerpolate an estimate of the dose that corresponds to a particular level of response(a benchmark response), often 10%. A measure of uncertainty is also calculated, andthe lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose is called the benchmark doselevel (BMDL). The BMDL accounts for the uncertainty in the estimate of the dose-response that is due to characteristics of the experimental design, such as samplesize. The BMDL can be used as the point of departure for derivation of a health-based guidance value or a margin of exposure (MOE) Benzodiazepines Group of GABA-agonist drugs.BHA Butylated hydroxyanisole, (1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methoxyphenol) used in many foods BMD Benchmark dose: an exposure due to a dose of a substance associated with a specified low incidence of risk, generally in the range of 1% to 10%, of a health effect,or the dose associated with a specified measure or change of a biological effect(IPCS, 2004).
