Individuals may choose which vaccine they receive as a booster dose. Some people may prefer the vaccine type that they originally received and others may prefer to get a different booster. The CDC's recommendations now allow for this type of mix-and-match dosing for booster shots. Getting fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine continues to be the most important protective measure, coupled with the use of masks and ventilation. [For guidance on who should receive boosters and information on the boosters available, visit CDC.gov.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1654544944164660&usg=AOvVaw3LYk3yl6fQQS_wRbOiMBs8) The booster vaccines for COVID will also be offered at some of our UF Health Physicians practices.

Frequently Asked Questions I work at UF Health, but I am not involved in patient care. Am I eligible to receive the COVID booster vaccine if I received both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least six months ago or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago? Yes, as part of UF Health, all faculty and staff who received the second dose of the Pfizer, Moderna or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago are eligible to receive the booster vaccine. Can I get a different vaccine than my original vaccine as my booster shot? At this time, the CDC recommendations allow for mix-and-match dosing for booster shots. Some people may prefer the vaccine type that they originally received and others may prefer to get a different booster. Either option is fine, per the CDC. Are side effects more prominent when receiving the booster dose of the COVID vaccine? Side effects people report after getting a booster shot are similar to side effects after the 2-shot series. What underlying medical conditions are considered to be high risk for severe COVID? The [list of medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) can be accessed at the CDC's website. How long do I need to wait between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine? No waiting period is required between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (1st, 2nd, 3rd or booster doses) and the flu vaccine. Both vaccines can be received at the [same time](https://imsva91-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cdc.gov%2fflu%2fseason%2ffaq%2dflu%2dseason%2d2021%2d2022.htm%23coadmin&umid=CCFF2B0B-CD00-3305-AFFD-E700C008BF0F&auth=5ab06289d9c3b14f9a77f69d29e7a25870e86301-449e4a11dd39e452c67566ca2ff448acb285dd6e). If you plan to get both vaccines at the same time, it is recommended you get them in separate arms. How long do I need to wait to get a COVID-19 vaccine after receiving COVID monoclonal antibody therapy (passive antibody therapy)? COVID-19 vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days after receiving monoclonal antibodies. This is a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid potential interference of the antibody therapy with vaccine-induced immune responses. This recommendation applies to people who receive passive antibody therapy before receiving any vaccine dose and between doses. Receipt of passive antibody therapy in the past 90 days is not a contraindication to receipt of COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine doses received within 90 days after receipt of passive antibody therapy do not need to be repeated. "}
