Focusing on preventive care, Schneck Integrative Medicine views health as the cohesive balance of mind, body, and spirit. What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative medicine is the practice of utilizing the best of conventional and alternative medicine. This combination includes the use of various treatments such as supplements and herbs, as well as approaching the patient from a \"body as a whole\" point of view. Integrative medicine prescriptions include emphasis on lifestyle such as dietary programs and exercise. Schneck Integrative Medicine incorporates age old healing techniques with state of the art modern medicine. Long before medicine as we know it began, people relied on herbs, acupuncture, dietary supplements, massage, and the healing power of the mind. Today there's a new interest in this natural, holistic approach. Blending alternative medicine with conventional medicine, Schneck Integrative Medicine provides treatment customized to your needs. We view health as the cohesive balance of mind, body, and spirit.
