It's water-soluble. It's easily absorbed when you take it by mouth. It's found in a variety of foods. It's also made by bacteria inside the large intestine. Biotin deficiency is rare. Like the other B vitamins, biotin helps your body make energy. Biotin works with carboxylase enzymes, ATP, and magnesium to use carbon dioxide to help make fatty acids. Biotin also helps make proteins and purines. Biotin helps your body break down carbohydrates and the amino acid tryptophan. Medically valid uses Biotin is the treatment for some genetic conditions caused by lack of certain enzymes. These include: These conditions can cause neurological damage and abnormal skin conditions. They happen often enough that healthcare providers may start testing for them at birth. Unsubstantiated claims There may be benefits that have not yet been proven through research. Biotin may help treat hair loss (alopecia). It may also treat skin issues. These can include acne, seborrhea, and eczema. Recommended intake Biotin is measured in micrograms (mcg). AI is the Adequate Intake. | | Group | | AI | | Infants (0-6 months) | | 5 mcg | | Infants (7-12 months) | | 6 mcg | | Children (1-3 years) | | 8 mcg | | Children (4-8 years) | | 12 mcg | | Children (9-13 years) | | 20 mcg | | Children (14-18 years) | | 25 mcg | | Adults (19 years and older) | | 30 mcg | | Pregnant women | | 30 mcg | | Breastfeeding women | | 35 mcg | | Food source | | Nutrient content | | Beef liver, cooked, 3 ounces | | 30.8 mcg | | Egg, whole, cooked | | 10 mcg | | Salmon, pink, canned in water, 3 ounces | | 5 mcg | | Pork chop, cooked, 3 ounces | | 3.8 mcg | | Hamburger patty, cooked, 3 ounces | | 3.8 mcg | | Sunflower seeds, roasted, \u00bc cup | | 2.6 mcg | | Sweet potato, cooked, \u00bd cup | | 2.4 mcg | | Almonds, roasted, \u00bc cup | | 1.5 mcg | | Spinach, boiled, \u00bd cup | | 0.5 mcg | | Milk, 2%, 1 cup | | 0.3 mcg Biotin is stable at room temperature.

Biotin deficiency can be caused by: - Eating a lot of raw egg whites (more than 6 per day), as egg whites contain a protein (avidin) that blocks the absorption of biotin - A weakened immune system - Cirrhosis of the liver - The genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU) - Taking seizure medicines (anticonvulsants), such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. - Chronic alcohol use - Certain rare genetic disorders Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may need to take supplements, but you should talk with your healthcare provider before doing so. Biotin deficiency can cause: Side effects, toxicity, and interactions There are no known problems due to too much use of biotin. Extra biotin comes out in urine. There are no known food or medicine interactions. Online Medical Reviewer: Bianca Garilli MD Online Medical "}
