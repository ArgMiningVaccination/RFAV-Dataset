The deadline to submit vaccination documentation was April 25, 2022. If you fail to comply, you will not be permitted to enter campus buildings and will be prevented from attending classes. On the first day of the summer term, you will be dropped from all classes and placed on an immediate leave of absence. To prevent further action by the University, you must follow these [instructions to submit vaccine documentation](https://uis.georgetown.edu/coronavirus-instructions-for-uploading-your-vaccination-documentation/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_campaign=) and immediately: Students who will not be fully vaccinated by the fist day of the summer term because COVID-19 vaccines are not available or widely accessible in their area or because they are being re-vaccinated, are in between doses, or will not be eligible for a booster must complete this deadline [extension request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW48z_uGo04eWt-PcBV79s0qfJ9npDFScHOiqoxhwN7b07Og/viewform). Medical and religious exemptions will be granted in accordance with federal and local law. To request a vaccination exemption, please complete the [Student Exemption Request Form](https://gu360.georgetown.edu/s/vaccination-exemption-form) now. Please visit the Georgetown University [COVID-19 Testing Protocol](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/georgetown-university-covid-19-testing-protocol/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_campaign=#checklist-for-campus-access) page for the required checklist for coming to campus, including testing requirements based on vaccination status. If you are a student in an online course or program that does not require on-campus presence at any time during the summer term, you do not need to submit proof of vaccination to Georgetown University, but we strongly encourage you to get vaccinated to protect yourself and others. Thank you for doing your part to protect the health and safety of the Georgetown University community. Sincerely, Annamarie Bianco Associate Vice President and University Registrar "}
