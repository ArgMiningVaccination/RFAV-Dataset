Caring for children when hospitalized offers a unique opportunity to connect with patients and families at some of the most stressful moments of their lives. While being in the hospital is undoubtedly nerve-wracking, I aim to create a safe environment that prioritizes healing, informed, open, and bi-directional communication, and culturally sensitive care along with a sprinkle of lightheartedness that pediatrics is known for. Working within a multi-disciplinary team focused on an all-encompassing holistic approach, I'm committed to a family-centered care approach that is mindful of creating a child-friendly environment while also upholding important pillars of care surrounding education, quality improvement and overall continuity of care in the hospital setting. Recognizing that every child is unique, I strive to provide care tailored to each situation through evidence-based guidelines and practices. I am driven to be a positive influence in the lives of those around me and recognize the tremendous potential we can have in impacting a child's life, especially through medicine and healthcare. As a researcher, I am interested in the intersection of food insecurity, obesity and nutrition especially within the themes of advocacy, medical education and wellness. I'm honored to be the recipient of various awards, including: I love spending time with my growing family and exploring all the fun and exciting things in the Cincinnati area while also carving out a \"healthy\" amount of time for Bluey, Ted Lasso, and other great shows and movies. Additionally, I am a big fan of the Dallas Stars, New York Mets, and New York Giants; I'm hopeful of adding a few Cincinnati teams to that list. I also enjoy doing CrossFit\u00ae and competing in regional competitions. MD: Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 2019.
