I admire and appreciate advances in medicine due to technology, and I live in gratitude for the entire spectrum of emergency medicine personnel. If I ever need to, I will gladly go to the emergency room. The aim of this article is to bring awareness of what healing is and what a healer does, and to acknowledge the inner healer in both the medical practitioner and the person receiving health care. I`m interested in the shared goals and differences between Allopathic and Holistic medicine, and I suggest that more benefits are available when these two models are complementary. The common goal of both models is better health thru optimal immune response. Their core difference is in the definition of who and what we are. Allopathic medicine focuses on curing symptoms of disease by using remedies that counter-act the effects of the disease. It conceives of the body and the mind, as separate entities. The body being made of separate compartments functioning mechanically like a fine tuned machine. Although there are monumental breakthroughs in the field of psychoneuroimmunology, the study of the effect of the mind on health and disease, the current operating truth in Allopathic medicine is that the body is a physical object, that mind and consciousness are the same thing, and that mind is a product of brain activity only. As far a health is concerned, there are no other dimensions to you. The Allopathic model claims there is no consciousness apart from the body that is capable to enhance well being. Holistic medicine focuses on healing by enhancing the well being of the whole: body-mind and Soul. The emphasis is on understanding the expression of the symptoms at every level. It looks for the source of dis-ease by interpreting the symptoms in relationship to optimal mental health (this includes your social life), a health promoting diet, and a physically active life style. It diagnoses by incorporating information from the body/mind/Soul system that is affected by dis-ease. It conceives of the body and the mind as a system of interrelated processes governed by non-physical, Self Aware Intelligence, your Soul. This intelligence is capable to respond to changes in well being, and affect the well being of the body/mind as a unit. This model makes a definite distinction between the ego/thinking mind correlated with brain activity, and the greater capacity to pay attention inherent in being aware, your Soul. Summary: The Allopathic model looks for causes of symptoms of disease by focusing on separate parts of the body that are ill and administering a cure. The cure may have negative side effects. The holistic model looks for causes of physical and mental illness through a lens of relationships among the different parts of the body, and the mind, as a whole unit. The emphasis is on treating the whole without inflicting any harm. The holistic model relies on the loving and intelligence of the Soul. In Holistic medicine awareness and inclusion of the Soul is not based on religious faith, rather it is a direct experience of expanded Self Awareness. How healers Heal Healers don`t heal, they facilitate healing. The will to live, to be well, and to overcome even the threat of dying is ultimately a personal choice. Healers can only affect an illness to the degree the individual concerned has accepted, from the core of their being, that it is possible and desirable to be well. Some individuals who have been miserable for long periods of time just want the pain to end; they no longer house the will to live. In these cases there is a potential for healing while in the process of dying. Healing is ultimately the transformation of pain into inner peace, regardless of the physical condition. It must be understood that true inner peace is a reflection of a peaceful mind, and a peaceful mind rest on an identity that is free of inner conflicts. An effective healer addresses the core of a person`s pain by helping them connect with their Soul where inner knowing and inner peace resides. Healing Vs. a cure The core of healing is integration of mind, body, and Soul into a unified well functioning presence; this is the dimension of you that can pay attention without thinking. Integration produces personal transformation. When an individual heals they transform by adding wisdom to themselves. For instance, they learn to truly love and appreciate themselves. Love empowers the choices you make for the better, and this affects your relationships to everyone, most of all to you. Love increases your awareness of what is healthy and what is not. \"Healing increases Self Awareness, and Self Awareness heals\" For example, you can interpret an illness as a physical counterpart of an unconscious childhood negative, and false belief you have had about you, like \"I`m guilty and deserve to be punished\", this belief is a recipe for low self-esteem that welcomes disease. Knowledge of this irrational belief simultaneously exposes what is actually true about you now: you are innocent! Making innocence available to be your new point of reference, your new identity opens your imagination to a welcoming future, instead of only seeing yourself as the currently ill version of you. This transformation of identity, which entails a lot of hard work, is an example of wisdom that enhances your well being. Healing allows you to know yourself differently...you feel fresh, you have more depth and you are empowered by what is true about yourself. You become free from falsehoods. A guilt-ridden person cannot exhibit well being. Their immunity and vitality are consumed by negative thinking generating negative emotions, what I call \"misery soup\". Integration means being whole and complete. This dynamic unity is facilitated by the connecting quality of love in present time. Healing involves learning to be present with loving kindness towards yourself, this is not negotiable, and is a core difference between healing and a cure. A cure is typically a one-dimensional approach to health that focuses exclusively on symptoms; it does not involve your active participation. For example, if you have heart problems your doctor will do things to your heart organ, and probably wont automatically know to ask you, what kind of mental and emotional suffering burdens your heart? Or if you are depressed, or burn out, your psychiatrist most likely will offer you medication, but is not likely to ask you, do you know how to connect to your Soul and ask for inner guidance? The difference between the activities of healing, yes it is an action, there is nothing passive about healing, and a cure, is more apparent when you look at some unintended consequences of Allopathic medicine. Some times Allopathic medicine violates the fundamental law of medicine: First do no harm. A cure that debilitates the body and mind with side effects further interrupts the harmony of the whole system. When this happens the intention to neutralize a symptom is causing harm to the system as a whole. I understand that when a patient shows up gravely ill the number one priority is to keep them alive. However, when decades pass by and there are no new alternatives to surgery, drugs, and radiation to address terminal illness without side negative effects, then it isn`t the science that is not evolving, is the health model that needs to expand and incorporate new perspectives. Symptoms are signals of imbalance that have expressions in the mind and the body simultaneously. Their resolution comes from a higher level perspective that has greater functioning capacity, your Soul. The human body knows how to grow and be healthy, and your Soul can activate the DNA blue print containing the latent healed state. Can you imagine how the delivery of care could change if Soul Awareness was added to diagnosis and treatment of illness? Yes, it would make it more humane, health care professionals will admit when they don`t know what to do, and there will be an understanding of how what they offer affects the entire system. Further, the Allopathic medicine will be increasingly less of a platform for corporations that use the need for health care as a ruthless for profit business. The role of the Healer In the broadest sense, a healer is a person who has access to a dimension of themselves that expresses a unique ability to enhance well being. The role of the healer is to mirror well being to their patient. An effective healer assumes the energetic vitality that resembles the healed state needed, and invites the person; through whatever modality they use, to match the healer`s state of well being. This personal choice to match the healer`s frequency activates the person`s inner healing capacity, and the system begins to repair itself. In other words, when you trust your practitioner, and you are inspired by them, you make a subconscious decision to be well. The Placebo effect is a perfect example of this. To some degree healing happens at a subconscious level, as a Soul to Soul meeting between healer and the one healed. This implies healers by definition must work with integrity, and without ego agendas including the arrogance of believing they can heal everything, or that they know how long a person has to live. There are almost as many healing modalities as there are ways to be out of balance. An effective healer knows what they can and cannot facilitate, and promptly refer patients to another practitioner if they know their treatment is more appropriate. They will never exploit a client for this automatically disconnects them from the person they intent to help. The role of the healer is greater than doing no harm; it embodies a deep impersonal loving and benevolent connection with the person, a Soulful connection. The Soul is exquisitely intimate and simultaneously impersonal, it can connect without attachments. Do you feel loved by your health care provider? Another law of medicine is \"healer heal thyself\". A healer is someone who has experienced personal healing and through their own life style demonstrates well being. A healer's presence facilitates the well being by embodying compassion and humility. Bottom line, if you are facilitating healing you must demonstrate you are healthy. Conclusion: By treating mind and body as a unit, and therefore correlating mental disorders with physical symptoms, a larger and more holistic diagnosis can be implemented. It would include the person`s social life, working and financial conditions, and any other sources of stress. Being a healer involves developing compassionate skills to address the fear of illness in people. Informing some one of bad news can be traumatic, or it can be the inspiration to move forward with an open mind and heart and handle an unexpected crisis without fear-which debilitates the immune system. Another wise innovation is administering medicine in a way that does no harm, or at the very least minimizes harmful consequences. For example, to treat every patient individually, not following a generic hospital protocol, and by allowing more time for the body to recover its immunity after an invasive procedure before administering radiation or chemotherapy. Healing transforms the passive dependency of the patients on drugs and surgery into a pro-active responsible attitude towards their health care. To be well requires a consciously chosen life style aimed at preventing dis-ease by promoting well being. The medical professional engaged in healing cares, sees educates, and relates to a person as more than the physical or mental symptoms they present. She makes a humble and empowering connection with the people she is helping, and support them to connect to themselves to make internal changes as part of the healing process. Lastly the addition of healing into a medical model addresses how issues of identity, such as feeling worthless, burn out, or guilty, which develop into physical symptoms, are really symptoms of disconnection from our greater identity, our Soul.
