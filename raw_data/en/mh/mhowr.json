them change their behavior and thus improve their health Intentionally regulating attention or systematically focusing on particular aspects of experience Using techniques to slow certain body functions down (for example, by slowing the heart rate) and thus to relieve tension and stress Biologically based practices Use of naturally occurring substances (such as particular foods and micronutrients) to promote wellness Uses substances that occur naturally in plants or animals to treat symptoms or disease (such as cartilage used to treat joint pain) Uses a drug to bind with and remove a metal or mineral that is believed to be present in excess or toxic amounts in the body Use specialized dietary regimens (such as the macrobiotic, Paleo, low carbohydrate, or Mediterranean diet) to treat or prevent a specific disease, to generally promote wellness, or to detoxify the body Manipulative and body-based practices Manipulation of parts of the body (such as joints and muscles) to treat various conditions and symptoms Based on the belief that the body in balance will improve certain symptoms and that its parts are interdependent Involves manipulating the spine

exercises or lifestyle changes Uses heated cups, inverted and placed on the skin to create vacuum that sucks the skin partway into the cup, which may be left in place for several minutes Considered a form of massage that increases blood flow to targeted regions in an effort to alter inflammation and certain conditions Involves manipulating muscles and other tissues to reduce pain and muscle spasm

pressure to specific areas of the foot, hand, or ear that are believed to correspond to different organs or systems of the body Involves rubbing a dull implement such as a coin or a spoon across skin, usually on the back, neck, or extremities Considered a form of massage, also called gua sha Energy therapies Manipulation of energy fields thought to exist in and around the body (biofields) to maintain or restore health Based on the belief that a universal life force or subtle energy resides in and around the body and throughout the universe Stimulates specific points on the body, usually by inserting very thin needles into the skin and underlying tissues to affect the flow of qi along energy pathways (meridians) and thus restore balance in the body Qi gong A gentle movement practice in traditional Chinese medicine using postures, breathing, and meditation to improve healing An energy therapy involving placing magnets on the body to reduce pain or enhance healing An energy therapy involving practitioners channeling energy through their hands and transferring it into a person's body to promote healing An energy therapy using the therapist's healing energy, usually without touching the person, to identify and repair imbalances in the person's biofield *Many solutions have been diluted so many times that they contain no measurable molecules of the active ingredient.
