[Request Appointment](/contact/) \"I'm not super savvy with acupuncture, so I just called the first clinic that came up in neighborhood searches. I'm so glad I just happened to end up here--Avigail is WONDERFUL!\" - Virginia R. \"Since May of 2022 I have had horrific pain in my neck due to severe arthritis. After several months of dealing with this pain I thought I would try acupuncture. I was desperate because nothing else seemed to work. So far, I have had five sessions and now I have been pain free for nine days in a row. I am so grateful and relieved.\" - Laurel Haas \"Avigail is absolutely the real deal! I am a massage therapist and nutritionist, so a thorough intake is always high on my list for other healthcare providers. Avigail took the time to get to know me and my top health concerns so I left our session feeling cared for and with less pain and numbness.\" -Amber H. \"Avigail is absolutely wonderful - I can not say enough about my positive experience at Ballard Acupuncture Center. Avigail is extremely experience in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine and she has been an integral part of my peri-menopausal treatment. The acupuncture treatment has been safe, comfortable and healing. I highly recommend!\" -Carrie Chou \"Avigail is one of two acupuncturists I have seen, and she is certainly the better of the two in my opinion. The acupuncture definitely had notable effects on my general muscle relaxation.\" -Miles R. \"Avigail is a talented, intuitive acupuncturist. I am so grateful to have worked with her. She most recently saw both of my teenage kids, and has always hit the mark directly, helping them with their issues. She is the best out there, you cannot go wrong seeing her, or anyone at her clinic- all so well trained! \" -Jena Peterson \"I began seeing Avigail as an alternative to cortisone injections for arthritis and etc. (complications from a broken bone in my foot). The foot is SOOOOO much better, nearly 100% now, but the thing that has surprised me is that my sleep, digestion, energy and anxiety/stress have all been helped as a \"extra benefit\" of the treatments! \" -Erica S. \"I cannot say enough good things about Avigail and Ballard Accupuncture Center. I am currently pregnant, and setup an appointment for extreme prenatal anxiety at the recommendation of my Doula. Treatment from Avigail has been instrumental in regaining control of my anxiety and feeling balanced and empowered in my pregnancy. It has truly made all the difference.\" -Sophia Ashton \"I've been seeing Avigail for almost a year. I am so happy with the treatment I receive from her. From the first time I came in, she has listened carefully to my needs and tailors my treatment accordingly. Although acupuncture cannot cure everything, Avigail can certainly help with many physical and emotional concerns. Every time I see her I come away feeling relaxed and specific aches and pains just kind of disappear.\" -Jana R.
