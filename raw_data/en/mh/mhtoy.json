Burn injuries are second only to motor vehicle accidents as a leading cause of accidental death in the United States. When should you seek emergency help for a burn? \"With minor burns it is appropriate to go to your primary care physician or a walk-in clinic rather than the emergency room,\" says A. Jon Smally, M.D., director of Emergency Medicine at Hartford Hospital. \"In general, if a burn is more than three inches in diameter, has blisters or is close to the eyes or sensitive areas, seek medical care.\" Children and the elderly are more likely than adults to experience complications from burns. First-degree burns Mild burns or minor scalding only affect the top layer of the skin, but can appear red, swollen and painful. Sunburn is one example of a minor first-degree burn. Most first-degree burns do not require emergency treatment. Rinse with cool water (not ice). Apply Bacitracin ointment and cover with a sterile gauze bandage. Second-degree burns More serious burns affect deeper skin layers and cause severe pain and swell - ing. Blisters develop and the skin appears red and splotchy. Second-degree burns (no larger than three inches in diameter) can be treated as minor unless the burn injures the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or joints. Third-degree burns The most serious burns involve all layers of the skin, which may appear black and charred-looking or dry and white. Deep burns may heal very slowly and leave disfiguring or disabling scars. For major burns, call 911 or seek emergency medical care. What to do until emergency help arrives: Don't remove burned clothing. Don't immerse burns in cold water. Elevate burned body parts above heart level, if possible. Cover the area of the burn with a sterile bandage or a clean, dry cloth. 2Burn BasicsDriven by obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), sufferers try to stave off their frightening feelings by indulging in behaviors that give them an illusory sense of control. Haunted by obsessive fears or forbidden urges, they try repeated hand washing, counting, checking and cleaning in a vain effort to control their intrusive thoughts. Last season's reality show, The OCD Project, showcased six faces of the bewildering disorder for millions of viewers nationwide. The show followed the OCD sufferers as they underwent treatment at a mansion in the California hills, led by clinical psychologist David Tolin, Ph.D., director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"The six people on the show were fairly representative of the type of individuals we treat in our cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions at the IOL,\" says Dr. Tolin. \"VH1 chose a group of people who wanted to be on the show. I wanted to be sure that they really did have OCD and that they would benefit from exposure therapy.\" The reality show followed all six individuals as they made their way through three weeks of \"exposure and response prevention\" therapy\u2014a proven treatment that helps individuals reduce their anxiety as they become \"desensitized\" by repeatedly facing their inner demons. One of the more striking moments in the show occurred when Dr. Tolin licked the sole of his shoe to convince the group that germs would not kill him. Under medical supervision and the watchful eye of Dr. Tolin, the individuals began to change their thinking by confronting whatever frightened them the most. Arine, for one, had to go around in circles repeatedly checking where she had been driving because she feared hitting someone with her car. Both her father and grand - father had died in car accidents, which set the stage for \"The OCD Project\" Is A Reality TV Hit on VH1 Arine's fears that she might kill someone while driving. She became caught in a web of fear and avoidance. Over the course of the eight shows, she finally let go of her morbid anxieties\u2014helped by Dr. Tolin throwing dolls under the wheels to show how irrational her fears really were. Traci overcame her fears as she endured a scary visit to the morgue and a mock funeral for her 9-year-old son, while Jerry and Cody agreed to spend time in jail. As the others steadily improved, Kevin was asked to leave the show (and referred to another program) because Dr. Tolin suspected he had Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, rather than OCD. Kristin agreed to go for follow-up treatment in another inpatient facility after the three-week intensive program. \"Some people doing therapy on TV are involved in the edit - ing process,\" says Dr. Tolin. \"I did not have any control over what was filmed or how the show turned out.\" Growing evidence links OCD to abnormal circuitry and un - usual patterns of brain activity. \"The most effective treat - ment we know of for OCD is exposure and response preven - tion,\" explains Dr. Tolin. \"The person needs to learn that the things they are afraid of are not really dangerous. OCD is a neuropsychiatric disorder. Your brain reacts as if a mistake is being made even when no mistake is being made. It's a false alarm of the brain.\" \"Imagine living in constant fear. Every minute of every day. Imagine the weight of the world feels like it's on your shoulders and your every move could kill you...could cause harm to your loved ones...and the only way you could cope with that fear is to engage in repetitive behaviors.\" \u2014 Dr. David Tolin in The OCD Project, VH1's hit TV show Dr. David Tolin works with Kristin, who feared being touched.

One in five American women suffer from heavy periods or ab - normal bleeding. For many women, hysterectomy remains the treatment of choice. Women often suffer from heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding as they approach menopause. Benign fibroid tumors of the uterus afflict about 40 percent of women over age 40 and account for about a third of all hysterectomies performed each year in the United States. African American women are at especially high risk for fibroids, which can grow bigger than a bowling ball, caus - ing heavy bleeding, anemia, back and pelvic pain, urinary frequency or pressure on the bladder. \"Women have new minimally invasive treat - ment options,\" says Frederick J. Rau, M.D., of Gynecology & Obstetrics. A non-surgical approach called uterine artery embolization \u2014performed by interventional radiologists\u2014starves the fibroid of blood supply and shrivels the tumor away over time. Endometrial ablation (freezing or burning the uterine lining) offers an alternative to hormones, birth control pills or other treatments for abnor - mal bleeding. Performed in the doctor's office, ablation can often eliminate heavy bleeding or irregular periods in women who no longer want children. The Mirena intrauterine device (IUD) is also FDA-approved to treat heavy periods. Five million women in the United States suffer from endometriosis, a disabling condition that causes pain and cramping when cells from the uterine lining spread to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder and bowel. The most commonly performed major gynecologic surgical procedure in the United States, hysterectomy permanently relieves pelvic pain and excessive bleeding. Hysterectomy no longer means a lengthy operation or a disfiguring scar. Minimally Invasive Techniques Smaller scars, reduced pain, minimal blood loss and shorter recovery times have spurred the rapid growth of minimally invasive surgery at Hartford Hospital. Today, minimally invasive surgery is rou - tine for fibroid tumors, ovarian cysts, tubal ligation (\"tube-tying\"). Tubal ligation can be performed with a mini - mally invasive technique in the doctor's office, says Linda Taylor, M.D., of Taylor Associates Gynecology in Farmington. Using a hysteroscope to look into the uterus, physicians choose one of two techniques to block the fallopian tubes and form a natural barrier to fertilization. The Essure microinsert or the Adiana silicone matrix can be placed in the fallopian tube to stimulate scarring and occlude (obstruct) the fallopian tube. Chronic pelvic pain accounts for an estimated 20 percent of all outpatient gynecological vis - its and up to a third of \"laparoscopic\" exams. Laparoscopy provide an innovative way to look within the abdomen to diagnose and treat gyneco - logical problems with less bleeding, swelling and scarring than conventional scalpels. Laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" surgery allows physicians to insert a pencil-thin fiberoptic camera and instruments through small slits, or \"ports,\" in the skin. Surgical Robotics Experience is a significant factor in predicting good surgical outcomes. Hartford Hospital ranks among the top five medical centers in the nation in minimally invasive and robotic pelvic recon - structive surgery. Physicians at Hartford Hospital now routinely use the da Vinci surgical robot to treat a variety of gynecologic conditions, including fibroids and endometriosis. Robotic-assisted sur -Technological innovations in fiberoptics, lasers and surgical robotics have shaped new healing tools for gynecological care. New Choices for Women's Health 5gery offers significant advantages over traditional ap - proaches to laparoscopic or \"open\" abdominal surgery. \"The advantages of the surgical robot include signifi - cantly less blood loss, smaller incisions and less post- operative pain,\" says obstetrician-gynecologist Odin Kuiper, M.D., of Farmington OB-GYN Group. \"If the goal is to preserve fertility, we perform detailed surgery to remove endometriosis around the bladder and bowel while keeping the uterus and ovaries intact.\" \"Robotic-assisted surgery can be a better choice for women with scarring or pelvic adhesions from prior pelvic surgery or cesarean section,\" adds Dr. Rau, who performs both laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hysterectomy. \"The advantages for the patient, compared to open surgical methods, include shorter hospital stays, less need for pain medication and faster recovery.\" Using the surgical robot, physicians can remove the uterus through a slit in the skin rather than a long incision through the abdomen. \"In Connecticut, fibroid tumors are removed through an abdominal incision about 60 percent of the time,\" adds Dr. Kuiper. \"If your physician suggests an open incision, get another opinion. In the hands of physicians with appropriate training and experience, the surgical robot reduces the chances of bleeding complica - tions and offers quicker recovery.\" \"My robotic hysterectomy with you was better than I ever could have imagined,\" recalls one of Dr. Kuiper's patients. \"I'm back to running, exercising, yoga and riding and I feel fantastic. I don't know why I waited so long.\" Robotic Advantages Robotic-assisted techniques have revolutionized surgi - cal control. \"The robot assists during closure and repair of the vagina after hysterectomy,\" says Dr. Rau. \"Patients have significantly less pain and trauma compared to open surgery. Most patients are home the next day and recovery is usually very quick.\" The robot helps with cutting and suturing when remov - ing pelvic adhesions in the abdomen or fertility-damaging areas of endometriosis that can invade the muscle wall. In today's high-tech operating room, physicians control robotic instruments with accuracy unmatched by even the steadiest of human hands. \"The robot has unlimited strength and never gets tired,\" says Peter Doelger, M.D., an obstetrician-gynecologist with Connecticut Multispecialty Group. \"Robotic surgery is useful for technically challenging procedures and reduces post-operative complications, especially in obese patients.\" Urogynecology Hartford Hospital was the first medical center in the Northeast to use the robot for urogynecological surgery. 6PHYSICIAN PROFILE Aaron Shafer, M.D., an obstetrician- gynecologist with a specialty in gynecologic oncology, recently joined Hartford Hospital. He brings significant experience in minimally invasive and robotic surgery to treat ovarian and cervical cancers, precancerous lesions and gynecologic malignancies. He earned his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and his medical degree cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 2002. He did his fellowship training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, where he was mentored by John F. Boggess, M.D., one of the pioneers in robotic surgery for gynecologic cancers. In addition to an active clinical research schedule, Dr. Shafer has a faculty appointment at the University of Connecticut. He teaches robotic sur - gery and trains residents in gynecologic oncology surgery, clinic and colpo- scopy during their rotations at Hartford Hospital. He enjoys running, sailing, mountain biking and skiing at Stratton Mountain in Vermont.Aaron Shafer, M.D. Today, Hartford Hospital leads the region in providing mini - mally invasive procedures to treat pelvic organ prolapse and bladder disorders that affect the health and quality of life of women of all ages. While laparoscopy reduces the need for an open procedure and shortens recovery times, the robot offers unprecedented control and precision during lengthy or difficult operations to hoist prolapsed organs back into place. \"Conventional surgery requires a long surgical incision that can take up to eight weeks to heal,\" says Christine LaSala, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Division of Urogynecology, who specializes in urinary and gynecological disorders along with Paul Tulikangas, M.D., Adam Steinberg, D.O., and Colleen Mellen, APRN. \"The robot makes the procedure easier to perform so we can often avoid an abdominal incision.\" Although urinary incontinence is a relatively common problem that afflicts an estimated 20 million Americans, patients are sometimes too embarrassed to discuss their symptoms with their doctors. About a quarter of women of childbearing age experience urinary incontinence, and the number of sufferers rises sharply as estrogen levels drop at menopause and muscles lose their elasticity. Being overweight not only raises a woman's risk for heart disease and diabetes, but also for urinary inconti - nence. \"About 60 percent of our patients are overweight or obese,\" says Dr. LaSala. \"Many women suffer from gyne - cological problems complicated by obesity. Studies show that even a weight loss of 10 percent often reduces incontinence.\" Obesity hinders both surgery and recovery. \"Obese pa - tients suffer more post-operative complications,\" she says. \"The robot makes surgery less backbreaking for procedures that require large amounts of suturing. Obese patients have more layers of fat, and while the risk is still low, they are more likely to get a post-operative wound infection.\" Gynecologic Cancer While most women who undergo a biopsy find that their irregular bleeding or pelvic pain is caused by a benign condition, Hartford Hospital's gynecologic oncologists are experts in treating cervical, vulvar, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. Post-menopausal women who experience bleeding should see a physician promptly because of the risk of uterine cancer. Medical advances have brought new treatments for gynecologic cancers, offering new options for women of re - productive age. Whenever possible, Hartford Hospital phy - sicians perform minimally invasive procedures to remove a tumor with less trauma and blood loss than traditional cancer surgery. 78When cancer is diagnosed early, robotic surgery can help with removal of ovarian masses or speed surgeries involving delicate organs or blood vessels. \"We use the robot for complex cancer surgery and lymph node dissec - tion,\" says Aaron Shafer, M.D., a gynecologic oncologist at Hartford Hospital. \"The robot provides greater dexterity for endometrial cancers that tend to occur in older, heavier women. Obese women have an increased risk of death from gyneco - logic cancers.\" Younger, thinner women are at risk for cervical cancer, especially if they smoke, although annual Pap test screening has reduced deaths. \"We're currently studying surgical outcomes in obese women with cervi - cal cancer,\" says Dr. Shafer. \"We want to see whether robotic surgery for radical hyster - ectomy can improve healing and shorten recovery time.\" Ovarian Cancer \"Ovarian cancer is often far advanced by the time it is diagnosed,\" says Hartford Hospital gynecologic oncologist Amy Brown, M.D., explaining that robotic surgery is useful only for early cancers. \"Even after surgery and chemo- therapy, tumors can recur anywhere in the abdomen.\" Hartford Hospital is participating in a clinical study to see whether a second tumor-removing surgery, followed by chemotherapy, will keep ovarian cancer patients disease- free longer. Patients enrolled in the study will also receive the targeted drug Avastin in addition to standard chemo - therapy. \"Many patients are happy to get access to Avastin, an expensive drug often not covered by insurance,\" says Dr. Brown. While some studies have linked breast cancer to oral contraceptives, new research shows that women on the Pill for five years or more had about half the risk of get - ting ovarian cancer as those who never took the Pill. \"The theory is that birth control pills shut down ovulation,\" says Dr. Brown. \"Symptoms of ovarian cancer\u2014bloating, urinary urgency and pelvic pain\u2014remain vague. We need better screening ways to screen for ovarian cancer. We don't want to perform surgery unnecessarily.\" Are Hormones Safe? In 2002, many women abruptly stopped hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after the landmark Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial showed that women taking hormones were at higher risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. At the time, more than 40 percent of menopausal women used HRT. Researchers theorized that it might help stave off heart disease, osteoporosis and even Alzheimer's disease beyond menopausal years. \"The initial report set off a lot of panic,\" says Amy Johnson, M.D., a Hartford Hospital OB- GYN at Women's Ambulatory Health who runs a menopause clinic at A Women's Life Center at Blue Back Square. Celebrity endorsements from Oprah, for one, may give women the impression that \"bioidentical\" hormones are somehow safer than estrogen- plus-progestin pills because they're natural. \"We have no data to show that bioidentical hormones are any better or even as effective as FDA-approved drugs,\" says Dr. Johnson, noting that HRT doses are lower today and treatment is very individualized. \"Some antidepressants decrease hot flashes, but we don't have good data on the effectiveness of herbal medications.\" Because soy milk contains estrogen-like plant isoflavones, the beverage is often recommended for relief of menopausal symptoms. \"The data on soy and its effects on breast can - cer are still inconclusive,\" says Dr. Johnson. \"There is some concern that soy has estrogenic effects. Many breast cancer survivors are unaware that it may be dangerous to eat large amounts of soy.\" \"Changes in hormone delivery offer new approaches to HRT,\" adds Dr. Rau. \"Sprays or gels rubbed on the skin may be safer for the cardiovascular system. Women taking hor - mones because they're suffering from insomnia or painful vaginal atrophy now stay on hormones for a shorter period of time than in the past. We prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible duration.\" \"Local therapy to treat vaginal dryness\u2014such as the use of estrogen creams\u2014is safer than pills because of its limited systemic absorption,\" adds Dr. Johnson. \"The risk of cardiovascular problems and cancer associated with HRT is small, but warrants careful patient selection. For most women, hot flashes and night sweats decrease over time and eventually go away.\" See www.harthosp.com/women for more information about women's health.Hartford Hospital is participating in a clinical study to see whether a second tumor-removing surgery, followed by chemotherapy, will keep ovarian cancer patients disease-free longer. WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Whooping Cough Comeback The highly contagious bacte - rial disease pertussis is on the rise among adolescents and adults vaccinated in childhood with combined diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend booster shots for adults and teens since immunity wanes over time and antibiotics are no longer routinely pre - scribed for coughs and colds.Knees News People at risk for osteoar - thritis of the knee are more likely to have knees relatively far apart and ankles closer together, say National Institutes of Health researchers. The \"outward-facing\" knee align - ment puts a strain on aging joints. Joint replacement surgery can help individuals with osteoarthritis, caused by wear and tear on the cartilage that cushions the ends of bone at the joints.Dad's Baby Blues While many moms feel de - pressed after having a baby, the Journal of the American Medical Association reports that 10 percent of fathers feel depressed before or af - ter their baby is born. New moms experience a sudden drop in feel-good pregnancy hormones, but depression in new dads peaks about three to six months after birth. American men suffer from post-partum depression at higher rates than dads in other countries.Watch Your Waist A large waist circumfer - ence is a better predictor of mortality than body mass index (BMI) in older adults, says Archives of Internal Medicine. Regardless of their weight, Cancer Prevention Study participants with greater waist circumference increased their chances of dying from all causes by about twofold in com - parison with those with less abdominal fat. 9 Excess weight accounts for about 70 percent of diabetes risk in the United States. Even with treatment, diabetes can lead to cardio - vascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction, stroke, blindness and lower-extremity amputations. The sooner a morbidly obese individual undergoes weight-loss (bariatric) surgery after being diagnosed with diabetes, the better. Significant long-term weight loss offers the best way to control diabetes. Obesity disrupts endocrine function, weakens joints and muscles, and taxes the hearts and lungs. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. \"For some patients, weight loss surgery can reduce the need for insu - lin or completely eliminate diabetes medications,\" explains Pavlos Papasavas, M.D., of Connecticut Surgical Group. At Hartford Hospital, bariatric surgery is performed with tiny in- cisions and minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques. The Weight Loss Program at Hartford Hospital, directed by Drs. Darren Tishler and Pavlos Papasavas, offers a variety of weight-loss procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band (LAP-BAND) and sleeve gastrectomy. \"An estimated 85 percent of diabetics who undergo gastric bypass surgery and 60 percent of LAP-BAND patients experience complete remission of their diabetes symptoms,\" adds Dr. Papasavas. \"Patients lose about 65 to 75 percent of their excess weight after gastric bypass and 45 to 55 percent after LAP-BAND.\" Bariatric surgery is recommended for morbidly obese patients who tip the scales at more than 100 pounds. One way to estimate your body fat is the body mass index (BMI). To calculate your BMI, multiply your weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches, and divide again by height in inches. You're overweight if your BMI is 25 to 30, obese if it's over 30, and morbidly obese above 40. Bariatric surgery is appropriate for anyone with a BMI over 40 or someone with a BMI between 35 and 40 who also suffers from a \"co- morbid\" condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high choles - terol, sleep apnea, or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Weight loss may also be crucial to the success of joint replacement surgery in obese patients with osteoarthritis. Weight-loss surgery can often alleviate obesity-related conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol relatively quickly. Maintenance of long-term weight loss depends on a healthy diet and structured exercise. The Surgical Weight Loss Program at Hartford Hospital is designated as a Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence by both the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and the American College of Surgeons.Weight Loss Surgery for Diabetes| in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | Dr. Judith Pepe and Lauren MastonAlthough successful treatment for bone cancer saved her life as a teenager, chemotherapy and radiation damaged Lauren Maston's heart. Her failing organ responded to medications until age 29, when she began almost daily visits to Hartford Hospital's congestive heart failure infusion center. Heartfelt ThanksLauren had beaten the cancer that invaded her ribs, but was now tethered to her hospital bed by heart monitoring equip - ment and lines pumping medications into her veins. \"I spent nearly a year on the transplant list and two months in the hospital waiting for a heart to become available,\" she recalls. \"You're confined to one room. You can't take a shower. There's no privacy. I spent my time doing a paint-by-numbers kit and making favors for the nurses' bridal showers.\" Early on a November morning two years ago, she got the long-awaited call that a heart was available. Because Lauren was so petite, she knew her new heart would come from a pediatric donor. \"It is a time of mixed emotions. It's a joyous moment that your wait has ended. You're scared and nervous about the surgery and many long months of recovery. Yet it's also a sad moment. The realization that someone's loved one has passed away really begins to sink in. I've gone through my own grieving process. Not a day goes by that I don't think about my donor and donor family and their selfless act to give me the gift of life during their tragic time. I will always be grateful and will do my best to take care of my new heart.\" During two tough months recovering in Hartford Hospital and another 10 months in cardiac rehab, Lauren slowly regained her strength. In August, she proudly completed a 5K walk at the 2010 National Kidney Foundation Transplant Games in Wisconsin. \"It was a huge step for me,\" says Lauren, who now works as a patient administrative assistant at the hospital where she spent so much time as a patient. Eventually she hopes to earn her master's in social work so she can share her experience with other cardiac transplant survivors. \"I think it's my calling in life.\" Since Dr. Henry Low performed Connecticut's first heart transplant more than 25 years ago, Hartford Hospital has become a comprehensive center for all stages of heart failure treatment and transplant. \"Andy Buczek was our first heart transplant patient in the fall of 1984, and this year we performed our 300th,\" says James E. Dougherty, M.D., the Transplant Program's medical director. \"Both are doing well, demonstrating the long-term potential for a long and healthy life following heart transplantation.\" Jonathan A. Hammond, M.D., is surgical director of the Heart Transplant Program, the first JCAHO-certified program in Connecticut to offer a full spectrum of ventricular assist device (VAD) capability for critically ill patients, often as a bridge to transplantation. The VAD does the work of the heart's pumping chambers to limit organ deterioration until a donor heart can be found. Today, Hartford Hospital's Heart Failure and Transplant Center, under the direction of Detlef Wencker, M.D., is recog - nized as one of the best in the country, with survival rates well above the national average. Dr. Wencker leads a multidis - ciplinary team that cares for heart failure, transplant and VAD patients. Patients with failing hearts receive world-class care without traveling out of town or waiting months in another city until a donor heart becomes available. LifeChoice Donor Services coordinates organ donation for northern Connecticut and western Massachusetts, encompass - ing both Hartford Hospital and Springfield's Baystate Medical Center. \"They don't do heart transplants at Baystate, which shortens wait times for Hartford Hospital patients,\" says Dr. Dougherty. Hartford Hospital is in a different organ procurement region and does not directly \"compete\" for organs with hospitals in Boston or New Haven. \"The limiting factor for all transplantation is availability of organs,\" adds Dr. Dougherty. \"Each year, only 2,200 heart transplants are performed across the United States, a number that has remained relatively stable and critically short of the number needed for patients awaiting transplantation.\" Donor organs often come from gravely injured accident victims who have been declared \"brain dead\" despite the trauma team's aggressive efforts to resuscitate them. \"We do everything in our power to save them,\" says intensivist Judith L. Pepe, M.D., a specialist who treats critically ill or injured patients in the intensive care unit. \"The option for organ donation only comes at the end of life after heroic efforts have failed.\" In the best scenario, the individual has made his or her wishes known to the family and has registered as an organ donor with the Department of Motor Vehicles, which links to a legally binding registry. You can designate your donor status when you get your license or register online. \"In Connecticut and many states with first-person consent laws, next-of-kin consent is not required to move forward with donation if the deceased is a registered donor,\" explains Jami Tyska, RRT, Hartford Hospital's in-house donation coordinator. When a severe brain injury leads to a fatal outcome de - spite the best efforts of the hospital's critical care team, the organs of a someone who has registered to be an organ donor are supported artificially on a mechanical respirator. \"We let the family know that the patient has died, or is not going to survive, in the most kind and caring way we can,\" says Dr. Pepe. \"We call LifeChoice to send a coordinator to evaluate the patient as a potential organ donor. There is no absolute age limit for organ donation. If the patient meets the criteria for organ donation, we do our best to support the family dur - ing this difficult time.\" \"We don't learn whether or not someone is on the organ donor registry until death is imminent,\" adds Maria Tackett, R.N., MSN, CCRN, nurse director of the neurointensive care unit at Hartford Hospital. \"There are strict clinical protocols for assessing brain death, and only specially trained physi - cians can make the determination.\" New legislation calls for every hospital in Connecticut to facilitate organ donation and to make transplantation a prior - ity. \"It is crucial that the process of organ donation be totally separate and independent from medical treatment,\" adds Dr. Dougherty. \"The family can be comforted knowing that the donor gave several people a beautiful gift of life.\" 11 Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at 860-545-1888 or 800-545-7664 for information about any program.

Serving accessories can be purchased at the Hartford Hospital Auxiliary Gift Shop.Combine boiling water and gelatin in a cup, stirring until dissolved. Set aside. Beat egg yolks and milk in a bowl. Whisk egg mixture, sugar and flour together in a saucepan until well mixed and sugar dissolves. Cook over medium heat, stirring continuously for 10 minutes until the mixture reaches a boil and becomes thick. Stir in gelatin mixture and vanilla extract.

Optional: Garnish with apple slices and cinnamon. Serves 8.Banana Cream Pie This low-calorie treat is low in both fat and carbohydrates, making it a heart-healthy choice for a holiday dessert. Bananas are cholesterol-free and are high in potassium and fiber. According to the American Heath Association, an occasional egg can be part of a healthy diet. Eggs contain a nutrient called choline, protein, minerals, essential fatty acids and vitamins A, E, D, K, folate and riboflavin. \"Two egg yolks for eight servings in this recipe is only a quarter of an egg per person,\" says Brunella A. Ibarrola, M.S., R.D., CD-N, of Hartford Hospital's Department of Nutrition Services. \"Most people who are following general heart-healthy guidelines can enjoy, on average, three eggs per week.\" One egg contains about 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol. The recommended cho - lesterol limit is 300 milligrams daily for people with normal LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. High levels of LDL\u2014the result of genetics, diet and inactivity\u2014trigger the buildup of fatty plaque, leading to chest pain and arterial blockages. Generally, those with high LDL levels or taking cholesterol-lowering medication should eat less than 200 mg of cholesterol per day.
