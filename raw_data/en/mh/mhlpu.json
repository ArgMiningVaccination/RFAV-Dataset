Pharm by DR. BALAMURALIDHARA V Asst . professor - Regulatory Affairs Group Dept. of pharmaceutics JSSCP, Mysore GUIDELINES Guidance on transfer of human biological material for research Dietary guidelines for Indians Cancer Management Guidelines Guidelines for Good Clinical Laboratory Practices Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Participants Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 3 STATEMENT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS This statement of Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Participants shall be known as the ICMR Code and shall consist of the following:- (a) Statement of General Principles on Research using Human Participants in Biomedical Research (b) Statement of Specific Principles on Research using Human Participants in specific areas of Biomedical Research 5 Background post Second World War Nuremberg Code was formulated in 1947 In 1948, Universal Declaration of Human Rights expressed concern about rights of human beings being subjected to involuntary maltreatment. In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights specifically stated, 'No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, in human or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his consent to medical or scientific treatment.' 6 GENERAL STATEMENT Medical and related research using human beings as research participants must necessarily ensure that - 1. The PURPOSE, of such research is that it should be directed towards the increase of knowledge about the human condition in relation to its social and natural environment. 2. Such research is CONDUCTED under conditions that no person or persons become a mere means for the betterment of others and that human beings who are subject to any medical research . 7 3. Such research must be subjected to a regime of EVALUATION at all stages of the proposal i.e., research design and experimentation, declaration of results and use of the results thereof, and that each such evaluation shall bear in mind the objects to be achieved, the means by which they are sought to be achieved, the anticipated benefits and dangers, the potential uses and abuses of the experiment and its results. 8 STATEMENT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES 1. Principles of essentiality. 2. Principles of voluntariness, informed consent and community agreement. 3. Principles of non-exploitation. 4. Principles of privacy and confidentiality. 5. Principles of professional competence. 6. Principles of precaution and risk minimisation. 7. Principles of accountability and transparency. 8. Principles of the maximisation of the public interest and of distributive justice. 9 9. Principles of institutional arrangements. 10. Principles of public domain. 11. Principles of totality of responsibility. 12. Principles of compliance. 10 Principles of voluntariness, informed consent and community agreement. whereby research participants are fully apprised of the research and the impact and risk of such research on the research participant and others The right to abstain from further participation in the research irrespective of any legal or other obligation 11 GUIDELINESON AUDIO-VISUAL RECORDING OF INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS IN CLINICAL TRIAL PROCEDURE OF AUDIO-VISUAL RECORDING the Investigator will identify the protocol If the Investigator does not know the language of the subject a member of the study team who understands the language, would become the interpreter The video camera for the audio-visual recording should be of adequate capability to simultaneously capture the facial details of subject, Impartial Witness (if any), Investigator/authorised person present during the consent process room conducive to recording of disturbance-free audio and video not to include unrelated persons/patients at the hospital within the field of vision. 12 Principles of privacy and confidentiality. identity and records of participants kept confidential are disclosed without valid scientific and legal reasons which may be essential for the purposes of therapeutics or other interventions 14 Ethical Review Procedures Basic Responsibilities 1. To protect the dignity, rights and well being of the potential research participants. 2. To ensure that universal ethical values and international scientific standards are expressed in terms of local community values and customs. 3. To assist in the development and the education of a research community responsive to local health care requirements. 15 Composition The IECs should be multidisciplinary and multisectorial in composition. Independence and competence are the two hallmarks of an IEC. The number of persons in an ethics committee should be kept fairly small (8 - 12 members). It is generally accepted that a minimum of five persons is required to form the quorum 16 The composition may be as follows:- 1. Chairperson 2. One - two persons from basic medical science area 3. One - two clinicians from various Institutes 4. One legal expert or retired judge 5. One social scientist/ representative of non- governmental voluntary agency 6. One philosopher/ ethicist/ theologian 7. One lay person from the community 8. Member Secretary 17 As per revised Schedule Y of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, amended in 2005, the ethics committee approving drug trials should have in the quorum at least one representative from the following groups: 1. One basic medical scientist 2. One clinician 3. One legal expert or retired judge 4. One social scientist/ representative of non governmental organization/philosopher/ ethicist/theologian or a similar person 5. One lay person from the community. 18 TRAINING The EC members should be encouraged to keep abreast of all national and international developments in ethics through orientation courses on related topics by its own members or regular training organized by constituted body(ies), so that they become aware of their role and responsibilities. 19 REGULATION Once the legislation of guidelines occurs which is currently under active consideration by the Ministry of Health, a Biomedical Research Authority will be set up under the proposed Bill on Biomedical Research on Human Participants(Promotion and Regulation) 20 SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION 1. The title with signature of Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-investigators as attestation for conducting the study. 2. Clear research objectives and rationale for undertaking the investigation in human participants in the light of existing knowledge. 3. Recent curriculum vitae of the Investigators indicating qualification and experience. 4. Participant recruitment procedures and brochures, if any. 21 5. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry of participants. 6. Precise description of methodology of the proposed research, including sample size (with justification), type of study design, intended intervention, dosages of drugs, route of administration, duration of treatment and details of invasive procedures if any. 7. Plan to withdraw or withhold standard therapies in the course of research. 8. Plan for statistical analysis of the study. 22 Cont...... 9. Procedure for seeking and obtaining informed consent with sample of patient information sheet and informed consent forms in English and local languages. 10. Safety of proposed intervention and any drug or vaccine to be tested, including results of relevant laboratory, animal and human research. 11. A statement on conflict-of-interest (COI), if any. 23 DECISION MAKING PROCESS 1. The decision must be taken by a broad consensus after the quorum requirements are fulfilled to recommend / reject / suggest modification for a repeat review or advice appropriate steps. The Member Secretary should communicate the decision in writing to the PI. 2. If a member has conflict-of-interest (COI) involving a project then s/he should submit this in writing to the chairperson before the review meeting, and it should also be recorded in the minutes. 3. If one of the members has her/his own proposal for review or has any COI then s/he should withdraw from the IEC while the project is being discussed 24 Cont.... 4. A negative decision should always be supported by clearly defined reason 5 .An IEC may decide to reverse its positive decision on a study if it receives information that may adversely affect the risk/ benefit ratio. 6. The discontinuation of a trial should be ordered if the IEC finds that the goals of the trial have already been achieved midway results are obtained. 7. In case of premature termination of study, notification should include the reasons for termination along with the summary of results conducted till date. 8. Meetings are to be minuted which should be approved and signed by the Chairperson/ alternate Chairperson/ designated member of the committee. 25 REVIEW PROCESS The ethical review should be done in formal meetings and EC should not take decisions through circulation of proposals. The committee should meet at regular intervals and should not keep a decision pending for more than 3 - 6 months, which may be defined in the SOP. 1. PERIODIC REVIEW 2. CONTINUING REVIEW 3. INTERIM REVIEW 26 MONITORING RECORD KEEPING i.The Constitution and composition of the IEC. ii. signed and dated copies of the latest the curriculum vitae of all IEC members with records of training if any. iii. standing operating procedures of the IEC; iv. national and International guidelines; v. copies of protocols submitted for review; vi. all correspondence with IEC members and investigators regarding application, decision and follow up. vii. agenda of all IEC meetings; viii. minutes of all IEC meetings with signature of the Chairperson; 27 ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT A full time secretariat and space for keeping records is required for a well functioning IEC. The members could be given a reasonable compensation for the time spared for reviewing the proposals. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS While all the above requirements are applicable to biomedical research as a whole irrespective of the specialty of research, there are certain specific concerns pertaining to specialised areas of research which require additional safe guards / protection and specific considerations for the IEC to take note of. Examples of such instances are research involving children, pregnant and lactating women, vulnerable participants and those with diminished autonomy besides issues pertaining to commercialisation of research and international collaboration. 28 General Ethical Issues Informed Consent Process Adequate information about the research is given in a simple and easily understandable unambiguous language in a document known as the Informed Consent Form with Participant/ Patient Information Sheet. The latter should have following components as may be applicable: Nature and purpose, Duration of participation with number, Procedures, Investigations, risks and discomforts, Benefits to participant, community or medical profession, Availability of medical treatment for such injuries or risk management 29 COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION i. When a guardian is asked to give consent on behalf of an incompetent person, no remuneration should be offered except a refund of out of pocket expenses; ii. when a participant is withdrawn from research for medical reasons related to the study the participant should get the benefit for full participation; iii. when a participant withdraws for any other reasons s/he should be paid an amount proportionate to the amount of participation. 30 Conflict Of Interest A set of conditions in which professional judgment concerning a primary interest like patient's welfare or the validity of research tends to be or appears to be unduly influenced by a secondary interest like non- financial (personal, academic or political) or financial gain is termed as Conflict of Interest (COI). Academic institutions conducting research in alliance with industries/ commercial companies require a strong review to probe possible conflicts of interest between scientific responsibilities of researchers and business interests ( ownership or part-ownership of a company developing a new product). 31 Selection of Special Groups as Research Participants I. Pregnant or nursing women ii. Children iii. Vulnerable groups 32 Essential Information on Confidentiality for Prospective Research Participants Safeguarding confidentiality - The investigator must safeguard the confidentiality of research data, which might lead to the identification of the individual participants. Data of individual participants can be disclosed under the following circumstances : a. only in a court of law under the orders of the presiding judge or b. there is threat to a person's life or c. in cases of severe adverse reaction may be required to communicate to drug registration authority or d. if there is risk to public health it takes precedence over personal right to privacy and may have to be communicated to health authority. 33 SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES 1. Drug trials 2. Vaccine trials 3. Surgical procedures / medical devices 4. Diagnostic agents - with special reference to use of radioactive materials and X-rays 5. Trials with herbal remedies 34 STATEMENT OF SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES FOR RESEARCH IN TRANSPLANTATION TRANSPLANTS FROM LIVE OR CADAVER DONORS Donation from a live donor should be restricted to renewable tissues like bone marrow, or to a paired organ. Predictable risks and compared to foreseeable benefits and improvement the donor should be informed of all possible risks in a manner easily understood by the participant before the consent is taken. experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the overall good of the donee without any risk to the life of the donor experiment the investigator comes to know that there is risk to the donor or to the recipient as a result of the procedure, it is her/ his responsibility to terminate the experiment 35 Guidelines on Cadaver Donor Transplants need for organ donation after death. If consent for organ donation is given prior to death in the presence of two or more witnesses, consent for transplantation of organs should be presumed and permissible without seeking further consent from relatives In the absence of such prior directions from the deceased, the person in lawful possession of the body will make the decision to use the organs or not, as he may think fit, after consultation with the family. 36 Under no circumstances should financial gain be made from any such procedure. There shall be no coercion and no monetary inducements offered to the family of the prospective cadaver donor. Confidentiality of the donation must be maintained on both sides. 37 Guidelines on Recipients of Transplants It is all the more important that every research protocol for transplantation should be carefully reviewed by an appropriate committee of suitably qualified scientists, jurists and other eminent members of society. The transplant research team should have high technical expertise. data management, tissue storage facilities, and surveillance procedures should be available 38 "}
