Huang Wei Ling * Department of Medical Acupuncture and Pain Management, Rua Homero Pacheco Alves, 1929, Franca, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil INTRODUCTION Spider veins are present in 41% of women over 50 years of age in North Americans and represents as aesthetic problem. According to the article written by Mujadzic, et al. entitled A Novel Approach for the Treatment of Spider Veins, traditional treatment of spider veins consists in sclerotherapy, injecting sclerosing solution into the veins. But this procedure can cause damage in the vessels well and causing subsequent fibrosis [ 1]. Purpose The purpose of this study is that spider vein has an energy cause and we need to treat the energy deficiency condition to treat the cause and not just the symptoms.

ABSTRACT Introduction: Spider veins as known as telangiectasia can result from small superficial blood vessels in the skin. According to Western medicine's point of view, spider veins rarely cause health problems and had a cosmetic problem and the treatment aims to improve the aspect. Purpose: the purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients with spider veins have chakras' energy centers deficient in energy that is leading to Blood stagnation and this is not only cosmetic issue but it is an important clinical meaning that these patients need to be treated to prevent or treat other present and future conditions that can come from energy deficient root. Methods: through two cases reports (70 and 75 years-old female patients) that went to the me clinic to treat their other clinical condition that was different from the spider veins (pain in the hip and pain in the shoulder respectively). Both patients were submitted to radiesthesia procedure which showed that both were without any energy in the chakras' energy centers, rated in one, with exception of the seventh chakra that was normal, rated in eight. The author treated their condition with Chinese dietary counseling avoiding some kinds of foods, acupuncture and auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting and homeopathy medications according to the theory entitled Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results: Both patients improved from their initial symptoms that took them to the treatment but they also said that they improved from the appearance of the spider veins in the legs and said to me that their legs were more beautiful and they are very grateful for their improvement because both searched for this kind of treatment using local injection of medication but always the spider veins reappear again. Conclusion: the conclusion of this study is that spider vein are symptoms that has a meaning in the back ground, that means that the patient has internal energy deficiency and the treatment of this condition, replenishing the energy of these five massive organs, that were in the lowest level, demonstrated through radiesthesia procedure, is of paramount importance to treat the root of spider vein formation and the treatment of this condition (energy deficiency) can prevent many present and other future health problems that both patients could have. Keywords: Spider-vein; Energy, Chakras; Traditional chinese medicine; Homeopathy2 Huang Freely available J Vasc Med Surg, Vol.9 Iss. 5 No: 426METHODS Through two cases reports of patients that went to an acupuncture clinic in Brazil to treat their pain. The first patient, a 70 years- old female patient with history of pain in the left hip. The second patient, 75 years-old female patient with history of pain in the right shoulder. Both patients were submitted to chakras' energy centers measurement using radiesthesia procedure with a crystal pendulum and the doctor discovered that both patients were in the lowest level of energy in all chakras' energy centers, rated in one out of eight, with exception of the seventh chakra that was rated in eight. The treatment of them consisted in Chinese dietary counseling, avoiding raw food, cold water, sweets and dairy products. The second group of foods was to avoid coffee, soda and mate tea. The third group of foods to avoid was fried foods, honey, eggs, coconut, chocolate, melted cheese, alcoholic beverages. The second tool used in the treatment was acupuncture associating with auricular acupuncture with apex ear bloodletting using mustard seeds applied with peace of adhesive tapes in the following points: Liver, Kidney, Lung, Heart, Kidney, Spleen, Large intestine, Shen-Men, hunger point. It was associated the use of highly diluted medications such as homeopathies according to the theory created by me (2020) entitled Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine and crystal-based medications. The medications were prescribed during a period of one year when the patients need to measure the chakras' energy centers again. RESULTS Both patients improved for their pains (hip and shoulder) but they also reported to improve their anxiety, insomnia, constipation and also, reported that their spider veins in both legs disappeared with the treatment done and their legs become more beautiful despite the doctor was not treating their spider veins but only treating the energy deficiency presented by both patients. DISCUSSION A doctor's daily practice is full of new discoveries while observing his patients on a daily basis. According to the article written by Nakano et al. entitled Treatment for telangiectasias and reticular veins, the authors are saying that the cause of spider veins is unknown [2]. Patients can be asymptomatic or can have burning, itching or pain in the legs and the risks factors, according to them are hormonal factors, family history, pregnancy, local trauma. I began my studies in traditional Chinese medicine, in 1997 but only in 2006, I used to adopt ancient treatment techniques for all localized diseases. This story began in 2006, when I attended one specific patient that was complaining pain the legs with no improvement with the use of anti-inflammatory medications. This patient searched for another kind of treatment for this pain in the legs using acupuncture. After 10 acupuncture sessions, the patient reported to me that he improved his leg pain with the treatment done but he also improved from other condition that he did not tell me. He was treating for glaucoma for the last 40 years, using eye drops, with no improvement of his intra-ocular pressure (always above 40 mmHg). For the first time of his life, his intra- ocular pressure went from 40 to 17 mmHg. After this specific case, I author began to be a researcher in the S\u00e3o Paulo University in Brazil, in the ophalmology department, to demonstrate that the treatment of energy imbalances can reduce intra-ocular pressure of patients with glaucoma [3]. This same history happened in these two cases reports, where they went to treat another condition that was not the spider vein the focus of the treatment but as I usually treat the root of the problem, that are the energy deficiencies, all the patients' symptoms will be treated at the same time, even the doctor does not know that the patient have such symptom [3]. In all my publications and presentations in all medical conferences, I always emphasize the treatment of the root of the problem, and I usually use the metaphor of the tree, to show the different viewpoint between Western and traditional Chinese medicine. In this metaphor, I am showing that Western medicine perspective do the treatment in the leaf level but Chinese medicine understands that all manifestations in the leaf of the tree is only related to energy imbalances localized in the root of this tree. So, if the doctor treats the root, all emotional and physical problems of this patient will improve at the same time, even the doctor does not know that the patient has such symptom. At the root of this tree, there are two theories in traditional Chinese medicine that are the Yin and Yang theory and the Five Elements theory, as you can see in the Figure 1 [4]. The rebalancing all energy systems of these two theories, orientating the patient's foods that they can ingest is very important toll used by us, because according to Chinese dietary counseling, there is a necessity to maintain the energy balance between the organs, due to all of them are interconnected. This way of thinking was contrary to thoughts of Galen (129 AD-c. 210) that said that the organs works independently and separately. Galen was the doctor who most influenced the thoughts of Western Medicine reasoning, until nowadays. In the case of spider veins, Western medicine's treatment is on the leaf level but in traditional Chinese medicine reasoning, they understand that the manifestation of symptoms in the leaf level (spider veins) is only manifestation of energy imbalances in the root of the tree that is invisible by the naked eyes. There are two theories in the root level, Yin and Yang (Figure 2) and Five Elements Theory (Figure 3) [4]. In this research article, I am demonstrating how I discovered the technique to cure people with spider veins in the legs because the majority of the patients went to my clinic to treat other conditions but what they usually tell me is that their legs are getting prettier, with fewer veins showing even the treatment was not carried out for this purpose, as she demonstrated in these two cases reports presented in this article [5,6]. According to one study made by me (2021) and published in an article entitled Energy Alterations and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies and Propensity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection, I measured the chakras' energy centers of 1000 patients from 2015 and 2020, and the conclusion of this study, after reviewing 409 files of this patients, were that more than 90% of the patients were in the lowest level of energy, showed in the Table 1 [7]. According to the book written by Capra entitled The Tao of Physics, he is saying that all the things that composes the universe is made by energy, including the human body. And there is a duality 3 Huang WL OPEN ACCESS Freely available online J Vasc Med Surg, Vol.9 Iss. 5 No: 426 between the thoughts in Western medicine and what Chinese medicine thinks about the formation of diseases [8]. What I want to say in this article is that the meaning of this lack of energy in the human body nowadays, is influencing all the func - tions of cells, glands and systems as all these systems depends on the energy to work and to survive. In another article written by me (2021) entitled are we vaccinating immune competent or Immuno - compromised people for COVID 19? I am saying that due to this lack of energy, that quite the entire population could be suffering, I am classifying the patients as immunosuppressant and not immune competent patients, as energy means immune system in traditional Chinese medicine [9].

In Chinese medicine, one disease can come from the different energy imbalances and one energy imbalances can induce many different diseases, as I am demonstrating in the article I wrote entitled Energy Alterations and Chakras' Energy Deficiencies and Propensity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection [7]. In the article written by me (2020) entitled Chakras' Energies Deficiencies as the Main Cause of Myocardial Infarction without Arterial Obstruction, I am demonstrating through one case report, a patient that had three episode of myocardial infarction without Figure 4: Balance state between Yin, Yang, Qi and blood. Figure 5: Chakras' energy centers and the correspondence to the Five Elements and the five massive organs of traditional Chinese medicine and the low energy pattern from chakra 1 to 6. arterial obstruction, that had chakras' energy centers deficient in energy, as you can see in the Figure 5 . The treatment of these deficiencies, using Chinese dietary counseling, auricular acupuncture and replenishing these lack of energy using highly diluted medications, according to the theory created by me entitled Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine, was very important to prevent future events of myocardial infarction that this patient was having each two months in 2018. In this case and in many article written by me, I am using homeopathy as the medication of choice in the treatment of all kinds of diseases nowadays, due to this new energy pattern that the population in this world are having, demonstrated in the editorial article written by me entitled Is the Population in the World the Same as in the Past? The homeopathy and crystal-based medications used in the treatment are shown in the Table 2 [10-12]. The energy of each chakra is important for the production of Blood (fifth chakra), for the production of Yin and Yang (second chakra) and for the distribution of Qi (first and fourth chakra), and the controlling of Blood flow inside the vessels are made by the Heart (third chakra), shown in the Figures 6 and 7 [4]. When there is this lack of energy (induced by the constant exposition to the electromagnetic waves), the Blood will not have condition or power to circulate inside the vessels and will stagnate in the arterioles [10]. This situation was published by me in the article entitled Chakras Energy Alterations in Patients with Hemorrhoids and How to treat it without Surgery. In this article, I am showing through two cases Chakras Five elements Homeopathy medications Crystal based medications 1\u00b0 chakra Tiger eyeTable: 2 Homeopathies and crystal based medications used to replenish the chakras' energy centers.5 Huang WL OPEN ACCESS Freely available online J Vasc Med Surg, Vol.9 Iss. 5 No: 426 Figure 7: Low energy production of Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood leading to blood stagnation. Figure 6: Chakras' energy centers and the five elements theory with the five massive organs and their correspondence energy functions. reports that patients with hemorrhoids also have chakras' energy centers deficient in energy and the treatment of this condition is very important to treat the cause of the problem (that are the energy deficiencies) and not just treating the symptoms (the thrombosis in the hemorrhoids) [5]. In another article written by me (2021) entitled What We Need to Know When the Patient has a Stroke with or without COVID-19? I am saying that patients with stroke also have chak ras' energy centers deficient in energy and there is the necessity of treating this condition, that is the root of the stroke formation and not treating the symptoms [13]. So, nowadays, when facing patients with stagnation of Blood in the legs, causing spider veins formation, the first diagnosis is deficiency in energy and even if the laboratorial exams are normal, these alterations are in the energy level, not seeing by the naked eyes [4]. The treatment of this lack of energy of the five internal massive organs (Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung and Kidney) has improved the evolution of all chronic degenerative diseases and the treatment of patients who already had a disease already installed, in addition to bringing rejuvenation, improvement of all sexual functions, improvement of memory, concentration and improvement of self- esteem, improvement in quality of life and also improvement in th e appearance of veins of people who, contrary to what others thought when viewing a patient with Blood stagnation in the lower limbs, it is an indirect sign that the patient has no energy to flow the Blood and the only localized treatment ,it is not treating the cause of the problem, so it is necessary to treat systemic deficiencies of energy ,because local symptoms are only the tip of an iceberg. This analogy was presented by me in the 2nd International Conference on Orthopedics & Advanced Care, that was held on February 25- 26, 2019 in Singapore [7,14]. I will be presenting as Keynote speaker in the 3rd Annual Conference on Vascular Medicine that will be held on September 25, 2021 the study entitled Energy and Chakras Alterations in Patients with Varicose Veins and How Can We Treat It without Using Surgery? In this presentation, I will show the different perspectives in the treatment by Western medicine nowadays, showed in the Figure 1, and the need to integrate the two kinds of medicine to understand in the deepest level, what is occurring inside the patient in the energy level, that is not studied by Western medicine nowadays, after the implantation of Flexner report in 1910 [15]. Therefore, as demonstrated by me, all these manifestations with stagnation of Blood and thrombosis have as their base the general energy deficiency of all internal massive organs and the treatment using Chinese diet therapy, acupuncture and energy replenishment of the five massive organs or chakras through the Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements based on Traditional Chinese 6 Huang WLOPEN ACCESS Freely available online J Vasc Med Surg, Vol.9 Iss. 5 No: 426Medicine is of paramount importance nowadays to treat the cause of the problem and not just the symptoms, in this case patients' with spider vein in the legs [11]. CONCLUSION The conclusion of this study is that spider veins is only the clinical manifestation of the patient ,and it is an indirect sign that the patient has no energy in the chakras' energy centers and the treatment rebalancing and replenishing them using highly diluted medications according to the theory Constitutional Homeopathy of the Five Elements Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine was very important to treat the patient's energy deficiency, that was the root of all problems and not treating the symptoms, that are the spider veins.
