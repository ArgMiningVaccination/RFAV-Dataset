Immune thrombocytopenia usually results from development of an autoantibody directed against a structural platelet antigen. These antiplatelet antibodies lead to increased platelet destruction, usually in the spleen, and inhibition of platelet production and release from megakaryocytes. In childhood ITP, the autoantibody may be triggered by viral antigens. The trigger in adults is unknown, although in some countries (eg, Japan, Italy), ITP has been associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, and treatment of the infection has been followed by remission of the ITP ( [1](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v67154788) [ General reference Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

Like the other disorders of increased platelet destruction, ITP is also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Diagnosis of ITP Complete blood count (CBC) with platelets and peripheral blood smear Rarely bone marrow aspiration Exclusion of other thrombocytopenic disorders Immune thrombocytopenia is suspected in patients with isolated thrombocytopenia (ie, otherwise normal CBC and peripheral blood smear).

Typically, patients have coagulation studies, liver tests, and tests for infection with hepatitis C and HIV.

The immature platelet fraction may be elevated in ITP when the platelet count is < 50,000/mcL (< 50 \u00d7 109/L). Bone marrow examination is not required to make the diagnosis but is done if blood counts or blood smear reveals abnormalities in addition to thrombocytopenia, when clinical features are not typical, or if patients fail to respond to standard therapies (eg, corticosteroids). In patients with ITP, bone marrow examination reveals normal or possibly increased numbers of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal bone marrow sample. Diagnosis reference 1.

In adults, spontaneous remission occurs in under 10%. With completion of initial treatment, about one-third of patients undergo remission. Up to 75% of patients improve within 5 years ( [1](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v42291859) [ Prognosis reference Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

However, many patients have mild and stable disease (ie, platelet counts > 30,000/mcL [> 30 \u00d7 109/L]) with minimal or no bleeding; they are often discovered by the automated platelet counting now routinely done with complete blood count.

Asymptomatic patients with a platelet count > 30,000/mcL (> 30 \u00d7 109/L) and no bleeding do not require treatment and can monitored. Adults with newly diagnosed ITP with bleeding and a platelet count < 30,000/mcL (< 30 \u00d7 109/L) are usually given an oral corticosteroid (eg, prednisone 1 mg/kg orally once a day) initially. An alternative, probably equally effective, corticosteroid regimen is dexamethasone 40 mg orally once a day for 4 days. In most patients, the platelet count increases within 2 to 5 days. However, in some patients, a response may take 2 to 4 weeks. When the corticosteroid is tapered after response, most adult patients relapse. Repeated corticosteroid treatments may be effective but increase the risk of adverse effects. Corticosteroids should not usually be continued beyond the first several months; other drugs may be tried in an attempt to avoid splenectomy. If medical therapy is effective, most guidelines recommend continuing it for at least one year before considering splenectomy. Oral corticosteroids, IVIG, or IV anti-D immune globulin may also be given when a transient increase of the platelet count is required for tooth extractions, childbirth, surgery, or eg, romiplostim, eltrombopag, avatrombopag) can also be used before invasive procedures but should not be used for childbirth. IVIG and IV anti-D immune globulin are also useful for [life-threatening bleeding in immune thrombocytopenia](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269107) [ Life-threatening bleeding in ITP Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

Splenectomy can achieve a complete remission in about two thirds of patients who relapse after initial corticosteroid therapy. Splenectomy is usually reserved for patients with severe thrombocytopenia (eg, < 15,000/mcL [< 15 \u00d7 109/L]) in whom bleeding risk cannot be controlled with medical therapy or those whose disease persists after 12 months. If thrombocytopenia can be controlled with second-line medical therapies, splenectomy is often not necessary ( [1, 2](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) [ Treatment references Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

Spleen size... read more ](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) ). Splenectomy results in an increased risk of thrombosis and infection (particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococcus); patients require vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis (ideally > 2 weeks before the procedure). Second-line medical therapies Second-line medical therapies are available for patients with immune thrombocytopenia Who are seeking to defer splenectomy in hope of a spontaneous remission Who are not candidates for or refuse splenectomy In whom splenectomy has not been effective Such patients usually have platelet counts < 10,000 to 20,000/mcL (< 10 to 20 \u00d7 109/L), and thus are at risk for bleeding. Second-line medical therapies include thrombopoietin receptor agonists as romiplostim 1 to 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously once a week, eltrombopag 25 to 75 mg orally once a day, and avatrombopag 20 mg orally once a dayy have response rates > 85%. TPO-RAs often need to be administered continuously to maintain the platelet count > 50,000/mcL (> 50 \u00d7 109/L), but data suggest that one third of adults will undergo a treatment-free remission after 1 year and > 50% after 2 years. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV once a week for 4 weeks) has a response rate of 57%, but only 21% of adult patients remain in remission after 5 years ( [3](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) [ Treatment references Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

Spleen size... read more ](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) ). Alternate dosing schemes are also effective (eg, doses of 1000 mg IV given 2 weeks apart). Rituximab may affect the ability to respond to vaccination for 6 to 12 months. Fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has a reported response rate of 18%. The dose is 100 mg orally twice a day, increasing to 150 mg twice a day after 1 month if the platelet count has not increased to > 50,000/mcL (> 50 \u00d7 109/L\u2014 [4](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) [ Treatment references Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

More intensive immunosuppression may be required with drugs such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and azathioprine in patients unresponsive to other drugs who have severe, symptomatic thrombocytopenia. Life-threatening bleeding in ITP In children or adults with immune thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding, rapid phagocytic blockade is attempted by giving IVIG 1 g/kg once a day for 1 to 2 days or, in Rh-positive patients, a single dose of IV anti-D immune globulin 75 mcg/kg. IV anti-D immunoglobulin is only effective in patients who have not had a splenectomy and may be associated with severe complications such as severe hemolysis and [disseminated intravascular coagulation](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/coagulation-disorders/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-dic) [ Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) intravascular (DIC) involves abnormal, excessive generation of thrombin and fibrin in the circulating blood.

This treatment usually causes the platelet count to rise within 2 to 4 days, but the count remains high for only 2 to 4 weeks. High-dose methylprednisolone (1 g IV once a day for 3 days) is easier to administer than IVIG or IV anti-D immune globulin but may not be as effective. Patients with ITP and life-threatening bleeding are also given platelet transfusions. Platelet transfusions are not used prophylactically. Vincristine (1.4 mg/m2; maximum dose of 2 mg) has also been used in emergency situations but may produce neuropathy with repeated administration. Early use of TPO-RA may also be effective in combination with the therapies above ( [5, 6](/en-kr/professional/hematology-and-oncology/thrombocytopenia-and-platelet-dysfunction/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp#v29269113) [ Treatment references Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder usually without anemia or leukopenia.

Treatment of children with ITP Treatment of children with immune thrombocytopenia is usually supportive because most children spontaneously recover. Even after months or years of thrombocytopenia, most children have spontaneous remissions. If mucosal bleeding occurs, corticosteroids or IVIG may be given. Corticosteroid and IVIG use is controversial because the increased platelet count may not improve clinical outcome. Splenectomy is rarely done in children. However, if thrombocytopenia is severe and symptomatic for > 6 months, then thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eg, romiplostim, eltrombopag) should be considered. Treatment references 1.

Other causes of isolated thrombocytopenia (eg, drugs, alcohol, lymphoproliferative disorders, other autoimmune diseases, viral infections) need to be excluded. Children usually have spontaneous remission; in adults, spontaneous remission may occur during the first year but is less common (about 33%) than in children. Corticosteroids (and sometimes intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or IV anti-D immune globulin) are first-line treatments for bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy is typically not needed unless there are other concerning red or white blood cell abnormalities or in patients being considered for splenectomy who have not responded to standard treatment with corticosteroids or IVIG. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are highly effective in maintaining a safe platelet count in > 85% of adults. COVID-19 infection rarely causes ITP, but COVID-19 vaccination may worsen thrombocytopenia in 2 to 12% of patients with ITP. Splenectomy is often effective but is reserved for patients in whom medical therapy is ineffective or those whose disease persists after 12 months. Platelet transfusion is given only for "}
