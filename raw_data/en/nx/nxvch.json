It is presented here for the rst time in English and con-tains a number of surprising jewels not found anywhere else. The year 1921 proved to be a most eventful time in the life of the anthroposophical movement. The First World War hadended and conditions were stabilizing, though in middleEurope many social problems still remained. Rudolf Steinerhad spent most of the war years in Dornach, Switzerland, andalthough he had given a number of lectures in Switzerlandand Germany, it had not been possible for him to visit othercountries. One of his rst extensive journeys abroad took him to the Netherlands for a two-and-a-half-week lecture tour. In additionto lectures to members, he gave a number of presentations to awider public. The rst of these lectures, given in the Hague, deals directly with the Guardian of the Threshold, the spiritual being whoseparates our ordinary consciousness from our spiritual con-sciousness. Without any introduction, Rudolf Steiner embarksupon basic questions regarding the materialistic age we live inand the dawning of a new, supersensible consciousness. Hisremarks are full of telling examples and analogies. The task ofspiritual science is to help modern humanity, strongly affectedby scientic training, to cross the threshold into a supersensibledimension by fully conscious means. Steiner argues persuasivelyfront viii Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 viii that these considerations are of vital importance for understand- ing the pedagogical needs of our time. The second lecture deals more specically with the urgent need to recognize the developmental stages of the child,addressing the question of a curriculum that meets the needs ofchildren. It emphasizes Steiner's high regard for the results ofscientic research and the achievements of medical science.Spiritual science does not seek to diminish the contributions ofprevailing materialistic views but rather to add a furtherdimension to them so that the human being can again beunderstood to consist of body, soul, and spirit. The two public lectures given in Switzerland on September 26 and November 11 provide us with a vivid picture of howRudolf Steiner dealt with a public hardly conversant with thenew ideals of education. Any reader\u2014from layperson to parentto teacher\u2014can gain an enormous amount from these presen-tations, for Rudolf Steiner also discusses what is meant byhealthy and unhealthy attitudes toward the growing child. Thewords of Goethe are quoted: \"Consider the what, but pay even more attention to the how.\" Steiner shows little interest for rigid educational principles and methods, but urges insteadthat the teacher practice an art of education based on insightinto the nature of the growing child. He recommends that allteachers study Schiller's central work, Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man , stating that they would gain considerably from doing so. Again and again, the three phases of the devel-opment of the child\u2014imitation, authority, and freedom\u2014aredealt with in an inspiring manner. The single public lectures on education were given in Oslo, during a visit Steiner made to Scandinavia. An interestingtheme, which Steiner spoke of in earlier lectures to members ofthe Anthroposophical Society, emerges here. In order to edu-cate children rightly, we should discover the element offront ix Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Introduction ix \"unbornness.\" Steiner coined this term to express that we should form a relationship with what the human being experi-ences in the spiritual world before birth. For thousands of yearshumanity has been concerned with \"immortality.\" Now, in thenew age of light, the concept of \"unbornness\" should be added,so that we develop a devotional understanding of what childrenbring with them. Of the twelve trips abroad that Rudolf Steiner made during the year 1922, special reference should be made to his stay inEngland from April 14-25. Well-known educators, such asProfessor Millicent Mackenzie, at that time Professor of Educa-tion at University College, Cardiff, Wales, were active membersof the committee that promoted the lectures Rudolf Steinergave in Oxford in August 1922. 1 Professor Mackenzie had attended the Christmas course for teachers at the Goetheanumin 1921, 2 and had been so impressed that, after the Oxford lec- tures, she invited Rudolf Steiner to lecture on education inconnection with the Shakespeare festival in Stratford-on-Avon.As a result of these presentations, Professor Mackenzie andPrincipal L.P . Jacks, then head of Manchester College, spon-sored what proved to be a breakthrough for the Waldorfimpulse in England. The festival at Stratford-on-Avon, which was to prove so fruitful, began on April 18 with lectures by some distinguishedrepresentatives of British intellectual life, dealing with Shakes-peare's work. The conference, arranged by the committee work-ing for \"New Ideals in Education,\" was set at the very center ofthis festivity. The two lectures Steiner gave in Stratford appearin this collection. In addition to studying these texts, it may be 1. Published as The Spiritual Ground of Education (London: Anthroposophi- cal Publishing Co., 1947) (GA305 in the Collected Works).2.

One ofthe ways in which the educational power of Shakespeare'sart is involved in the history of human evolution isthrough the influence that Shakespeare's art exertedupon Goethe. The question must be asked: Upon whatdoes this tremendous influence rest? When I ask myself this question, I am confronted by a fact in supersensible experience. Anyone who is in a posi-tion to devote himself livingly to Shakespeare's dramasand then carry this experience into that world whichspreads out before 'exact clairvoyance' can nd that thegures of Shakespeare's dramas continue to appear beforethe soul in the supersensible realm as living, whereas thegures out of the new naturalistic dramas are either trans-formed completely through this process into puppets or,in a sense, become immobile. In imagination, Shake-speare's gures continue to live. They do not continue tocarry out the same actions as in the dramas; rather, theyact in different situations and with a changed course offactual events. I believe this indicates that Shakespeare'sgures are deeply rooted in the spiritual world, and thatGoethe, in his devotion to Shakespearean drama, uncon-sciously experienced this fact of their being deeply rooted.When he turned to Shakespeare, Goethe felt as if he him-self were seized upon by events of the spirit world. I hadthis experience in the back of my mind when I had theopportunity to speak in Stratford about Shakespeare,Goethe, and the nature of education in three lectures. Myfront xi Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Introduction xi conviction of this was especially vivid when I spoke on April 23, the real Shakespeare Day, about 'Shakespeareand the New Ideals.' The programs arranged by the committee for 'New Ideals in Education' were accompanied by presentationsof Shakespeare dramas in the Shakespeare Memorial The-atre. We had the opportunity to see Othello ,Julius Caesar , The T aming of the Shrew ,Twelfth Night ,All's Well that Ends Well , and Much Ado about Nothing . The presentation of the comedies was satisfying, but I have a different conception of the right presentation of thetragedies. An anecdote, recorded by Harry Collison, 3 could be added for local color: \"Every evening the party went to performancesof Shakespeare's plays. In Twelfth Night when Sir Toby Belch sat on the lap of Andrew Aguecheek, Rudolf Steiner was taken bysuch a laughing t that the audience turned round and the per-formers themselves burst out laughing, hardly able to containthemselves.\" Newspaper reports indicated the importance of the Shakes- peare festival and the conference on education. Rudolf Steinermade a marked impression on the public and the report fromtheLondon Times of April 29 bears this out. The famous person in this year's conference was Dr. Rudolf Steiner, who is distinguished at present not only inthe eld of education but also in other elds. In the lightof spiritual science, he gives new forces of life to a number 3. Collison (1868-1945), a lawyer, painter, and writer, was a student of Rudolf Steiner from 1910. Authorized by Rudolf Steiner to translate his works intoEnglish, Collison founded the Anthroposophical Publishing Company. From1923, he was the General Secretary of the English Anthroposophical Society.front xii Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 xii of dogmas hitherto held in check, and he promises to teachers relief from unnecessary difculty through learn-ing to know the soul of the child with the help of super-sensible knowledge. . . . Speaking in the Germanlanguage, Dr. Steiner was able to hold his audience in anextraordinary manner, in spite of the interpretation inter-jected after each twenty minutes, as he presented state-ments regarding the spiritual-scientic school inDornach, Switzerland, and his own researches regardingthe nature of man. During this period, spiritual science experienced a consid- erable breakthrough. The rst Waldorf school, founded inStuttgart in September, 1919, was flourishing, and seeds hadbeen planted for similar schools in Holland and England.Rudolf Steiner was able to present his work before crowdedauditoriums in the greatest cities of middle Europe. At the West/East Conference in Vienna, he addressed more than two hundred people for twelve consecutive evenings. Thelectures were reported daily in the local press. 4 In September, a course was given in Dornach mainly for French participants. The lectures have been printed under thetitlePhilosophy, Cosmology and Religion . 5 This very special event also brought about the reconciliation between Edouard Schur\u00e96 4. See The T ension between East and West (Anthroposophic Press: Spring Val- ley, 1983).5. Anthroposophic Press: Spring, Valley, NY, 1986.6. Schur\u00e9 (1841-1929), French mystic, writer, and friend of Rudolf Steiner,was the author of, among others, Richard Wagner, son oeuvre et son ide\u00e9 (1875), The Great Initiates (1889), Les Femmes Inspiratrices ,L 'Evolution Divine , and the dramas The Children of Lucifer and The Mystery of Eleusis. Marie von Sivers (later Steiner) had known Schur\u00e9 before the end of thenineteenth century and later translated some of his works into German.Rudolf Steiner and Schur\u00e9 first met in May 1906.front xiii Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Introduction xiii and Steiner.They had become estranged during the First World War because of the strong patriotism of Schur\u00e9, who like manyAlsatians had bitterly resented the German annexation of theirprovince in 1871. The meeting of the eighty-one-year-oldSchur\u00e9, the renowned author, with the sixty-one-year-oldSteiner was the warmest possible. Rudolf Steiner prepared adaily outline for Jules Sauerwein, the most prominent Frenchjournalist of his time, who acted as translator. In the present col-lection of public lectures we shall nd Rudolf Steiner's ownreport of a lecture on education, which he gave during theFrench course. It has the crispness of a statement that wouldappeal particularly to the French mind. It should perhaps be mentioned that the present collection of lectures given in different parts of Europe also very muchreflects the mentality and the interest of each different nation. Finally, the publishers should be thanked for making avail- able in English, after so many years, a collection of lectures thatcan help particularly parents and teachers to gain a clearer pic-ture of how to address a wider public on the central questions ofa spiritual-scientically oriented education. Much can belearned from them, for they are totally uncompromising,although never intended to distress an unprepared audiencewith a terminology that would be obscure or inappropriate.These lectures could well be placed also in the hands of begin-ners who wish to nd out in a succinct and clear way what Wal-dorf education is really about.

Querido, LLD Boulder, Coloradofront xiv Thu Aug 31 10:20:50 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 xiv1chapter 1 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 1 1 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science and the Great Questions of our Present Civilization THE HAGUE \u2014 FEBRUARY 23, 1921 Anyone who chooses to address the themes that I shall address tonight and again on the 27th knows that many peopletoday long for a new element in contemporary spiritual life, animpulse that could revitalize and transform important aspectsof our present civilization. Such longings live especially inthose who try to look deeply into their own inner being, stirredby the various signs in contemporary society indicating that,unless present trends change, our civilization is heading for ageneral collapse. These signs themselves, of course, are a resultof many characteristic features of the cultural stream of West-ern Europe over the last few centuries. What may be said about the supersensible worlds today may therefore be said to every human soul. It may be said even to ahermit, a recluse, who has withdrawn from the world. Aboveall, however, it may be said to those who stand fully and rmlyin life: for what we are talking about is every human being'sconcern. But this is not the only point of view from which I wish to speak today and again on the 27th. I want to talk about how,if we let them work upon our souls, the fundamental issuesfacing our civilization affect our attitudes. Those who feel1chapter 2 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 2 called upon to lead their fellow human beings will nd much that is inwardly disturbing here and much that makes themyearn for a renewal of certain aspects of spiritual and culturallife. If we consider humanity's present cultural, spiritual situa- tion, we may trace it back to two fundamental issues. Oneshines out in contemporary science and in the way in whichscientic life has developed during the last three or four hun-dred years. The other shines out from the practical sphere oflife, which, naturally, has been largely influenced by modernscience. To begin with, let us look at what science has brought in its wake more recently. At this point, to avoid any misunderstand-ing, let me state clearly that anthroposophical spiritual sci-ence\u2014as I shall represent it here\u2014must in no way be thoughtof as opposing the spirit of modern science, whose triumphantand important successes the exponents of spiritual science fullyrecognize. Precisely because it wishes to enter without prejudiceinto the spirit of natural science, anthroposophical spiritual sci-ence must go beyond its connes and objectives. Natural sci-ence, with its scrupulous, specialized disciplines, providesexact, reliable information about much in our human environ-ment. But, when a human soul asks about its deepest, eternalbeing, it receives no answer from natural science, least of allwhen science searches in all honesty and without prejudice.This is why we nd many people today who out of an innerreligious need\u2014in some cases more, in others less\u2014long for arenewal of the old ways of looking at the world. The outer sciences, and anthropology in particular, already draw our attention to the fact that our forebears, centuries ago,knew nothing of what splits and fragments many souls today;namely, the disharmony between scientic knowledge on onehand and religious experience on the other. If we compare our1chapter 3 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 3 situation today with what prevailed in ancient times, we nd that the leaders of humanity who cultivated science then\u2014however childlike their science might appear to us now\u2014alsokindled the religious spirit of their people. There was certainlyno split between these two spiritual streams. Today, many souls long for the return of something similar. Yet one cannot say that a renewal of ancient forms of wis-dom\u2014whether Chaldean, Egyptian, Indian, or any other\u2014would benet our present society. Those who advocate such areturn can hardly be said to understand the signicance ofhuman evolution, for they overlook its real mission. They donot recognize that it is impossible today to tread the same spir-itual paths that were trodden thousands of years ago. It is anintrinsic feature of human evolution that every age should haveits own particular character. In every age, people must seekinner fulllment or satisfaction in appropriate though dis-tinctly different ways. Because we live and are educated in thetwentieth century, our soul life today needs something differ-ent from what people living in distant antiquity once neededfor their souls. A renewal of ancient attitudes toward the worldwould hardly benet our present time, although knowledge ofthem could certainly help in nding our bearings. Familiariz-ing ourselves with such attitudes could also help us recognizethe source of inner satisfaction in ancient times. Now, thisinner satisfaction or fulllment was, in fact, the result of a rela-tionship to scientic knowledge fundamentally different fromwhat we experience today. There is a certain phenomenon to which I would like to draw your attention. To do so is to open myself to the accusa-tion of being either paradoxical or downright fantastical. How-ever, one can say many things today that, even a few years ago,would have been highly dangerous to mention because of thesituation that prevailed then. The last few catastrophic years1chapter 4 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 4 [1914-1918] have brought about a change in people's thinking and feeling about such things. Compared with the habits ofthought and feeling of the previous decade, people today arereadier to accept the idea that the deepest truths might at rststrike one as being paradoxical or even fantastical. In the past, people spoke of something that today\u2014espe- cially in view of our scientic knowledge\u2014would hardly beacceptable. This is something that will be discussed again in arelatively short time, probably even in educated, cultured cir-cles. I refer to the Guardian of the Threshold. 1 This guardian stands between the ordinary world of the senses, which formsthe rm ground of orthodox science and is where we lead ourdaily lives, and those higher worlds in which the supersensiblepart of the human being is integrated into the spiritual world.Between the sensory world\u2014whose phenomena we canobserve and in which we can recognize the working of naturallaws with our intellect\u2014and that other world to which webelong with our inner being, between these two worlds, theancients recognized an abyss. To attain true knowledge, theyfelt, that abyss had rst to be crossed. But only those wereallowed to do so who had undergone intensive preparationunder the guidance of the leaders of the mystery centers.Today, we have a rather different view of what constitutes ade-quate preparation for a scientic training and for living in ascientic environment. In ancient times, however, it wasrmly believed that an unprepared candidate could not possi-bly be allowed to receive higher knowledge of the humanbeing. But why should this have been the case? 1.

See also, among others, Rudolf Steiner: How to Know Higher Worlds , chapter 10; Occult Science , chapter 3; the Mystery Drama, The Guardian of the Thresh- old, and A Road to Self Knowledge and The Threshold of the Spiritual World .1chapter 5 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 5 An answer to that question can be found only if insight is gained into the development of the human soul during thecourse of evolution. Such insight goes beyond the limits ofordinary historical research. Basically, present historical knowl-edge draws only on external sources and disregards the moresubtle changes that the human psyche undergoes. 2 For instance, we do not usually take into account the partic- ular condition of soul of those ancient peoples who were rootedin the primeval oriental wisdom of their times, decadent formsof which only survive in the East today. Fundamentally speak-ing, we do not realize how differently such souls were attunedto the world. In those days, people already perceived externalnature through their senses as we do today. To a certain extent,they also combined all of the various sense impressions withtheir intellect. But, in doing so, they did not feel themselvesseparated from their natural surroundings. They still perceivedan element of soul and spirit within themselves. They felt theirphysical organization permeated by soul and spirit. At the sametime, they also experienced soul and spirit in lightning and inthunder, in drifting clouds, in stones, plants, and beasts. Whatthey could divine within themselves, they could also feel out innature and in the entire universe. To these human beings of thepast, the whole universe was imbued with soul and spirit. On the other hand, they lacked something that we, today, possess to a marked degree, that is, they did not have as pro-nounced and intensive a self-consciousness as we do. Their self-awareness was dimmer and dreamier than ours today. That was 2.

(For bib- liographic information, see Bibliography).1chapter 6 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 6 still the case even in ancient Greece. Whoever imagines that the condition of soul\u2014the psychic organization\u2014of theancient Greeks was more or less the same as our own canunderstand only the later stages of Greek culture. During itsearlier phases, the state of the human soul was not the same asit is today, for in those days there still existed a dim awarenessof humanity's kinship with nature. Just as a nger, if endowedwith some form of self awareness, would feel itself to be a partof the whole human organism and could not imagine itselfleading a separate existence\u2014for then it would simply witheraway\u2014so the human being of those early times felt closelyunited with nature and certainly not separate from it. 3 The wise leaders of the ancient mystery schools believed that this awareness of humanity's connection with nature repre-sented the moral element in human self-consciousness, whichmust never be allowed to conceive of the world as being devoidof soul and spirit. They felt that if the world were to be con-ceived of as being without soul and spirit\u2014as has now hap-pened in scientic circles and in our daily lives\u2014human soulswould be seized by a kind of faintness. The teachers of ancientwisdom foresaw that faintness or swooning of the soul wouldoccur if people adopted the kind of world-view we have today. You might well wonder what the justication for saying such things is. To illustrate that there is a justication, I would liketo take an example from history\u2014just one out of many othersthat could have been chosen. Today, we feel rightfully satised with the generally accepted system of the universe that no longer reflects what the eye canobserve outwardly in the heavens, as it still did in the Middle 3. For a more extended treatment of the relation of Greek thought to the ancient mystery schools, see \"The Mission of the Archangel Michael,\" lec-ture 4, in The Archangel Michael: His Mission and Ours .1chapter 7 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 7 Ages. We have adopted the Copernican view of the universe, which is a heliocentric one. During the Middle Ages, however,people believed that the earth rested in the center of the plane-tary system\u2014in fact, in the center of the entire starry world\u2014and that the sun, together with the other stars, revolved aroundthe earth. The heliocentric system of the universe meant analmost complete reversal of previously held views. Today, weadhere to the heliocentric view as something already learnedand believed during early school days. It is something that hasbecome part of general knowledge and is simply taken forgranted. And yet, although we think that people in the Middle Ages and in more ancient times believed uniquely in the geocentricview as represented by Ptolemy, this was by no means alwaysthe case. We only need to read, for instance, what Plutarchwrote about the system of Aristarchus of Samos, who lived inancient Greece in the prechristian era. Outer historicalaccounts mention Aristarchus' heliocentric view. Spiritual sci-ence makes the situation clear. Aristarchus put the sun in the center of our planetary system, and let the earth circle around it. Indeed, if we take Aristarchus'heliocentric system in its main outlines\u2014leaving aside furtherdetails supplied by more recent scientic research\u2014we nd it infull agreement with our present picture of the universe. Whatdoes this mean? Nothing more than that Aristarchus of Samosmerely betrayed what was taught in the old mystery centers.Outside these schools, people were left to believe in what theycould see with their own eyes. And why should this have beenso? Why were ordinary people left with the picture of the uni-verse as it appears to the eyes? Because the leaders of thoseschools believed that before anyone could be introduced to theheliocentric system, they had to cross an inner threshold intoanother world\u2014a world entirely different from the one in1chapter 8 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 8 which people ordinarily live. People were protected from that other world in their daily lives by the invisible Guardian of theThreshold, who was a very real, if supersensible, being to theancient teachers. According to their view, human beings were tobe protected from having their eyes suddenly opened to see aworld that might appear bereft of soul and spirit. But that is how we see the world today! We observe it and create our picture of the realms of nature\u2014the mineral, plant,and animal kingdoms\u2014only to nd this picture soulless andspiritless. When we form a picture of the orbits and the move-ments of the heavenly bodies with the aid of calculations basedon telescopic observations, we see a world empty of soul andspirit. The wise teachers of the mystery centers knew very wellthat it was possible to see the world in that way. But they trans-mitted such knowledge to their pupils only after the pupils hadundergone the necessary preparations, after they had under-gone a severe training of their will life. Then, they guided theirpupils past the Guardian of the Threshold\u2014but not until theywere prepared. How was this preparation accomplished? Pupilshad not only to endure great deprivations, but for many yearsthey were also taught by their teachers to follow a moral path instrict obedience. At the same time, their will life was severelydisciplined to strengthen their self-consciousness. And onlyafter they had thus progressed from a dim self-consciousness toa more conscious one were they shown what lay ahead of themon the other side of the threshold: namely, the world as itappears to us in outer space according to the heliocentric sys-tem of the universe. At the same time, of course, they were alsotaught many other things that, to us, have merely become partof our general knowledge of the world. Pupils in ancient times were thus carefully prepared before they were given the kind of knowledge that today is almostcommonplace for every schoolboy and schoolgirl. This shows1chapter 9 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 9 how times and whole civilizations have changed. Because exter- nal history knows nothing of the history of the development ofthe human soul, we tend to be under a misapprehension if wego only by what we read in history books. What was it then, that pupils of the ancient mystery centers brought with them before crossing the threshold to the super-sensible world? It was knowledge of the world that, to a certainextent, had arisen from their instinctual life, from the drives oftheir physical bodies. By means of those drives or instincts,they saw the external world ensouled and lled with spirit.That is now known as animism. They could feel how closely ahuman being was related to the outer world. They felt thattheir own spirit was embedded in the world spirit. At the sametime, in order to look on the world as we learn to do alreadyduring our early school days, those ancient people had toundergo special preparations. Nowadays, one can read all kinds of things about the Guard- ian of the Threshold\u2014and the threshold to the spiritualworld\u2014in books whose authors take it upon themselves to dealwith the subject of mysticism, often in dilettantish ways, evenif their publications have an air of learnedness about them.Indeed, one often nds that, the more nebulous the mysticism,the greater attraction it seems to exert on certain sections of thepublic. But what I am talking about here, what is revealed tothe unbiased spiritual investigator concerning what theancients called the threshold to the spiritual world, is not thekind of nebulous mysticism that many sects and ordersexpound today and many people seek on the other side of thethreshold. Rather, it is the kind of knowledge which hasbecome a matter of general education today. At the same time, we can see how we look at the world today with a very different self-consciousness than people did inmore ancient times. The teachers of ancient wisdom were1chapter 10 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 10 afraid that, unless their pupils' self-consciousness had been strengthened by a severe training of the will, they would sufferfrom overwhelming faintness of soul when they were told, forexample, that the earth was not stationary but revolved aroundthe sun with great speed, and that they too were circlingaround the sun. This feeling of losing rm ground from undertheir feet was something that the ancients would not have beenable to bear. It would have reduced their self-consciousness tothe level of a swoon. We, on the other hand, learn to stand upto it already in childhood. We almost take for granted now the kind of world-view into which the people of ancient times were able to penetrate onlyafter careful preparation. Yet we must not allow ourselves tohave nostalgic feelings for ancient ways of living, which can nolonger fulll the present needs of the soul. Anthroposophicalscience of the spirit, of which I am speaking, is a renewal nei-ther of ancient Eastern wisdom nor of old Gnostic teachings,for if such teachings were to be given today, they would haveonly a decadent effect. Spiritual science, on the other hand, issomething to be found by an elementary creative power thatlives in every human soul when certain paths that I willdescribe presently are followed. First, however, I want to drawattention to the fact that ordinary life, and science in general,already represents a kind of threshold to the supersensibleworld or, at any rate, to another world. People living in ancient times had a quite different picture of life on the other side of the threshold. But what do we hear,especially from our most conscientious natural scientists, whofeel thoroughly convinced of the rightness of their methods?We are told that natural science has reached the ultimate lim-its of knowledge. We hear such expressions as \" ignorabimus, \" \"we shall never know,\" which\u2014I hasten to add\u2014is perfectlyjustied as long as we remain within the bounds of natural1chapter 11 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 11 science.4 Ancient peoples might have lacked our intense self- consciousness, but we are lacking in other ways. To what do we owe our intense self-consciousness? We received it through the ways of thinking and looking at theworld that entered our civilization with people like Coperni-cus, Galileo, Kepler, Bruno, and others. 5 The works of such thinkers not only provided us with a certain amount of knowl-edge but, through them, modern humanity underwent a dis-tinct training of soul life. Everything that the mode of thinkingdeveloped by these personalities has achieved in more recenttimes tends to cultivate the powers of intellect. There is also astrong emphasis on scientic experimentation and on accurate,conscientious observation. With instruments such as the tele-scope, the microscope, X-rays, and the spectroscope, we exam-ine the phenomena around us and we use our intellect mainlyin order to extract from those phenomena their fundamentaland inherent natural laws. But what are we actually doingwhen we are engaged in observing and experimenting? Ourmethods of working allow only the powers of reasoning andintellect to speak. It is simply a fact that, during the last centuries, it has been primarily the intellect that has been tapped to promote humandevelopment. And a characteristic feature of the intellect is thatit strengthens human self-consciousness, hardening it andmaking it more intense. Due to this hardening, we are able tobear what an ancient Greek could not have born; namely, the 4. The famous \"ignorabimus\" was rst voiced by the German physiologist Emil Dubois-Reymond (1818-1896) in a lecture, On the Limits of Natural Science , given on August 14, 1872, in Leipzig. Steiner refers frequently to this moment. See, for instance, The Riddles of Philosophy orThe Boundaries of Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 12 consciousness of being moved around the sun on an earth that has no rm ground to uphold it. At the same time, because ofthis strengthened self-consciousness that has led to the pictureof a world devoid of soul and spirit, we are deprived of the kindof knowledge for which our souls nevertheless yearn. We cansee the world with its material phenomena\u2014its materialfacts\u2014as the ancients could never have seen it without appro-priate preparation in the mystery centers, but we can no longerperceive a spiritual world surrounding us. This is why consci-entious scientists confess \"ignorabimus\" and speak of limits towhat we can know. As human beings, we stand in the world. And, if we reflect on ourselves, we must inevitably realize that, whenever we pon-der various things or draw conclusions based on experimentand observation, something spiritual is acting in us. And wemust ask ourselves, \"Is that spirit likely to live in isolation fromthe world of material phenomena like some kind of hermit?Does that spirit exist only in our physical bodies? Can it reallybe that the world is empty of soul and spirit, as the ndings ofthe physical and biological sciences would have us believe and,from their point of view, quite rightly so?\" This is the situation in which we nd ourselves at the present time. We are facing a new threshold. Although that circum-stance has not yet penetrated the consciousness of humanity asa whole, awareness of it in human souls is not completelyabsent either. People might not be thinking about it but, in thedepths of their souls, it lives nevertheless as a kind of presenti-ment. What goes on in the realm of the soul remains mostlyunconscious. But out of that unconsciousness arises a longingto cross the threshold again, to add knowledge of the spiritualworld to present self-consciousness. No matter what name we might wish to give these things\u2014 that in most cases are felt only dimly\u2014they nevertheless belong1chapter 13 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 13 to the deepest riddles of our civilization. There is a sense that a spiritual world surrounding all human beings must be foundagain and that the soulless, spiritless world of which natural sci-ence speaks cannot be the one with which the human soul canfeel inwardly united. How can we rediscover the kind of knowledge that also gen- erates a religious mood in us? That is the great question of ourpresent time. How can we nd a way of knowing that also, atthe same time, fullls our deepest need for an awareness of theeternal in the human soul? Modern science has achieved greatand mighty things. Nevertheless, any unprejudiced personmust acknowledge that it has not really produced solutions,but rather\u2014one would almost have to say\u2014the very opposite.Yet we should accept even this both willingly and gladly. What can we do with the help of modern science? Does it help us to solve the riddles of the human soul? Hardly, but atleast it prompts us to ask our questions at a deeper level. Con-temporary science has put before us the material facts in allpurity; that is, free from what a personal or subjective elementmight introduce in the form of soul and spirit. But, justbecause of this, we are made all the more intensely aware ofthe deep questions living in our souls. It is a signicantachievement of contemporary science to have confronted uswith new, ever deepening riddles. The great question of ourtime is therefore: what is our attitude toward these deepenedriddles? What we can learn from the spirit of a Haeckel, Hux-ley, or Spencer does not make it possible to solve these riddles;it does, however, enable us to experience the great questionsfacing contemporary humanity more intensely than everbefore. 6 6. Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919); Thomas Huxley (1825-1895); Riddles of Philosophy , Part II.1chapter 14 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 14 This is where spiritual science\u2014the science of the spirit\u2014 comes into its own, for its aim is to lead humanity, in a waythat corresponds to its contemporary character, over the newthreshold into a spiritual world. How this is possible for amodern person\u2014as distinct from the man or woman ofold\u2014I should now like to indicate, if only in brief outline.You can nd more detailed descriptions in my books How to Know Higher Worlds and Occult Science , and in other publica- tions of mine. 7 First, I would like to draw attention to the point of departure for anyone who wishes to engage in spiritual research orbecome a spiritual researcher. It is an inner attitude with which,due to present circumstances, a modern person is not likely tobe in sympathy at all. It is an attitude of soul that I would liketo call intellectual modesty or humility. Despite the fact thatthe intellect has developed to a degree unprecedented in humanevolution during the past three or four hundred years, a would-be spiritual researcher must nevertheless achieve intellectualhumility or modesty. Let me clarify what I mean by using acomparison. Imagine that you put a volume of Shakespeare'splays into the hands of a ve-year-old. What would the childdo? The child would play with the book, turn its pages, perhapstear them. He or she would not use the book as it was meant tobe used. But, ten-to-fteen years later, that young person wouldhave a totally different relationship to the same volume. He orshe would treat the book according to its intended purpose.What has happened? Faculties that were dormant in the childhave meanwhile developed through natural growth, upbring-ing, and education. During those ten to fteen years, the childhas become an altogether different soul being. 7. For instance, Stages of Higher Knowledge and A Road to Self Knowledge and The Threshold of the Spiritual World .1chapter 15 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 15 Now, an adult who has achieved intellectual humility, despite having absorbed the scientic climate of the environ-ment by means of the intellect, might say: my relationship tothe sense world may be compared with the relationship of ave-year-old child to a volume of Shakespeare's plays. Facultiesthat are capable of further development might lie dormantwithin me. I too could grow into an altogether different beingas far as my soul and spirit are concerned and understand thesense world more deeply. Nowadays, however, people do not like to adopt an attitude of such intellectual modesty. Habits of thought and the psy-chological response to life as it is steer us in a different direc-tion. Those who have gone through the usual channels of edu-cation might enter higher education, where it is no longer aquestion of deepening inner knowledge and of developing fac-ulties of will and soul. For, during a scientic training of thatkind, a person remains essentially at the level of his or herinherited capacities and what ordinary education can provide.Certainly, science has expanded tremendously by means ofexperimentation and observation, but that expansion has onlybeen achieved by means of those intellectual powers thatalready exist in what is usually called modern culture. In fur-thering knowledge, the aim of science has not been to cultivatenew faculties in the human being. The thought would neverhave occurred that anyone already in possession of our presentmeans of knowledge, as given both by ordinary life and by sci-ence, might actually be confronting the world of nature in away similar to how a ve-year old responds to a volume ofShakespeare. Allowance has not been made for the possibilitythat new faculties of cognition could develop that would sub-stantially alter our attitude toward the external world. Thatsuch new faculties are possible, however, is precisely the atti-tude required of anyone who wishes to investigate the spiritual1chapter 16 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 16 world of which anthroposophy, the science of the spirit, speaks. Here, the aim is to develop human faculties inherent in eachperson. However, in order to bring these potentials to a certainstage of development, a great deal must be experienced rst. I am not talking about taking extraordinary or even supersti- tious measures for the sake of this soul development. Rather, Iam talking about the enhancement of quite ordinary, wellknown faculties that play important roles both in daily life andin the established sciences. However, although those facultiesare being applied all the time, they are not developed to theirfull extent during the life between birth and death. There are many such faculties, but I would like to character- ize today the further development of only two of them. Moredetailed information can be found in the books mentionedpreviously. First of all, there is the faculty of remembering or memory, which is an absolute necessity in life. It is generally realized\u2014asanyone with a particular interest in these matters will knowfrom books on psychology and pathology\u2014how important it isfor a healthy soul life that a person's memory should be unim-paired and that our memory should allow us to look back overour past life right down to early childhood. There must notexist periods in our past from which memory pictures cannotrise to bring events back again. If someone's memory were to becompletely erased, the ego or I of such a person would be virtu-ally destroyed. Severe soul sickness would befall such an indi-vidual. Memory gives us the possibility for past experiences toresurface, whether in pale or in vivid pictures. It is this faculty,this force, that can be strengthened and developed further.What is its characteristic quality? Without it, experiences flit bywithout leaving any lasting trace. Also, without memory, theconcepts formed through such experiences would be only fleet-ing ones. Our memory stores up such experiences for us (here,1chapter 17 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 17 I can give only sketchy indications; in my writings and pub- lished lectures you will nd a scientically built-up treatmentof memory). 8 Memory gives duration to otherwise fleeting impressions. This quality of memory is grasped as a rst step in applyingspiritual-scientic methods. It is then intensied and devel-oped further through what I have called meditation and con-centration in the books that I have mentioned. To practicethese two activities, a student, having sought advice fromsomeone experienced in these matters or having gained thenecessary information from appropriate literature, will focusconsciousness on certain interrelated mental images that areclearly dened and easy to survey. They could be geometricalor mathematical patterns that one can clearly view and that oneis certain are not reminiscences from life, emerging from one'ssubconscious. Whatever is held in consciousness in this way must result from a person's free volition. One must in no way allow oneselfto become subject to auto suggestion or dreaming. One con-templates what one has chosen to place in the center of one'sconsciousness and holds it for a longer period of time in com-plete inner tranquility. Just as muscles develop when engagedin a particular type of work, so certain soul forces unfold whenthe soul is engaged in the uncustomary activity of arresting andholding denite mental images. It sounds simple enough. But,in fact, not only are there people who believe that, when speak-ing about these things, a scientist of the spirit is drawing onobscure influences, but there are others who believe it simple toachieve the methods that I am describing here, methods thatare applied in intimate regions of one's soul life. 8. See, for instance, Anthroposophy and the Inner Life.1chapter 18 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 18 Far from it! These things take a long time to accomplish. Of course, some nd it easier to practice these exercises, but othershave to struggle much harder. Naturally, the depth of suchmeditation is far more important than the length of time spentover it. Whatever the case might be, however, one must perse-vere in one's efforts for years. What one practices in one's soulin this way is truly no easier than what one does in a laboratory,in a lecture hall for physics, or an astronomical observatory. Itis in no way more difcult to fulll the demands imposed byexternal forms of research than it is to practice faithfully, care-fully, and conscientiously what spiritual research requires to becultivated in the human soul over a period of many years. Nevertheless, as a consequence of such practice, certain inner soul forces, previously known to us only as forces of memory,eventually gain in strength and new soul powers come intoexistence. Such inner development enables one to recognizeclearly what the materialistic interpretation is saying about thepower of memory when it maintains that the human faculty ofremembering is bound to the physical body and that, if there issomething wrong with the constitution of the nervous system,memory is weakened, as it is likewise in old age. Altogether,spiritual faculties are seen to depend on physical conditions. Asfar as life between birth and death is concerned, this is notdenied by spiritual science. For whoever develops the power ofmemory as I have described knows through direct insight howordinary memory, which conjures up pictures of past experi-ences before the soul, does indeed depend on the human phys-ical body. On the other hand, the new soul forces now beingdeveloped become entirely free and independent of the physical body. The student thereby experiences how it becomes possible to live in a region of the soul in such a way that one can havesupersensible experiences, just as one has sense-perceptibleexperiences in the physical body.1chapter 19 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 19 I would now like to give you an explanation of the nature of these supersensible experiences. Human life undergoes rhythmical changes between waking and sleeping. The moments of falling asleep and awakening,and the time spent in sleep, are interspersed with waking life.What happens in this process? When we fall asleep, our con-sciousness is dimmed down, in most cases to a zero point.Dreams sometimes \"bubble up\" from halfconscious depths.Obviously, we are alive during this condition for, otherwise, assleepers, we would have to pass away every night and come tolife again every morning. The human soul and spirit are alivebut, during sleep, our consciousness is diminished. This dimi-nution of consciousness has to do with our inability to employour senses between when we fall asleep and when we wake up,and also with our lack of access to impulses that derive fromour physical organs of will. This dimming down of consciousness can be overcome by those who have developed the new higher faculty of which Ihave spoken of their given faculty of memory. Such peoplereach a condition, as they do in sleep, in which they no longerneed eyes in order to see, nor ears in order to hear. They nolonger need to feel the physical warmth of their environment,nor to use will impulses that under ordinary conditions workthrough the muscles and through the human physical organiza-tion generally. They are able to switch off everything connectedwith the physical body. And yet their consciousness does notdiminish as is usually the case in sleep. On the contrary, theyare able to surrender themselves in full consciousness to condi-tions normally pertaining only to the sleeping state. A spiritualresearcher remains completely conscious. Just as a sleeping per-son is surrounded by a dark world of nothingness, so a spiritualresearcher is surrounded by a world that has nothing to do withthe sense world but is nevertheless as full and intense as the1chapter 20 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 20 sense world. In the waking state, we confront the sense world with our senses. But when they are able to free themselves fromthe physical body in full consciousness\u2014that is, when they canenter, fully consciously, the state normally gone throughbetween falling asleep and waking up\u2014spiritual researchersconfront a supersensible world. They thus learn to recognize that a supersensible world always surrounds us, just as the sense world surrounds us in ordinarylife. Yet there is a signicant difference. In the sense world, weperceive outer facts through our senses and, through those facts,we also become aware of the existence of other beings. Outerfacts predominate while beings or existences make their presence felt within the context of these outer facts. But, when the super-sensible world is opened to us, we rst encounter beings . 9 As soon as our eyes are opened to behold the supersensible world,real beings surround us. To begin with, we cannot call this worldof concrete and real supersensible beings in which we now ndourselves a world of facts. We must gain such facts for ourselvesby means of yet something else.It is an achievement of the mod-ern anthroposophical science of the spirit that it enables humanbeings to cross a threshold once more and enter a world differ-ent from what usually surrounds us. After one has learned to experience the state of indepen- dence from the physical body, one nally comes to realize notonly that the soul during sleep lifts itself out of the body onlyto return to it upon awakening, but also that this return iscaused by the soul's intense desire for the physical body. Super-sensible cognition enables us to recognize the true nature of thesoul, whose re-entry into the physical body upon awakening isdue to a craving for the body as it lies asleep. Furthermore, if 9. See, for instance, Rudolf Steiner, Spiritual Beings in the Heavenly Bodies and in the Kingdoms of Nature.1chapter 21 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 21 one can make this true conception of falling asleep and awak- ening one's own, one's understanding expands to such anextent that one eventually learns to know the soul before itdescends\u2014through conception and birth\u2014from the spiritualworld into the physical body offered by heredity. Once one has grasped the nature of the human soul, and has learned to follow it outside the body between falling asleep andwaking up\u2014at the same time recognizing the less powerfulforces pulling it back into the body lying in the bed\u2014then onealso begins to know what happens to the soul when it is freedfrom the body and passes through the portal of death. Onelearns to understand that the reason why the human soul hasonly a dim consciousness during sleep is because it has a strongdesire to return to the body. It is this craving for the body thatcan dull human consciousness into a state of total impotenceduring the time between falling asleep and awakening. On theother hand, once the soul has passed through death, this desirefor the physical body is no longer there. And once, through the newly developed faculty of enhanced memory, we have learned to know the human soul, we can fol-low its further progress beyond the portal of death. 10 One then learns to recognize that, since it is no longer bound to a physi-cal body and is therefore freed from the desire to return to it,the soul is now in a position to retain a consciousness of itsown while in the spiritual world, a consciousness that differsfrom what is given through the instrument of the physicalbody. One comes to recognize that there were forces in the soulbefore birth that drew it toward a physical body while it wasstill in the spiritual world. That physical body, however, was asyet quite indeterminate; it cast a certain light toward thedescending soul. Then one begins to see how the soul develops 10. See Rudolf Steiner, The Presence of the Dead.1chapter 22 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 22 a strong desire to re-enter physical, earthly life. One learns to know\u2014but in a different language\u2014the eternal being of thehuman soul. This being becomes clear and, through it, onelearns to understand something else as well. One learns to cognize in pictures the soul's eternal being as it goes through births and deaths. I have called those picturesimaginations. 11And one comes to recognize that, just as the body belongs to the sensory world, so too does the soul belongto a supersensible world; and that, just as one can describe thesense world with the help of the physical body, so can one like-wise describe the supersensible world with its spirituality. Onecomes to know the supersensible world in addition to the sen-sory world. But, in order to attain this faculty, it is necessary tocultivate another soul quality, the mere mention of which\u2014asa way of gaining higher knowledge\u2014is enough to make a mod-ern scientist wince. Certainly, one can fully respect the reasonsfor this, but what I have to tell you about the enhancement ofthis second soul faculty is nevertheless true. As I said, the rst power to be developed is the faculty of memory, which then becomes an independent force. The sec-ond power to be developed is the power of love. In ordinary life, between birth and death, love works through the physicalorganism. It is intimately connected with the instincts anddrives of human nature and only in sublime moments doessomething of this love free itself from human corporeality. Inthose moments, we experience being freed from our narrowselves. Such love is a state of true freedom, in which one doesnot surrender to inborn instincts, but rather forgets the ordi-nary self and orients one's actions and deeds toward outerneeds and facts. It was because of this intimate connectionbetween love and freedom that I dared to state publicly in my 11. See Rudolf Steiner, Life between Death and Rebirth.1chapter 23 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 23 book, Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path12 (rst published in 1892 and in which I tried to found a new sociology in philo-sophical terms), that, far from making people blind, love makesthem see; that is, free. Love leads us beyond what otherwiseblinds us by making us dependent on personal needs. Loveallows us to surrender to the outer world. It removes whateverwould hinder our acting in full freedom. The modern spiritualinvestigator must therefore develop such love\u2014love that shinesactively into ordinary life in truly free deeds. Gradually, lovemust be spiritualized, in the same way as the faculty of remem-bering had to be spiritualized. Love must become purely apower of the soul. It must make the human individual as a soulbeing entirely independent of the body, so that he or she canlove free from blood ties and from the physical organization asa whole. Love of this kind brings about a fusion of the self withthe external world, with one's fellow human beings. Throughlove, one becomes one with the world. This newly developed power of love has another conse- quence. It makes us \"co-workers\" in the spiritual world that wehave been able to enter through the newly developed faculty ofmemory. At this point, we learn to know real beings as spiritualfacts. When describing the external world, we now no longerspeak of our present planetary system as having originatedfrom some primeval cosmic nebula and of its falling into dustagain\u2014or into the sun again\u2014in some remote future. We donot contemplate nature as being thus alienated from the worldof spirit. And, if people today are honest, they cannot helpbecoming aware of the dichotomy between what is most pre-cious in them on one hand, and the interpretation of the worldgiven by natural science on the other. How often has one come 12. Also translated as The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity orThe Philosophy of Freedom .1chapter 24 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 24 across oppressed souls saying, \"Natural science speaks of a world of pure necessity. It tells us that the world originatedfrom a primeval mist. This condensed into the natural king-doms\u2014the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and, nally,also the human kingdom. And yet, deep inside us, somethingrises that surely is of fundamental importance and value,namely, our moral and religious world. This stands before oursouls as the one thing that makes us truly human. But an hon-est interpretation of the world of natural science tells us thatthis earth, on which we stand with our moral ideas like hermitsin the universe, will disintegrate, will fall back again into thesun, it will end up as one vast cinder. A large cemetery is allthat will be left and all of our ideals will be buried there.\" This is the point at which spiritual science enters, not just to grant new hope and belief, but resting entirely on its own sureknowledge, developed as I have already described. It states thatthe natural-scientic theory of the world offers only an abstractpoint of view. In reality, the world is imbued with spirit, andpermeated by supersensible beings. If we look back into prime-val times, we nd that the material substances of the earth orig-inated in the spiritual world, and also that the present materialnature of the earth will become spirit again in future times. Justas, at death, the human being lays aside the physical body toenter, consciously, a spiritual world, so will the material part ofthe earth fall away like a corpse and what then is soul and spiriton earth and in human beings will arise again in future times,even though the earth will have perished. Christ's words\u2014taken as a variation of this same theme\u2014ring true: \"Heavenand earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\" 13 Human beings thus can say, \"Everything that our eyes can seewill perish, just as the body, the transient part of the human 13. St. Luke 21:33.1chapter 25 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 25 individuality, does. But there will rise again from this dying away what lived on earth as morality. Human beings will per-ceive a spiritual world around them; they will live themselvesinto a spiritual world.\" In this way, deepening knowledge with spirit, anthroposoph- ical spiritual science meets the needs of our present civilizationdifferently from external science. It deepens knowledge andcognition to the level of deeply felt piety, of religious con-sciousness, giving human beings spiritual self-awareness. Fundamentally speaking, this is the great question faced by contemporary civilization. But, as long as human beings lackthe proper inner stability, as long as they feel themselves to bematerial entities floating about in some vacuum, they cannotdevelop a strong inner being, nor play a vigorous part in sociallife. Outer planning and organization, directly affecting socialconditions, must be created by people themselves. Such outersocial conditions are of great signicance to the questions ofpresent and future civilization\u2014questions that lead us to searchfor true consciousness of our humanity. But only those withinner stability, which has been granted them through beinganchored in the spirit, will be able to take their proper place insocial life. Thus, a rst question is, how can people place themselves into present social conditions with inner rmness and certaintyregarding matters of daily life? A second question concernshuman relationships or what we could call our attitude towardour fellow human beings: the way in which each person meetshis or her fellow human being. Here we enter a realm where,no less than in the realm of knowledge, modern civilization hasbrought us new riddles rather than new solutions. Only thinkof how the achievements of modern natural science haveexpanded the scope of technology! The technology, commerce,and transportation that surround us every hour of the day are1chapter 26 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 26 all offspring of this new, grandiose way of looking at the sense- perceptible world. And yet we have not been able to nd ananswer in this age of technology to what has become a new,vital question; namely, how are we, as human beings, to live inthis complex technical, commercial and trafc-ridden world?This question has become a by-product of modern civilizationitself. The fact that it has not yet been resolved can be seen inthe devastating political movements, the destructiveness ofwhich increases the farther east we go, even right into Asia. 14 Due to a working out of human instincts, nothing noble or ele-vating is being put into the world there. Rather, because theburning questions of our day have not been solved, havoc anddestruction rule the day. There is no doubt that modern civili-zation would perish if what is emerging in the East were tospread worldwide. What is lurking there, intent on bringingabout the downfall of modern civilization, is far more horricthan people living in the West can imagine. But it also testiesto the fact that something else is needed for the solution of theproblem of contemporary civilization. It is not enough for us to work within the bounds of mod- ern technology, which is a child of the modern world outlook.We must also work toward attainment of another possibility.Human beings have become estranged from their old kinshipto nature. In their practical activities and in their professionallives, they have been placed into a soulless, spiritually empty,mechanistic world. From cooperating with nature, they havebeen led to operating machines and to dealing with spiritlessand mechanical means of transportation. We must nd theway again to give them something to take the place of the oldkinship to nature. And this can only be a world-view thatspeaks to our souls with a powerful voice, making us realize 14. Steiner is referring to the Bolshevik Revolution.1chapter 27 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 27 that there is more to human life than what can be experienced outwardly. Human beings must become inwardly certain thatthey belong to a supersensible world, to a world of soul andspirit, that always surrounds them. They must see that it ispossible to investigate that world with the same scientic accu-racy as the physical world, which is being studied and exploredby outer science and which has led to this technological age.Only such a new science of the supersensible can become thefoundation for a new, right relationship between people. Sucha science not only will allow them to see in their fellow humanbeings what appears during the life between birth and death,but will make them recognize and respect what is immortaland eternal in human beings through their humanity's closelinks with a spiritual world. Such a deepened knowledge willsurely bring about a change for the better in how one individ-ual perceives another. Here is yet a third point of importance. It is the recognition that human life is not fully exhausted within the boundaries ofbirth and death, as the \"ideology of the proletariat\" would haveus believe. Rather, what we are doing every moment here onearth is of signicance not only for the earth, but for the wholeof the universe. When the earth will have passed away, what wehave carried into our daily tasks out of moral, soul-and-spiri-tual depths will arise to live in another world. T ransformed, itwill become part of a general spiritualization. 15 Thus anthroposophical spiritual science approaches the problems of our time in a threefold way. It enables us tobecome aware of our spirituality. It helps us see in our fellowsother beings of soul and spirit. And it helps us recognize thatour earthly deeds, however humble and practical, have a cos-mic and universal spiritual meaning. 15.

In Stuttgart, there is the Waldorf school, which wasfounded by Emil Molt and which I was asked to direct. 16 It is a school whose pedagogical principles and methods are based oninsights gained through the science of the spirit I am speakingof here. Furthermore, in Dornach, near Basel, lies the Goet-heanum, which houses our High School of Spiritual Science.This Goetheanum in Dornach is still incomplete, but we werealready able to hold a large number of courses in the unnishedbuilding during the autumn of last year. 17 Some time ago, on a previous occasion, I was also asked to speak about spiritual science here in Holland. At that time, Icould say only that it existed as a new method of research andthat it was something inherently alive in every human being.Since then, spiritual science has taken on a different form. Ithas begun to establish its own High School in Dornach. Lastspring, I was able to show how what I could only sketchtonight as the beginning of spiritual-scientic research can beapplied in all branches of science. On that occasion, I showeddoctors and medical students how the results of spiritual sci-ence, gained by means of strict and exact methods, can beapplied to therapeutics. 18 Medical questions, which can often 16.

They have becomeriddles because modern science will not rise from observingonly what is sense perceptible and widen its investigations toinclude the supersensible, the spiritual world. During thatautumn course, specialists drawn from many elds\u2014includinglaw, mathematics, history, sociology, biology, physics, chemis-try, and pedagogy\u2014tried to show how all branches of sciencecan be fructied by anthroposophical spiritual science. Repre-sentatives of the arts were also present to demonstrate how spir-itual science was inspiring them to discover new developmentsin their professions. Then there were others, too, drawn fromsuch spheres of practical life as commerce and industry. Thesecould show that spiritual science not only lifted them out ofthe old routines that led the world into the catastrophe of thelast war, but also that it can help relate people to practical lifein a higher sense. The courses were meant to show how spiri-tual science, far from fostering dilettantism or nebulous mysti-cism, is capable of entering and fructifying all of the sciencesand that, in doing so, it is uplifting and linking each separatebranch to become a part of a comprehensive spiritual-supersen-sible conception of the human being. I shall have more to say next time about the practical appli- cations of spiritual science, particularly with regard to educa-tion and the social question. Once I have done so, you willappreciate that anthroposophical spiritual science is not striv-ing for some vague mysticism, removed from daily life, butwishes to grasp the spirit consciously. It wishes to do so for twomain reasons\u2014rst, because it is essential for human beings tobecome aware of how they are related to their true spiritual ori-gin and, second, because spiritual powers are intent on inter-vening in the practical and material affairs of daily life.1chapter 30 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 30 Anyone, therefore, who tends to combine a life devoid of spirit with a truly practical life, or combine a spiritual attitude withisolation from daily life, has certainly not grasped the realnature of anthroposophical spiritual science, nor recognizedthe paramount needs of our present age. We have found people who understand what the High School of Spiritual Science seeks to accomplish for the benetof humanity along the lines already indicated. We have foundpeople who appreciate the necessity of working in this way inview of the great problems facing our present civilization. Yet,due to difcult local circumstances, the completion of theGoetheanum has been greatly delayed. This building is still inan unnished state and its completion will largely depend oncontinued help from friends who have the heart and the under-standing to give their support for the sake of human evolution,so needed today. Nevertheless, despite these difculties, morethan a thousand people were assembled at the opening of ourcourses. Visitors can see in Dornach that spiritual science seeksto work out of the whole human being, that it does not wish toappeal only to the head. They can witness that it seeks to moveahead not only through what can be gained by experimenta-tion and observation, but also by striving for truly artisticexpression, free from empty symbolism or pedantic allegory.This is the reason why we could not possibly use just any arbi-trary style for our building in Dornach. Its architecture, too,had to flow from the same sources from which spiritual scienceitself flows. Because it endeavors to draw on the whole humanbeing, spiritual science is less one-sided than the other sciences,which work only on the basis of experimentation and observa-tion. It is as exact as any other science could be and, in addi-tion, wants to speak to the whole human being. About the practical aspects, I shall have more to say next time. Today, I wanted to prepare the ground by showing how1chapter 31 Thu Aug 31 10:26:51 1995 Anthroposophical Spiritual Science 31 spiritual research leads us right into our present situation. When dealing with the practical side, I hope to show how ourtimes are in need of what anthroposophical spiritual science hasto offer. Such spiritual science seeks to complement the consci-entious and methodical research into the world of matter,which it acknowledges more than any other spiritual move-ment. It is also capable of leading to a religious deepening andto artistic impulses, as did the old, instinctive science of themystery centers, renewal of which, however, would no longerserve our present needs. When dealing with the practical aspects, I shall have to show that spiritual science is in no way either antireligious or anti-Christian. Like all other true and religious aspirations towardan inner deepening, spiritual science strives toward the spirit. This gives us the hope that those who still oppose spiritual science will eventually nd their way into it because it strivestoward something belonging to all people. It strives toward thespirit, and humanity needs the spirit.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 32 2 Education and Practical Life from the Perspective of Spiritual Science THE HAGUE \u2014 FEBRUARY 27, 1921 In my first lecture, I drew your attention to the essence of anthroposophical spiritual science. I mentioned how methods have been sought in spiritual science that enable the spiritualinvestigator to penetrate a supersensible world with the sameclarity as natural science penetrates the outer, sense-perceptible world with the sense organs and the intellect, which system- atizes and interprets the results of sensory impressions. Idescribed these methods in my last lecture. And I emphasizedthat, in addition to today's ordinary science, another science exists. This uses spiritual methods and, by its path of research and the inner experiences unfolding along it, furnishes fullproof of our being surrounded by a supersensible world, just as,in the ordinary state of consciousness, we are surrounded by the sense world. I would now like to return to a prior point, elaborated during the last lecture, that, at least to a certainextent, will form the basis of what I have to say today. The anthroposophical science of the spirit, referred to here, is not at all opposed to what has become\u2014over the last three or four centuries\u2014the natural-scientific world-view. As Ialready pointed out, this spiritual science is opposed only toviewpoints that do not take into account the results of modernEducation and Practical Life 33 natural science and thereby become more or less dilettantish. Spiritual science wishes to be an extension or continuation of natural-scientific thinking. Only, this spiritual-scientific con- tinuation allows a person to acquire the kind of knowledgethat can answer the deepest longings in the minds and thesouls of modern human beings. Thus, through spiritual sci- ence, one really comes to know human beings. Not so long ago, modern science, in a way fully recognized by spiritual science, gave us a wonderful survey of the gradualdevelopment of living organisms right up to human beings. And yet, when all is said and done, the human being stands there only as the end product of evolution. Biology speaks of certain muscles that are found both in human beings and in various animal species. We also know that a human being has a certain number of bones and that this number corresponds with the bones of the higher animals.Altogether, we have grown accustomed to explaining the emer-gence of the entire bone structure of higher animals and human beings as a development from a lower stage to a higher one. But we have no idea of the essential characteristics that areuniquely and exclusively human. Anyone willing to look at thesituation without prejudice has to admit the fact that we are ignorant of what constitutes a human being. In general, natural phenomena and all living organisms are scrupulously investi-gated up to and including homo sapiens , and the conclusion is then drawn that human beings are encompassed by what is to be found in external nature. But, generally, there is no really adequate idea of what is essentially human. In ordinary, practical life, we find a similar situation, very much as a result of natural-scientific thinking and knowledge. We find its effects overshadowing modern life, causing a great deal of perplexity and distress. The consequence of not knowingthe essential nature of human beings becomes all too obvious inWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 34 what is usually referred to as the social question. Millions of peo- ple who belong to what is called the proletariat, whom the tradi- tional religions and confessions have abandoned, believe that reality is no longer to be found in the human soul, but only inthe material aspects of life, in the processes of production withinthe outer economic sphere. Morality, religion, science, and art, as cultivated by humanity throughout the ages, are regarded as nothing more than a kind of ideological superstructure, built ona solid material or even economic material substructure. Themoral and cultural aspects of life appear almost as a kind of vapor, rising from the only reality\u2014material reality. Here, again, what is truly the human soul and spirit\u2014what is psychical-spiri-tual in human beings\u2014has been eliminated. 1 Not to be able to reach knowledge of the human being and, consequently, to be debarred from beholding and experiencing the truth of human nature, and from bringing down humanideals into will impulses in the social sphere\u2014these seem to bethe characteristic features of modern times. Anthroposophical spiritual science, on the other hand, is only too aware of what needs to be accomplished in this direc-tion for the sake of the deepest, yet often unconscious, longingof the souls of some of the best of our contemporaries. It is to be accomplished, first, by true knowledge of the human being and, second, by an inner sense of fulfillment strong enough toenable one to carry into public life truly social impulses arisingin the soul. For, without these impulses arising from the depths of our humanity, even the best of outer practical arrangements will not lead to what in the widest circles is regarded as unreal-izable, but toward which many people are striving nevertheless,namely to a dignified human existence. 1. Steiner is referring to Marxism. See his essay \"Marxism and the Threefold Social Order\" in The Renewal of the Social Organism .Education and Practical Life 35 The path leading into the spiritual world as I described it here a few days ago could easily be understood as something that estranges one from life rather than leading one to the two weighty questions that I have put before you once again today.For this reason, it was of paramount importance that anthropo-sophical spiritual science be practiced in the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. Despite the unfinished state of the build- ing, spiritual science has the possibility of pursuing practicalactivities there, demonstrating how knowledge of human natureand human faculties can enter into the practical sphere of life. One of the most important practical activities is surely edu- cation of the young. Those who work in the field of educating children are basi- cally dealing with what will enter the world with the next gen- eration, and this means a very great deal. Raising and educating children are a direct way to work into the near future. In itsquest for a method of understanding human nature, anthropo-sophical spiritual science finds itself able to understand the human being in its becoming\u2014the child\u2014in a wide, compre- hensive manner. From such comprehensive knowledge of thegrowing child, spiritual science seeks to create a real art of edu-cation. For what spiritual science can provide in understanding and penetration of human nature does not end in abstractions or theories, but eventually develops into an artistic comprehen-sion, first of the human form and then of the potential of thehuman soul and spirit. It is all very well to maintain that sci- ence demands what is often called a sober working with objec- tive concepts. But, ladies and gentlemen, what if the wholeworld, if nature, did not work with such concepts at all? Whatif it were to scorn our wish to restrict its creativity to the kind of natural law into which we try to confine it? What if the creativ- ity of the world were to elude our sober, merely external grasp and our rather lightweight logical concepts? We can certainlyWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 36 make our demands, but whether by doing so we will attain real knowledge depends on whether nature works and creates according to them. At any rate, more recent scientific attitudes have failed to recognize the essence of human nature because they have failedto consider the following. In her upward climb, at each succes- sive step of the evolutionary ladder\u2014from the mineral king- dom, through the plant and animal kingdoms, to the humankingdom\u2014nature's creativity increasingly escapes our intellec-tual grasp and sober logic, forcing us to approach her workings more and more artistically. What ultimately lives in a human being is open to many interpretations and shows manifoldaspects. And because spiritual science, in its own way, seeks theinner harmony between knowledge, religious depth, and artis- tic creativity, it is in a position to survey rightly\u2014that is, spiri- tually\u2014the enigmatic, admirable creation that is a humanbeing and how it is placed in the world. Last time, I spoke of how it is possible to look with scientific accuracy into the world where human beings live before they descend into physical existence at conception or birth. I indi-cated how, with mathematical clarity, the human spirit andsoul, descending from the spiritual worlds, place themselves before the spiritual eyes of the anthroposophical investigator, showing themselves to be at work on the interior of the futureearthly body and drawing only material substances from thestream of heredity bequeathed by previous generations. Anyone who talks about such things today is quickly judged inconsistent. And yet the methods pursued by spiritual scienceare much the same as those employed by natural science. Themain difference is that the work entailed in the various branches of natural science is done in the appropriate laborato- ries, clinics, or astronomical observatories, whereas the scienceo f t h e s p i r i t a p p r o a c h e s h u m a n n a t u r e d i r e c t l y i n o r d e r t oEducation and Practical Life 37 observe it as methodically as a natural scientist observes what- ever might belong to his or her particular field of study. In the latter case, however, the situation is more straightforward for it is easier to make one's observations and to search for underly-ing laws in natural science than in spiritual science. As a first step, I would like to draw your attention to what one can observe in a growing human being in a truly natural- scientific way. Of course, in the case of spiritual science, wemust include in our observations the gradual development ofthe human being through several different life periods. One of those periods extends from birth to the change of the teeth; that is, until about the seventh year. T o recognize a kind of nodalpoint around the seventh year might easily create the impressionof an inclination toward mysticism which is not, however, the case. The following observations have as little to do with mysti- cism as the distinction between the seven colors of the rainbowhas. They are simply an outcome of objective, scientific observa-tion of the growing child. Even from a physical point of view, it is evident that a powerful change occurs when, in about a child's seventh year, forces from within drive the second teeth out ofthe organism. This event does not recur, indicating that somekind of conclusion has been reached. What is going on becomes clearer when we do not restrict our observations to the physical or change-of-teeth aspect of thisseventh year, but extend them to parallel developments occur-ring alongside the physical changes. In this case, if we are capa- ble of observing at all, we will see how a child's entire soul life undergoes a gradual change during this period. We can observehow the child, who previously could form only blurred andindistinct concepts, now begins to form more sharply contoured concepts\u2014how it is only now in fact that the child begins to form proper concepts at all. Furthermore, we notice how quite ad i f f e r e n t k i n d o f m e m o r y i s n o w u n f o l d i n g . F o r m e r l y , w h e nWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 38 younger, the child might often have displayed signs of an excel- lent memory. That memory, however, was entirely natural and instinctive. Whereas there was before no need for any special effort in the act of remembering, the child who has passed thiswatershed must now make a mental effort to remember pastevents clearly. In short, it becomes obvious that, with the change of teeth around the seventh year, a child begins to be active in the realm of mental imagery, in forming simple thoughts, and inthe sphere of conscious will activity. But what is actually happening here? Where had this force been that we can now observe in the child's soul and spirit, forming more clearly-defined mental images and thoughts?Where was that force before the child's milk teeth were shed?This is the kind of question that remains unasked by our con- temporary theorizing psychologists. When physicists observe in a physical process an increase of warmth that is not due to external causes, they explain this phe-nomenon by the concept of \"latent heat becoming liberated.\" This implies that the heat that emerges must have existed previ- ously within the substance itself. A similar kind of thinking mustalso be applied in the case of human life. Where were thoseforces of soul and spirit before they emerged in the child after the seventh year? They were latent in the child's physical organism. They were active in its organic growth, in its organic structuring,until, with the pushing out of the second teeth, a kind of climaxwas reached, indicating the conclusion of this first period of growth, so particularly active during the child's early years. Psychology today is quite abstract. People cogitate on the relationship of soul to body, and devise the most remarkableand grandiloquent hypotheses. Empty phrases, however, will not lead to an art of education. Spiritual science, for its part, shows that what we see emerging cognitively in a child after theseventh year was actively engaged in its inner organism beforeEducation and Practical Life 39 the second dentition. It shows that what appears in a child's soul after the change of teeth was active before as an organic force that has now become liberated. In a similar way, a true spiritual researcher observes in a con- crete manner\u2014not abstractly\u2014the entire course of human life.To illustrate that concrete manner of observation, let us now consider a well-known and specific childhood phenomenon. Let us look at children at play, at children's games. If we can do so without preconception and with dedicated interest in thegrowing human being, we know\u2014although every game has a certain form and shares common, characteristic features\u2014that, whatever the game, each child will play it with his or her ownindividual style. Now those who raise or educate young chil-dren can, to a certain extent, influence or guide how a child plays according to the child's own nature. Also, depending on our pedagogical skills, we can try to steer our children's playinto more purposeful directions. And, if we pay attention to allthis, we can clearly discriminate between the various individual styles of playing until the child reaches an age when they are no longer so clearly identifiable. Once a child enters school andother interests are crowding in, however, it becomes more diffi-cult to see the future consequences of his or her characteristic style of playing. Nevertheless, if we do not observe superficially and, realizing that the course of life represents a whole, extendthe range of our observations to span the entire earthly life, wemight discover the following. Around twenty-four or twenty-five\u2014that is, when young adults must find their links with the outer world, and whenthey must fit themselves into the social fabric of the wider com-munity\u2014there will be those who prove themselves more skillful than others in dealing with all aspects and details of their tasks. Now, careful observation will reveal that the way in which peo-ple in their twenties adapt themselves to outer conditions of life,Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 40 with greater or lesser skill, is a direct consequence of their play activity during early childhood. Certain rivers, whose sources may be clearly traced, disap- pear below the earth's surface during their course, only to resur-face at a later stage. We can compare this phenomenon withcertain faculties in human life. The faculty of playing, so prom- inent in a young child, is particularly well developed during the first years of life. It then vanishes into the deeper regions of thesoul to resurface during the twenties, transmuted into an apti-tude for finding one's way in the world. Just think: by guiding the play of young children, we, as educators, are directly inter- vening in the happiness or unhappiness, the future destiny, ofyoung people in their twenties! Such insights greatly sharpen our sense of responsibility as educators. They also stimulate the desire to work toward a gen- uine art of education. Tight-fitting, narrow concepts cannotreach the core of human nature. T o do so, a wide and compre-hensive view is needed. Such a view can be gained if we recog- n i z e t h a t s u c h i n t e r c o n n e c t i o n s a s I h a v e m e n t i o n e d a f f e c t human life. It will also make us realize that we must distinguishbetween definite life periods in human development, the firstof which extends from birth to the change of teeth and has a character all its own. At this point, I should mention that those who choose to become teachers or educators through anthroposophical spiri-tual science are filled with the consciousness that a message from the spiritual world is actually present in what they meet in such enigmatic and wondrous ways in the developing human being,the child. Such teachers observe the child with its initially inde-terminate features, noticing how they gradually assume more definite forms. They see how children's movements and life stir- rings are undefined to begin with and how directness and pur-pose then increasingly enter their actions from the depths ofEducation and Practical Life 41 their souls. Those who have prepared themselves to become teachers and educators through anthroposophical spiritual sci- ence are aware that something actually descending from the spiritual worlds lives in the way the features of a child's facechange from day to day, week to week, and year to year, gradu-ally evolving into a distinct physiognomy. And they know too that something spiritual is descending in what is working through the lively movements of a child's hands and in what,quite magically, enters into a child's way of speaking. T o learn to recognize this activity of the spiritual world, which is so different from that of the physical world; to meet the child as an educator with such an inner attitude and moodas I have described: this means that we see in the vocation ofteaching a source of healing. This vocation could be expressed as follows: The spiritual worlds have entrusted a human soul into my care. I have been called upon to assist in solving the riddles thatthis child poses. By means of a deepened knowledge of the humanbeing\u2014transformed into a real art, the art of education\u2014it is my task to show this child the way into life. Such deepened knowledge of human nature reveals that, in the first period of life, a child is what I would like to call an\"imitating\" being. (You will find a more detailed account of this characteristic feature in my booklet The Education of the Child in the Light of Anthroposophy . 2) Descending from the spiritual world, the child brings to outer expression\u2014like anecho from the spiritual world\u2014the last experiences undergone there. As anthroposophists, when we educate our children, we are aware that the way in which children imitate their sur-roundings is childish and primitive. They copy what is donebefore them with their movements. They learn to speak entirely and only through imitation. And, until they lose their 2. See Bibliography.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 42 milk teeth, they also imitate what happens morally in their environment. What lies behind all of this can be rightly understood only with the help of spiritual science. Before conception or birth, achild lives in the spiritual world, the same spiritual world that canbe known and consciously experienced if we strengthen the power of memory and develop the power of love in the ways I described during our last meeting. In that spiritual world, therelationship of one being to another is not one in which theyconfront one another outwardly; rather, each being is capable of living right into another\u2014objectively, yet full of love. Children then bring this relationship of spiritual beings to one anotherdown to earth. It is like a resonant echo of the spiritual world. Wecan observe here how children become creatures of imitation, how everything they learn and make their own during these first seven years, they learn through imitation. Any genuine art ofeducation must fully respect this principle of imitation\u2014other-wise, it is all too easy to misjudge our children's behavior. T o illustrate this point, let me give you an example, just one of hundreds that could be chosen. The father of a boy, agedabout five, once came to me and told me that a very sad thinghad happened; namely, that his boy had been stealing. I sug- gested that we begin by carefully examining whether in fact the child had really stolen. The father told me that the boy hadtaken money from the drawer where his wife kept it and hadthen bought candy with it, which he shared with other children in the street. I asked the father what usually happened with the money kept in the drawer. He replied that the boy's mothertook the amount of money needed for the household that dayout of her drawer every morning. Hearing this, I could reassure him that his boy had not stolen at all. I said, \"The child is five years old. This means that he is still fully in the stage of imita-tion. Therefore, it is only good and proper that he should doEducation and Practical Life 43 what he sees done in his environment. His mother takes money out of the drawer every day, and so he naturally copies her. This is not stealing but merely behavior appropriate to the funda- mental principle of a child's development during the firstseven-year period.\" A real teacher must know these things. During the first seven years of life, one cannot guide and direct a child by reprimands, nor by moral commands. During this period, one must guide achild by one's own deeds and by setting an example. But thereare of course imponderables to be reckoned with in human as in outer nature. We guide a child not only with external deeds, but also with inner thoughts and feelings. If children enjoy the com-pany of grown-ups who never allow unworthy thoughts or feel-ings to enter into their lives, something noble and good could become of them. On the other hand, if adults allow themselves mean, ignoble thoughts or feelings when they are around youngpeople, believing that such thoughts or feelings do not mattersince everyone is safely ensheathed within an individual bodily structure, they are mistaken, for such things do work on chil- dren. Imponderables are at work. Such imponderables also manifest themselves in the second period of life, which begins after the change of teeth\u2014when the child enters school\u2014and lasts until the age of puberty, around fourteen. When we were working out the fundamentalsof a truly spiritual-scientific, spiritually artistic pedagogy forthe Waldorf school in Stuttgart\u2014founded by Emil Molt and directed by myself\u2014we had to make a special study of this transition from the first life period, that of imitation, to thesecond period, from the change of teeth to puberty. For allteaching, education, and upbringing at the Waldorf School is to be based entirely upon anthroposophical insight into human nature. And because children change from the stage of imita-tion into quite a different stage\u2014I shall say more about thisWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 44 presently\u2014we had to make a special effort to study this time of transition. During the second period, leading up to puberty, imitation alone no longer suffices to form the faculties, the child's wholebeing. A new impulse now emerges from the depths of thechild's soul. The child now wishes to regard the teacher as a fig- ure of undisputed authority. T oday, when everything goes under the banner of democracy, the demand is easily made thatschools, too, should be \"democratized.\" There are even thosewho would do away with the distinction between teacher and pupil altogether, advocating \"community schools,\" or whatever name these bright ideas are given. Such ideas are a consequenceof party-political attitudes, not knowledge of human nature.But educational questions should not be judged from partisan p o s i t i o n s ; t h e y s h o u l d b e j u d g e d o n l y o n t h e i r o w n m e r i t s . And, if you do this, you will find that, between second denti-tion and puberty, a child is no longer obliged to imitate, butnow has a deep desire to learn what is right or wrong, good or evil, from a beloved and naturally respected authority figure. Happy are those who throughout their lives can remember such childhood authorities and can say of themselves, \"I had at e a c h e r . W h e n I w e n t t o v i s i t h e r , o p e n i n g t h e d o o r t o h e r room, I already felt full of awe. T o me, it was perfectly natural that my teacher was the source of everything good and true.\"Such things are not subject to argument on social or any othergrounds. What is important is to gain the insight into human nature so that one can say, \"Just as a young child's urge to play, which manifests in individually different ways, resurfaces asmore or less skill in fitting into life when the young person is inhis or her twenties, so another, similar transformation also occurs regarding a child's reverence for the teacher as a figure of authority. That is, only if faith in the authority of the adults incharge develops fully between the ages of approximately sevenEducation and Practical Life 45 and fifteen will the right sense of freedom develop later, when the feeling for freedom must be the basis for all social life.\" People cannot become free as adults unless they found as children support in the natural authority of adults. Likewise,only those who during the first period of life are allowed to passthrough the process of adjusting themselves to their environ- ment through the inborn desire to imitate can be motivated as adults to take a loving interest in the social sphere. This abilityto adjust based on imitation does not last; what is needed inlater life is a social awareness, the development of which depends on how far educators of children under seven can b e c o m e w o r t h y m o d e l s o f i m i t a t i o n . W e n e e d p e o p l e t o d a ywho are able to place themselves into life with a genuine senseof freedom. They are those who were able to look up to their educators and teachers as persons of authority during the time between their second dentition and puberty. If one has stated publicly\u2014as I already did in my book Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path , published in 1892 3\u2014 that the sense of freedom and the feeling for freedom are the basic facts of social life, one is hardly likely to speak againstfreedom and democracy. But, just because of this positive atti-tude towards freedom, one must also acknowledge that the practice of education as an art depends on the sense of author- ity, developed by the child during the second period of life.During this same period, the child also has to make a gradualtransition from living in mental images\u2014or pictures\u2014to a more intellectual approach, a process that moves through and beyond another important turning point. A true art of education must be able to penetrate such important issues. 3. Also translated as The Philosophy of Freedom or The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 46 The turning point to be discussed now occurs around a child's ninth year\u2014but sometimes not before the tenth or even the eleventh year. 4 When our teachers recognize that a child is passing this point, they accompany the change with an appro-priate change in pedagogy. In early childhood, a child learns tospeak, gradually learning to refer to itself as \"I\". Up to the ninth year, however, the distinction between the child's \"I\" and the surrounding world is still rather undefined. Those who canobserve things carefully recognize that the period when a childlearns to differentiate between self and surroundings\u2014approxi- mately between the ninth and the eleventh years\u2014is critical. It i s a t im e w hen t he c h il d is a ct u al ly c r os s i ng a R u b ic on . T heway in which the teachers respond to this change is of greatestimportance for a child's future life. T eachers must have the right feeling for what is happening. They must realize that the child no longer experiences itself as an organic part of its envi-ronment\u2014as a finger might experience itself as a part of thebody if it had its own consciousness\u2014but as a separate, inde- pendent entity. If they do so and respond in the right way as teachers, they can create a source of lasting joy and vitality inlife. But if they fail to respond rightly, they open the way tobarren and weary lives for their pupils later on. It is important to realize that, prior to this significant change, the child still lives in a world of pictures so closely related to its own naturethat, unable to appreciate the difference between self and envi-ronment, it merges into its surroundings. Therefore, in assist- ing a child to establish its relationship to the world at this stage, a teacher must use a pictorial approach. We receive the children into our school from their parental homes. T oday, we live in an age when writing and reading have 4. On the nine-year-old turning point, see Hermann Koepke, Encountering the Self.Education and Practical Life 47 produced conventional symbols no longer bearing any direct inner relationship to the human being. Compare the abstract letters of our alphabet with the picture writing used in ages past. What was fixed into written forms in ancient times still bore aresemblance to people's mental images. But writing nowadayshas become quite abstract. If we introduce children directly to these abstract letters in reading and writing lessons, we intro- duce them to something alien to their nature, or at least some-thing inappropriate for six-, seven-, or eight-year olds. For thisreason, we use a different method in our Waldorf school. Instead of beginning with the letters of the alphabet, we engage our young pupils in artistic activity by letting thempaint and draw; that is, work with colors and forms. In thisactivity, not only the head is engaged\u2014which would have a very harmful effect\u2014but the child's entire being is involved. We then let the actual letters emerge out of these color-filledforms. This is how our Waldorf pupils learn writing. Theylearn writing first. And only afterward do they learn to read, for printed letters are even more abstract than our handwrit- ten ones. In other words, only gradually do we develop theabstract element, so necessary today, from the artistic elementwhich is more closely allied to life. We proceed similarly in other subjects, too. And we work in this way toward a living, artistic pedagogy that makes it possible to reach the very soulof the child. As for the nature of what we usually think of asplant, mineral, and so forth, this can be fruitfully taught only after the child has passed the turning point just characterized and can differentiate itself from its surroundings. Working along these lines, it might well happen that some of our pupils learn to read and write later than pupils in other schools. But this is no drawback. On the contrary, it is even an advantage. Of course, it is quite possible to teach young chil-dren reading and writing by rote and get them to rattle offWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 48 what is put before their eyes, but it is also possible to deaden something in them by doing this, and anything killed during childhood remains dead for the rest of one's life. The opposite is equally true. What we allow to live and what we wake intolife is the very stuff that will blossom and give life vitality. T onurture this process, surely, is the task of a real educator. You will doubtless have heard of those educational ideas already published during the nineteenth century that empha-size the importance of activating a child's individuality. 5 We are told that, instead of cramming children with knowledge, we should bring out their inherent gifts and abilities. Cer- tainly, no one would wish to denigrate such great geniuses ofeducation. Important things have certainly been said by thescience of education. On the other hand, though one can listen carefully to its abstract demands, such as that the individuality of the child should be developed, positive results will beachieved only if one is able to observe, day by day, how a child'sindividuality actually unfolds. One must know how, during the first seven years, the principle of imitation rules the day; how, during the following period from the seventh to the fourteenthyear, the principle of authority predominates; and how this lat-ter principle is twinned with the child's gradual transition from mental imagery\u2014which is essentially of a pictorial or symbolic nature and based on memory\u2014to the forming of concepts bythe awakening intellect: a process that begins in the eleventhto twelfth year. If we can observe all of this and learn from a spiritual-scientific and artistic way of observing how to respond as a teacher, we shall achieve much more than if weattempt to follow an abstract aim, such as educating a child 5. Above all, the Swiss educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and Friedrich Wilhel August Fr\u00f6bel (1782-1852), founder of the kindergarten system.Education and Practical Life 49 out of its individuality. Spiritual science does not create abstractions, it does not make fixed demands; rather, it looks toward what can be developed into an art through spiritual perceptiveness and a comprehensive, sharpened sense ofobservation. Last time, I was able to describe only briefly the kind of knowledge of the human being given by spiritual science that can form a basis for dealing with such practical matters as edu-cation. The pressing demands of society show clearly enoughthe need for such knowledge today. By complementing the outer, material aspects of life with supersensible and spiritual insights, spiritual science or anthroposophy leads us from agenerally unreal, abstract concept of life to a concrete practicalreality. According to this view, human beings occupy a central position in the universe. Such realistic understanding of human nature and human activities is what is needed today. Let mereinforce this point with a characteristic example. Imagine that we wanted to convey a simple religious con- cept\u2014for instance, the concept of the immortality of the human soul\u2014to a class of young children. If we approach thesubject pictorially, we can do this before a child's ninth year.For example, we can say, \"Look at the butterfly's chrysalis. Its hard shell cracks open and the butterfly flutters out into the air. A similar thing happens when a human being dies. Theimmortal soul dwells in the body. But, when death breaks itopen, just as the butterfly flies from the chrysalis into the air, so the soul flies away from the dead body into the heavenly world, only the human soul remains invisible.\" When we study such an example from the point of view of a living art of education, we come face to face with life's impon- derables. A teacher might have chosen such a comparison by reasoning somewhat as follows: \"I am the one who knows, for Iam much older than the child. I have thought out this pictureWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 50 of the caterpillar and the butterfly because of the child's igno- rance and immaturity. As someone of superior intelligence, I have made the child believe something in which I myself do not believe. In fact, from my own point of view, it was only asilly little story, invented solely for the purpose of getting thechild to understand the concept of the immortality of the soul.\" If this is a teacher's attitude, he or she will achieve but lit- tle. Although to say this might sound paradoxical in our mate-rialistic age, it is nevertheless true: if teachers are insincere,their words do not carry much weight. T o return to our example. If Waldorf teachers had chosen this comparison for their classes, the situation, though out-wardly similar, would have been very different. For they wouldnot have used it\u2014nor, for that matter, any other picture or simile\u2014unless they were convinced of its inherent truth. A Waldorf teacher, an anthroposophically oriented spiritualresearcher, would not feel, \"I am the intelligent adult whomakes up a story for the children's benefit,\" but rather: \"The eternal beings and powers, acting as the spiritual in nature, have placed before my eyes a picture of the immortal humansoul, objectively, in the form of the emerging butterfly. Believ-ing in the truth of this picture with every fibre of my being, and bringing it to my pupils through my own conviction, I will awaken in them a truly religious concept. What matters isnot so much what I, as teacher, say to the child, but what I amand what my heartfelt attitude is.\" These are the kinds of things that must be taken more and more seriously in the art of education. Y ou will also understand when I tell you that visitors to our Waldorf school, who come to see the school in action and to observe lessons, cannot see the whole. It is almost as if, for instance, you cut a small piece out of a Rembrandt painting,believing that you could gain an overall impression of theEducation and Practical Life 51 whole picture through it. Such a thing is not possible when an impulse is conceived and practiced as a comprehensive whole\u2014as the Waldorf school is\u2014and when it is rooted in the totality of anthroposophical spiritual science. You might have been wondering which kind of people would make good teachers in such a school. They are people whose entire lives have been molded by the spiritual knowledge of which I spoke last time. The best way of learning to knowthe Waldorf school and of becoming familiar with its underly-ing principles is by gaining knowledge of anthroposophical spiritual science itself at least as a first step. A few short visits in order to observe lessons will hardly convey an adequate impres-sion of Waldorf pedagogy. Plain speaking in such matters is essential, because it points toward the character of the new spirit that, flowing from the High School of Spiritual Science centered in Dornach, is toenter all practical spheres of life\u2014social, artistic, educational,and so forth. If you consider thoroughly all that I have been telling you, you will no longer think it strange that those who enter more deeplyinto the spirit underlying this art of education find it absolutelyessential to place themselves firmly upon the ground of a free spiritual life. Because education has become dependent on the state on the one hand and on the economic sphere on the other,there is a tendency for it to become abstract and programmatic.Those who believe in the anthroposophical way of life must insist on a free and independent cultural-spiritual life. This rep- resents one of the three branches of the threefold social orderabout which I wrote in my book The Threefold Commonwealth . 6 6. Die Kernpunkte der Sozialen Frage , 1919, GA23. For the threefold social order, see also (among others) The Renewal of the Social Organism ; and The Social Future .Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 52 One of the demands that must be made for spiritual life\u2014 something that is not at all utopian, that may be begun any day\u2014is that those actively engaged in spiritual life (and this means, above all, those involved in its most important publicdomain; namely, education) should also be entrusted with alladministrative matters, and this in a broad and comprehen- sive way. The maximum number of lessons to be taught\u2014plus the hours spent on other educational commitments\u2014should allowteachers sufficient time for regular meetings, in both smaller and larger groups, to deal with administrative matters. How- ever, only practicing teachers\u2014not former teachers now hold-ing state positions or retired teachers\u2014should be called on tocare for this side of education. For what has to be administered in each particular school\u2014as in all institutions belonging to the spiritual-cultural life\u2014should be only a continuation ofwhat is being taught, of what forms the content of every wordspoken and every deed performed in the classroom. Rules and regulations must not be imposed from outside the school. In spiritual life, autonomy, self-administration, is essential. I am well aware that people who like to form logical \"quickly tailored\" concepts, as well as others who, somewhat superficially, favor a more historical perspective, will readily object to these ideas. But in order to recognize the necessity of making spiri-tual-cultural life into a free and independent member of thesocial organism, one really must be acquainted with its inherent nature. Anyone who has been a teacher at a working-class adult- education center for several years\u2014as I was in the schoolfounded by Wilhelm Liebknecht, 7 thereby gaining firsthand 7. Wilhelm Liebknecht, 1826-1900, founder of the German Social-Demo- cratic Party. The school was a Worker's College. Rudolf Steiner taught his- tory, public speaking, and composition there.Education and Practical Life 53 experience of the social question\u2014knows only too well that this is not merely a matter of improving external arrangements or of dealing with dissatisfaction caused by unjust outer conditions. As I say , if one has taught in such circles, one knows that oneword comes up repeatedly in proletarian circles, but extends farbeyond proletarian life, namely, the word \"ideology,\" the mean- ing of which is set out in the first chapter of The Threefold Com- monwealth . Now, what is hidden behind this? Long ago, in the ancient East, people spoke of the great illu- sion or \"maya.\" According to this view\u2014already decadent today and hence unsuited to our Western ways\u2014 maya refers to the external sensory world which offers us only semblance orouter appearance. T o ancient sages, true reality of being\u2014thereality that sustained human beings\u2014lived and grew in the soul. All else, all that the outer senses beheld, was only maya . We live today in an age that expresses\u2014especially in its most radical philosophies\u2014a total reversal of this ancient view. Formost people today true reality resides in outer, physical nature and in the processes of production, while what can be found inwardly in the human soul as morality, art, religion, knowl-edge is maya, illusion . If we want to translate the word maya correctly, we must translate it as \"ideology.\" For modern humanity, all other translations fail. But ideology refers to exactly the opposite of what maya was for the ancient oriental. The widest circles of the population today call maya what the ancient oriental called the sole reality. And this reversal of the word's meaning is of great significance for life today. I have known people of the leading classes who lived under the influence of the philosophy that gave rise to ideology. I havelearned to know the perplexity of people who reasoned thus: if we trust what natural science tells us, the entire origin of the cos- mos can be traced to a primeval nebula. According to these theo-ries, all of the different species of nature began during this stage.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 54 At that time, too, human beings densified out of the nebula. And, while this process continued, something not unlike soap bubbles unfolded in the human soul. According to natural sci- ence, what rises in the human soul as ethics, religion, science orart, does not represent reality. Indeed, if we look toward the endof earthly evolution as it is presented by science, all that is offered is the prospect of an immense cemetery. On earth, death would follow, due either to general glaciation, or to total annihilationby heat. In either case, the result would be a great cemetery forall human ideals\u2014for everything considered to be the essence of human values and the most important aspect of human exist- ence. If we are honest in accepting what natural science tellsus\u2014such people had to conclude\u2014then all that remains is onlya final extinction of all forms of existence. I have witnessed the sense of tragedy and the deep-seated pain in the souls of such materialistically minded members oftoday's leading circles, who could not escape the logical conclu-sions of the natural-scientific outlook and who were conse- quently forced to look on all that is most precious in the human beings as mere illusion. In many people, I have seenthis pessimism, which was a result of their honest pursuit of thenatural-scientific conception of the world. This attitude took a special form in the materialism of the working class. There, everything of a spiritual nature is gener-ally looked upon as a kind of a superstructure, as mere smokeor fog; in a word, as \"ideology\". And what enters and affects the soul condition of modern people in this way is the actual source of the contemporary anti-social sentiment\u2014howevermany other reasons might be constantly invented and pub-lished. They amount only to a form of self deception. It is the influence of this attitude which is the real origin of the dreadful catastrophes that are dawning\u2014undreamt of by most people\u2014in the whole East. So far, they have started in Russia, whereEducation and Practical Life 55 they have already assumed devastating proportions. They will assume even greater dimensions unless steps are taken to replace an ideology by a living grasp of the spirit. Anthroposophical spiritual science gives us not only ideas and concepts of something real but also ideas and concepts by whichwe know that we are not just thinking about something filled with spirit. Spiritual science gives us the living spirit itself, not just spirit in the form of thoughts. It shows human beings asbeings filled with living spirit\u2014just like the ancient religions.Like the ancient religions, the message of spiritual science is not just \"you will know something,\" but \"you will know something, and divine wisdom will thereby live in you. As blood pulses inyou, so by true knowing will divine powers too pulse in you.\"Spiritual science, as represented in Dornach, wishes to bring to humanity precisely such knowledge and spiritual life. T o do so, we need the support of our contemporaries. Work- ing in small ways will not lead to appropriate achievements.What is needed is work on a large scale. Spiritual science is free from sectarianism. It has the will to carry out the great tasks of our times, including those in the practical spheres of life. Butto bring this about, spiritual science must be understood in aliving way by contemporary society. It is not enough to open a few schools here and there, modeled on the Waldorf school, as some people wish. This is not the way forward, for it will notlead to greater freedom in spiritual life. Often, I have had to suffer the painful experience of witness- ing the conduct of certain people who, because of their distrust in orthodox, materialistic medicine, approached me, trying totempt me into quackery. They wanted to be cured by creepingthrough the back door, as it were. I have experienced it to the point of revulsion. There was, for instance, a Prussian govern- ment official, who publicly supported materialistic medicine inparliament, granting it sole rights, only to enter by the backWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 56 door to be treated by the very people whom he had opposed most violently in parliament. The Anthroposophical Society\u2014which could, from a certain point of view, be justly described as willing to make sacrificesand whose members have dedicated themselves to the cultiva-tion of anthroposophical spiritual science\u2014seeks a powerful impetus, capable of affecting and working into the world at l arge. Wha t i s at is s u e t oda y is n ot h in g les s th an t he fo ll o w -ing\u2014that a true spiritual life, such as our present society needs,can be created only by those interested in it, which fundamen- tally includes everyone, many of whom have children, and that these must bring about the right conditions in which childrencan mature into free human beings so that those children, inturn, can create an existence worthy of humanity. As far as spir- itual-cultural life is concerned, everyone is an interested party and should do his or her share to work for what the future willprovide in the form of spiritual-cultural life. Thus, what I would like to call \"a world school movement,\" based on the ideas I have put forward today, should meet with approval in the widest quarters. What really ought to happen isthat all those who can clearly see the need for a free spiritual-cul-tural life should unite to form an international world school movement. An association of that kind would offer a stronger and more-living impetus for uniting nations than many otherassociations being founded these days on the basis of old andabstract principles. Such a union of nations, spiritually implied in a world school movement, could be instrumental in uniting peoples all over the globe by their participation in this great task. The modern state school system superseded the old denomi- national schools relatively recently. It was good and right that this happened. And yet, what was a blessing at the time when the state took this step would cease to be one if state-controllededucation were to become permanent; for then, inevitably,Education and Practical Life 57 education would become the servant of the state. The state can train theologians, lawyers, or other professionals to become its civil servants, but if the spiritual life is to be granted full inde- pendence, all persons in a teaching capacity must be responsiblesolely to the spiritual world, to which they can look up in thelight of anthroposophically oriented spiritual science. A world school movement, as I envisage it, would have to be founded on an entirely international basis by all whounderstand the meaning of a truly free spiritual life andwhat our human future demands in social questions. Gradu- ally, such a world school movement would give birth to the general opinion that schools must be granted independencefrom the state and that the teachers in each school must begiven the freedom to deal with that school's own adminis- tration. We must not be narrow minded or pedantic in these matters, as many are who doubt that enough parents wouldsend their children to such schools. That is the wrong kindof thinking. One must be clear that freedom from state interference in education will be the call of the future. Even if there are objections from some parents, ways and meanswill have to be found for getting children to attend schoolwithout coercion by the state. Instead of opposing the founding of independent schools because of dissenting par- ents, ways and means will have to be found of helping freeschools to come into existence despite possible oppositionor criticisms\u2014which must then be overcome in an appro- priate way. I am convinced that the founding of a world school movement is of the greatest importance for the socialdevelopment of humanity. Far and wide, it will awaken asense for a real and practical free spiritual life. Once such a mood becomes universal, there will be no need to open Wal- dorf schools tucked away in obscure corners and existing atthe mercy of governments, but governments will be forcedWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 58 into recognizing them fully and refraining from any inter- ference, as long as these schools are truly founded in a free spiritual life. What I have said so far about freedom in the cultural-spiri- tual sphere of life\u2014namely that it has to create its own formsof existence\u2014applies equally to the social sphere known by spiritual science as the sphere of economic life . Just as the sphere of cultural spiritual life must be formed on the basis of thecapacities of every individual, so too must economic life beformed on the basis of its own principles, different though these are. Fundamentally, such economic principles derive from the fact that, in economics, a judgment made by an indi-vidual cannot be translated directly into deeds, into economicactions. In the cultural-spiritual sphere, we recognize that human souls strive for wholeness, for inner harmony. T eachers and educators must take that wholeness into account. Theyapproach a child with that wholeness as their aim. In the eco-nomic sphere, on the other hand, we can be competent in a professional sense only in narrower, more specialized areas. In economics, therefore, it is only when we join together withpeople working in other areas that something fruitful may beachieved. In other words, just as free spiritual-cultural life emerged as one member of the threefold social organism, so likewise must economic life, based upon the associative princi-ple, arise as another, independent member of this same three-fold organism. In the future, economic life will be run on a basis quite different from what we are used to out of the past. Economic life today is organized entirely according to past practices, for there is no other yardstick for earnings and profits.Indeed, people are not yet ready to contemplate a change in the economic system which is still entirely motivated by profit. I would like to clarify this by an example that, though perhaps notyet representing purely and simply the economic sphere, never-Education and Practical Life 59 theless has its economic aspects. It shows how the associative principle can be put into practice in the material realm. There is, as you know, the Anthroposophical Society.8 It might well be that there are many people who are not particu-larly fond of it and regard it as sectarian, which it certainly isnot. Or they may be under the impression that it dabbles in nebulous mysticism, which again is not the case. Rather, it devotes itself to the cultivation of anthroposophical spiritual sci-ence. Many years ago, this Society founded the Philosophic-Anthroposophic Publishing Company in Berlin. T o be exact, two people who were in harmony with the Anthroposophical Society's mode of thinking founded it. 9 This publishing com- pany, however, does not work as other profit-making compa-nies, which are the offspring of modern economic thinking, do. And how do these profit-making enterprises work? They print books. This means that so and so many people have to beemployed for processing paper; so and so many compositors,printers, bookbinders; and so on. But now I ask you to look at those strange and peculiar products that make their appearance every year and which are called \"crabs\" in the book trade. Theseare newly printed books, which have not been purchased by thebook sellers and which, consequently, at the next Easter Fair wander back to the publishers to be pulped. Here we have a case where wares have been put on the market, the production ofwhich had occupied a whole host of workers, but all to no avail. 8. The Anthroposophical Society was founded on February 3, 1913. Until then, Rudolf Steiner had worked under the auspices of the German Section of the Theosophical Society. The Anthroposophical Society was refounded in 1923/24. As such, it still exists, headquartered in Dornach, Switzerland, with national societies throughout the world. For information on the Anthroposophical Society in America, write: 529 West Grant Place, Johanna M\u00fccke (1864-1949).Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 60 Such unnecessary and purposeless expenditure of labor rep- resents one important aspect of the social question. Nowadays, because one prefers to live with phrases rather than an objec- tive understanding, there is too much talk about \"unearnedincome.\" 10 It would be better to look at the situation more realistically, for similar situations arise in all branches of our external, material life. Until now, the Philosophic-Anthropo- sophic Publishing Company has not printed one single copyin vain. At most, there are a few books that were printed out ofcourtesy to our members. That was our conscious motive; they were printed as a kind of offering to those members. Other- wise there was always a demand for whatever we printed. Ourbooks always sold out quickly and nothing was printed unnec-essarily. Not a single worker's time was wasted and no useless labor was performed within the social framework. A similar situation could be achieved in the whole economic sphere ifone organized cooperation between consumers who have an understanding of needs and demands in a particular domain, traders who trade in certain products, and last, the actual pro- ducers . Consumers, traders, and producers would form an asso- ciation whose main task would be the fixing of prices. Suchassociations would have to determine their own size; if they grew too large, they would no longer be cost effective. Such associations could then unite to form larger associations. Theycould expand into what might be called global or world-eco-nomic associations\u2014for the characteristic feature of recent eco- nomics is its expansion of economies into a world economy. A great deal more would have to be said to give an adequate account of what I can indicate here only in principle. I must, 10. \"Unearned income\" is the literal translation of \"erwerbsloses Einkom- men.\" Seen in its context, Rudolf Steiner seems to refer to income from non- social activities.Education and Practical Life 61 however, say that the concept of associative life implies nothing organizational. In fact, although I come from Germany (and have lived there frequently even though my main sphere of activity is now Dornach, Switzerland) the mere word \"organi-zation\" produces a thoroughly distasteful effect in me. \"Orga-nization\" implies an ordering from above, from a center. This is something that economic life cannot tolerate. Because the Middle-European states, penned in between the West and theEast, were trying to plan their economies, they were actuallyworking against a healthy form of economic life. The associa- tive principle which must be striven for in economics leaves industry, as also industrial cooperatives, to their own devices. Itonly links them together according to levels of production andconsumption regulated by the activity of the administrators of the various associations. This is done through free agreements among single individuals or various associations. A more detailed description of this subject can be found in my book The Threefold Commonwealth , or in other of my writ- ings, such as The Renewal of the Social Organism , which is sup- plementary to The Threefold Commonwealth . Thus, in order to meet the needs of our times, anthropo- sophical spiritual science, based on practical life experience, calls for two independent members of the social organism\u2014a free spiritual life and an associative economic life. Those twoare essential in the eyes of anyone seriously and honestly con-cerned about one of the fundamental longings in the hearts of our contemporaries; namely, the longing for democracy. Dear friends, I spent the first half of my life in Austria\u2014thirty years\u2014and have seen with my own eyes what it means not totake seriously society's heartfelt demand for democracy. 11 In the 11. For an account of Rudolf Steiner's life, see his Autobiography and Stewart Easton, Rudolf Steiner: Herald of a New Epoch .Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 62 1860s, the call for parliamentarianism was heard in Austria, too. But because it could not bring about the right social conditions, this land of political experimentation was the first to go under in the last great World War. A parliament was formed. But howwas it constituted? It was composed of four assemblies: land-owners, the chamber of commerce, the department of towns, markets and industrial areas, and, finally, the assembly of coun- try parishes. In other words, only economic interests were repre-sented. There were thus four departments, each dealing withvarious aspects of the national economy. T ogether, they consti- tuted the Austrian Parliament, where they were supposed to come to decisions regarding political and legal matters as well asmatters pertaining to general affairs of the state. This means thatall decisions, reached by majority vote, represented only eco- nomic interests. Such majorities, however, can never make fruit- ful contributions to the social development of humanity. Norare they the outcome of any expert knowledge. T ruly, the call fordemocracy, for human freedom, demands honesty. At the same time, however, one must also be clear that only certain issues are suitable for parliamentary procedures, andthat democracy is appropriate only when the issues treated liewithin the areas of responsibility of each person of voting age. Thus, between free spiritual life on one side and associative economic life on the other, the sphere of democracy becomes the third member of the threefold social organism. This demo-cratic sphere represents the political sphere of rights within the social organism. Here each individual meets the other on equal terms. For instance, in such questions as the number of work-ing hours and the rights of workers in general, each person ofage must be considered competent to judge. Let us move toward a future in which questions of cultural and spiritual life are decided freely and entirely within theirown sphere, a future in which freedom in education is strivenEducation and Practical Life 63 for so that schools can work out of the spirit and, consequently, produce skillful, practical people. Then, practical schools, too, will develop from such a free spiritual life. Let us move toward a future in which spiritual life is allowed to work within its ownsphere and in which the powers of the state are limited to whatlies within the areas of responsibility of each person of voting age; a future in which economic life is structured according to the principle of associations, where judgments are made collec-tively on the strength of the various members' expertise andwhere agreements are made with others who are experts in their fields. If we approach the future with these aims in mind, we shall move toward a situation that will be very different fromwhat many people, unable to adapt themselves to new condi-tions, imagine today. There will be many who believe that a nebulous kind of cul- tural spiritual life, alienated from ordinary life, emanates fromDornach. But such is not the case at all. However absurd it maysound, according to the spirit prevailing in Dornach, no one can be a proper philosopher who does not also know how to chop wood or dig potatoes. In short, according to this spirit, one can-not be a philosopher if one cannot turn a hand to tasks requir-ing at least a modicum of practical skill. Spiritual science does not estrange people from practical life; on the contrary, it helps them develop skills in coping with life. It is not abstract. It is areality, penetrating human beings with real strength. It thereforenot only increases people's thinking activity, it also makes them generally more skillful. At the same time, spiritual science is inti- mately connected to a sense of inner dignity and morality; thatis, to morality, religion, and art. Visitors to the Goetheanum canconvince themselves of this\u2014although the building is not fin- ished yet by any means. Indeed, in order to bring it even into its present state, people with an understanding for the impulse itembodies have already made many sacrifices. The GoetheanumWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 64 is not a result of our employing the services of an architect and a builder to erect a building in a more or less conventional style\u2014 be it in Gothic, Renaissance, or any other style. The living qual- ity of the science of the spirit spoken of here could not have tol-erated that. Spiritual science had to evolve its own style inkeeping with its own nature. This manifests in the various artis- tic forms. Just as the same growth forces that produce a nut's kernel also form its shell\u2014for the shell can be formed only bythe same principle as also works in the kernel\u2014so the outershell of our building, the center of what is being willed in Dor- nach, can arise only from the same spiritual sources from which all of the teaching and researching in Dornach also flows. Thewords spoken there and the results of research conducted thereall proceed from the same sources as the artistic forms of the building's pillars and the paintings inside the cupolas. All of the sculpture, architectural design, and painting\u2014and these are notempty symbolism or allegories\u2014arise from the same spiritualimpulses that underlie all of the teaching and researching. And, because all this is part of the one cultural-spiritual life that we hope to quicken in the human being, the third, religious ele- ment, is closely linked to the arts and to science, forming a unitywith them. In other words, what we are striving for as spiritual science\u2014 as it enters into the practical spheres of life as the \"threefolding\"(or tripartition) of the social organism\u2014brings to realizationthe three great ideals that resound from the eighteenth century in such a heart-rending, spirit-awakening way. I refer to the threefold call to humanity: freedom, equality, brotherhood.Learned people in the nineteenth century pointed out repeat-edly that it was impossible for those three ideals to be put into practice simultaneously under any one state or government. Such was their considered opinion and, from their point ofview, justifiably so. But the apparent incongruity rests on falseEducation and Practical Life 65 premises. Freedom, equality, and brotherhood do resound to us from the eighteenth century as the three great and justly- claimed ideals. The source of misunderstanding is the tacit assumption that the state must be given sole prerogative inmatters pertaining to all three spheres of society. The thoughtnever occurred that, in accord with its own nature, such a monolithic state should be membered into three social organ- isms: the free spiritual organism; the organism representing the sphere of politics and rights , built on equality; and the organism of the economic sphere, built on the principle of association. Objections have been raised against these views by people who expect to be taken seriously in social questions and whomaintain that, by demanding a tripartition of society, I seek todestroy its unity. But the unity of the human organism is not destroyed because it naturally consists of three parts. Nor is the unity of the human being disturbed because the blood, as it cir-culates rhythmically through the body, is sustained by a part ofthe organism different from the one in which the nerves are centered. Likewise, the unity of the social organism is enhanced rather than disturbed by recognition of its threefold nature (ifthe human head, apart from sending forth the nerves, wouldalso have to produce the blood, then the unity of the human organism would certainly be destroyed). All of this is explained in much greater detail in my book Riddles of the Soul . 12 I would like to conclude these considerations about spiritual science and its practical application in social life by pointing out that, although the three great ideals of humanity\u2014liberty, equal- ity, fraternity\u2014are not realizable within the framework of an all-powerful state monopoly\u2014where any attempted implementa-tion would be founded upon illusion\u2014they can nevertheless penetrate human life in the form of a threefold ordering of soci- 12. Riddles of the Soul (1917); English edition, The Case for Anthroposoph y.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 66 ety. Here, the following order would prevail: full freedom in the cultural-spiritual sphere; equality in the realm where each person of voting age shares in democratic rights and responsibilities on equal terms with fellow citizens of voting age; and brotherhoodin the economic sphere which will be realized by means of theprinciple of associations. Unity will not be destroyed by this ordering, for every human being stands in all three spheres, forming a living link toward unity. Basically, one may consider the meaning of world evolution to reside in the fact that the particular ways of its working and its underlying forces culminate in the human being as the apex of the entire world organism. Just as the forces of nature and theentire cosmos\u2014the macrocosm\u2014are to be found again on aminute scale in the microcosm, in the threefold human being, so the great ideals\u2014liberty, equality, and fraternity\u2014must come together again in the social organism. But this must not bebrought about by external or abstract means: it must proceed inaccordance with reality, so that these three ideals can work in harmony with the human nature in its integral unity. As free individuals, every human being can share in the free spiritual lifeto which all belong. Sharing equal rights with our fellow citi-zens, we can all participate in the democratic life of the state, based on the principle of equality. Finally, by participating in economic life, we share in the brotherhood of all human beings. Liberty in the cultural spiritual sphere; equality in political life and the sphere of rights; fraternity in economic life. These three working together harmoniously will lead to the healing and further evolution of humanity\u2014to new resources in thestruggle against the forces of decline. A combination of these three in a genuine social organism, a concurrence of freedom, equality, and brotherhood in integral human nature\u2014this appears to be the magical password for thefuture of humanity.Knowledge of Health and Illness 67 3 Knowledge of Health and Illness in Education DORNACH \u2014 SEPTEMBER 26, 1921 The education that has arisen from the whole anthropo- sophical understanding of the world\u2014which is being put into practice in the Waldorf school in Stuttgart and other, smallerschools organized on the same principles\u2014has to be far morecomprehensive than the forms of education usual today. Above all, it has to be far more closely linked to knowledge of human beings as a whole. Once what we call anthroposophical educa-tion is properly understood, we will speak of it not so much asan objective pedagogical science or art but rather, and more importantly, as a way of understanding the whole human being. We shall speak of it in terms of the growing, unfoldingchild who is to be educated. And we shall know more aboutwhat one human being can mean to another and particularly what the teacher means to the pupil. The important relationship of one human being to another existing between teacher and pupil has suffered from the ten-dency toward specialization that has increasingly entered all work and striving in the cultural-spiritual sphere in recent times. Specialization has gone so far that it is now believed thatit is not only teachers who should influence the growing child.Since schools have to deal with the healthy or unhealthy waysWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 68 in which children develop, it is now thought that the physician too should exert an influence in school. And, in most recent times, it is even considered necessary for a qualified psycholo- gist, who has acquired specialized knowledge of the humansoul by the usual methods, to be present to advise the teachers.We thus see teachers receiving advice from medical doctors on one side and from psychologists on the other. This is nothing but an introduction of specialization into the life of the school. But if we understand correctly the close relationship that has to form between the teacher and the child who is to be edu- cated, and understand how intimately the teacher must know what is actually happening in the growing child, then we canhardly favor such superficial forms of cooperation among peo-ple who are thrown together only by outward circumstances, each understanding only one aspect of human development. We will not think it helpful that such persons should contrib-ute their advice in order to bring about an external form ofcooperation. What is emerging here, then, is but a consequence of specialization as such. Of course, those who believe that the human soul has only an external relationship to the physical,bodily organism might believe that it is the teacher's task to dealonly with the child's soul and that the doctor is there to give advice regarding the physical aspect of education. It goes without saying that, though I shall speak of the importance of the teacher's knowledge of health and illness ineducation, I am not referring to acute or chronic illnesses in pupils. Naturally, medical treatment in such cases lies outside t h e p r o v i n c e o f e d u c a t i o n . I n w h a t f o l l o w s , t h e r e f o r e , I s h a l lconfine myself to what belongs to the general field of educa-tion. I must here state clearly that, if people believe that the doctor, as a specialist, must assist the teachers in matters of hygiene in a school, then they are encouraging a tendency toonesidedness in the principles and the practice of education:Knowledge of Health and Illness 69 they are separating and alienating from each other two sides of what constitute a natural whole in childhood\u2014children's souls and spirits on one hand and their physical-bodily nature on the other. Depending in this way on the help of specialists\u2014leaving physical questions in the hands of the specialists\u2014drives edu- cational theory and practice into abstraction. Confirming this tendency, matters have now gone so far that great surprise isshown in many quarters when one fails to conform one's peda-gogy and actual teaching to the usual abstract rules and regula- tions, but rather adapts them to conform to the totality of the human being, which naturally also includes the physicalaspects. This aberration, as I may call it, is due to the fact thatscience nowadays no longer has any clear understanding of the relationship of soul and spirit to the physical-bodily aspect\u2014if s c i e n c e s p e a k s o f s o u l a n d s p i r i t a s h a v i n g a n y i n d e p e n d e n texistence at all. Clear evidence of this is shown by contemporary psychol- ogy's frequent references to a \"psycho-physical parallelism.\" Psychologists feel that they must speak about human soul andspirit; but they also feel it necessary to speak about the physicalaspects of the human being. However, since they no longer rec- ognize the living interplay between soul and spirit and body, they speak of \"parallelism\"\u2014as if there were spiritual phenom-ena on one side and, beside them, physical and bodily phe-nomena on the other, the two running side by side. But the way in which those two interact and interweave is naturally altogether neglected. This external way of looking at the relationship between soul-spiritual and bodily aspects of the human being has slowly colored the theory and practice of education. Here one thing must be made clear. This is something that I can describe onlyby referring to anthroposophy in general. I refer to the fact thatWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 70 i f w e s p e a k o f t h e b o d i l y , p h y s i c a l a s p e c t o f a l i v i n g h u m a n being as contemporary physiology and biology do, then we are speaking about something that, in reality, does not exist in the form in which we are speaking of it\u2014because the entire physi-cal part of a human being is a result, a synthesis of the soul andspiritual aspects. Furthermore, if we speak about soul and spirit in the abstract, we are not speaking about something real either. Souland spirit live in the living human being where they permeate,build up, and shape the physical body. This means that it is not possible to speak of the relationship of soul and spirit to the physical body in general terms. Once we can see soul and spiritin their configuration\u2014not merely in the abstract, but as theyare inwardly structured\u2014we know that every detail of soul and spirit is related in a specific way to every detail of our bodily and physical nature. If, for example, we observe the process ofseeing, we find its physical and bodily location isolated in thehuman head, and can study the process of seeing by studying its localized organs in the head. But we find a different situa- tion if we study the process of hearing. T o study hearing, wemust also study the rhythmic system. In fact, to understand theprocess of hearing, we must begin with the process of breath- ing. One cannot study hearing as if its seat were localized, iso- lated, in the head, as is often done in today's abstractphysiology. The same principle holds good for the whole ofphysiology. We must relate soul and spirit to definite organic systems when we study them. This means that a real under- standing of soul and spirit is quite impossible without knowl-edge of the bodily and physical nature and vice versa.Comprehensive knowledge of physical nature is knowledge of soul and spirit. Although from the present-day perspective what is soul\u00a6-spiritual and what is physical appear to part com-pany, at most running parallel to each other, we must strive forKnowledge of Health and Illness 71 a way of knowing that unites the soul-spiritual and physical- bodily natures in the living human being. Members of this audience who have come to listen to these lectures because of their interest in anthroposophy know thathere we do not speak of soul and spirit abstractly or theoreti-cally. They know that in anthroposophy, knowledge of soul and spirit is truly experienced and fully and intimately interwo- ven with knowledge of the physical-bodily aspects. Now, once we consider the bodily and physical aspects of the human being, we are immediately faced with the question of the relationship of health and illnesses. Extreme cases of illness, as I said, certainly do not belong to the field of education. Yetthe manifold tendencies toward illness to be found in 1,001different ways in a so-called healthy human being constitutes an area that ought to be known thoroughly by those who wish to become educators. This is an extremely important area ofpedagogical knowledge. In order to make clear what I mean, letme refer to a very important concept in Goethe's world-view. 1 In his theory of metamorphosis, Goethe tried to gain an understanding of organic life. And his achievements in the fieldof metamorphosis will certainly find greater and more unpreju-diced approval in the future than has been the case so far, because present trends in science have often gone in the direc- tion opposite to Goethe's approach. T o take the simplest exam-ple, Goethe observed how , when leaf upon leaf develops alongthe stem of a plant, each successive leaf, which shows a different 1. For Rudolf Steiner on Goethe, see, among others: Goethean Science (Spring Valley, New York: Mercury Press, 1988), Science of Knowing (The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception) (Spring Val-ley, New York: Mercury Press, 1988), Goethe's World View (Spring Valley, New York: Mercury Press, 1985), and Nature's Open Secret: Rudolf Steiner and Goethe 's Participatory Science New York: Anthro- posophic Press, forthcoming).Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 72 shape from the leaf below, is in fact nothing but a metamorpho- sis of the lower leaf. According to Goethe, the separate organs of the plant\u2014the simpler, lower leaves, then the more complicated leaves on the stem, followed by the sepals which again areshaped quite differently from the leaves, and the petals whichhave even a different color from that of the leaves on the stem\u2014 all differ outwardly in form but inwardly follow the same under- lying pattern. In other words, an identical idea assumes mani-fold forms and designs in outer appearance. This insight allowed Goethe to see the whole plant in the leaf and, likewise, only complex variations of a single leaf in the whole plant. For Goethe, each leaf is a whole plant. The idea ofthe plant, the type of the plant\u2014the archetypal plant\u2014assumes a definite form in outward physical appearance; it becomes simplified, and so on. Goethe said that, when it pro- duces a leaf, the stem really wants to grow a whole plant. Theinherent tendency to do this definitely exists, but the force thatcould produce a plant develops only to a limited degree; it is held back in the leaf. And, in the next leaf, it unfolds again only to a limited degree, and so on. In each leaf, a whole plantwants to unfold\u2014the formative force strives to become a wholeplant\u2014but, in each case, only a fragment of a plant comes into existence. Yet the whole plant exists. It is a reality. And this invisible whole plant holds together in harmony what strives tobecome many different plants. Every plant wants to becomemany plants but does not succeed, developing only a limited formation, an organ. And every organ really wants to become an entire plant with the task of balancing the various individ-ual, fragmentary formations for the sake of a greater harmony.This picture of metamorphosis shows us a force working devel- opmentally in each individual organ, while limiting each organ's developmental growth and integrating the individualorgans to form the overall whole of the complete plant.Knowledge of Health and Illness 73 Now, Goethe was never interested in formulating abstract concepts. He did not, for instance, coin an abstract concept such as, \"one sees single, fragmentary plants wanting to develop and the unifying plant that holds them all together.\" Thatwould be an abstraction. Goethe wants to know how the plant-forming force works . He wants to learn what it is that shapes itself in this way and, above all, what holds itself back in a sin- gle leaf. He wants to get a clear picture of this; he does notwant to remain with only a concept. He wants to reach a livingpicture. Hence, what he called the \"malformations\" or \"mon- strosities\" of a plant assumed great importance for him\u2014such as when, on a definite part of a plant where one would expectto find a leaf, there is no leaf but the stem instead thickens anda malformation occurs; or when a blossom, instead of rounding itself off into petals, grows slim; and so on. Goethe concluded that, where malformations occur in a plant, the plant-forming force reveals outwardly what it wasmeant to hold back. Where a leaf shows a malformation, that force was not held back but shot directly into the leaf. From this, Goethe realized that, when a malformation occurs, some-thing that really belongs to the spiritual realm becomes physi-cal. We see something become visible that was meant to be held back as a growth force. Hence, there is material for study in malformations, for malformations allow us to see what isactive in the plant. Where such malformations do not occur,something is restrained that reveals itself later in the subsequent leaves or the other organs that follow. For Goethe, then, malformations assume a special signifi- cance, extending to the study of the whole organism. In thissense, we are following in Goethe's footsteps when we consider, for instance, a hydrocephalic child, suffering from dropsy of the brain. Here, we have a malformation. Goethe would say, \"Ifrightly studied, this malformation shows me something thatWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 74 exists as a tendency in every child's head but is normally held back within the spiritual sphere. Therefore, if such a malforma- tion occurs, I can conclude that something is revealed there in the physical, sense-perceptible world that really belongs rightlyto the soul-spiritual realm.\" If we now look at a human being or an animal, we find not only such outwardly perceptible malformations but also ill- nesses or at least tendencies toward illnesses. According toGoethe's view, each illness reveals something living in eachhuman being that develops onesidedly\u2014like a malformation\u2014 while it ought to be held back within the entire organic system. Instead of remaining within the spiritual sphere, it strikesthrough into an external manifestation. We can say that, if wedetect a tendency toward a certain illness somewhere, that very tendency reveals something of special significance regarding the human organization. Hence, when we understand illnesses, wer e a l l y h a v e a c h a n c e t o s t u d y t h e h u m a n s p i r i t b y m e a n s o fthem, just as Goethe studied malformations to understand plant types and the archetypal plant. It is of greatest signifi- cance to be able to look at the more subtle weaknesses in eachchild, those subtle tendencies that do not deteriorate into grossillnesses but manifest as predispositions toward one or the other extreme, becoming illnesses there. This is a kind of outer indication of what is at work in every healthy human being.We could almost say that there is a hidden hydrocephaloid inevery child. We must be able therefore to study hydrocephalic children in order to discover how to treat what has worked (like a malformation) too far into the physical sphere from the soulspiritual sphere in which it belongs. Naturally, this is some-thing that must be treated with great scientific delicacy; it is not something to be coarsely interpreted. Considerable tact and careful, precise, scientific discrimination are needed here.For we are dealing with something at work in human beings,Knowledge of Health and Illness 75 manifesting in this case as an illness but which, if it remains in its own proper inner sphere, belongs with children's normal developmental forces. Since a child undergoes a constant process of growth and has tendencies toward all kinds of illness, you yourselves will beable to appreciate how, with the necessary knowledge of where those tendencies might lead, we can also become capable of harmonizing them, of calling forth counterforces when there isa danger of a child's falling into imbalance. There is another point to be considered. Usually, when peo- ple talk of the theory and the practice of education, they feel that they must uphold an ideal that they can then elaborate ingreat theoretical detail. This approach, however, can lead torigid forms and fixed claims. When one has to deal with peda- gogical questions and when, as I was for instance, one is asked to guide the Waldorf school, a thought strikes one again andagain. On the whole, audiences like to hear talks about educa-tion which seem to make sense to them. People like such talks. And, indeed, anyone who is scrupulously honest\u2014and anthro- posophy must always be scrupulously honest\u2014can't help feel-ing: \"There certainly is a need for our new education.\" Andpeople, hearing about it, come and say, \"This is wonderful. If only we could have gone to a school like the Waldorf school!\" But, so often, the very people who want to pioneer education-ally in this new way are the very ones who had to go throughthe worst forms of education themselves. They may have had to put up with the worst, most corrupt forms of education in their own schooling. And yet, in spite of their negative experi-ences, they are able to call for improved educational systems.Then the idea might strike one: does one really have the right to plan and think out, right down to specific details, how chil- dren should be educated? Would it not be better by far to letthem grow up wild, as many biographies testify, telling us ofWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 76 persons who were not pressed into any particular educational mold, but nevertheless matured into most capable and respon- sible people? Do we not sin against the growing child if we present a pedagogical system that has been worked out down tothe finest detail? You see how you have to weigh everything in your mind, and, if you do so, how you will find your way into the kind of education that talks less about how various details should bedealt with and is concerned primarily with giving the teachersthe means of gaining the intimate relationship to the child of which I have spoken. T o achieve this, something else is needed. When we receive a child into our school, we are expected to teach and train theyoungster. We introduce all kinds of activities, such as writing, reading, and arithmetic, but really we are assaulting the child's nature. Suppose that we are to give reading lessons. If taught inthe traditional way, they are certainly onesided, for we make noappeal to the child's whole being. Essentially, we are actually cultivating a malformation, even a predisposition toward ill- ness. And, when teaching writing, we are cultivating a ten-d e n c y t o w a r d i l l n e s s i n a n o t h e r d i r e c t i o n . I n t e a c h i n g y o u n gchildren, we are making assaults on them all of the time, even if this is not always evident because the illness lies hidden and dormant. Nevertheless, we have to make continual attacksupon the children. At our stage of civilization there is no otherway . But we must find ways and means of making amends for those continual assaults on our children's health. We must be clear that arithmetic represents a malformation, writing a sec-ond malformation, and reading a third malformation, not tospeak of history or geography! There is no end to it and it leads us into a real quandary. T o balance out those malformations, we must constantly provide what will make good the damage;we must harmonize what has been disturbed in the child. It isKnowledge of Health and Illness 77 most important to be aware of the fact that, on one hand, we must teach children various subjects but that, on the other, we must ensure that, when we do so, we are not hurting them. The right method in education therefore asks: How do I healthe child from the attacks which I continually inflict? Aware-ness of this must be present in every right form of education. But this awareness is possible only if we have insight into the whole human organization and really understand the condi-tions of that organization. We can be proper teachers and edu-cators only if we can grasp the principle of the inflicting of malformations and their subsequent harmonization. For we can then face a child with the assurance that, whatever we aredoing when teaching a subject and thereby attacking one orother organic system, we can always find ways and means of balancing the ill effects of leading the child into onesidedness. This is one realistic principle and method in our education that teachers can use and that will make them into people whoknow and understand human nature. Teachers, if they are able to know the human being as a whole, including the inherent tendencies toward health and illness, can gradually develop thisability. Here something arises that contemporary, more materialist medicine might well consider to lie outside its province. How- ever, it immediately gains in importance as soon as we look atgrowing human beings from the point of view of predisposi-tion toward illness, or\u2014if I make this remark somewhat pre- maturely\u2014of a predisposition toward health. For then it flows into our educational philosophy of the human being. T oday, health and illness are considered polar opposites: a person is either healthy or ill. But, if we go to the root of the matter, the actual situation is not that at all. Health and illness do not represent opposing poles, for the opposite of illness issomething quite different from health. Everyone has a clearWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 78 idea of illness. Naturally, it is only an abstract and general con- cept for, actually, we have to do only with particular cases of illness and ultimately, in fact, only with the individual who is ill. However, we could certainly gain an idea of what illness isif we started from the perspective of malformation and gradu-ally reached a picture of how such malformations came about, at first less noticeably, in an animal or human organism. What occurs in the case of illness is that a single organ, or organicsystem, no longer operates within the overall general organiza-tion but assumes a separate role. This has a complement in the case of a single organ completely merging into the total orga- nization. Let us consider this in the light of Goethe's principle. Instead of a healthy leaf growing at a certain point, assume that a mal- formation occurs. But something else could also happen; namely, that the plant, instead of shooting into an individualorgan, develops rather in the direction of the general, underly-ing tendency that really ought to remain in the spiritual sphere. In that case, the effect is that the single organ, instead of assuming its normal position within the organic whole, dis-perses its forces into the entire organism. The organ does notsufficiently predominate in the physical realm and conse- quently the whole thing becomes too spiritual, becomes too spiritualized, and the spiritual permeates the physical toostrongly. This is a possibility. The situation, however, can alsodegenerate in a direction opposite to illness. The opposite polarity of illness consists in the single organ being sucked up, as it were, by the general organism. In human beings this issomething that creates a feeling of well-being and sensual bliss.F r o m t h i s p o i n t o f v i e w , t h e o p p o s i t e o f i l l n e s s i s w h a t w e might call the ensuing overabundant bliss. Consider the same thing from the perspective of language. If you form a verb from the adjective \"sick,\" you get the verb \"toKnowledge of Health and Illness 79 sicken\" [German kranken = to hurt someone's feelings]. If you take an adjective and a verb expressing the polar opposite [of kranken ], you get \"pleasant\" and the verb, \"to please\". Between these two extremes\u2014of feeling ill, or pained and the feeling ofwell-being or organic bliss\u2014a healthy human being must holdthe balance. That is what health really is: holding the balance. This assumes special significance when we face a growing child. In what condition is the growing child whom we have toteach? Let us take a child who attends primary school; that is,between the change of teeth and puberty. What is the signifi- cance of the change of teeth? I have already described its significance in one of the \"aca- demic courses\" held here in Dornach: 2 namely, certain forces of growth saturate and form the child's organism until the sec- ond teeth appear. During the first seven years of childhood, the forces that are active in the child's organism, forming its physi-cal body, behave in a way similar to latent heat when it changesinto outwardly perceptible, liberated heat. I showed how what works into the human sphere of soul and spirit as an organizing principle in the physical body is transmuted into human souland spirit in their own indigenous realm. Once the secondteeth have developed, a child no longer needs the forces of growth that have been active previously in the inner organism. With the change of teeth, those forces are liberated, trans-formed into forces of soul and spirit, and find a healthy lifethrough what we can do when we, as teachers, receive the child into our care. T o put it schematically, we may say that the young child's physical organism is imbued with a force that organizes itstructurally. When the child sheds its milk teeth and reaches 2. \"Hochschulkurse\"\u2014Academic Courses: October 1920 and April 1921 (Collected Works/GA 76).Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 80 school age, that force comes to a natural completion and what had been working previously in the child's physical organism becomes liberated and reappears metamorphosed in the realm o f s o u l a n d s p i r i t a s f o r c e s o f i d e a t i o n , m e m o r y , a n d s o o n .Once teachers recognize that what they engage in primary edu-cation is \"liberated soul forces\"\u2014comparable to liberated heat\u2014they can begin to understand the inner relationship of soul and spirit with the bodily-physical nature in a new way.That is, for example, whereas these soul forces were previouslyoccupied in the physical body, they are now at our disposal. We can use them to meet the educational demands of contempo- rary culture. For, after all, we cannot and must not ignore thecultural conditions of our time. Hence, at this stage we approach the child knowing that, as we receive him or her into our school, something of a soul and spiritual nature is withdrawing from the physical sheaths. Weknow that a part of this organizing force gradually transformsitself into soul and spirit. And yet, to a certain extent, through- out this transition, this organizing force retains its previous manner of working in the physical body\u2014for the part that isliberated is still accustomed to working in accordance withphysical forms. We are not doing the child any good, therefore, if we teach it something totally alien to its nature. We do this, for example, if we begin by teaching the letters of the alphabet.These, in themselves, are alien to the child and, besides, haveundergone many changes since the days of pictorial writing. That is why, in the Waldorf school, we introduce writing on an entirely artistic basis. We do not teach children writingdirectly, but let them draw and paint fundamental forms sothat, through those drawn forms, they can externalize what has been released during the change of teeth. When children move their hands and fingers in drawing and painting, we find thatwhat was weaving in the soul realm is now projected into theKnowledge of Health and Illness 81 whole human being in accordance with the form of the body. By our bringing the child's hands and fingers into movement in this way, what had been working previously in the soul realm as an organizing principle can continue its activity. In this way, we become conscious of what we are really deal- ing with. We are dealing with the fact that, from birth to the change of teeth, a child's body is still deeply permeated by soul-spiritual forces that, later, free themselves from the physi-cal. Once the soul-spiritual nature withdraws, the physicalaspect develops more onesidedly. Indeed, as far as the physical a s p e c t i s c o n c e r n e d , w e h a v e h e r e a p r o c e s s s i m i l a r t o t h o s e malformations in which the entire plant force shoots into asingle organ. In the case of malformations, the result is simplya malformation. In a human being, the normal course of events is that, at the time of the change of teeth, the physical body becomes sepa-rated from the soul-spiritual aspect. When the teeth change,therefore, we are actually dealing with the beginning of pro- cesses that, if they were allowed free development in a onesided way, would become processes of illness. This explains the causeof some illnesses that often accompany the change of teeth. Wecan now recognize their origin. It is possible to look into the child's organism with absolute clarity when the milk teeth are being shed. If one does so, one will see that, when the soul andphysical natures separate, the physical body tends to becomeonesided and harden. One can see how the same forces are at work within their higher, normal limits. Should they prolifer- ate, they would lead to processes of illness. In normal processes,there are always subtle ones present that can lead to illness ifthe separating tendencies are allowed free rein. We may there- fore say that when a child acquires second teeth, it is at the threshold of illness. The more we as teachers engage the liber-ated forces of the child's soul and spirit\u2014in anthroposophicalWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 82 terminology we call them etheric forces \u2014the greater the healing effect. 3 This is so as long as the activities are suited to the child's physical nature. By teaching in an artistic way, we have to re-unite a child's soul and spirit harmoniously with itsbodily-physical nature. We must be able to recognize the ten-dencies toward illness and health in the child's body, for we must make that body into a fit instrument for what is evolving in the child. Let us now look at the other end of the primary school, at puberty. There, we find exactly the opposite situation. Whereas, during the second dentition, the soul-spiritual with- draws from the child's organism, becoming liberated from andabandoning the physical body, during puberty the soul-spiri-tual nature, which has meanwhile developed, longs to return to the physical body, to permeate and impregnate it. During puberty, there is a submerging of the soul-spiritual nature intothe physical body. The body is being saturated and thoroughlypermeated by the soul and spirit nature, which works instinc- tively. It is the reverse process, moving in the direction opposite to that of a state of illness; that is, it tends towards inner well-being and, we might say, a feeling of gratification. While teach-ing the child during the years of primary education, we must continually maintain a balance between what is striving toward the soul-spiritual becoming liberated at the beginning of thesecond dentition and what is instinctively streaming back fromthe soul-spiritual sphere into the physical body at puberty. The teacher must always strive toward equilibrium in the child dur- ing the coming and going that take place during the wholeperiod between seven and fourteen. 3. On \"etheric forces,\" see Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy , and T oward a Phenomenology of the Etheric World (Spring Valley, New York: Anthroposophic Press, 1985).Knowledge of Health and Illness 83 This becomes a particularly important and absorbing task for the teacher between the child's ninth and tenth years. Because the two streams of forces meet at the half-way stage, the child is then in a condition in which it can develop in allpossible directions. Much depends on whether the teacher, asthe guide, says the right words to the child, choosing the right moment between the ninth and tenth years, or whether he or she misses this unique moment. Much of great significance forthe child's entire life depends on whether the teacher knowshow to meet this challenge between the ninth and tenth years. Only if one understands the mutual interplay between soul and spirit and the physical body can one really understand theessence of childhood at this age and know how to deal with thechild. One cannot talk about education at all without grasping these rising and falling processes, which are onesided only if we s e p a r a t e t h e m i n t o s o u l a n d s p i r i t o n o n e h a n d a n d b o d i l y -physical on the other. In reality, they constantly interweave andinterpenetrate. We understand the child rightly only if we can see this flowing together of soul-spiritual and bodily-physical as a single unified, coherent process. What, then, is our task as teachers after the onset of the sec- on d de nt it io n? W e m u s t c on ti nu a lly ma ke s u r e t ha t t h e s o ul and spiritual forces that become liberated are employed in accordance with true human growth and development. In away , we must \"copy\" the forces that want to leave the physicalorganism; we must copy them in the realm of the soul and the spirit in order that, by this means, they can find their right place in human growth and development. In other words, wemust know the child and teach in a way that activates the innerharmony of the child's whole being. We must draw everything out of the child's inner nature. As teachers, when pupils approach puberty, we must look for the essence of their being in their letting their soul-spiritualWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 84 nature submerge into their physical nature. Indeed, our adoles- cents will develop abnormally if we do not recognize that we must fill their souls and spirits that are submerging into their physical being with an interest for the whole world. If we do notdo this, they will become inwardly excitable, nervous, or neur-asthenic (not to speak of other abnormalities). As teachers, we must direct our pupils' interests to the affairs of the wide world, so that our young people can take into their bodily being asmuch as possible of what links them to the outer world. When achild first enters school, we must kno w what is striving to be liberated so that we can work on it, but, at the stage of adoles- cence, we must become \"people of the world\" in order to knowwhat can interest our adolescent students. By so doing, we canensure a healthy descent of our teenagers' souls and spirits, which are about to become submerged in their physical bodies. That will prevent their becoming too strongly absorbed in theflesh and they therefore will not lose themselves narcissisticallyin pleasure. We should aim at helping them to become persons who live in the world and who are able to become free from too much self-interest. Otherwise, they will become trapped in ego-tism. We must help them toward a true and harmonious rela-tionship with the world. These are the kind of things that can show how a method of education arising from a consideration of the whole humanbeing must proceed. Naturally, I could give only brief indica-tions here. It can be quite painful to hear, in response to one's talking to educationalists and teachers\u2014as happened to me recently\u2014\"How strange to hear that medical knowledge alsohappens to be a part of teaching.\" These medical aspects do not\"happen\" to belong to education; they are an absolutely essen- tial ingredient. Without medical awareness, a healthy pedagogy is unthinkable, for it would become lost in empty abstractions,which are useless when one really has to deal with children.Knowledge of Health and Illness 85 We know the spirit only if we knows how it works into mat- ter. Spiritual science therefore does not lead into a nebulous \"cloud cuckoo-land\" but to real insights into the material aspects of life. Those who seek to escape from matter will findno entry into the spirit, but those who recognize the power ofthe spirit and how it manifests in matter will. This is the only basis for a healthy theory and practice of education. If people would only see how anthroposophical spiritual science seeks towork everywhere in a realistic way and how it is remote from allunhealthy pursuits such as proliferate today in various kinds of mysticism, spiritualism and the like\u2014if people would only rec- ognize how real knowledge of the spirit is a reality and at thesame time true knowledge of matter\u2014then they would be ableto judge the anthroposophical approach in a healthier manner. For, after all, and one must repeat it, natural science has cele- brated its great triumphs in modern times; it has cultivatedgreat and important results for human development. But suchscience, in reality, is like a study of the human body without a soul or a spirit. Just as the human body makes sense only if the soul is seen as part of it, so natural science is comprehensiveonly when it is complemented by a science of the spirit. If one does not know very much about spiritual science, one might not be in a position either to accept or to criticize this statement. Yet, if a person studies specific \"chapters\" of this sci-ence, he or she will come to realize its mission more and more.Especially in the field of education we can see how spiritual sci- ence, arriving at universal concepts, gives teachers what they need in school with regard to knowledge of tendencies towardhealth and sickness. Spiritual science overcomes specialization,fragmentation, and gives teachers what they need to use knowl- edge of health and illness when they teach children at school. If a doctor had to stand beside the teacher, their cooperationcould only be external. A healthy situation is possible onlyWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 86 when teachers let their knowledge of health and illness perme- ate their entire teaching. Such a thing, however, is possible only if a living science, as striven for by anthroposophy, includes knowledge of healthy and sick human beings. How often have I emphasized that anthroposophical spiritual science addresses itself to the whole human being! In anthropos- ophy, the whole human being enters into a relationship to what a specific branch of spiritual science can contribute. If teachersare introduced to both healthy and sick development of chil-dren in a living way, if they can harmonize those two aspects of child development, then their own feeling life will at once be motivated. They will face each individual child with his or herspecific gifts as a whole human being. Even if teachers teachwriting in an artistic way, they can still be guiding their children in a onesided way that comes very close to malformation. But, at the same time, they also stand there as whole human beings,who have a rapport with their children's whole beings and, inthis capacity, as whole human beings, they themselves can be the counterforce to such onesidedness. If, as a teacher who has a living relationship with everything that has to do with the human being, I must lead the child in a onesided way when I teach reading or writing, then I must go about it in such a way that, precisely through leading the child into onesidedness, I at the same time bring about an inner har-monization of the child's being. The teacher who always has towork toward the wholeness of all things must stand there as a whole person, whatever subject is taught. There are two things that must always be present in education. On one hand, thegoal of each particular subject and, on the other, the 1,001imponderables which work intimately between one human being and another. If teachers are steeped in knowledge of the human being and the world\u2014and if their knowledge begins tolive in them when they face their children\u2014we have a situationKnowledge of Health and Illness 87 similar to that of the plant. As the entire formative force shoots into a single organ in a plant, only to withdraw again in the right way and shoot into another organ, so the teacher holds this totality, this unifying force, in his or her own being, whileguiding the child from stage to stage. Spiritual science can stimulate this way of guiding the child, for spiritual science is related to all branches of outer, natural science in the same way as the soul is related to the humanbody. And, as, according to the old saying, a healthy soul is tobe found in a healthy body, so, too, in and through a healthy science of nature there should be found a healthy science of the spirit, a healthy anthroposophy. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS QUESTIONER I: Gifted educators and teachers have an instinctive feeling forwhat needs to be done with a child upon reaching school age,both in and out of school. But it is not clear to me what the relationship of anthroposophically-based education is toward such instinctive responses to children. I would therefore like toask whether such pedagogical instincts are frowned on in theWaldorf school or whether, in fact, they have their place within the framework of anthroposophical pedagogy. QUESTIONER II: I would like to ask how we are to understand children's illnesses as you have spoken of them. By \"illness,\" do you mean a condi-tion that orthodox medicine would call a state of illness, or an abnormality of the child's physical constitution, or perhaps ill humor, grumpiness, or similar disturbances?Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 88 RUDOLF STEINER: Regarding the relationship between pedagogical instincts and what I said today, I would like to make the following observa- tions. In general, the two approaches need not be consideredcontradictory, but one must be clear about the whole process ofhuman evolution. The farther back we go in human evolution, the more consciousness decreases, until we come to what corre- sponds to the entirely instinctive mode of behavior of the ani-mal world. The natural course of development in humanevolution is a gradual lessening of instinctual life and a gradual supplementing of instinctive behavior by a healthy, conscious grasp of life's realities. We can see how important it is to bringabout this transformation in the right way when we observehow, precisely in our times, previously healthy instincts have to a large extent fallen into disorder. For instance, while we can see quite clearly that children living in the country will grow upharmoniously even without a great deal of schooling, we cana l s o s e e c l e a r l y t h a t i f w e l e t c i t y c h i l d r e n d e p e n d o n t h e i r instincts or\u2014as has happened\u2014if we seek to guide those instincts according to current pedagogical ideas, we can cause agreat deal of harm. Unless, therefore, guided by our inner being,we are moved once more in a safe direction, we will not be able to foster wholesome and healthy conditions simply by calling abstractly for more instinctive ways of living\u2014ways of livingthat in fact must today be replaced by powers of reasoning andintellect. Certainly, instinctive life still plays its part, but it ismore and more on the wane. T o give a striking example, I can recall something that once happened in my presence. This is the kind of situation oftenencountered nowadays. It certainly took me by surprise. I wasinvited by a good friend whom, from earlier days of friendship, I knew to be quite a healthy eater\u2014a person who also knew when to stop eating. Once, after an interval of several years, IKnowledge of Health and Illness 89 was invited to his house again. And there, on the table, to my great surprise, I saw a pair of scales, complete with weights, on which he weighed every piece of food that he ate. This was surely clear evidence that, in his case at least, healthy instinctshad greatly decreased! S i m i l a r s y m p t o m s c a n a l s o b e o b s e r v e d i n o t h e r l i f e s i t u a - tions\u2014for instance, if one studies the current curricula in our schools. We do not find in our schools the kind of teachingmaterial that, if healthy instincts were working, would be foundappropriate for, say, children in their eighth or ninth year. The curriculum is handled there according to quite different crite- ria\u2014such as abstract rules regarding human and nonhumanmatters. But curriculum\u2014how we plan and work out our waysof education today\u2014has a grave consequence for our children's health. We must find our way back to a concrete grasp of the interweaving of health-giving and illness-inducing tendenciesin the human being. What I mean by health-giving or illness-inducing will become clear in a moment. Words, such as \"ill-humor\" and \"grumpiness\" were men- tioned in this regard. Such words land us immediately amidabstractions. This is certainly not what I mean, for we wouldthen be judging a child's whole soul being abstractly. This is the very thing that a healthy, anthroposophically-based education must overcome. An anthroposophically-based education wouldmake us realize, for example, that when a child suffers frommood disturbances, we are to watch for irregular glandular secretions. The glandular secretions are of far greater signifi- cance to us than the outer symptoms of ill humor, which willdisappear when we tackle the problem at the source; that is, inthe child's physical organism. What we must do is to look far more deeply into the whole relationship between the child's soul and spirit on one side and its physical and bodily existenceon the other.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 90 As educators dealing with children, teachers are naturally dealing only with inherent tendencies, with nascent states of unhealthy conditions. T eachers deal with subtle, rather than cruder, symptoms. And when such symptoms become patho-logical, they must be dealt with appropriately. I think it clearfrom what I have said that, in education, we deal with tenden- cies toward extremes and with finding ways and means of bal- ancing them. QUESTIONER: We have heard that, during puberty, the adolescent is to bebrought into contact with the affairs of the world and awayfrom his or her individual spiritual self. What does this meanin concrete terms? What are the teachers supposed to do about it? RUDOLF STEINER: I did not say \"away from his or her spiritual self.\" I weigh my words carefully and what I say surely has a clear meaning. I didnot say \"away from his or her spiritual self\" but simply awayfrom himself or herself; that is, adolescents must be prevented from pressing the spiritual element too strongly into their inner being and thereby experiencing a kind of inner pleasure. At theonset of puberty, we must try to awaken the students' interestfor what is happening in the world. This is a fundamentalobjective in our curriculum for adolescents. We must awaken a particular interest in such subjects as geography and history\u2014 subjects that lead students away from themselves and out intothe world. Adolescents need subjects that, because they aretotally unconnected with any form of inner brooding, will counteract any too strong preoccupation that they might have with their inner life. It all depends on working out an appropri-ate curriculum in concrete detail.Knowledge of Health and Illness 91 RUDOLF STEINER: (in answer to a further question): I have already indicated that teachers preparing their lessons should seek to work with theirpupils' natural and healthy forces of organic growth. If we knowhow to study the healthy growth of the human organism, we also know that implicit in different physical forms is a constant inner striving toward movement. For instance, if we look at thehuman hand without preconceptions, we can see that its formreally makes little sense in the state of rest. Each finger is living proof of the hand's inherent desire to move. And, conversely, such latent movement also seeks an appropriate form for thestate of rest. This is an indication of something that is outwardlyapparent. But such organismic tendencies can also be followed into the innermost organization of the human being. So that, if I am familiar with living anatomy, living physiology, then I alsoknow what harmonizes with inner potentialities in the realm ofmovement. From this point of view, it certainly does not correspond to the nature of children when a teacher makes a child scratch acopper-plate Gothic style letter \"a\" as is popular today. This is aform for which there is really no justification. There is no inner connection between the way the fingers want to move and the form of the letter that finally evolves after having gone throughmany intermediary stages. During earlier phases of human evolution, quite different signs were painted to represent a form of writing which was still in harmony with the human organization. T oday, theforms of our conventional letters no longer have any directrelation to the inner organization of human beings and that is why we must draw out of the child what is akin to its inner organization before introducing it to the present form of ouralphabet. But, if you bring this to the attention of educationalauthorities, they become quite alarmed, wondering how onWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 92 earth they are to know what the human organism is demand- ing, how they could possibly expect teaching to be done in an artistic style when pupils are aged six, and so on (this may be rather different in the case of practicing teachers who are oftenvery open to these ideas because they can see new perspectivesbeing opened up by them). There is but one answer to all this\u2014one must learn to do it! It is something that must be brought to the notice of anyoneinterested in education. It is not the task of anthroposophy tospread an abstract conception of the world that might satisfy people who like to rehash what they have heard, or who enjoy telling themselves what they must do for their own advance-ment. Anthroposophy is broadly based and has many ramifica-tions that can lead us to the most intimate knowledge of human nature. One can truly say that anthroposophy offers an opportunity of fructifying the various sciences, especially inareas that, today, are not generally accessible to them. And so we can say that we have to get to know the human being thoroughly so that, when we receive the child into pri- mary education, we know from its whole organism how itshould move its fingers and hands when learning to write, andalso how it should learn to think. The other day, I had the opportunity to take a visitor into a first grade writing and reading lesson. This subject can betaught in a hundred different ways. In the Waldorf school,teachers are given absolute freedom in their application of basic principles. Education is an altogether free art. The subjects might remain the same, but teachers may present their contentin their own individual ways and according to the specific char-acter of their pupils. People sometimes cannot see how these two aspects are related to each other. How was this lesson given after the young pupils had been in the first grade for only a few months? A child was called outKnowledge of Health and Illness 93 and told to run in a circle in a given number of steps. Immedi- ately afterward, the teacher drew a circle on the blackboard to show how the movement experienced by the child while run- ning looked when seen with the eyes. Then, a second child was called out and asked to run in a much smaller circle inside the first circle, using only two steps. A third child had to run yet another circle, this time using three steps. All of the children were thoroughly involved inwhat was going on and they transposed what they had experi-enced with their whole being into what became visible on the blackboard. Their interest was directed not only to what the eye could see, but to what they experienced with their wholebeing. So there were three circles. When yet another one wasrun, the children noticed that, because of the size, the fourth circle intersected the smaller ones within the first large circle. And so it went on. This is how children were given the oppor-tunity of gaining an experience out of their whole being thatthey could then transfer to the visual sphere. If, on the other hand, children are told to draw forms immediately, it is their heads that are mainly engaged\u2014which amounts to a onesidedoccupation. Everything that pupils do at this stage shouldcome out of their whole being, writing included. But this does not mean that every teacher is now supposed to follow the same example! I merely gave an example here toshow how one teacher undertook the task of applying underly-ing principles in the classroom. What I introduced in the T eacher T raining Course, prior to the opening of the Waldorf school in Stuttgart, was not meant to be copied pedantically byteachers in their actual teaching. It was presented as living sub-stance so that the school could become a living organism. As for rules and regulations, they can of course always be put together. If three people\u2014or thirty, or perhaps only twelve\u2014sit together in order to work out what, according to theirWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 94 lights, are the necessary conditions for creating a model school\u2014committing to paper every rule in order of priority and with the appropriate paragraphs\u2014they can of course pro- duce wonderful schemes, even if they themselves are notgraced with outstanding intelligence, even if they are only ofordinary or possibly even below average intelligence. The rele- vant points can be discussed in detail until impressive rules and regulations are finally agreed upon. But these are not likelyto be of any use at all when it comes to the actual teaching.What always matters most is how things work out in practice. QUESTIONER: How should one proceed when educating a nervous child? RUDOLF STEINER: The expression \"a nervous child\" is extremely ambiguous. Thus, it is impossible to give definite directives. One must have a clear description of the child's symptoms and one needs toknow the age of the child. In such a case, one really must beable to consider all the relevant factors within the general con- text. For instance, it might happen that one is shown a child, let us say, three or four years old, who is extremely fidgety andlikely to romp about wildly. There are such children. Theythrow themselves to the ground and go into terrible tantrums. Their behavior is distinctly discomfiting for the parents who may thereby suffer a great deal of unhappiness. Then they askwhat they could possibly do with such a child. Often, thoughby no means in every case, one would like to ask them to do nothing at all, for the worst thing in such a situation is to sup- press the symptoms. Such a child simply has to get rid of anoverabundance of energy so that, later on, it may develop nor-mally\u2014as one might put it. It is sometimes necessary to point out that it is better not to meddle with a child's developmentKnowledge of Health and Illness 95 by taking pedagogical measures. The important thing is to find out from the child's overall constitution what is or is not bene- ficial in each individual case. The same thing applies when one considers conditions of health or illness. How often does onehear these or similar remarks from persons with fixed ideas ofwhat is normal, \"If someone's pulse beat is irregular, one has to cure it by this or the other means.\" That might be perfectly correct in many instances but is by no means so in every case.Some people, due to their general constitution, actually need aslightly abnormal pulse! And so also in this case. One must know the overall constitution of a child before one can make definite statements. As always, anthroposophy aims to free peo-ple from living with abstract ideas. S uch a question as \"Howshould one deal with a nervous child?\" is an abstraction. One is never confronted by a general situation, but always by a partic- ular child who needs to be dealt with individually. QUESTIONER: How can anthroposophy give a lead with regard to pupils' find- ing their future careers? RUDOLF STEINER: I really do not know what is meant by this question! If I wereto answer it in the abstract, I would have to say that an anthro- posophical environment would in itself engender in a young person the right inclination to finding an appropriate voca-tion. In general, the choice of a career is dealt with far tooschematically. As a rule such a choice is already linked to a per- son's destiny. People are sometimes insufficiently flexible\u2014 they believe that only a particular profession can bring theminner satisfaction. That might well be so in cases where profes-sions have a markedly individualistic stamp, but to look for a lead to finding the right career in what anthroposophy has toWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 96 say on the subject sounds to me removed from the realities of life. I cannot really see the meaning of the question. The chairman asked whether there were any further questions. There were none. RUDOLF STEINER : I hope that this talk, given in all brevity and presented as a mere outline of our broadly based but specific theme, has con- tributed something toward a better understanding of the aimsof anthroposophy. These aims are never intended to be isolatedfrom actual life situations. When the essence of anthroposophy is fully grasped, it will always lead into the realities of life, into life itself.4chapter 97 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 97 4 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education AARAU \u2014 NOVEMBER 11, 1921 W hen, after the collapse of Germany in 1918, a movement toward social renewal was born in Stuttgart with the aim of lift-ing the country out of the chaos of the times and guiding ittoward a more hopeful future, one of the oldest friends of theanthroposophical movement, Emil Molt, conceived the idea offounding the Waldorf school in Stuttgart. Mr. Molt was in aposition to implement that idea almost immediately, for he wasin charge of an industrial enterprise employing a large numberof workers. Thanks to the excellent relations existing betweenthe management of that enterprise, the Waldorf-Astoria Ciga-rette Factory, and its workers, it proved possible to attract all ofthe workers' children to the school. In this way, more than twoyears ago, the Waldorf School was founded, primarily forworking class children. During the past two years, however, the school has grown almost from month to month. Today we have not only theoriginal pupils of the Waldorf school\u2014whose guidance wasput into my care\u2014but also many other children from allsocial classes and backgrounds. Indeed, the number of pupilswho have found their way into the Waldorf school from allquarters of the population is now considerably larger than the4chapter 98 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 98 original number of founding pupils, the children of the fac- tory workers. This fact shows the Waldorf school to be in practice a school for children of all types, coming from different classes and cul-tures, all of whom receive the same teaching, based on our ownmethods. The idea of the Waldorf school grew out of the anthropo- sophical movement, a movement that, nowadays, attracts agreat deal of hostility because it is widely misunderstood. Intonight's talk, and by way of introduction, I will mentiononly one such misunderstanding. This misunderstandingasserts that it is the aim of anthroposophy or spiritual science,particularly in its social aspects, to be revolutionary or some-how subversive, which is not at all the case. I must emphasizethis because it is of special importance for our pedagogicaltheme. As anthroposophical spiritual science seeks to deepenand fructify the many branches of science that have developedin the cultural and spiritual sphere during the last three orfour centuries, it has no intention whatever of opposing mod-ern science in any way. Nor does it wish to introduce ama-teurism into modern science. It only wishes to deepen and towiden the achievements of modern science, including modernmedicine. Likewise, the education arising from anthroposophical spir- itual science does not wish to oppose the tenets of recent edu-cational theory as put forward by its great representatives. Nordoes it wish to encourage amateurism in this eld either.Acknowledging the achievements of modern natural science,anthroposophical spiritual science has every reason to appreci-ate the aims and the achievements of the great educators at theend of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth cen-turies. Anthroposophy has no wish to oppose them. It wishesonly to deepen their work by what can be gained through4chapter 99 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 99 anthroposophical research. It wishes to stand entirely on the ground of modern pedagogical thinking. However, it doesnd it necessary to expand the scope of modern pedagogicalthinking and I shall endeavor to give a few outlines of howthis is to be done. Though the Waldorf school takes its starting point from anthroposophical spiritual science, it is nevertheless not anideological school\u2014and this I hope will be accepted as animportant fact. The Waldorf school is not in the least con-cerned with carrying into the school anthroposophical dogmaor anthroposophical convictions. It seeks to be neither ideo-logical nor sectarian nor denominational, for this would notbe in character with anthroposophical spiritual science. Unfor-tunately, the opposite is often erroneously believed. The Waldorf school, which has its roots in anthroposophy, is a school applying specic methods and classroom practices,as well as pedagogical ideas and impulses drawn from anthro-posophically-oriented spiritual science. When we founded theschool, we were simply not in a position to insist on such rad-ical demands as are frequently made by some modern educa-tors who maintain, for instance, that, if one wants to educatechildren properly, one has to open boarding schools or the likein the country, away from cities. There are many such endeav-ors today, and we have no objection to them on our part.From their point of view, we fully understand the reasoningbehind their demands. In the Waldorf school, however, we arenot in the same happy position. We had to accept a given situ-ation. The possibility was granted to us to place what was tobecome the Waldorf school in a city, in the very life of a city.There was no question of rst insisting on the right outer con-ditions for the school. What mattered was to achieve what hadto be achieved through the principles and methods of our edu-cation under given circumstances.4chapter 100 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 100 It is a characteristic feature of anthroposophical spiritual science that it can adapt itself to any outer conditions, for itwants to be able to work under all conditions of life. It has nowish to chase after utopian ideals, but wants to create some-thing in harmony with the human potential of its membersout of the immediate practical conditions and the practicalneeds of life in any given situation. To repeat, no dogma is to be carried into the school. What a person standing within the anthroposophical movementdoes gain, however, is a way of knowing that involves ourwhole humanity. The educational life of our times tends tofavor a certain intellectualism. Therefore there is no need tofear that the Waldorf school teaches its pupils that a humanbeing consists not only of a physical body (as you can read inmany anthroposophical writings) but also of an etheric body,supplying the formative and organic growing forces at work inthe physical body, and also of an astral body that, duringearthly life, carries what was developed during pre-earthlyexistence\u2014prior to physical birth or, rather, conception, andso on\u2014into the human physical organization. None of this istaught in the school. But, if we know that human beings,when observed with scientic accuracy, consist of body, soul,and spirit, and if we grasp how this is revealed in the child as ahuman being in the making, we gain a deeper and truerknowledge of the human being than is possible throughpresent-day natural science. We do not grasp this deeper knowledge of human beings and all that anthroposophical spiritual science can learn aboutthem only with our powers of thinking: the whole humanbeing\u2014thinking, feeling, and willing\u2014is involved. This, how-ever, is not the substance from which the training methods forwork in the Waldorf school are to be drawn. Rather, anthropo-sophical knowledge creates in our teachers the forces of will to4chapter 101 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 101 do all that they can for growing children in accordance with the demands of each child's organization. However paradoxicalit might sound, the child is the teacher \"par excellence\" in theWaldorf school. For Waldorf teachers are fully convinced thatwhat they meet in their children, week by week, year by year, isthe outer manifestation of divine and spiritual beings whohave come down to earth from a purely soul and spiritualexistence in order to evolve in a physical body on earthbetween birth and death. They realize that each child's beingunites\u2014by means of the stream of heredity coming throughthe parents and their ancestors\u2014with what is bestowed physi-cally and etherically. Waldorf teachers have an enormouslydeep reverence for the young human being who, in the rstdays after birth, already shows how an inner soul-being mani-fests in physiognomy, in the rst limb movements, and in therst babblings that gradually grow into human speech.Anthroposophical knowledge of human beings creates a deepreverence for what the divine world has sent down to earth andthat inner attitude of reverence is the characteristic feature ofWaldorf teachers as they enter their classrooms every morning.From the daily revelations of this mysterious spirit and soulexistence, they discover what they as teachers must do withtheir children. This is the reason why one cannot formulate the methods of the Waldorf school in a few abstract rules. One cannot say:point one, point two, point three, and so on. Rather, one hasto say that, through anthroposophical spiritual science, ateacher comes to know the growing human being and learns toobserve what looks out of a child's eyes and reveals itself in achild's dgety leg movements. Because teachers are thoroughlygrounded in an understanding of the whole human being,their knowledge of anthroposophy lls not only their intellect,with its capacity to systematize, but embraces the whole4chapter 102 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 102 human being who also feels and wills. These teachers approach their pupils in such a way that their methods acquire a livingexistence that they can always modify and metamorphose,even in larger classes, to suit each individual child. Anyone hearing all of this in the abstract, might well respond, \"These crazy anthroposophists! They believe that ahuman being does not only have a physical body which, as acorpse, may be carefully examined and investigated in physiol-ogy and biology; they also believe that human beings haveetheric, and even astral, bodies; and they believe that we canknow these if we practice certain soul exercises; they believethat if we strengthen our thinking to the point where the wholehuman being is transformed into a kind of 'supersensible senseorgan'\u2014if I may use Goethe's expression\u2014we can see morethan we do in ordinary human life.\" It is easy to poke fun atsuch \"crazy anthroposophists,\" who speak in these terms ofsupersensible beings in the sense-perceptible world. But if theseconvictions\u2014based not on weird fantasies but on well-grounded knowledge\u2014are carried into teaching, those whosetask it is to educate the young are able to look upon growingchildren realistically as beings of body, soul, and spirit. Andthis is how children must be observed if our pupils' innermostbeing is to be revealed. I do not wish to say anything derogatory about what, today, is referred to as experimental psychology or experimental ped-agogy. I appreciate what those scientic disciplines are capableof achieving and I acknowledge it. But, just because of thosedisciplines, we must deepen our educational life all the more.For, aside from their positive aspects, they demonstrate that weare not getting closer to children in a direct and natural way,but that, on the contrary, we have become more estrangedfrom them than ever before. External experiments are madewith children to ascertain how their thinking, their memory,4chapter 103 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 103 and even their will function. From the ensuing statistics, rules and regulations are then drawn up. Certainly, such ndingshave their uses, especially if one is an anthroposophist. But, ifwe regard them as the \"be-all and end-all\" and a foundationfor education, we only adduce proof that, in actual fact, wehave not reached the child's real being in any way. Why do wend it necessary to engage in experiments at all? Only becausethe direct, immediate relationship of teacher to child, whichwas there in ancient, Biblical times\u2014if I may use this expres-sion\u2014has been lost under the influence of our modern materi-alistic culture. External experiments are made because there nolonger exists a direct feeling and understanding for what actu-ally happens within a child. The fact of these external experi-ments is in itself proof that we have lost a direct relationshipwith our children and that we should try to rediscover it withall available power. When we study contemporary experimental psychology and pedagogy, it often seems as if the experimentalist were likesomeone observing a person riding a horse to see how he orshe does on a smooth path as compared to more difcult ter-rain. From such observations, the experimentalist then com-piles statistics: on the smooth path, such and such a distance infteen minutes; on a slippery path, so many miles; on anuneven path, so many more miles; and so on. This is the wayof working that we also nd, more or less, in experimentsmade to determine whether a child will remember somethingfor a quarter of an hour, or whether a child omits so and somany of the words to be remembered, and so on. To return toour simile; if we were to compile statistical details about therider, we would have to take into consideration not only thestate of the paths but also what the horse was capable of doingon the particular paths observed, and so on. But we will neversucceed by this method in discovering anything about the4chapter 104 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 104 rider him- or herself (although it would of course be perfectly possible to include the rider in statistical observations as well).What really matters is not just that we carry out externalexperiments on those to be educated, but that, as teachers, weare in direct, natural contact with children through our under-standing of their inner nature. In anthroposophical spiritual science, one learns to know what is given when a baby is born. We learn that a child bearswithin itself not only what we can perceive with our senses butalso a spirit-soul being that has united with the physicalembryo. We learn to know exactly how this spirit-soul beingdevelops, just as we learn from material science how the physi-cal germ develops within the hereditary flow. We learn to rec-ognize that, independent of the inherited traits, something ofa supersensible spirit and soul nature enters. Without teachingit as a dogma\u2014and I must emphasize this repeatedly\u2014thisperspective nevertheless becomes a means of orientation forthe teacher\u2014something that serves to guide a teacher's obser-vations of children even before they enter school. In the case of a child learning to speak, the following premise is useful. We must observe not only what belongs tothe stream of heredity but also what develops in the childfrom spiritual depths. Language is part of this. When oneobserves human beings in the light of anthroposophical spiri-tual science\u2014discriminating between the more inward, astralbody and the more outward etheric body\u2014one comes toknow the nature of the human will in quite a new way. Onesees the will as more allied to the astral body while thinking,for instance, is seen to be more closely connected with theetheric body. One learns to know how these members interactin speaking. For in observing and experiencing life, we haveto do not only with outer facts but with placing these facts inthe right light.4chapter 105 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 105 Let us now take a well trained observer of life, someone schooled in anthroposophy to know human beings, and placethis person beside a child who is going through the process oflearning to speak. If we have really learned to look into a child'ssoul life, recognizing the imponderables at play between adultand child, we can learn more about children's psychology byobserving real-life situations than, for example, the eminentpsychologist Wilhelm Preyer 1 did by means of statistical records. For instance, we learn to recognize the immense differ-ence between, let us say, when we hear a mother or fatherspeaking to a child to calm it down and saying, \"Ee Ee,\" andwhen we hear someone who is speaking to a child about some-thing more outward in its immediate environment and says,\"Hsh, hsh!\" With every vowel sound, we speak directly to achild's feeling life. We address ourselves to the innermost beingof the child's soul. With the help of spiritual science, we learnto know how to stimulate a particular soul area. And in thisway, we bring about a certain connection between adult andchild that generates a close relationship between teacher andpupil, allowing something to flow from the teacher directly tothe child's inmost feeling. If, for example, we speak to a child about how cold it is out- side, that child is taken into the realm of consonants (as in\"Hsh-Hsh\"), where we work directly on the child's will. We canthus observe that we stimulate in one instance a child's feelinglife, and in another the child's life of movement, which lives inwill impulses. With this example, I merely wanted to indicate how light can be shed upon everything, even the most elementary things,provided we have a comprehensive knowledge of life. Today, 1. Wilhelm Preyer, 1841-1897, physiologist and psychologist, published the book, The Soul of the Child , Leipzig, 1881.4chapter 106 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 106 there exists a magnicent science of language from which edu- cation certainly can benet a great deal. That science, however,studies language as if it were something quite separate fromhuman beings. But, if we are schooled in anthroposophicalspiritual science, we learn to look at language not as somethingfloating above human beings who then take hold of it andbring it into their lives; we learn that language is directly con-nected with the whole human being, and we learn to use thisknowledge in practical life. We learn how a child's inner rela-tionship to the vowel element is connected with a warmingglow in the feeling life, whereas the consonantal element\u2014whatever a child experiences through consonants\u2014is closelylinked to the movements of the will. The point is that one learns to observe the child more inti- mately. This kind of observation, this empathy with the child,has gradually been lost. So often today, when attempts aremade to educate young human beings, it is as if we were actu-ally circumventing the child's real being \u2014as if our modern sci-ence of education had lost direct contact with the child to beeducated. We no longer recognize that speech is organically linked to all processes of growth and to all that happens in a child. Fun-damentally, we no longer know that, in raising a child tobecome an imitator in the right way, we are helping it becomeinwardly warm and rich in feelings. Until the change of teeth,around the seventh year, children depend entirely on imitationand all upbringing and education during those early yearsdepends basically upon this faculty. Only if we gain a clearunderstanding of this faculty of imitation during the rst yearsof life and can follow it closely from year to year will the hid-den depths of a child's inner nature be revealed to us, so thatwe can educate our pupils in ways that, later on, will placethem fully into life.4chapter 107 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 107 This is true not only of speech but of whatever we must teach our children before they enter school. As I say, until thesecond dentition, a child is, fundamentally speaking, whollydependent on imitation. Anthroposophical spiritual scienceallows us to study the young child's faculty of imitation in allspheres of life\u2014and speech, too, develops entirely throughimitation. But the study of the faculty of imitation enables usto look more deeply into the nature of the growing humanbeing in other ways too. Although contemporary psychologyconstantly thinks around the problem of how the human soulor\u2014as it is sometimes called\u2014the human spirit is connectedto the human physical body, it is not in a position to come toany exact idea of the relationship between the human souland spirit on one side and the physical and bodily counterparton the other. Basically, psychology only knows the physicalaspects of the human being, when, like a corpse, the body isbereft of soul and spirit; on the other hand, it has distanceditself from the human soul and spirit as I have spoken ofthem. This situation can best be claried with the help of aparticular example. Contemporary science does not appreci-ate the importance of such phenomena as the second denti-tion occurring around the seventh year. But the kind ofobservation fostered by spiritual science reveals how a child'ssoul forces change during this process. A child's memory andability to think, and also a child's faculty of feeling, becomevery different during these years. Actually, one cannot see achild's soul life develop before about the seventh year. Butwhere was this emerging soul life with which we have to dealwhen the child enters school before the seventh year? Wherewas it previously? The method employed by scientic thinking is perfectly appropriate in the inorganic realm. When physicists todaystudy certain substances that emit heat after undergoing a4chapter 108 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 108 particular process, they ascribe that heat to the warmth that was formerly contained within the substance as \"latent\" orhidden heat. Then they study how, when subjected to a par-ticular process, that latent heat is liberated or released fromthe physical substance. They would not dream of concludingthat the radiating heat had somehow come into the matterfrom outside, but they study the condition in which the heatexisted while already present there. This way of thinking,inaugurated by physics, can be transferred to the more com-plicated realm of the human being. If, from an anthroposophical point of view, we study how a child's memory and will assume a particular conguration inthe seventh year, we will not conclude that these new facultieshave suddenly \"flown into the child.\" We will assume that theydeveloped within the child itself. But where were they previ-ously? They were active in the child's physical organism. Inother words, what the teacher must educate was previously alatent, hidden force in the child's own being. That force hasbeen liberated. As long as children need the forces that will cul-minate with the pushing out of the second teeth, those forceswill be active in the child's inner realm. With the shedding ofthe milk teeth and the emergence of the second teeth, thoseforces\u2014like the latent heat in certain substances\u2014are releasedfrom their task and reveal themselves as new soul and spiritualcapacities. These we then actively engage in our teaching. Only by studying examples from real life can we learn to understand how soul and body work together. We can engagein endless philosophical speculation about the relationship ofsoul and body to each other but, when studying early child-hood up to the seventh year, we must observe the actual facts.Only then will we recognize that forces that have left theorganic bodily realm after the change of teeth are free to beused by the teacher in quite a new way.4chapter 109 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 109 The same principle applies to the whole span of human life. All of the speculative theories about the relationship of souland body that we can nd in books on philosophy and physiol-ogy are useless unless they are based on a mode of observationthat is exact according to proper scientic methods. If we observe such things further, we realize that the forces in a child with which we deal as teachers are the same that werepreviously engaged in building up the organism. We know,too, that those forces must now assume another form and that,if we are to teach children, we must come to know those forcesin their new form. But we must also get to know them in theiroriginal form\u2014since they must be used for learning, we mustbe able to recognize them in their original task. Well, a lotmore could be said about this. I will only point out that it isbecause of those forces, working in the depths of the organism,creating life, that a child imitates up to the seventh year. Tounderstand a preschool child, we must always bear in mind thisfaculty of imitation. For example, parents complain that their son has stolen money. They are looking for advice. You ask how old the childis and are told that he is four or ve years old. It might soundsurprising, but a child of four or ve does not really steal. Sucha child is still at the stage of imitation. And so, if you ask fur-ther questions, you discover, for instance, that the child hasseen his mother taking money out of a cupboard every day.The child imitates this action and, consequently, he too takesmoney. I have even known a case in which a child took moneyout of a cupboard but, instead of buying sweets, bought thingsto give to other children. There was nothing immoral in thisbehavior, only perhaps something somewhat amoral, some-thing imitative. An incident like this makes us realize that, in educating chil- dren, we are dealing with imponderables. As teachers, we must4chapter 110 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 110 realize that, when we stand before a child who is an imitator, we must be mindful even of our thoughts. Not only ouractions but our thoughts too must be of a kind that a child cansafely imitate. The entire upbringing of preschool childrenmust be based on this principle of imitation. Even if it mightsound strange, awareness of this principle must lie at the foun-dation of a really healthy form of early education. The forces that make a child an imitator to such an extent that it imitates even the slightest hand movement appear whenthe child is about seven as the liberated forces with which edu-cators and teachers have to deal. Looking more closely at thisdevelopment, one recognizes that, whereas a child is a compul-sive imitator up to the age of seven, during the next sevenyears, up to puberty, the pupil needs to experience a naturalsense of authority in the teacher as the right guide on life'spath. The experience of authority becomes the main educa-tional principle for children between the change of teeth andpuberty\u2014a principle that develops naturally to become thebasic relationship between teacher and pupil. It is all too easy to speak abstractly about this relationship based upon a natural sense of authority. If we wish to guide itin the right direction at every moment of our teaching life, weneed anthroposophical knowledge of the human being. Today, many people speak about the necessity and the importance of visual instruction, practical demonstration,and so forth\u2014and they are in a certain sense quite right to doso. It is certainly right for some subjects. Anything that can beoutwardly observed can be brought to the child by thesemethods. But we must consider, above all, the moral order ofthe world and human religious feelings\u2014that is, everythingpertaining to the spiritual nature of the world. The spiritual isimperceptible to outer senses and if we take the so-calledvisual instruction method too far, we lead children into4chapter 111 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 111 believing in only what is sense perceptible\u2014that is, into materialism. What really matters at this age is that throughthe natural relationship to the teacher, the child feels, \"Thisadult, who is my guide, knows what is right and behaves in away I long to emulate.\" (If I describe such a feeling as anadult, it is naturally quite different from how a child wouldexperience it.) During the rst seven years, then, a child's activities mirror and imitate its surroundings\u2014above all through gestures,including the subtle inner gestures that live in speech. But, dur-ing the next seven years, children develop under the influence ofthe words that come from the naturally accepted authority oftheir teacher. In order to appreciate the importance and value ofthis natural sense of authority, one must have a thorough foun-dation in true knowledge of the human being. You would hardly expect someone like myself who, many years ago, wrote a book called Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path: A Philosophy of Freedom to support a reactionary social belief in authority. So it is not on the basis of any authoritar-ian intention but solely on educational grounds that I main-tain that the most essential principle, the most importantforce in education, between the age of seven and puberty, liesin a pupil's belief that the teacher, as an authority, knows whatis right and does what is right. This must sink down into thechild. If students do not develop on the basis of this belief in the authority of the teacher, they will be unable, when older, toenter social life in a wholesome manner. To understand this, we need only to know what it means for a child willingly to accept something on the basis of authority.I realize that this is for many people rather a controversial pointbut, actually, it is controversial only for those who, fundamen-tally speaking, lack the will to look at life in its entirety.4chapter 112 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 112 For instance, let us assume, say, that, in our second year of life nature did not dispose the form of our ngers so that theygrow and develop\u2014that nature made our ngers such that, asit were, they were cast in hard stereotyped forms. What wouldwe do then! Insofar as we are human, then, we are growing,continuously changing beings. And as educators, likewise,this is the kind of essence that we must pour into children'ssouls. We must not impose on our children anything that cre-ates sharply contoured pictures, impressions, or will impulsesin them. Just as our ngers do not retain the contours thatthey had when we were two but rather grow on their own, soall ideas, thoughts, and feelings that we pour into childrenduring their school years must have the essence of growth inthem. We must be quite clear: what we bring to an eight-year-old cannot be clear-cut or sharply contoured. Rather, it must havean inner capacity for growth. By the time the person is forty,it will have become something quite different. We must beable to see the whole human being. Anyone who does not appreciate the principle of authority during these years ofchildhood has never experienced what it really means when,for instance, in the course of one's thirty-fth year, out of thedark recesses of memory, one understands some concept ofhistory or geography\u2014or some concept of life\u2014that oneaccepted without understanding at the age of nine on theauthority of a well loved teacher or parent, having taken itsimply on faith. When such a concept emerges in the soul andis understood with the mature understanding of severaldecades later, this becomes an animating principle that callsup an indenable feeling that need not be brought to full con-sciousness: something from one's earliest years lives on inone's soul. It is in this sense that we must be able to follow theforces of growth in nature.4chapter 113 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 113 Our educational principles and methods must not be tied up in xed formulae. Rather, they must become a kind of rened,practical instinct for action in those who educate from a livingknowledge of human beings. Teachers will then nd the rightway of dealing with children rather than merely articiallygrafting something onto the souls in their care. This is not todeny what has been promulgated by the great pedagogues ofthe nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. On the contrary,it is actually applying it in the right way. Those who wish to become Waldorf teachers know quite well that they cannot join the school as amateurs, as dilettantes.They must be moved by all that nineteenth- and twentieth-century education has brought forth. But, at the same time,they must also bring to the Waldorf school the living insightinto human beings of which I have spoken. Here one feelsprompted to quote Goethe's dictum, \"Consider well the what, but consider more the how.\" You will nd excellent expositions of the what\u2014 with regard to foundations and principles\u2014in theoretical texts on education. Even quite idealistic thoughtsare sometimes expressed there, but all of this represents onlythewhat. The point is not to formulate abstract principles but to be able to apply them in a living way, with inner soulwarmth. I am fully convinced that if a group of people were to sit together\u2014they need not even be outstandingly clever\u2014todraft the blueprint for an ideal school, their schemes, put intoorder of priorities\u2014rst, second, third, and so forth\u2014wouldbe quite excellent. They would be so convincing that one couldnot improve on them. It is quite possible to think out thegrandest ideals and turn them into slogans for great move-ments of reform and so on. But, in life as it is, all of this is oflittle value. What matters is to truly observe life, to bear inmind the living human being who is capable of doing what4chapter 114 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 114 needs to be done under given circumstances. \"Consider well thewhat, but consider more the how.\" And so, what matters is that love of the child lies at the root of all of our educational endeavors, and that all teaching bedone out of an inner, living experience. Against this back-ground, the foundations of our education become quite otherthan they usually are. With this in mind, then, I would like toput into words a fundamental underlying principle, once morein the form of an example. A child is supposed to form an inner picture of a denite concept. It is capable of doing so but, in our attempts to com-municate something abstract\u2014something of an ethical andreligious nature\u2014we can proceed in different ways. For exam-ple, let us imagine that the teacher wants to convey topupils\u2014naturally in accordance with the children's age andmaturity\u2014the idea of the immortality of the human soul. Wecan do this with a comparison. There are two ways in whichwe can do this. One would be as follows. As teachers, we canbelieve that we are terribly clever, whereas the child is stillyoung and terribly ignorant. On this basis, we could invent acomparison and say, \"Look at the chrysalis. The butterflycomes out of the chrysalis.\" Then, after describing this processpictorially, we might say, \"Just as the butterfly emerges from itschrysalis, so the human soul, when a person passes throughthe portal of death, leaves the body and flies into the spiritualworld.\" This is one way of approaching the problem. Feelinggreatly superior to the child, we think out a simile or compari-son. But, if this is our underlying attitude, we will not be verysuccessful. Indeed, this is a situation where imponderablesplay their part. For a teacher who has been schooled in anthro-posophical spiritual science about the nature of the world andknows that there is spirit in all matter will not proceed from afeeling of being far more clever than the child. Consequently,4chapter 115 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 115 he or she will not invent something for the child's benet. That is to say in this case the teacher will rmly believe thatwhat on a higher level represents the human soul leaving thebody at death is represented in the natural order on a lowerlevel by the emergence of the butterfly from the chrysalis. Theteacher will believe in the truth of this picture. To this teacher,the image is a sacred revelation. These are two entirely differ-ent approaches. If I speak to the child out of a sacred convic-tion, I touch the child's innermost being in an imponderableway. I call forth in the child a living feeling, a living concept.This approach is generally true. We must neither underesti-mate nor overestimate what modern science has to say out ofits exclusive interest in the external world. Allow me to quote a somewhat far-fetched example to con- solidate what I have been saying. As you know, there has been agreat deal of talk about so-called \"counting horses.\" Thosehorses perform quite special feats. I myself have not seen theElberfeld horses, but I did see Herr von Osten's horse and wit- nessed how this horse, when questioned, stamped out theanswers to simple arithmetical questions with one of its hooves.The horse stamped the correct number of times\u2014one, two,three, four, ve, six, and so on. In order to explain such a phe-nomenon and avoid falling into nebulous mysticism or mererationalism, we need a certain ability to observe. Now, amongthe spectators of the counting horses was a certain private tutorin psychology and physiology who, having seen Herr vonOsten's horse performing its tricks, declared that the horsestamped when a specic number was called out because it wasable to detect very subtle and rened expressions in Herr vonOsten's face. He claimed that when his master moved his facein a certain way after asking, \"What are three times three?\" thehorse stopped stamping after nine stamps. Naturally, thislearned gentleman had to prove that such looks or movements4chapter 116 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 116 really existed in Herr von Osten's face. But this he was unable to do. In his learned dissertation, he stated, \"These looks are sosubtle and innitesimal that a human being cannot detectthem, and even I myself\" \u2014he added\u2014\"am unable to say any-thing about them.\" You see that all of his cleverness amountedto admitting his own lack of being able to discover the facialexpressions that the horse was supposed to follow. In otherwords, the horse was more perceptive than this learned lecturer!A less biased spectator would have noticed that, while the horsestamped answers to arithmetical questions, Herr von Ostencontinually fed his horse with sugar lumps which he took fromhis rather capacious coat pocket. While apparently performingcalculations, the horse was constantly relishing the sweet tasteof the sugar lumps. I must ask you not to misunderstand me ifI say that this way of treating the horse gave rise to a very spe-cic form of a loving and intimate relationship, an inner rela-tionship, and that this is really what was the root-cause of whatwas happening. If one wants to discover this true relationship existing below the level of ordinary observation, one must begin with whatthe effect of such \"love\" can be. If one wants to understandsuch things properly, it is no good talking of hypnotism or sug-gestion in a general way, but one must understand the natureof such a subtle relationship. Neither nebulous mysticism normere rationalism will lead to one's solving the mystery, butonly a knowledge of the human, and in this case also the ani-mal, soul. This is what matters above all if we wish to found a living method of education, as distinct from one based on mereprinciples and intellectual theories. This living method of edu-cation then guides us to observe the child from year to year. Itis this How, this individual treatment of each child even within a larger class, that matters. It is possible to achieve it.4chapter 117 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 117 The Waldorf school has already demonstrated this fact during the rst few years of its existence. Here I can only give broad outlines, which can be supple- mented by more detailed examples. First of all, we receive thechild into our rst grade, where it is supposed to learn writingand reading, perhaps also the beginnings of arithmetic and soon. Let us rst discuss reading. Reading in our present cultureis really quite alien to a young child. If we go back to ancienttimes, we nd that a kind of picture writing existed in whicheach letter word still retained a pictorial connection with theobject it represented. In our present system of writing orprinting, there is nothing to link the child's soul to what iswritten. For this reason, we should not begin by immediatelyteaching children writing when they enter primary school intheir sixth or seventh year. In the Waldorf school, all teach-ing\u2014and this includes writing, which we introduce beforereading\u2014appeals directly to a child's innate artistic sense.Right from the start, we give our young pupils the opportu-nity of working artistically with colors, not only with dry cray-ons but also with watercolors. In this simple way, we give thechild something from which the forms of the letters can bedeveloped. Such things have been done elsewhere, of course.But it is again a matter of how. The main thing is that we allow the child to be active without in any way engaging theforces of the intellect but by primarily activating the will. Onthe basis of drawing and painting, we gradually lead a child'srst will activities in writing toward a more intellectual under-standing of what is written. We lead our children, step by step,developing everything in harmony with their own inherentnatures. Even down to the arrangement of the curriculum,everything that we do at school must be adapted to the child'sevolving nature. But, for this, anthroposophical knowledge ofhuman beings is necessary.4chapter 118 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 118 I would here like to point out how one can observe the harm done to children when one does not give them conceptsand feelings capable of growth, but makes them aware of thedifference between the outer material world of xed forms andtheir own inner mobile soul life at too early an age. Untilabout the ninth year, a child does not yet clearly discriminatebetween him- or herself and the outer world. One must becareful not to believe in abstract concepts, as some people dotoday who say, \"Well, of course, if a young child bumps intothe corner of a table, it smacks the table because it thinks thatthe table is also a living thing.\" This, of course, is nonsense.The child does not think that the table is a living object. Ittreats the table as if it were a child, too, simply because it can-not yet distinguish its own self from the table. Whether thetable lives or not is beside the point. The child, as yet, has nosuch concept. We must always deal with realities, not withwhat we ourselves imagine intellectually. Until the ninth year,whatever we introduce to a child must be treated as if it hadpurely human qualities. It must be based on the assumptionthat the children's relationship to the world is such that everything is a part of them\u2014as if it were a part of their own organ-ism. One can, of course, point to certain obvious exampleswhere a child will differentiate between something in theexternal world and its own being. But, between the seventhand ninth years, we cannot further the ner aspects of educa-tion unless we bring to life whatever we teach the child, unlesswe make everything into a parable, not in a dead, but a trulyliving form. Everything must be taught in mobile and colorfulpictures, not in dead static concepts. Between the ninth and tenth years, a most important, sig- nicant moment occurs: it is only then that children reallybecome conscious of the difference between their inner selvesand their surroundings. This is the age when we can rst4chapter 119 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 119 intellectually introduce children to the life of plants and ani- mals, both of whom have an existence apart from humanbeings. Something truly profound is taking place in a child'smind and soul at this time\u2014a little earlier in the case of somechildren, a little later in others. Something is happening\u2014fundamental changes are occurring\u2014in the depths of theiryoung souls; namely, they are learning to distinguish theirinner selves from the outer world in a feeling way, but not yetby means of concepts. Therefore if teachers are aware of theright moment, and can nd the appropriate words, theycan\u2014acting as the situation demands\u2014do something of last-ing value and importance for the whole life of these childrenaged between nine and ten. On the other hand, if they missthis signicant moment, they can create an inner barrennessof soul or spiritual aridity in later life, and an attitude of ever-lasting doubt and inner dissatisfaction. But, if teachers are suf-ciently alert to catch such a signicant moment and if, byimmersing themselves in the child's being, they have the nec-essary empathy and know how to speak the right words andhow to conduct themselves rightly, they can perform animmense service for their children, who will derive benet forthe rest of their lives. In Waldorf education, the observation ofsuch key moments in the lives of children is considered to beof utmost importance. After this special moment in the ninth-tenth year, while all subjects had previously to be \"humanized,\" teachers can beginto introduce simple descriptions of plants and animals in amore objective style. Then, between the eleventh and twelfthyears, they can begin to introduce inorganic subjects, such asthe study of minerals and physics. Certainly the lifeless worldshould be approached only after children have been fullyimmersed in the living world. Thus the child is led\u2014I mention only a few characteristic4chapter 120 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 120 examples\u2014to the age when school normally comes to an end, to the age of puberty.2 How many countless discussions and arguments are going on these days about puberty from a psychoanalytical and froma psychological point of view! The main thing is to recognizethat one is dealing here with the end of a characteristic lifeperiod\u2014just as second dentition represented the end of anearlier period of development. Puberty in itself is only a link inan entire chain of metamorphoses embracing the whole ofhuman life. What happened in the child at second dentition isthat inner soul forces became liberated that had previouslybeen working within the organism. Between the seventh andapproximately fourteenth years, we try to guide the child inthe ways I just described. With the onset of puberty, however,children enter the time of life when they can form their ownjudgments on matters concerning the world at large. Whereas,when younger, our children drew their inner being from thedepths of their organism, as adolescents they now becomecapable of understanding the spiritual nature of the outerworld as such. How to educate our children between their sev-enth and fourteenth years so that they are naturally guided toacquire an independent and individual relationship to theworld\u2014of which sexual life is only one expression\u2014presentsone of the greatest challenges to teachers. This is one of themost important problems of a truly living education. The sex-ual love of one person for another is only one aspect, one partof the whole fabric of human social life. We must lead our adolescents to the point where they develop the inner maturity necessary to follow outer events inthe world with caring interest. Otherwise, they will pass themby unheeded. As teachers, we must aim at turning our young 2. In 1921, the school-leaving age in Germany was fourteen.4chapter 121 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 121 human beings into social beings by the time of puberty. We must also try to cultivate in them religious feelings, not in abigoted or sectarian way, but in the sense that they acquire theseriousness necessary to recognize that the physical world iseverywhere permeated by spirit. They should not feel inwardlysatised with merely observing the outer sense world butshould be able to perceive the spiritual foundations of theworld everywhere. During prepubescence, when pupils open their inner being to us, believing in our authority, we must be what amounts tothe whole world for them. If they nd a world in us as theirteachers, then they receive the right preparation to becomereverent, social people in the world. We release them from ourauthority, which gave them a world, into the wide worlditself. Here, in only a few words, I touch on one of the most important problems of cognition. If we train children tomake their own judgments too early, we expose them toforces of death instead of giving them forces of life. Onlyteachers whose natural authority awakens the belief that whatthey say and do is the right thing, and who in the eyes of thechild become representatives of the world, will prepare theirpupils to grow into really living human beings when, lateron, they enter life. Such teachers prepare their pupils not bycontrolling their intellect or their capacity to form judgmentsbut by setting the right example as living human beings. Lifecan evolve only with life. We make our students into propercitizens of the world by presenting the world to them in ahuman being\u2014the teacher\u2014not through abstract intellec-tual concepts. I can characterize all of this in a few sentences, but what I am suggesting presupposes an ability to follow in detail howgrowing children evolve from day to day. By the power of his4chapter 122 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 122 or her example, the way in which a teacher carries something through the door into the classroom already helps a child todevelop further toward nding its own way in life. If we knowthis, we need not make amateurish statements, such as that alllearning should be fun. Many people say this today. T ry to seehow far you get with such an abstract principle! In manyrespects learning cannot bring only joy to the child. The rightway is to educate children by bringing enough life into the var-ious subjects that they retain a curiosity for knowledge, even ifit does not reward them immediately with pleasure. How ateacher proceeds should be a preparation for what pupils mustlearn from them. This leads quite naturally to cultivation of the pupils' sense of duty. We touch here upon a sphere that extends far beyondwhat belongs to the eld of education. We touch on some-thing where a method and practice of education based onspiritual foundations directly fructies the whole of culturallife. We all of us surely look up to Schiller and Goethe as lead- ing spirits. To have studied and written about them for morethan forty years, as I have, leaves one in no doubt as to one'sfull, warm appreciation of their work and gifts. There is, how-ever, just one point that I would like to make in this context. When, in the 1790s, Schiller, having distanced himself from Goethe for all kinds of personal reasons renewed an intimatefriendship with him, he wrote his famous\u2014and sadly too littleappreciated\u2014 Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man . Schiller wrote these letters under the influence of how Goethe worked,thought, and viewed the world. In those letters, which areabout aesthetic education, we nd a strange sentence: \"Onlywhen we play are we fully human, and we play only when weare human in the truest sense of the word.\" With that sentence,Schiller wanted to point out how ordinary life essentially4chapter 123 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 123 chains us into a kind of slavery, how the average person, forced to live under the yoke of necessity, suffers under the burden ofouter life. In general, people are free to follow their ownimpulses only when engaged in artistic activities, when creatingand enjoying art, or when behaving like children at play, actingonly in accordance with their own impulses. What Schillerdescribes in his aesthetic letters is a beautiful and genuine con-ception of what it is to be human. On the other hand, the letters show that with the advance of our modern scientic, technological civilization and for thesake of human dignity, exceptional persons like Schiller andGoethe found it necessary to demand that human beingsshould be allowed freedom from the daily round of duties. Tobecome fully human, people should be relieved of the coercionof work so that they can be free to play. If we bear in mind thesocial conditions imposed on us by the twentieth century, werealize that we have completely changed our attitude towardlife. Realizing that everyone must accept the demands of life,we feel that we carry an intolerable burden of responsibilityupon our shoulders. We must learn how to make life worthwhile again, from both the social and individual points of view, not only byintroducing more play but by taking up our tasks in a morehuman way. This is the reason why the social question istoday rst of all a question of education. We must teachyoung people to work in the right way. The concept of dutymust be brought into school, not by preaching, but in theright and natural way\u2014which can be achieved only through athorough, well grounded, and correct knowledge of humannature. If we do so, we shall be founding schools for work, not schools following the attitude that teaching and learning aremerely be a kind of \"playing about.\" In our school, where4chapter 124 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 124 authority plays its proper part, pupils are expected not to shy away from the most demanding tasks. In Waldorf schools,students are encouraged to tackle whole heartedly whatever isto be mastered. They are not to be allowed to do whateverthey feel like doing. It is with this in view that the Waldorf school has been founded. Children are to learn to work in the right way; theyare to be introduced to life in the world in the full humansense. This demands work for social reasons and also that, ashuman beings, the students should learn to face one anotherand, above all, themselves in the right way. For this reason,apart from conventional gymnastics, which originally evolvedfrom human physiology and hence has its values, we have alsointroduced eurythmy 3\u2014a new art of movement, cultivating body, soul and spirit; a visible form of language and music\u2014into the Waldorf school. You can nd out more about eurythmy in Dornach. Just as there are speech and music that you can hear, so there also is akind of language and music that uses the medium of gesturesand movements evolved from the organization of the humanbody, but not as is done in dance or mime. It can be performedby groups of people who express in this new way the kind ofcontent that is usually expressed through audible speech andmusic. Since its introduction in the Waldorf school some twoyears ago, we have already been able to observe that pupils fromthe lowest to the highest grades take to eurythmy lessons withthe same natural ease with which little children take to speak-ing, provided that the lessons are given properly, in a way suitedto each age group. 3. See, for instance, Rudolf Steiner, An Introduction to Eurythmy (Hudson, New York: Anthroposophic Press, 1984) and Marjorie Spock, Eurythmy (Spring Valley, New York: Anthroposophic Press, 1980).4chapter 125 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 125 Once, during an introductory talk before a eurythmy perfor- mance in Dornach, I spoke about eurythmy to an audiencethat happened to include one of the most famous physiologistsof our times (you would be surprised if you heard his name).After saying that we had no wish to denigrate the value of gymin schools, but that the time would come when such matterswould be judged with less prejudice and that eurythmy, withits movements involving a person's soul and spirit, would thencome into its own, the famous physiologist approached me andsaid, \"You said that gymnastics has its own benecial value inmodern education and that it is based on human physiology.As a physiologist, I consider gymnastics to be sheer barbarism!\"It was not I who expressed this view, it was one of the best-known physiologists of our times! Such an incident can lead us to appreciate the saying: \"Con- sider well the what, but consider more the how.\" There are occasions when, reading books on educational theory andapplied teaching, one feels like shouting for joy. What the great educationalists have achieved! But what matters is the righthow. One has to nd ways and means of implementing the ideas into practical life in the right way. Every Waldorf teacher must seek this anew each day, for any- thing that is alive must be founded on life. Spiritual scienceeventually leads each one of us to an understanding of funda-mental truths that, although they are always the same, never-theless inspire us ever anew. Regarding our ordinary knowledgebased on material things, we depend on our memory. What hasbeen absorbed is remembered, to be recalled later from thestore of memory. What we have once learned, we possess; it isclosely linked to us. In everyday life, we certainly need ourstore of memory. Our intellect depends on memory, but livingprocesses do not need memory\u2014not even on the lower levelsof our existence. Just imagine for a moment that you thought4chapter 126 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 126 that what you ate once as a small child sufced for the rest of your life. You have to eat anew every day because eating is apart of a living process and what has been taken up by theorganism must be thoroughly digested and transformed. Spiri-tual substance likewise must be taken up in a living way and aneducational method based on anthroposophy must work out ofthis living process. This is what I wanted to describe to you in brief outline, merely indicating here what has been described in furtherdetail in anthroposophical books, particularly those dealingwith education. I wanted to draw your attention to the educa-tional principles of the Waldorf school, a pioneering schoolfounded by our friend Emil Molt, a school that has no desireto rebel against contemporary education. It seeks only to putinto practice what has often been suggested theoretically. Any-one who surveys the kind of life which humanity, particularlyin Europe, lives today will recognize the need to deepen manyaspects of life. During the second decade of this twentieth cen-tury, following the terrible catastrophe that destroyed most ofwhat was best in humanity, one must admit the importance ofgiving the coming generations soul-spiritual and physical-bodily qualities different from those received by our contem-poraries who have had to pay so dearly in human life. Thosewho, as parents, must care for the well-being of their sons anddaughters and who, most of all, have the right to see how edu-cation relates to life, will view our efforts without prejudice.Those among them who, as parents, have experienced thegreat catastrophes of our times, will doubtlessly welcome everyattempt that, based on deeper social and spiritual awareness,promises the coming generations something better than whathas been offered to many at the present time. The people whohave most reason to hope for an improvement of conditionsprevailing in contemporary education are the parents and they,4chapter 127 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 127 above all, have the right to expect and demand something better from the teachers. This was the thinking and the idealthat inspired us when we tried to lay the educational founda-tions of the Waldorf school. FROM THE DISCUSSION QUESTIONER: Dr. Steiner has spoken to us about the importance of authorityin education, but this is something with which our young peo-ple want nothing to do. Every teacher, not to mention everypriest, experiences it. Various currents run through ouryounger generation and one can certainly notice an aloofnesson their part toward anything connected with the question ofauthority, be the authority in the parental home or authorityregarding spiritual matters. Parents sometimes have the feelingthat they no longer have any say in anything and that one mustsimply let these young people go their own way. On the otherhand, one sometimes also witnesses the disillusionment ofsuch an attitude and it is then painful to see young people notnding what they were seeking. There is something in the airthat simply seems to forbid a respectful attitude toward olderpeople, something that is like a deep-seated sting, ever ready tostrike against authority in whatever form. Perhaps Dr. Steinerwould be kind enough to tell us something about the reasonsfor this strange ferment among the younger generation. Whyare they not happy? Why do they take special pleasure in com-plaining? It saddens us that we are no longer able to reachthem. I have sought help by studying books dealing with thisproblem, but I have so far not found a single one that could4chapter 128 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 128 show me the way forward. I would therefore be very happy if Dr. Steiner could say something to give us insight into the soulof a young person. RUDOLF STEINER: This is, of course, a subject that, unfortunately, were I were todeal with it in any depth, would require a whole lecture of atleast the same length as the one I have just given you\u2014I sayunfortunately because you would have to listen to me for sucha long time! I would, however, like to say at least a few words inresponse to the previous speaker's remarks. During my life, which by now can no longer be described as short, I have tried to follow up various life situationsrelated to this question. On one hand, I have really experi-enced what it means to hear, in one's childhood, a great dealof talk about a highly esteemed and respected relative whomone had not yet met in person. I have known what it is tobecome thoroughly familiar with the reverence toward such aperson that is shared by all members of the household, byone's parents as well as by others connected with one'supbringing. I have experienced what it means to be led for therst time to the room of such a person, to hold the door han-dle in my hand, feeling full of awe and reverence. To haveundergone such an experience is of lasting importance for thewhole of one's life. There can be no genuine feeling for free-dom, consistent with human dignity, that does not have itsroots in the experience of reverence and veneration such asone can feel deeply in one's childhood days. On the other hand, I have also witnessed something rather different. In Berlin, I made the acquaintance of a well-knownwoman socialist, who often made public speeches. One day Iread, in an otherwise quite respectable newspaper, an articleof hers entitled, \"The Revolution of our Children.\" In it, in4chapter 129 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 129 true socialist style, she developed the theme of how, after the older generation had fought\u2014or at least talked about\u2014therevolution, it was now the children's turn to act. It was noteven clear whether children of preschool age were to beincluded in that revolution. This is a different example ofhow the question of authority has been dealt with during thelast decades. As a third example, I would like to quote a proposal, made in all seriousness by an educationalist who recommended that aspecial book be kept at school in which at the end of eachweek\u2014it may have been at the end of each month\u2014the pupilswere to enter what they thought about their teachers. The ideabehind this proposal was to prepare them for a time in the nearfuture when teachers would no longer give report \"marks\" totheir pupils but pupils would give grades to their teachers. None of these examples can be judged rightly unless they are seen against the background of life as a whole. This willperhaps appear paradoxical to you, but I do believe that thiswhole question can be answered only within a wider context.As a consequence of our otherwise magnicent scientic andtechnical culture\u2014which, in keeping with its own character,is bound to foster the intellect\u2014the human soul has graduallybecome less and less permeated by living spirit. Today, whenpeople imagine what the spirit is like, they usually reach onlyconcepts and ideas about it. Those are only mental images ofsomething vaguely spiritual. This, at any rate, is how the mostinfluential philosophers of our time speak about the spiritualworlds as they elaborate their conceptual theories of educa-tion. This \"conceptuality\" is, of course, the very thing thatanthroposophical spiritual science seeks to overcome. Spiri-tual science does not want its adherents merely to talk aboutthe spirit or to bring it down into concepts and ideas; it wantshuman beings to imbue themselves with living spirit. If this4chapter 130 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 130 actually happens to people, they very soon begin to realize that we have gradually lost touch with the living spirit. Theyrecognize that it is essential that we nd our way back to theliving spirit. So-called intellectually enlightened people inparticular have lost the inner experience of living spirit. Atbest, they turn into agnostics, who maintain that natural sci-ence can reach only a certain level of knowledge and that thatlevel represents the ultimate limit of what can in fact beknown. The fact that the real struggle for knowledge onlybegins at this point, and that it leads to a living experience ofthe spiritual world\u2014of this, generally speaking, our educatedsociety has very little awareness. And what was the result, or rather what was the cause, of our having lost the spirit in our spoken words? Today, you will ndthat what you read in innumerable articles and books basicallyconsists of words spilling more or less automatically from thehuman soul. If one is open-minded and conversant with thecurrent situation, one often needs to read no more than therst few lines or pages of an article or book in order to knowwhat the author is thinking about the various points in ques-tion. The rest follows almost automatically out of the wordsthemselves. Once the spirit has gone out of life, the result is anempty phrase-bound, clich\u00e9-ridden language, and this is whatso often happens in today's cultural life. When people speakabout cultural or spiritual matters or when they wish to partic-ipate in the cultural spiritual sphere of life, it is often no longerthe living spirit that speaks through their being. It is clich\u00e9sthat dominate their language. This is true not only of howindividuals express themselves. We nd it above all in our \"glo-rious\" state education. Only think for a moment of how littleof real substance is to be found in one or another political partythat offers the most persuasive slogans or \"party-phrases.\" Peo-ple become intoxicated by these clich\u00e9s. Slogans might to some4chapter 131 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 131 degree satisfy the intellect, but party phrases will not grasp real life. And so it must be said that what we nd when we reachthe heights of agnosticism\u2014which has already penetrateddeeply into our society\u2014is richly saturated with emptyphrases. Living so closely with such clich\u00e9s, we no longer feel aneed for what is truly living in language. Words no longer risefrom profound enough depths of the human soul. Change willoccur only if we permeate ourselves with the spirit once more.T wo weeks ago, I wrote an article for The Goetheanum under the heading, \"Spiritual Life Is Buried Alive.\" 4 In it, I drew attention to the sublime quality of the writing that can still befound among authors who wrote around the middle of thenineteenth century. Only very few people are aware of this. Ishowed several people some of these books that looked as ifthey had been read almost continually for about a decade, afterwhich they seemed to have been consigned to dust. Full of sur-prise, they asked me, \"Where did you nd those books?\" Iexplained that I am in the habit, now and then, of poring overold books in second-hand bookshops. In those bookshops, Iconsult the appropriate catalogs and ask for certain chosenbooks to be delivered to wherever I am staying. In that way Imanage to nd totally forgotten books of all kinds, books thatwill never be reprinted but that give clear evidence of how thespirit has been \"buried alive\" in our times, at least to a certainextent. Natural science is protected from falling into such clich\u00e9s simply because of its close ties to experimentation and obser-vation. When making experiments, one is dealing with actualspiritual facts that have their place in the general ordering ofnatural laws. But, excepting science, we have been gradually 4. See: Collected articles, 1923-1925 (in the Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner /GA36).4chapter 132 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 132 sliding into a life heavily influenced by clich\u00e9s and phrases, by-products of the overspecialization of the scientic, techno-logical development of our times. Apart from many otherunhappy circumstances of our age, it is to living in such aphrase-ridden, clich\u00e9d language that we must attribute theproblem raised by the previous speaker. For a child's relation-ship to an adult is an altogether imponderable one. Thephrase might well flourish in adult conversations, and partic-ularly so in party-political meetings, but if one speaks to chil-dren in mere phrases, clich\u00e9s, they cannot make anything ofthem. And what happens when we speak in clich\u00e9s\u2014no mat-ter whether the subject is religious, scientic, or unconven-tionally open-minded? The child's soul does not receive thenecessary sustenance, for empty phrases cannot offer propernourishment to the soul. This, in turn, lets loose the lowerinstincts. You can see it happening in the social life of EasternEurope, where, through Leninism and T rotskyism, an attemptwas made to establish the rule of the phrase. This, of course,can never work creatively and in Soviet Russia, therefore, theworst instincts have risen from the lower regions. For thesame reason, instincts have risen up and come to the fore inour own younger generation. Such instincts are not evenunhealthy in every respect, but they show that the older gen-eration has been unable to endow language with the necessarysoul qualities. Basically, the problems presented by our youngare consequences of problems within the adult world; at leastwhen regarded in a certain light, they are parents' problems.When meeting the young, we create all too easily an impres-sion of being frightfully clever, making them feel frightfullystupid, whereas those who are able to learn from children aremostly the wisest people. If one does not approach the youngwith empty phrases, one meets them in a totally different way.The relationship between the younger generation and the4chapter 133 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 133 adult world reflects our not having given it sufcient warmth of soul. This has contributed to their present character. Thatwe must not blame everything that has gone wrong entirelyon the younger generation becomes clearly evident, dearfriends, by their response to what is being done for our youngpeople in the Waldorf school, even during the short time ofits existence. As you have seen already, Waldorf education is primarily a question of nding the right teachers. I must confess thatwhenever I come to Stuttgart to visit and assist in the guid-ance of the Waldorf school\u2014which unfortunately happensonly seldom\u2014I ask the same question in each class, naturallywithin the appropriate context and avoiding any possibletedium, \"Children, do you love your teachers?\" You shouldhear and witness the enthusiasm with which they call out inchorus, \"Yes!\" This call to the teachers to engender love withintheir pupils is all part of the question of how the older genera-tion should relate to the young. In this context, it seemsappropriate to mention that we decided from the beginning toopen a complete primary school, comprising all eight classesin order to cover the entire age range of an elementaryschool. 5 And sometimes, when entering the school building, one could feel quite alarmed at the apparent lack of discipline,especially during break times. Those who jump to judgmenttoo quickly said, \"You see what a free Waldorf school is like!The pupils lose all sense of discipline.\" What they did notrealize was that the pupils who had come to us from otherschools had been brought up under so-called \"iron discipline.\"Actually, they have already calmed down considerably but,when they rst arrived under the influence of their previous\"iron discipline,\" they were real scamps. The only ones who 5. Six to fourteen.4chapter 134 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 134 were moderately well-behaved were the rst graders who had come directly from their parental homes\u2014and even then, thiswas not always the case. Nevertheless, whenever I visit theWaldorf school, I notice a distinct improvement in discipline.And now, after a little more than two years of existence, onecan see a great change. Our pupils certainly won't turn into\"apple-polishers\" but they know that, if something goeswrong, they can always approach their teachers and trust themto enter into the matter sympathetically. This makes thepupils ready to conde. They may be noisy and full of boister-ous energy\u2014they certainly are not inhibited\u2014but they arechanging, and what can be expected in matters of discipline isgradually evolving. What I called in my lecture a natural senseof authority is also steadily growing. For example, it is truly reassuring to hear the following report. A pupil entered the Waldorf school. He was alreadyfourteen years old and was therefore placed into our top class.When he arrived, he was a thoroughly discontented boy whohad lost all faith in his previous school. Obviously, a newschool cannot offer a panacea to such a boy in the rst fewdays. The Waldorf school must be viewed as a whole\u2014if youwere to cut a small piece from a painting, you could hardlygive a sound judgment on the whole painting. There are peo-ple, for instance, who believe that they know all about theWaldorf school after having visited it for only one or two days.This is nonsense. One cannot become fully acquainted withthe methods of anthroposophy merely by sampling a few ofthem. One must experience the spirit pervading the wholework. And so it was for the disgruntled boy who entered ourschool so late in the day. Naturally, what he encountered thereduring the rst few days could hardly give him the inner peaceand satisfaction for which he was hoping. After some time,however, he approached his history teacher, who had made a4chapter 135 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 135 deep impression on him. The boy wanted to speak with this teacher, to whom he felt he could open his heart and tell of histroubles. This conversation brought about a complete changein the boy. Such a thing is only possible through the innersense of authority of which I have spoken. These thingsbecome clear when this matter-of-fact authority has arisen byvirtue of the quality of the teachers and their teaching. I don'tthink that I am being premature in saying that the young peo-ple who are now passing through the Waldorf school are hardlylikely to exhibit the spirit of non-cooperation with the oldergeneration of which the previous speaker spoke. It is really upto the teachers to play their parts in directing the negativeaspects of the \"storm and stress\" fermenting in our youth intothe right channels. In the Waldorf school, we hold regular teacher meetings that differ substantially from those in other schools. During thosemeetings, each child is considered in turn and is discussed froma psychological point of view. All of us have learned a very greatdeal during these two years of practicing Waldorf pedagogy.This way of educating the young has truly grown into oneorganic whole. We would not have been able to found our Waldorf school if we had not been prepared to make certain compromises. Rightat the beginning, I drafted a memorandum that was sent to theeducation authorities. In it, we pledged to bring our pupils intheir ninth year up to the generally accepted standards of learn-ing, thus enabling them to enter another school if they sodesired. The same generally accepted levels of achievementwere to be reached in their twelfth and again in their four-teenth year. But, regarding our methods of teaching, werequested full freedom for the intervening years. This does con-stitute a compromise, but one must work within the given situ-ation. It gave us the possibility of putting into practice what we4chapter 136 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 136 considered to be essential for a healthy and right way of teach- ing. As an example, consider the case of school reports. Frommy childhood reports I recall certain phrases, such as \"almostpraiseworthy,\" \"hardly satisfactory\" and so on. But I never suc-ceeded in discovering the wisdom behind my teachers' distinc-tion of a \"hardly satisfactory\" from an \"almost satisfactory\"mark. You must bear with me, but this is exactly how it was. Inthe Waldorf school, instead of such stereotyped phrases ornumerical marks, we write reports in which teachers express intheir own style how each pupil has fared during the year. Ourreports do not contain abstract remarks that must seem likemere empty phrases to the child. For, if something makes nosense, it is a mere phrase. As each child gradually grows up intolife, the teachers write in their school reports what each pupilneeds to know about him- or herself. Each report thus containsits own individual message, representing a kind of biography ofthe pupil's life at school during the previous school year. Fur-thermore, we end our reports with a little verse, specially com-posed for each child, epitomizing the year's progress. Naturally,writing this kind of report demands a great deal of time. Butthe child receives a kind of mirror of itself. So far, I have notcome across a single student who did not show genuine interestin his or her report, even if it contained some real home truths.Especially the aptly chosen verse at the end is something thatcan become of real educational value to the child. One mustmake use of all means possible to call forth in the children thefeeling that their guides and educators have taken the task ofwriting these reports very seriously, and that they have done sonot in a onesided manner, but from a direct and genuine inter-est in their charges. A great deal depends on our freeing our-selves from the clich\u00e9-ridden cultivation of the phrase socharacteristic of our times, and on our showing the right kindof understanding for the younger generation. I am well aware4chapter 137 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 137 that this is also connected with psychological predispositions of a more national character, and to gain mastery over these is aneven more difcult task. It might surprise you to hear that in none of the various anthroposophical conferences that we have held during thepast few months was there any lack of younger members.They were always there and I never minced my words whenspeaking to them. But they soon realized that I was notaddressing them with clich\u00e9s or empty phrases. Even if theyheard something very different from what they had expected,they could feel that what I said came straight from the heart,as all words of real value do. During our last conference inStuttgart in particular, a number of young persons represent-ing the youth movement were again present and, after a con-versation with them lasting some one-and-a-half or two hours,it was unanimously decided to actually found an anthropo-sophical youth group, and this despite the fact that youngpeople do not usually value anything even vaguely connectedwith authority, for they believe that everything has to growfrom within, out of themselves, a principle that they were cer-tainly not prepared to abandon. What really matters is how the adults meet the young, how they approach them. From experience\u2014many times con-rmed\u2014I can only point out that this whole question of theyounger generation is often a question of the older generation.As such, it can perhaps be best answered by looking a little lessat the younger generation and looking a little more deeply intoourselves. A PERSON FROM THE AUDIENCE : Perhaps, at this point, a member of the younger generationmight be allowed to speak up. Please forgive my speakingplainly, but the truth is that we younger people have lost all4chapter 138 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 138 respect for authority, for older people. Why? because our par- ents, too, have lost it. When talking to them or to otheradults, we nd that all that they can do is to criticize all kindsof unimportant, niggling things in others\u2014thus showing theirown generation in a bad light. We young people sometimesfeel that those who are trying to educate us have become walk-ing compromises, incapable of making up their minds onwhich side they stand, unable to state from the fullness oftheir hearts what their opinions are, unable to stand up forwhat they believe in. And we all the time have the feeling thatour parents and educators do not in fact want to learn whatwe young are really like. Instead, they keep criticizing andcondemning us. I need only to think of how we in our youthcircle work together and what kind of things we study. Forinstance, we have read and discussed together Bl\u00fcchner andMorgenstern. Just imagine those two polar opposites! Thissort of thing happens with us all the time. Events in the worldbuffet us and nowhere can we nd a center to give us a rmgrasp. Nowhere can we nd a really living person who canstand above it all with a comprehensive viewpoint\u2014not even aperson who can do so conceptually. How is it possible to teachunless behind everything that is taught there is a real livinghuman being, whom one can feel coming through his or herteaching? . . . If that were to happen, it would rouse our enthu-siasm. But, as long as our teachers do not approach us ashuman beings, as long as they are afraid even, sometimes, tolaugh at themselves, we simply cannot feel the necessary con-dence in them. I can say with complete conviction that weyoung people are really seeking adults to whom we can lookup as authorities. We are looking for a center, for a rm gripwith which we can pull ourselves up and that would enable usto grow into the kind of life that has an inner reality. That iswhy we throw ourselves into everything new that appears on4chapter 139 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 139 the horizon: we always hope to discover something that could have a real meaning for us. But whenever this happens, wend nothing but a confusion of opinions and attitudes. Wend judgments that are not real judgments at all, but are atbest only criticisms. If I may say something to the rst speaker, who asked for a book to explain why young people behave as they do, I say:Don't read a book. To nd an answer, read us young people! Ifyou want to talk to the younger generation, you must approachthem as living human beings. You must be ready to open your-self to them. Young people will then do the same and young andold will become clear about what each is looking for. QUESTIONER: As a teacher, I would like to ask Dr. Steiner whether he himselfdoes not believe what the rst speaker in today's discussionbrought up; namely, that a quite new mood and spirit are stir-ring among young people today. This might perhaps be moreevident in the larger cities, where even teachers with a deeplyhuman attitude are no longer able to cope with difculties asthey were able to some fty years ago. The source of the prob-lem has been rightly sought in the older generation. Neverthe-less, it cannot be denied that today's youth, under the influenceof social-democratic ideas, is pervaded by skepticism to theextent that a teacher of Dr. Steiner's persuasion might not beable to imagine the kind of insolence and arrogance with whichwe have to put up. Socialistic contradictions are rife among theyoung, creating a false urge for independence in them thatmakes the teachers' tasks far more difcult than they were sometime ago. Indeed, our job is now often almost impossible.What Dr. Steiner said gave the impression that the behavior ofour youth merely reflects the shortcomings of their teachers.Certainly, teachers must take their share of the blame, but is it4chapter 140 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 140 all the teachers' fault? Are all teachers to blame? That is the question. Is it not the case that the few good teachers, who arenot to blame, nevertheless bluntly state that a new and differ-ent kind of youth has appeared and that lack of faith and skep-ticism among them makes the teacher's task far more difcult? RUDOLF STEINER: Well, if you put the question in this way, it is impossible tomove forward. Putting it thus will not produce anything fruit-ful. It is the wrong way to begin. T o declare that young peoplehave changed and that it might have been easier to deal withthem fty years ago is not the point at all; the crux of the mat-ter is to nd ways and means of coping with the problem.After all, the younger generation is there, growing up in ourmidst. Nor is it productive to speak of our youth as being ledinto skepticism by social-democratic prejudices. That is asfutile as if one were to criticize something in nature because itwas growing in an undesirable way\u2014and that is what is hap-pening with the young. They are growing up among us likeproducts of nature. Rather than stating the fact that the younghave changed, and that perhaps it was easier to deal with themfty years ago, the only way forward is to nd ways and meansof enabling the older generation to cooperate with the youngagain. We shall nd no answer if we merely point out thattoday's youth is different from what it was fty years ago, as ifthis were something to be accepted more or less fatalistically.That kind of attitude will never lead us to nd an answer tothis problem. Of course, the young have changed! And, if weobserve life, we can see that the change has its positive aspects,too\u2014that we could speak of it as a change toward somethinggreater. Let me remind you, for instance, of the generationalconflicts that we nd expressed in literature. You can readthem or see them performed on the stage. You still sometimes4chapter 141 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 141 come across performances of plays from the late 1880s when the relationship between the younger and older generation wasvividly portrayed. You will see that what we are discussing is anage-old problem. It has been regarded for centuries as a kindof catastrophe. By comparison, what is happening today ismere child's play! But, as I said before, merely to state facts willnot lead us further. The question everywhere is how to regain the lost respect for authority in individual human beings that will enable youas teachers and educators to nd the right relationship to theyoung. That it is generally correct to state that young peopledo not nd the necessary conditions for such a respect andsense of authority in the older generation and that they ndamong its members an attitude of compromise is in itself, inmy opinion, no evidence against what I have said. This striv-ing for compromise can be found on a much wider scale evenin world events, so that the question of how to regain respectfor human authority and dignity could be extended to aworldwide level. I would like to add that\u2014of course\u2014I real-ize that there exist good and devoted teachers as described bythe last speaker. But the pupils usually behave differentlywhen taught by those good teachers. If one discriminates, onecan observe that the young respond quite differently in theircompany. We must not let ourselves be led into an attitude of com- plaining and doubting by judgments that are too strongly col-ored by our own hypotheses, but must be clear that ultimatelythe way in which the younger generation behaves is, in gen-eral, conditioned by the older generation. My observationswere not meant to imply that teachers were to be held solelyresponsible for the faults of the young. At this point, I feelrather tempted to point to how lack of respect for authority isrevealed in its worst light when we look at some of the events4chapter 142 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 142 of recent history. Only remember certain moments during the last, catastrophic war. There was a need to replace older, lead-ing personalities. What kind of person was chosen? In France,Clemenceau, in Germany, Hertling\u2014all old men of the mostancient kind who carried a certain authority only because theyhad once been important personalities. But they were nolonger the kind of person who could take his or her stancefrom a direct grasp of the then current situation. And what ishappening now? Only recently the prime ministers of threeleading countries found their positions seriously jeopardized.Yet all three are still in ofce, simply because no other candi-date could be found who carried sufcient weight of author-ity! That was the only reason for their survival as primeministers. And so we nd that, in important world happen-ings, too, a general sense of authority has been undermined,even in leading gures. You can hardly blame the younger gen-eration for that! But these symptoms have a shattering effecton the young who witness them. We really have to tackle this whole question at a deeper level and, above all, in a more positive light. We must be clear that,instead of complaining about the ways in which the youngconfront their elders, we should be thinking of how we canimprove our own attitude toward young. To continue tellingthem how wrong they are and that it is no longer possible tocooperate with them can never lead to progress. In order towork toward a more fruitful future, we must look for what thespiritual cultural sphere, and life in general, can offer to help usregain respect and trust in the older generation. Those whoknow the young know that they are only too happy when theycan have faith in their elders again. This is really true. Theirskepticism ceases as soon as they can nd something of realvalue, something in which they can believe. Generally speak-ing, we cannot yet say that life is ruled by what is right. But, if4chapter 143 Thu Aug 31 10:30:20 1995 The Fundamentals of Waldorf Education 143 we offer our youth something true, they will feel attracted to it. If we no longer believe this to be the case, if all that we do ismoan and groan about youth's failings, then we shall achievenothing at all.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 144 5 Educational Methods Based on Anthroposophy CHRISTIANIA (OSLO) \u2014 NOVEMBER 23, 1921 PART I First, I would like to thank the Vice Chancellor of this Uni- versity, and you yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, for your friendly welcome. I hope that I can make myself understood, despite my inability to speak your language. Indeed, I apolo-gize for my lack in that respect. The theme that I shall present tonight and tomorrow night is the educational principles and methods based on anthro- posophy. And so, here, right at the beginning, I must ask younot to look on the aims of anthroposophy as wishing to be inany way subversive or revolutionary\u2014 with respect either to scientific matters or any of the other many aspects of life where anthroposophy seeks to be productive. On the contrary, anthroposophy seeks only to deepen and develop what has already been prepared by the recent spiritualculture of humanity. However, because of anthroposophy's deepened insight into human life and knowledge of the uni- verse, it necessarily looks for a corresponding deepening andinsight in contemporary scientific thinking. Likewise, it alsolooks for different ways of working practically in life\u2014differ- ent from more accustomed and conventional ways.Educational Methods\u2014I 145 Because of this, anthroposophy has found itself opposed by representatives of the spirit of the day. But it does not want to become involved in hostilities of this kind, nor does it wish to engage in controversy. Rather, it aims to guide the fundamentalachievements of modern civilization toward a fruitful goal. This is the case, above all, in the field of education. Apart from my small publication, The Education of the Child from the Viewpoint of Spiritual Science , published several years ago, I had no particular reason to publish a more detailed account of oureducational views until, with the help of Emil Molt, the Wal- dorf school in Stuttgart was founded. 1 With the founding of the Waldorf school, anthroposophy's contribution to the field of education entered the publicdomain. The Free Waldorf school itself is the outcome of long- ings that made themselves felt in many different parts of Cen- tral Europe after the end of the last, catastrophic war. One of the many topics discussed during that time was the realization that perhaps the most important of all social ques- tions was about education. And, prompted by purely practical considerations, Emil Molt founded the Free Waldorf school,originally for the children of the employees of his Waldorf Asto-ria Factory. At first, therefore, we only had children whose par- ents were directly connected with Molt's factory. During the last two years, however, children from different backgrounds havealso entered the school. Hence, the Waldorf school in Stuttgarttoday educates children from a wide range of backgrounds and classes. All of these children can benefit from an education based on anthroposophy. In education, above all, anthroposophy doesnot wish to introduce revolutionary ideas, but seeks only toextend and supplement already existing achievements. T o appre- ciate those, one need only draw attention to the contribution of 1. See note 16, lecture 1.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 146 the great educators of the nineteenth and early twentieth centu- ries. Anyone with education at heart can feel only enthusiasm for their comprehensive ideas and powerful principles. Yet, despite all of this, there remain urgent problems in our present education. As a result, not a year passes in which alonging for the renewal of education does not make itself felt in society. Why should it be that, on one hand, we can be enthusiastic about the convincing educational ideas expressed by the greateducators of our times, while, on the other, we experience a certain disenchantment and dissatisfaction in how education is carried out? Let me give just one example. Pestalozzi has become world famous. 2 He certainly belongs among the great educators of our time. Nevertheless, thinkers of Herbert Spencer's caliber3 have pointed out in the strongest terms that, although one might be in full agreement with Pestalozzi's educational princi-ples, one cannot help realizing that the great expectations raised by them have not been fulfilled with their practical application. Decades ago, Spencer already concluded thatdespite Pestalozzi's sound and even excellent pedagogical ideas,we are unable at present to apply his general principles in prac- tical classroom situations. I wish to repeat, ladies and gentle- men, that it is not new ideas that anthroposophy wants tointroduce. Anthroposophy is mainly concerned with actualteaching practice. Just as the Waldorf school in Stuttgart grew out of the imme- diate needs of a given life situation, what exists today as anthro-posophical pedagogy and the anthroposophical method of 2. Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827), Swiss educator. 3. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), English philosopher. See his work Educa- tion [1861].Educational Methods\u2014I 147 education is not a product of theories or abstract principles but grows out of the need to deal practically with human affairs. Anthroposophy feels confident of being able to offer specific contributions for solution of human problems, particularly inthe realm of education. What, then, are the fundamentals ofthis anthroposophy? Anthroposophy has frequently drawn hostility and opposi- tion, not because of an understanding of what it seeks to accom-plish for the world, but rather because of misconceptionsregarding it. Those within anthroposophy fully understand such hostility. For, on the basis of natural science and the cultural achievements of our times, modern humanity generally believesitself to have found a unified conception of the world. Anthro-posophy then steps in with a call to our contemporaries to think about themselves and the world in an apparently quite different way. The contradiction, however, is only apparent. But peoplethink initially that the insights provided by anthroposophy can-not be reconciled with the claims made by natural science. T oday, the human physical and bodily constitution is being thoroughly studied, on solid grounds, following the admirableand exact methods of modern natural science. And, as far asthe human soul is concerned, its existence is no longer gener- ally denied. On the contrary, the number of those who deny the existence of the soul and speak of \"human psychology with-out a soul,\" as many did for a time, has already dwindled. Yetthe soul itself is only observed by means of research into its physical aspects and by guesswork done on the basis of physical manifestations. Under such conditions, it is impossible toderive an educational practice, even with the best of theoriesand premises. Thus, Herbert Spencer profoundly regrets the lack of a proper psychology for modern educational principles. But atrue child psychology cannot possibly grow from the modernWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 148 natural-scientific view of life. Anthroposophy, on the other had, believes that it is able to offer the basis for a true psychol- ogy, for real care of the human soul. However, it is a psychol- ogy, a care of the soul, that admittedly requires an approachvery different from that of other contemporary psychologicalinvestigations. It is all too easy to poke fun at anthroposophists who speak of other supersensible bodies, or sheaths, in addition to the physi-cal body. It is often said that anthroposophy, when it speaks ofthe etheric body, which I also call the \"body of formative forces,\" has invented or built up some strange fantasy, vision, or illusion. What anthroposophy says, however, is simply that ahuman being possesses not only a sense-perceptible, physicalbody (that can be examined according to established medical practice and whose underlying natural laws can be grasped by our intellectual capacity to systematize manifold phenomena)but also an etheric body, or a body of formative forces, that is of a more refined nature than the physical body and\u2014apart from the etheric body\u2014a still higher and more refined member of the human being, called the astral body. In anthroposophy, fur- thermore, we also speak of a very special aspect of the humanbeing, which is summarized only by each individual's own self- awareness and is expressed by the word \"I.\" At first, there seems to be little justification for speaking of these higher aspects of the human being. By way of introduc-tion, however, I would like to show how in actual and practi- cal life situations\u2014which are the basis of our educational views\u2014anthroposophy speaks about, for example, the human etheric body . This etheric body is not a nebulous cloud that is somehow membered into the physical body and perhaps extends a little beyond it here and ther e. I nitially , of course, it is possible toimagine it like this but in reality it appears quite differently toEducational Methods\u2014I 149 anyone using anthroposophical methods of observation. The etheric body, in fact, is primarily a kind of regulatory agency and points to something that belongs, not so much to the human spatial organization, but to something of the nature ofa \"time organism.\" When we study the human physical body, according to present day natural-scientific methods, we know that we can do so by studying its various organic parts\u2014such as the liver,the stomach, or the heart\u2014as separate entities. But we can alsostudy those same organs from the viewpoint of their various functions and interrelationships within the whole human organism. We cannot understand certain areas of the humanbrain, for example, without knowing how they affect otherorgans, such as the liver, the stomach, and so on, effects that are instrumental in regulating the nourishment of those organs. We thus look upon the spatial, physical organism as having itsown specific interrelationships. We see the physical organism assomething in which single members affect each other in defi- nite and determined ways. Anthroposophy sees what it calls the human etheric body in the same way. It assigns to it an existence in time, but not inspace as in the case of the physical body. What we call the human etheric body manifests itself at birth or, rather, concep- tion and continues to develop through life until the point ofdeath. Disregarding the fact that a person can die before his or her natural life span has been reached, let us for the moment con- sider the normal course of a human life\u2014in which case we maysay that the etheric body continues its development throughold age until the moment of death. In what develops in this way, anthroposophical investigation sees an organic wholeness. Indeed, as the human spatial body iscomposed of various members\u2014such as the head as the carrierWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 150 of the brain, the chest organs as carriers of speech and breath- ing, and so on\u2014so what manifests as the human etheric orga- nization is likewise composed of various life periods, one following the other in the flow of time. We thus distinguishbetween the various component parts of the etheric body\u2014which, as already stated, must be observed as existing in time and as consisting of spatially separated parts\u2014by first consider- ing the period from approximately a child's birth to its changeof teeth. We can see an important part of the etheric body inthis life period, just as we can see the head or the lungs in the physical body. Thereafter, we see its second member lasting from the second dentition until puberty and, though lessclearly differentiated, we can also distinguish further life peri-ods during the subsequent course of life. Thus, for instance, at the twentieth year, a completely new quality in a person's psy- chic and physical life begins to manifest. But, just as, for exam-ple, the cause of certain headaches can be traced tomalfunctioning of the stomach or the liver, so can certain pro- cesses undergone in one's twenties or even during later life be traced back to definite happenings during the time betweenbirth and the change of teeth. Just as it is possible to see pro-cesses of digestion affecting processes occurring in the brain, so is it possible to see the effects of what happened during a child's first seven years of life up, to the second dentition, expressed inthe latest period of adult life. When studying psychology, we generally find that only the present situation of a person's soul life is observed. Characteris- tics of a child's capacity of comprehension, memory, and so onare observed. Without wishing to neglect those aspects, stu-dents of anthroposophy must also ask themselves the following kind of question. If a child becomes subject to certain influ- ences, say in the ninth year, how does that affect the deeperregions of his or her etheric psychic life and in what form will itEducational Methods\u2014I 151 re-emerge later on? I would like to illustrate this in more detail by giving you a practical example. By means of our pedagogical approach, we can convey to a child still at a tender age a feeling of reverence and respect forwhat is sublime in the world. We can enhance that feeling intoa religious mood through which a child can learn how to pray. I am purposely choosing a somewhat radical example of a moral nature. Thus, let us suppose that we guide a child so that it canlet such a mood of soul flow into a sincere prayer. This moodwill take possession of the child, entering the deeper regions of its consciousness. And, if we observe not only the present state of a person's soul life but his or her whole psychic constitutiona s i t d e v e l o p s u p t o t h e m o m e n t o f d e a t h , w e w i l l f i n d t h a twhat came into existence through the reverence felt by the praying child goes \"underground\" to be transmuted in the depths of the soul. At a certain point, perhaps not before theperson's thirties or forties, what was present in the devotionalattitude of a praying child resurfaces as a power of blessing, emanating from the words spoken by such a person\u2014especially when he or she addresses children. In this way, we can study the whole human being in relation to his or her soul development. As we relate the physical to the spatial\u2014for example, the stomach to the head\u2014so can we relate and study through the course of a life what the power of prayermight have planted in a child, perhaps in the eighth or ninthyear. We may see it re-emerge in older age as the power to bless, as a force of blessing, particularly when meeting the young. One could put this into the following words\u2014unless one has learnedto pray in childhood in a true and honest manner, one cannotspread an air of blessing in one's forties or fifties. I have purposely chosen this somewhat radical example and those among you who are not of a religious disposition willhave to take it more in its formal meaning. Namely, what IWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 152 wanted to point out was that, according to anthroposophical pedagogy, it is not just the present situation of a child's soul life that must be considered; rather, the entire course of a human life must be included in one's considerations. How such an atti-tude affects one's pedagogical work will become plainly visible.Whatever a teacher or educator might be planning or preparing regarding any educational activity, there will always be the question in mind, what will be the consequences in later life ofwhat I am doing now with the child? Such an attitude willstimulate an organic, that is, a living pedagogy. It is so easy to feel tempted to teach children clearly defined and sharply contoured concepts representing strict and fixeddefinitions. If one does so, it is as if one were putting a youngchild's arms or legs, which are destined to continue their growth freely until a certain age, into rigid fetters. Apart from looking after a child's other physical needs, we must also ensurethat its limbs grow naturally, unconstricted, especially while itis still at the growing stage. Similarly, we must plant into a child's soul only concepts, ideas, feelings, and will impulses that, because they are not fixed into sharp and final contours,are capable of further development. Rigid concepts would havethe effect of fettering a child's soul life instead of allowing it to evolve freely and flexibly. Only by avoiding rigidity can we hope that what we plant into a child's heart will emerge duringlater life in the right way. What, then, are the essentials of an anthroposophically based education? They have to do with real insight into human nature. This is something that has become almost impossibleon the basis of contemporary natural science and the scientificconception of the world. In saying this, I do not wish to imply any disregard for the achievements of psychology and peda- gogy. These sciences are the necessary outcome of the spirit ofour times. Within certain limits, they have their blessings.Educational Methods\u2014I 153 Anthroposophy has no wish to become embroiled in contro- versy here either. It seeks only to further the benefits that these sciences have created. On the other hand, we must also ask what the longing for scientific experimentation with childrenmeans. What does one seek to discover through experiments inchildren's powers of comprehension, receptivity to sense impressions, memory, and even will? All of this shows only that, in our present civilization, the direct and elementary rela-tionship of one soul to another has been weakened. For weresort today increasingly to external physical experimentation rather than to a natural and immediate rapport with the child, as was the case in earlier times. T o counterbalance such experi-mental studies, we must create new awareness and knowledgeof the child's soul. This must be the basis of a healthy peda- gogy. But, to do so, we must become thoroughly familiar with what I have already said about the course of an individual's life.This means that we must have a clear perception of the first lifeperiod, which begins at birth or conception, and reaches a cer- tain conclusion when the child exchanges its milk teeth. T o a n y o n e w i t h a n u n b i a s e d s e n s e o f o b s e r v a t i o n , a c h i l d appears completely changed at the time of the change ofteeth\u2014the child appears different, another being. Only if we can observe such a phenomenon, however, can we reach a real knowledge of human beings. Our understanding of the higher principles of the world has not kept pace with what natural science demands of our under- standing of the lower principles. I need only remind you of what science says about \"latent heat.\" This is heat contained bya physical substance without being outwardly detectable. But,when such a substance is subjected to certain outer conditions, the heat radiates outward, emitting what is then called \"liber- ated heat.\" Science today speaks of forces and interrelationshipsof substances in the inorganic realm, but scientists do not yetWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 154 dare to use such exact methods to deal with phenomena in the human realm. Consequently, what is said of body, soul, and spirit remains abstract and leaves those three aspects of the human being standing beside one another, as it were, with noreal interconnection. We can observe the child growing upuntil the change of teeth and, if we do so without preconcep- tions, we can detect how, just after this event, the child's mem- ory assumes a different character; how certain faculties andabilities of thinking begin to manifest; how memory worksthrough more sharply delineated concepts, and so on. We can observe that the inner soul condition of the child undergoes a definite change after the second dentition. But what exactlyhappened in the child? T oday, I can only point in certain directions. Further details can be found with the help of natural science. When observing a child growing up from the earliest stage until the secondteeth appear, one can discern the gradual manifestation of aninner quality, emerging from the depths and surfacing in the outer organization. One can see above all how, during those years, the head system develops. If we observe this develop-ment without preconceptions, we can detect a current flowingthrough the child, from below upward. At first, a young baby, in a state of helplessness, is unable to walk. It has to lie all the t i m e a n d b e c a r r i e d e v e r y w h e r e . T h e n , a s m o n t h s p a s s , w eobserve a strong force of will, expressed in uncoordinated,jerky movements of the limbs, that gradually leads to the fac- ulty of walking. That powerful force, working upward from the limb system, also works back upon the entire organizationof the child. And, if we make a proper investigation of the metamorpho- sis of the head, from the stage when the child has to lie all the time and be carried everywhere to the time when it is able tostand on its own legs and walk\u2014which contemporary scienceEducational Methods\u2014I 155 also clearly shows us and is obvious physiologically, if we learn to look in the right direction\u2014then we find how what mani- fests in the child's limb system as the impulse for walking is related to the area of the brain that represents the will organiza-tion. We can put this into words as follows. As young childrenare learning to walk, they are developing in their brains\u2014from below upward, from the lower limbs and in a certain way from the periphery toward the center\u2014their will organization. In other words: when learning to walk, a child develops the will organization of the brain through the will activity of its lower limbs. If we now continue our observation of the growing child, we see the next important phase occur in the strengthening of thebreathing organization. The breathing assumes what I should like to call a more individual constitution, just as the limb sys- tem did through the activity of walking. And this transforma-tion and strengthening of the breathing\u2014which one canobserve physiologically\u2014is expressed in the whole activity of speaking . In this instance, there is again a streaming in the human organization from below upward. We can follow quite clearlywhat a young person integrates into the nervous system by means of language. We can see how, in learning to speak, ever greater inwardness of feeling begins to radiate outward. As ahuman being, learning to walk becomes integrated into the willsphere of the nervous system, so, in learning to speak, the child's feeling life likewise becomes integrated. A last stage can be seen in an occurrence that is least observ- able outwardly and that happens during the second dentition.Certain forces that had been active in the child's organism, indwelling it, come to completion, for the child will not have another change of teeth. The coming of the second teethreveals that forces that have been at work in the entire organ-Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 156 ism have come to the end of their task. And so, just as we see that a child's will life is inwardly established through the ability to walk, and that a child's feeling life is inwardly established by i t s l e a r n i n g t o s p e a k s o , a t t h e t i m e o f t h e c h a n g e o f t e e t h ,around the seventh year, we see the faculty of mental picturingor thinking develop in a more or less individualized form that is no longer bound to the entire bodily organization, as previ- ously. These are interesting interrelationships that need to be stud- ied more closely. They show how what I earlier called the etheric body works back into the physical body. What happens is that, with the change of teeth, a child integrates the rest of itsorganization into the head and the nerves. We can talk about these things theoretically, but nothing is g ain ed b y t ha t. La tel y , w e h av e bec om e to o a cc u s t om ed t o a kind of intellectualism, to certain forces of abstraction, whentalking about scientific matters. What I described just nowhelps you to look at the growing human being not just intellec- tually: I have been trying to guide you to a more artistic way of observing growing human beings. This involves experiencinghow every movement of a child's limbs is integrated into its willorganization and how feeling is integrated as the child learns to speak. It is wonderful to see, for example, what happens when someone\u2014perhaps the mother or another\u2014is with the childwhen it learns to speak the vowels . A quality corresponding to the soul being of the adult who is in the child's presence flows into the child's feeling through these vowels. On the other hand, everything that stimulates the child to perform its ownmovements in relation to the external world\u2014such as findingthe right relationship to warmth or coldness\u2014leads to the speaking of consonants . It is wonderful to see how one part of the human organism, say moving of limbs or language, worksback into another part. As teachers, we meet a child of schoolEducational Methods\u2014I 157 age when his or her second teeth are gradually appearing. Just at this time we can see how a force (not unlike latent heat) is liberated from the general growth process of the organism: what previously was at work within the organism is now activein the child's soul life. When we experience all of this, we can-not but feel inspired by what is happening before our eyes. But these things must not be grasped with the intellect; they must be absorbed with one's whole being. If we do this, then aconcrete, artistic sense will pervade our observations of thegrowing child. Anthroposophy offers practical guidance in rec- ognizing the spirit as it manifests in outer, material processes. Anthroposophy does not want to lead people into any kind ofmystical \"cloud cuckoo land.\" It wants to follow the spiritworking in matter. In order to be able to do this\u2014to follow the spirit in its creativity, its effectiveness\u2014anthroposophy must stand on firm ground and requires the involvement of wholehuman beings. In bringing anthroposophy into the field ofeducation, we do not wish to be dogmatic. The Waldorf school is not meant to be an ideological school. It is meant to be a school where what we can gain through anthroposophy withliving inwardness can flow into practical teaching methods andactual teaching skills. What anthroposophy gives as a conception of the world and an understanding of life assigns a special role to the teachersand educators in our school. Here and there, a certain faith in life beyond death has remained alive in our present culture and civilization. On the other hand, knowledge of human life beyond death up to anew birth on earth has become completely lost. Anthroposophical research makes it clear that we must speak of human pre-existence, of a soul-spiritual existence before birth. It shows how this can rightly illumine embryology.T oday, one considers embryology as if what a human beingWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 158 brought with him into earthly life were merely a matter of heredity, of the physical effects of forces stemming from the child's ancestors. This is quite understandable and we do not wish to remonstrate against such an attitude. In accordancewith accepted modern methods, research is done into how thehuman germ develops in the maternal body. Researchers try to trace in the bodies of the mother and the father, in the parents' bodies, the forces that manifest in the child and so on. Butthings are just not like that. What is actually happening in theparents' bodies is not a process of construction but, to begin with, one of destruction. Initially, there is a return of the mate- rial processes to a state of chaos. And what plays into the bodyof an expectant mother is the entire cosmos itself. If one has the necessary basis of observation, one can per- ceive how the embryo, especially during the first months of pregnancy, is formed not only by the forces of heredity, but bythe entire cosmos. The maternal body is in truth the matrix forwhat is formed through cosmic forces, out of a state of chaos, into the human embryo. It is quite possible to study these things on the basis of the existing knowledge in physiology, but we will in time regardthem from an entirely different viewpoint. We would consider it sheer folly if a physicist claimed, \"Here is a magnetic needle, one end of which points north while the opposite end pointssouth: we must look for the force activating the needle withinthe space of the compass needle itself.\" That would be consid- ered nonsense in physics. T o explain the phenomenon, we must consider the whole earth. We say that the whole earthacts as a kind of magnet, attracting one end of the needle fromits north pole and the other from its south pole. In the direc- tion seeking of the compass needle, we observe only one part of a whole complex phenomenon; to understand the wholephenomenon, we must go far beyond the physical boundary ofEducational Methods\u2014I 159 the needle itself. The exact sciences have not yet shown a simi- lar attitude in their investigations of human beings. When studying a most important process, such as the formation of the embryo, the attitude is as limited as if one were to seek themotivating force of a compass needle within the needle itself.That would be considered folly in physics. When we try to dis- cover the forces forming the embryo within the physical boundaries of human beings, we behave just as if we were try-ing to find the forces moving a compass needle within thephysical needle itself. T o find the forces forming the human embryo, we must look into the entire cosmos. What works in this way into the embryo is directly linked to the soul-spiritualbeing of the one to be born as it descends from the soul-spiri-tual worlds into physical existence. Here, anthroposophy shows us\u2014however paradoxical it might sound\u2014that, at first, the soul-spiritual part of thehuman being has least connection with the organization of the head. As a baby begins its earthly existence, its prenatal spirit and soul are linked to the rest of the organism excluding the head. The head is a kind of picture of the cosmos but, at thesame time, it is the most material part of the body. One couldsay that at the beginning of human life, the head is least the carrier of the prenatal soul-spiritual life that has come down to begin life on earth. Those who observe what takes place in a growing child from an anthroposophical point of view see that soul-spiritual quali- ties, at first concealed in the child, come to the surface in every facial expression, in the entire physiognomy, and in the expres-sion of the child's eyes. They also see how those soul-spiritualelements manifest initially in the development of the limb movements\u2014from crawling to the child's free walking\u2014and next in the impulse to speak, which is closely connected withthe respiratory system. They then see how these elements workWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 160 in the child's organism to bring forth the second teeth. They see, too, how the forces of spirit and soul work upward from below, importing from the outer world what must be taken in u n c o n s c i o u s l y a t f i r s t , i n o r d e r t o i n t e g r a t e i t t h e n i n t o t h emost material part of the human being\u2014the organization ofthe head in thinking, feeling, and willing. T o observe the growing human being in this way, with a sci- entific artistic eye, indicates the kind of relationship to childrenthat is required if we, their teachers, are to fulfill our tasks ade-quately as full human beings. A very special inner feeling is engendered when teachers believe that their task is to assist in charming from the child what divine and spiritual beings havesent down from the spiritual world. This task is indeed some-thing that can be brought to new life through anthroposophy. I n o u r l a n g u a g e s , w e h a v e a w o r d , a n i m p o r t a n t w o r d , closely allied to the hopes and longings of many people. Theword is \"immortality.\" But we will see human life in the rightway only after we have a word as fitting for life's beginning as we have for its ending\u2014a word that can become as generally accepted and as commonly used as the word \"immortality\"(undyingness)\u2014perhaps something like \"unbornness.\" Only ifwe have such a word will we be able to grasp the full, eternal nature of the human being. Only then will we experience a holy awe and reverence for what lives in the child through theever creating and working spirit, streaming from belowupward. During the first seven years, from birth to the second dentition, the child's soul, together with the spiritual counter- part received from the life before birth, shapes and develops thephysical body. At this time, too, the child is most directlylinked to its environment. There is only one word that adequately conveys the mutual relationship of the child to its surroundings at this delicate timeof life when thinking, feeling and willing become integratedEducational Methods\u2014I 161 into the organs\u2014and that word is: imitation . During the first period of life, a human being is an imitator par excellence . With regard to a child's upbringing, this calls forth one all-important principle: w hen you are around a child, only behave in ways that that child can safely imitate . The impulse to imitate depends on the child's close relationship to its surroundings in which imponderables of soul and spirit play their part. One cannot communicate with children during these first seven years with admonitions or reprimands. A child of thatage cannot learn simply on the authority of a grownup. It learns through imitation. Only if we understand that can we understand a child properly. Strange things happen\u2014of which I shall give an example that I have given before\u2014when one does not understand this. One day, a father comes saying, \"I am so unhappy. My boy, who was always such a good boy, has committed a theft.\" Howshould such a case be considered? One asks the worried parent,\"How old is your boy and what has he stolen?\" The answer comes, \"Oh, he is five years old. Until now, he has been such a good child, but yesterday he stole money from his mother. Hetook it out of the cupboard and bought sweets with it. He didnot even eat them himself, but shared them with other boys and girls in the street.\" In a case like this, one's response should probably go as fol- lows. \"Your boy has not stolen. Most likely, what happenedwas that he saw his mother every morning taking money from her cupboard to do the shopping for the household. The child's nature is to imitate others, and so the boy did what hehad seen his mother do. The concept of stealing is not appro-priate in this case. What is appropriate is that\u2014whenever we are in the presence of our children\u2014we do only what they can safely imitate (whether in deeds, gestures, language, or eventhought).\"Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 162 If one knows how to observe such things, one knows that a child imitates in the most subtle, intimate ways. Anyone who acts pedagogically in the manner I have indicated discovers that whatever a child of that age does is based on imitation\u2014evenfacial expressions. Such imitation continues until a child shedsits milk teeth. Until then, a child's relationship to the surround- ing world is extremely direct and real. Children of this age are not yet capable of perceiving with their senses and then judgingtheir perceptions. All of this still remains an undifferentiatedprocess. The child perceives with its senses and, simultaneously, this perception becomes a judgment; and the judgment simul- taneously passes into a feeling and a will impulse. They are allone and the same process. In other words, the child is entirely immersed in the currents of life and has not yet extracted itself from them. The shedding of the milk teeth marks the first occurrence of this. The forces that had been active in the lower regions of theorganism and\u2014following the appearance of the second teeth\u2014 are no longer needed there, then manifest as forces in the child's soul-spiritual sphere. At this point, the child enters thesecond period of life, which begins with the second dentitionand ends in puberty. During this second period, the soul and spiritual life of the child becomes liberated, as\u2014under given outer conditions previously cited\u2014latent warmth is liberated.Before this period, we must look in the inner organism, in theorganic forming of the physical organism, for the child's soul and spirit. This is the right way to explore the relationship between body and soul. Principles and relationships of all kinds arebeing expounded today in theory. According to one, the soul affects the body; according to another, everything that hap- pens in the soul is only an effect of the body. The most fre-quently held opinion is so-called \"psychophysical parallelism,\"Educational Methods\u2014I 163 meaning that both types of process\u2014soul-spiritual as well as physical-bodily ones\u2014may be observed side by side. We can speculate at length about the relationship of spirit to body and body to spirit but, if we only speculate and do not engage incareful observation, we will not get beyond mere abstractions.We must not limit our observations to present conditions alone. We must say to ourselves, the forces that we witness as the child's soul spiritual element during the period from theseventh to about the fourteenth year are the same ones thatw o r k e d b e f o r e i n t h e l o w e r o r g a n i s m i n a h i d d e n o r l a t e n t way. We must seek in the child's soul and spirit what is at work in the child from birth to the change of teeth andbetween the change of teeth and puberty. If we do this, wewill gain a realistic idea of the relationship between soul and spirit on one side and the physical-bodily processes on the other. Observe physical processes up to the second dentition and you will find the effects of soul and spirit. But, if you wish to observe the soul and spirit in its own right, then observe a child from the change of teeth until the coming of puberty. Donot proceed by saying, \"Here is the body and the soul is some-where within it; now I wish to find its effects.\" No, we must now leave the spatial element altogether and enter the dimen- sion of time. If we do so, we shall find a true, realistic relation- ship between body and soul, a relationship that leads tofruitful ideas for life. We shall learn, from a deeper point of view, how to care for a child's physical health before the change of teeth, so that the child's psychic and spiritual health canmanifest appropriately afterward , during the second life period, from the change of teeth to puberty. Similarly, the health of the stomach reveals itself\u2014in the time organism; that is, the etheric or body of formative forces\u2014in the healthy con-dition of the head. That is the point.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 164 And, if we want to study how to deal with the forces that are released from the physical organism between the change of teeth and puberty\u2014and we are here dealing with one of the most important periods of a child's life, let us call it the time ofschool duties\u2014I must say , first of all, that they are formative forces, liberated formative forces, that have been building up the human organism, plastically and musically . We must treat them accordingly. Hence, initially, we must not treat themintellectually. T o treat the formerly formative forces, which arenow soul-spiritual forces, artistically , not intellectually, is the basic demand of anthroposophical pedagogy. The essence of Waldorf education is to make education into an art\u2014the art of the right treatment of children, if I may usethe expression. A teacher must be an artist, for it is the teacher's task to deal in the right way with the forces that previously shaped the child's organism. Such forces need to be treatedartistically\u2014no matter which subject the teacher is to intro-duce to children entering the Waldorf school. Practically, this means that we begin not with reading but with writing\u2014but learning to write must in no way be an intellectual pursuit. Webegin by letting our young pupils draw and paint patterns andforms that are attuned to their will lives. Indeed, watching these lessons, many people would feel them to be rather a strange approach to this fundamental subject! Each teacher is given complete freedom. We do not insist on a fixed pedagogical dogma but, instead, we introduce our teachers to the whole spirit of anthroposophical pedagogical principles and methods. For instance, if you were to enter afirst grade class, you might see how one teacher has his or herpupils move their arms in the air to given rhythms. Eventually each pupil will then draw these on paper in the simplest form. Hence, out of the configuration of the physical organism\u2014thatis, out of the sphere of the children's will\u2014we elicit somethingEducational Methods\u2014I 165 that quite naturally assumes an artistic form and we gradually transform such patterns into the forms of letters. In this way, learning to write avoids all abstraction. Rather, writing arises in the same way as it originally entered human evolution. First,there was picture-writing, which was a direct result of outerreality. Then, gradually, this changed into our written symbols, which have become completely abstract. Thus, beginning with a pictorial element, we lead into the modern alphabet, whichspeaks to the intellect. Only after having first taught writingout of such artistic activities do we introduce reading. If teach- ers approach writing and reading in this way, working from an artistic realm and meeting the child with artistic intentions,they are able to appeal above all to a child's forces of will. It isout of the will forces that, fundamentally speaking, all psycho- logical and intellectual development must unfold. But, moving from writing to reading, a teacher is aware of moving fromwhat is primarily a willing activity to one that has more of afeeling quality. The children's thinking, for its part, can be trained by dealing with numbers in arithmetic. If teachers are able to follow a child's whole soul-spiritual configuration in detail as each child first draws single figures,which leads to formation of letters and then to writing words that are also read\u2014and if they are able to pursue this whole process with anthroposophical insight and observation ofgrowing human beings\u2014then a true practice of teaching willemerge. Only now can we see the importance of applying an artistic approach during the first years of school. Everything that isbrought to a child through music in a sensible and appropriateway will show itself later as initiative. If we restrict a child's assimilation of the musical element appropriate to the seventh to eighth year, we are laming the development of that child'sinitiative, especially in later life. A true teacher of our timeWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 166 must never lose sight of the whole complex of such intercon- nections. There are many other things\u2014we shall have to say more about them later\u2014that must be observed not only year by year but week by week during the life period from thechange of teeth to puberty. There is one moment of special importance, approximately halfway through the second life period; that is, roughly between the ninth and tenth years. This is a point in a child'sdevelopment that teachers need to observe particularly care-fully. If one has attained real insight into human development and is able to observe the time organism or etheric body, as I have described it, throughout the course of human life, oneknows how, in old age, when a person is inclined to look backover his or her life down to early childhood days, among the many memory pictures that emerge, there emerge particularly vividly the pictures of teachers and other influential figures ofthe ninth and tenth years. These more intimate details of life tend to be overlooked by natural-scientific methods of research that concentrate on more external phenomena. Unfortunately, not much attention ispaid to what happens to a child\u2014earlier in one child, later inanother\u2014approximately between the ninth and tenth years. What enters a child's unconscious then emerges again vividly in old age, creating either happiness or pain, and generating eitheran enlivening or a deadening effect. This is an exact observa-tion. It is neither fantasy nor mere theory. It is a realization that is of immense importance for the teacher. At this age, a child has specific needs that, if heeded, help bring about a definiterelationship between the pupil and the teacher. A teacher simply has to observe the child at this age to sense how a more or less innate and unspoken question lives in the child's soul at this time, a question that can never be put intoactual words. And so, if the child cannot ask the questionEducational Methods\u2014I 167 directly, it is up to the teacher to bring about suitable condi- tions for a constructive resolution of this situation. What is actually happening here? One would hardly expect a person who, in the 1890's [1894], wrote a book entitled The Philosophy of Freedom4 to advocate the principle of authority on any conservative or reactionary grounds. Yet, from the standpoint of child devel- opment alone, it must be said that, just as up to the change ofteeth a child is a being who imitates , so, after this event, a child needs naturally to look up to the authority of the teacher and educator. This requires of the teacher the ability to command natural respect, so that a pupil accepts truths coming from theteacher simply because of the child's loving respect, not on thestrength of the child's own judgments. A great deal depends on that. Again, this is a case in which we need to have had personal experience. We must know from experience what it means for achild's whole life\u2014and for the constitution of a person's soul\u2014 when children hear people talk of a highly respected member of their family, whom they have not yet met, but about whomall members of the household speak in hushed reverential tonesas a wise, good, or for any other reason highly esteemed family member. The moment then arrives when the child is to be introduced to such a person for the first time. The child feelsovercome by deep awe. He or she hardly dares open the door toenter into the presence of such a personality. Such a child feels too shy to touch the person's hand. If we have lived through such an experience, if our souls have been deepened in child-hood in this way, then we know that this event created a lastingimpression and entered the very depths of our consciousness, to resurface at a later age. This kind of experience must become 4. Published (1995) as Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 168 the keynote of the relationship between the teacher and the child. Between the change of teeth and puberty, a child should willingly accept whatever the teacher says on the strength of such a natural sense of authority. An understanding of this direct elemental relationship can help a teacher become a real artist in the sense that I have already indicated. During this same period, however, another feeling also lives in the child, often only dimly and vaguely felt. This is the feel-ing that those who are the objects of such authority must them- selves also look up to something higher. A natural outcome of this direct, tangible relationship between the teacher and thechild is the child's awareness of the teacher's own religious feel-ings and of the way in which the teacher relates to the meta- physical world-all. Such imponderables must not be overlooked in teaching and education. People of materialisticoutlook usually believe that whatever affects children reachesthem only through words or outer actions. Little do they know that quite other forces are at work in children! Let us consider something which occasionally happens. Let us assume that a teacher thinks \"I\u2014as teacher\u2014am an intelli-gent person, but my pupils are very ignorant. If I want to com- municate a feeling for the immortality of the human soul to my students, I can think, for instance, of what happens when abutterfly emerges from a chrysalis. I can compare this event,this picture, with what happens when a person dies. Thus I can say to my children, 'Just as the butterfly flies out of the chrysa- lis, so, after death, the immortal soul leaves the physical body.'Such a comparison, I am certain, offers a useful simile for thechild's benefit.\" But if the picture\u2014the simile\u2014is chosen with an attitude of mental superiority on the part of the teacher, we find that itdoes not touch the pupils at all and, soon after hearing it, theyEducational Methods\u2014I 169 forget all about it, because the teacher did not believe in the truth of his simile . Anthroposophy teaches us to believe in such a picture and I can assure you that, for me, the butterfly emerging from thechrysalis is not a simile that I have invented. For me, the butter-fly emerging out of the chrysalis is a revelation on a lower plane of what on a higher level represents the immortality of the human soul. As far as I am concerned, it is not I who createdthis picture out of my own reasoning; rather, it is the world itselfthat reveals the processes of nature in the emergence of a butter- fly. That is what this picture means to me. I believe with every fibre of my soul that it represents a truth placed by the godsthemselves before our eyes. I do not imagine that, comparedwith the child, I am wiser and the chid more foolish. I believe in the truth of this picture with the same earnestness that I wish to awaken in the child. If a teacher teaches with such an attitude,the child will remember it for the rest of his or her life. Unseen supersensible\u2014or shall we say imponderable\u2014forces are at work here. It is not the words that we speak to children that matter, but what we ourselves are\u2014and above all what weare when we are dealing with our children. This is especiallyimportant during the period between the ninth and tenth years, for it is during this time that the child feels the underlying background out of which a teacher's words are spoken. Goethesaid: \"Consider well the what, but consider more the how.\" 5 A child can see whether an adult's words express a genuine rela- tionship with the supersensible world or whether they are spo- ken with a materialistic attitude\u2014the words have a different\"ring.\" The child experiences a difference of quality between thetwo approaches. During this period between the ninth and tenth years, children need to feel, if only subconsciously, that as 5. \"Das Was bedenke, mehr Education and Anthroposophy 1 170 they look up to the authority of their teachers, their teacher likewise looks up to what no longer is outwardly visible. Then, through the relationship of teacher to child, a feeling for other people becomes transformed into a religious experience. This, in turn, is linked to other matters\u2014for example, the child's ability to differentiate itself from its surroundings. This too is an inner change, requiring a change of approach toward the subjects taught. We shall speak of that tomorrow. In themeantime, one can see how important it is that certain moodsof soul\u2014certain soul conditions\u2014form an intimate part of the theory and the practice of education. When the plans for founding the Waldorf school in Stutt- gart were nearing realization, the question of how to form thehearts and the souls of teachers so that they entered their classrooms and greeted their children in the right spirit was considered most important. I value my task of having to guidethis school enormously. I also value the fact that, when I havebeen able to be there in person, the attitude about which I have been speaking has been much in evidence among the teaching staff, however varied the individual form of expres-sion. Having heard what I have had to tell you, you now willrealize the significance of a question that I always ask, not in the same words but in different ways each time, either during festive school occasions or when visiting different classes. Thequestion is, \"Children, do you love your teachers?\" And thechildren respond \"Yes!\" in chorus with a sincere enthusiasm that reveals the truth of their answer. Breathing through all of those children's souls, one can feel the existence of a bond ofdeep inner affection between teachers and pupils and that thechildren's feeling for the authority of the teacher has become a matter of course. Such natural authority is meant to form the essence of our educational practice during these years ofchildhood.Educational Methods\u2014I 171 Waldorf pedagogy is thus built not only upon principles and educational axioms\u2014of which, thanks to the work of the great pedagogues, there are plenty in existence already\u2014but, above all, upon the pedagogical skills in practical classroom situations,that is, the way each individual teacher handles his or her class.Such skill is made possible by what anthroposophy unfolds in the human soul and in the human heart. What we strive for is a pedagogy that is truly an art, an art arising from educationalmethods and principles founded on anthroposophy. Of course, with such aims today, one must be prepared to make certain compromises. Hence, when the Waldorf school was opened, I had to come to the following arrangement withthe school authorities. In a memorandum, worked out whenthe school was founded, I stipulated that our pupils should attain standards of learning comparable to those reached in other schools by the age of nine, so that, if they wanted, theywould be able to transfer into the same class in another school.But, during the intervening years\u2014that is, from when they entered school around six to the age of nine\u2014I asserted our complete freedom to use teaching time according to our ownmethods and pedagogical point of view. The same arrangementwas offered to pupils who stayed in the school through the age of twelve. Because they had reached the standards of learning generally expected at that age, they were again given the possi-bility of entering the appropriate classes in other schools. The same thing happens again when our pupils reach puberty; that is, when they reach school-leaving age. 6 But what happens in between is left entirely to our discretion. Hence weare able to ensure that it unfolds out of our anthroposophicalunderstanding of human beings, just as our curriculum and educational aims do, which are likewise created entirely out of 6. In 1921, the school-leaving age in Germany was fourteen.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 172 the child's nature. And we try of course to realize these aims while leaving scope for individual differences. Even in compar- atively large classes, the individuality of each single pupil is still allowed to play its proper part. T omorrow, we shall see what an incisive point of time the twelfth year is. There is obviously a certain kind of perfection in education that will be attained only when we are no longer restricted bysuch compromises\u2014when we are given complete freedom todeal with pupils all of the way from the change of teeth to puberty. T omorrow, I shall indicate how this could be done. All the same, since life itself offered us the opportunity to do so, anattempt had to be made. Anthroposophy never seeks to dem-onstrate a theory\u2014this always tends toward intellectuality\u2014 but seeks to engage directly in the fullness of practical life. It seeks to reveal something that will expand the scope of humanbeings and call into play the full potential of each individual.Certainly, in general terms, such demands have been made before. The what is known; with the help of anthroposophy, we must find the how. T oday, I was able to give you a few indica- tions regarding children up to the ninth year or so. When wemeet again tomorrow, I shall speak in greater detail about the education of our children during the succeeding years.6chapter 173 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 173 6 Educational Methods Based on Anthroposophy CHRISTIANIA (OSLO) \u2014 NOVEMBER 24, 1921 PART II Yesterday, I sought to show how the philosophy and practice of an education based on anthroposophy rest on an intimateknowledge of human beings and hence also of growing humanbeings or children. I tried to show how a growing child can beregarded as a sort of \"time-organism,\" so that we must alwaysbear in mind that the activities of each succeeding year of achild's development occur against the background of thatchild's entire life. We can therefore plant something like soul-spiritual seeds in our children that will bear fruits of inner hap-piness and security in practical life situations for the rest oftheir earthly existences. First, we looked at the period between birth and the change of teeth, when a child is a completely imitative being. We mustrealize that, during this rst period of life, a young child is con-nected to its environment in an extremely intimate way. In amanner of speaking, everything that happens through the peo-ple around the young child, even their thoughts and feelings,affects the child in such a way that it grows into the happeningsin its surrounding world by imitating them. This relation-ship\u2014this connection to the surrounding world\u2014has a kindof polar opposite in what happens during puberty.6chapter 174 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 174 Naturally, during the present age, with its materialistic over- tones, there is much talk of the process of puberty. The phe-nomenon is usually viewed as an isolated event; however, tounprejudiced observation, it must be seen rather as a conse-quence of a complete metamorphosis of the whole course oflife thus far. At this age, human beings develop not only theirmore or less soul-spiritual or physically colored erotic feelingsbut also their personal relationship to the external world. Thisbegins with the forming of judgments that express themselvesin strong sympathies and antipathies. Basically, it is only nowthat young people are placed fully within the world. Only atpuberty do they attain the maturity to turn toward the worldin such a way that independent thinking, feeling, and judg-ment can live within them. During the years between the change of teeth and puberty, a child's relationship to its teacher is based above all on the feel-ing of respect for the teacher's authority. Those important yearscan be regarded as lying between two polar opposites. One ofthem is the age of childhood when, without any subjectiveawareness, a child lives wholly within its outer surroundings.The other is the time of sexual maturity or puberty. At thistime, adolescents as subjects differentiate themselves from theworld\u2014with all their newly awakened inwardness\u2014by whatcould be called in the broadest sense sympathies and antipa-thies. In short, they distinguish themselves from the world bywhat we might call the various manifestations, or revelations,of love. Between these two poles lies the lower school and, as teach- ers, it is our task to create a bridge from one pole to the otherby means of education. During both stages\u2014during earlychildhood as well as during puberty\u2014the growing person ndsa certain foothold in life, in childhood through union with thesurrounding world and later through the feeling of being6chapter 175 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 175 anchored within the self. The intervening years, encompassing the actual lower-school years, are the time when the growingchild is in an unstable equilibrium, needing the support of theteacher and educator. Basically, during those years of primaryeducation, the teacher stands as a representative of the entireworld in the eyes of the child. That world is not one of merearbitrary coincidence but rather the natural, lawful order inhuman development that is brought to life in what the teacherand educator means to the child. For the child, the teacher rep-resents the whole world. Happy are those children who\u2014before they must nd a personal relation to the world by meansof individual judgments, will impulses, and feelings\u2014receivethe world through someone in whom the world is rightlyreflected! This is a deeply felt premise of the education that is to be based on anthroposophy. With this principle, we try to gaininsight into the child's development, month by month, evenweek by week, in such intimate ways that we become able toread the curriculum and all our educational aims directly fromthe nature of the growing child. I could summarize this by say-ing: knowledge of the human being that is true and intimatealso means knowledge of how and when\u2014during which yearand even during which month\u2014to introduce the appropriatesubject matter. We must consider that until about the age of seven\u2014and children should not really enter school before that age\u2014achild lives entirely by imitation. Our young pupils are beingswho strive with their will to be at one with their surround-ings. This fact alone should preclude any appeal to the intel-lect, which depends on the soul's self activity. Nor should weappeal to the child's personal feelings, which in any case are incomplete sympathy with the environment. If we bear in mindthat every response of such an imitative being bears a will6chapter 176 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 176 character, we will realize how strongly the innate will nature meets us when we receive a child into school at the time of thesecond dentition. Above all, then, we must begin by educating, instructing\u2014 training\u2014the child's will. This in itself implies an emphasis onan artistic approach. For instance, when teaching writing, wedo not immediately introduce the letters of the alphabet intheir present form, because these have already become quitealienated from human nature. Rather, we begin by letting thechildren paint and draw, an activity that is a natural conse-quence and externalization of their will activities and that inturn leads to writing. Proceeding in this way, a teacher notices in the children two different tendencies that should be given consideration. Forwhether we contribute to a child's future health or lack ofhealth depends upon how we deal with these two tendencies.In relation to writing, we nd two types of child. This becomesespecially evident when we guide them toward writing througha kind of painting. One type of child learns to write in a waythat always retains a quality of painting. This child writes \"withthe eye,\" observing every line and working with an aestheticfeeling for the beauty of the form\u2014a painterly quality lives inall his or her writing. The other type forms the letters on thepaper more mechanically, with a certain compulsion. Even inwriting lessons\u2014often given for dubious pedagogical reasons,especially in the case of older persons who believe that theymust improve their handwriting\u2014the aim is usually to enablethe participants to put their letters on paper with this mechan-ical kind of compulsion. This is how individual handwriting isdeveloped. Just as people have their gestures, of which they areunaware, so too they have their handwriting, of which they areequally unaware. Those who write mechanically no longerexperience an echo of their writing. Their gaze does not rest6chapter 177 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 177 upon it with an aesthetic pleasure. They do not bring an artis- tic element of drawing into their writing. Each child ought to be guided toward introducing this artis- tic element into handwriting. A child's eye should always reston the piece of paper on which he or she is writing and soreceive an impression of all that is being put into the writing.This will avoid writing under sheer inner mechanical compul-sion, but will allow the child to experience an echo of his or herwriting and the various letters. If we do this, we shall be culti-vating a certain love in the child for what surrounds it\u2014a senseof responsibility for its surroundings. Although this remarkmight sound improbable, it is nevertheless true. A caring atti-tude for whatever we do in life is a direct consequence of thisway of learning to write\u2014a method in which writing is a mat-ter not only of manual dexterity but also for the eyes, for aes-thetic seeing and willing. We should not underestimate how such familiar things influence the whole of human life. Many persons who, later inlife, appear lacking in a sense of responsibility\u2014lacking in lov-ing devotion to the surrounding world\u2014would have beenhelped if they had been taught writing in the right way. We must not overlook such intimate interconnections in education. Anthroposophy therefore seeks to shed light on allaspects of human nature\u2014not just theoretically but lovingly . It tries to recognize the inherent soul and spiritual back-ground of all external human traits and this allows it to add acompletely practical dimension to the education of the young.If we remember to allow a child's forces of will to flow intosuch activities as writing, then learning to write\u2014writing les-sons\u2014will eventually produce fruits of the kind I previouslymentioned. After writing, we proceed to reading lessons. Reading involves a child's life of feeling to a greater extent than writing6chapter 178 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 178 and ought to develop from writing. Reading entails a greater element of observation, while writing is more a matter of activeparticipation. But the starting point in education shouldalways be an appeal to the will element, to active participation,and not only to powers of observation. Three steps should always be followed when teaching chil- dren aged from seven to fourteen. First, the aim should be toinvolve the will; that is, the active participation of the pupils.Second, the aim is gradually to lead toward what becomes anattitude of observation. And only during the last phase of thisperiod do we proceed to the third step, that of making ofexperiments, to experimentation. Yesterday, I drew your attention to an important moment occurring between the ninth and tenth years. I pointed to thefact that much depends on a teacher's detecting the inner soulneeds of each child at this critical stage and taking appropriateaction. This moment in a child's development must beobserved accurately. For only at this stage does the child beginto learn to differentiate its individual self from its surround-ings. It does this in three ways\u2014in feeling, in will activity, andthrough the forming of judgments. The ability to distinguishbetween self and environment with full inner independence isachieved only at puberty. Between the ninth and tenth years, a rst harbinger of this separation from the surrounding world already begins to makeitself felt. It is so important\u2014just because we must support achild's being until puberty\u2014that we recognize this moment andadapt our teaching accordingly. Up to this age, it is best not toexpect children to distinguish themselves from their surround-ings. We are always at a disadvantage when we as teachers intro-duce subjects\u2014such as the study of nature\u2014that require acertain objectivity, an inner distancing of the self from its sur-roundings, before a child is nine or ten. The more teachers6chapter 179 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 179 imbue the surrounding world with human qualities, the more they speak about it pictorially, and the more they employ anartistic approach, the better it is for the inner unfolding of theirpupils' will natures. For, by becoming directly involved, thesewill natures are also thereby inwardly strengthened. Everything musical helps deepen a child's will nature. After age six or seven, the element of music helps make a child moreinward, more soulful. The will itself is strengthened by all pic-torial and artistic activities\u2014but only, of course, as long as theycorrespond to the child's age. Naturally, we cannot yet speakabout plants, animals, or even lifeless objects, as somethingindependent and separate. On the contrary, a child should feelthat such things are an extension of its own being. Personica-tion of outer objects and facts is right and appropriate duringthis time of a child's life. We are wrong to believe that, when we personify nature, we are presenting a child with something untrue. Arguments ofthis kind have no validity. Our attitude should be, \"What mustI bring to a child to liberate his or her life forces? What can Ido so that what is within rises to the surface of life?\" We canhelp this happen, above all, by being as lively as possible in ourdescriptions and stories of the surrounding world\u2014if we makethe whole surrounding world appear as if it issues from ahuman being's inner self. Everything introduced to the child atthis age should be addressed to the child's whole being, not justto its head and nervous systems. A false conception of human nature and an entirely mis- guided picture of human beings underlie current attitudestoward education. We have a false anthropology that overem-phasizes the nervous system. Rather, it is of prime importancethat we recognize a current flowing through the entire personfrom below upward\u2014from the activity of the limbs and fromeverything that follows from our relationship to the external6chapter 180 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 180 world\u2014that impresses itself into the nervous system and par- ticularly into the brain. From this perspective, anthroposophi-cal anthropology is not being paradoxical when it maintainsthat, if a child practices the appropriate movements at an ear-lier age, he or she will develop intelligence, intellect, the powerof reasoning, the ability to discriminate, and so forth at a laterage. If we are asked, \"Why has a particular child not developeda healthy ability to discriminate by the time he or she is thir-teen or fourteen? Why does he or she make such confusedjudgments?\" We often have to answer, \"Because the child wasnot encouraged to make the right kinds of physical hand andfoot movement in early childhood.\" The fact that eurythmy is a required subject in the Waldorf curriculum shows that, from our point of view, these remarksare justied. Eurythmy is an art of movement but it is also ofgreat pedagogical value. Eurythmy is truly a visible language. Itis not like mime, nor is it a form of dance. Rather, eurythmyoriginates in the perception of tendencies toward movement inthe human being that may be observed\u2014if I may borrowGoethe's expression\u2014with \"sensible-supersensible beholding.\"Those tendencies toward movement (I say \"tendencies\" ratherthan the actual movements themselves) are seen when humanbeings express themselves in speech, with the larynx and otherspeech organs performing the actual movements. Those movements are transformed into moving air, which in turn becomes the carrier of sound and tone perceived by theear. But there exist other inner tendencies or inclinationstoward movement which proceed no further than the nascentstate and yet can be studied by \"sensible-supersensible behold-ing.\" It is possible to study what is formed in a human beingbut never becomes an actual movement, being instead trans-formed, or metamorphosed, into movement of the larynx andthe other speech organs.6chapter 181 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 181 In eurythmy, the movements are performed by one person or by groups whose movements produce an ordered, organic,and visible form of speech, just as human speech organs pro-duce audible speech or song. Each single movement\u2014everydetail of movement that is performed eurythmically\u2014 mani-fests such laws of the human organism as are found in speechor song. This is why, in the Waldorf school, we witness again and again how\u2014provided that it is taught properly\u2014younger chil-dren in the rst eight grades nd their way into eurythmy, thisnew language, quite naturally. Just as, at this stage of develop-ment, a child's organism desires to move through imitation, solikewise is the child naturally inclined to reveal itself throughthe language of eurythmy. A sense of inner well being dependson the possibility of the child's expressing itself through thismedium. Older pupils develop the same inner response towardthis visible language of eurythmy, only in a metamorphosedform, at a later stage. Indeed, we nd that, just as eurythmy hasbeen called forth from the inner order governing the humanorganism, it works back upon the human organization in ahealthy manner. For the moment, let us consider the human form. Let us take as an example the outer human form\u2014although it would beequally possible to take the forms of inner organs\u2014but let usfor the moment take the human hand together with its arm.Can we really understand the form of the human hand and armwhen they are in a position of rest? It would be an illusion tothink that we could. We can understand the forms of the n-gers, of the palm, and of the arm only when we see them inmovement. The resting form only makes sense when it beginsto move. We could say that the hand at rest owes its form to thehand in movement and that the movements of the hand or armmust be as they are because of the form of the resting hand.6chapter 182 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 182 In the same way, one can summon forth from the whole human being the movements, like those connected with thevowels and consonants, that originate in the inner organizationand are determined by the natural organization or form of thehuman being. Eurythmy has been created in harmony with theinnate laws of the human form. A child experiences the changeof the human form at rest into the form in movement\u2014themeaningful transition into visible speech through eurythmy\u2014with deep inner satisfaction and is thereby enabled to experi-ence the inner life of its whole being. And this works backagain in that the entire organism activates what is later trans-formed into intelligence in a way that should not be activatedby anything else. If we try to develop a child's intelligencedirectly , we always introduce a more or less deadening or lam- ing agent into its development. But, if we cultivate intelligencethrough the whole human being, then we proceed in a funda-mentally healing manner. We endow the child with a form ofintelligence that grows easily from the whole human being,whereas onesided training of the intellect resembles somethingarticially grafted onto the organism. When seen in its practical pedagogical context, eurythmy\u2014 which is an obligatory subject along with lessons in gymnas-tics\u2014therefore has the effect of ensouled gymnastics. I feel surethat the time will come when people will think about suchmatters more openly and more freely than is usual today. In this respect, something extraordinary happened to me a short time ago. I talked about ideas concerning eurythmy andthere happened to be in the audience someone who couldrightly be called one of the most eminent Central Europeanphysiologists. You would be surprised if I mentioned his name,for he is a world-famous personality. On this occasion, out of acertain modesty, I said that anthroposophy does not clamor forrevolutionary aims in any subject. I said that, one day, one6chapter 183 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 183 might come to think of gymnastics as having been evoked from human physiology, from the inherent law and order of thephysical body, and that, in that sense, it can be said to have abenecial effect on the healthy development of the humanphysical body. I continued by saying that this more spiritual,ensouled eurythmy will nd its proper place side by side withgymnastics because, in eurythmy, although due considerationis given to the physical aspects, at the same time, in each move-ment performed, an element of soul and spirit also lives, allow-ing the child to experience meaningful soul and spiritual senseand never merely empty physical movements. The child alwaysexperiences how the inner being of the eurythmist flows intothe movements performed. And the strange thing was that thisfamous physiologist came to see me afterward and said, \"Youcalled gymnastics an educational aid. But I entirely disagreewith your justication of gymnastics on physiological grounds.From my point of view, I consider gymnastic lessons for chil-dren to be pure barbarism!\" Well, I would never have dreamed of making such a state- ment myself, but I nevertheless nd it interesting to hear whatone of the most eminent physiologists of our time has to sayabout this subject. As I mentioned before, I do not wish to goas far as this physiologist but merely wish to say that eurythmyhas its own contribution to make in practical pedagogy, side byside with gymnastic lessons as they are given today. By working back again on the spirit and the soul of children up to the ages of nine and ten, eurythmy becomes an impor-tant educational aid. The same applies to later years when,between nine and ten, a child learns to discriminate betweenthe self and the external world. Here, however, one must bevery careful about how such discrimination occurs. First, onemust be careful not to introduce subject matter that predomi-nantly activates a child's intellect and faculty of cognition.6chapter 184 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 184 From this point of view, before proceeding to mineralogy, physics, and chemistry, it is good to introduce rst animal andthen plant study. Through the study of zoology and botany,children learn to discriminate between the inner and outerworlds in new and different ways. According to a given child'sown nature, it might feel more akin to the animal world thanto the plant kingdom. Pupils experience the plant world as arevelation of the outer world. On the other hand, with regardto the animal kingdom, children feel greater, more immediaterapport, inwardly sensing that there are similarities in manyrespects between animals and human beings. Teachers shoulddenitely be aware of this when giving lessons in zoology andbotany. Hence, when introducing botany, they should relatethe plants to the earth as to a living organism. They shouldspeak of the earth as a living organism. They should speak of itduring the different seasons and of how it reveals itself byappropriate plant growth at different times of the year. In otherwords, they should introduce a temporal aspect into the studyof plants. The use of observational methods, while justiable in other situations, can easily be disturbing if applied to botany andzoology. Generally speaking, far too little attention is given tothe fact that the earth forms a unity with its plant growth.Again, you might nd this paradoxical, but just as we canhardly study the organization of an animal's or a human being'shair separately\u2014having rather to consider it in connectionwith the whole organism, as part of a whole\u2014so we should alsoconsider the earth as an organism, and the plant world as partof it. If we introduce botany in this manner, a child, observingthe plant kingdom, will differentiate its own being from theplant world in the right way. On the other hand, the approach to animal study should be very different. Children feel a natural kinship, a \"soul-bridge,\"6chapter 185 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 185 with the animal world and this feeling of kinship should be taken into account. The opinions of older nature philosophersare often smiled at today. But you will nd all of the opinionsof these older nature philosophers in Goethe's way of lookingat the animal world. According to the Goethean way, we lookat the form of an animal and nd, for instance, that in the formof the lion the development of the chest and the heart predom-inate, whereas, in the case of other animals, the digestive organsmay predominate; in still other species, the teeth are especiallydeveloped, or the horns, and so on. We consider the variousanimal forms as expressions of single organs. In other words,we could say that there are head animals, chest animals, andlimb animals. Indeed, one could arrange the various animalforms according to even more subdivisions. This gives us thetotality. Finally, taking all of the various animal formstogether\u2014synthesizing them in such a way that what predomi-nates in a particular species regresses to t itself back into awhole\u2014we come to the form of a human being. From thepoint of view of outer form, therefore, the human being repre-sents a synthesis of the entire animal world. It is quite possible to call forth in the child a feeling for this synthesis of the entire animal kingdom in humanity. If we dothis, we have achieved something very signicant, for we havethen allowed the child to relate both to the plant world and tothe animal world in the right way. In the case of the animalworld, the child can learn to see a human being spread acrossthe entire animal kingdom and in the plant kingdom some-thing that belongs organically to the whole earth. If, by givingindividual examples, we can bring to life such a study of ani-mals or plants at a deeper level, we respect at the same timehow human beings should t rightly into the world accordingto their inner nature. Then, just at the age when a child learnsto differentiate itself from its surrounding world by beginning6chapter 186 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 186 to discriminate between subject and object, she or he will grow into the world in the right way. Through the study ofbotany, we can succeed in separating the outer world from theinner life of a human being in the right way, and at the sametime enable a child to build bridges into the world. Suchbridges are essential if a right feeling for the world, if love forthe world, is to develop. We can also do this by presenting theanimal world to the child in the form of a picture of thehuman being unfolded or outspread. Doing this, we are fol-lowing an organic, living path by allowing the child to nd itsproper relationship to living nature. Only when the twelfthyear begins can we cultivate purely intellectual work andappeal to the powers of reasoning without harming a child'sdevelopment. When the curriculum that I have outlined today is followed, we begin by cultivating the life of the will. By presenting thechild's relationship to the plant world and to the animal worldin nature study, we begin the cultivation of the child's feelinglife. The child then learns to relate to the plant and animalkingdoms not just theoretically. Indeed, the concepts gainedfrom these lessons lay the foundations for a deeper relationshipto the whole surrounding world. Something happens here thatreally touches the child's feeling, the child's psyche. And this isof immense importance; for, proceeding thus by engaging thechild in the right kind of movement, and guiding and cultivat-ing children's will forces and their lives of heart and soul up toalmost the twelfth year, we can then nd the transition to theactual cultivation of the intellect by introducing subject matterbelonging to lifeless, inorganic nature. Mineralogy, physics, and chemistry should not be intro- duced before this age (the twelfth year). The only intellectualoccupation not harmful during the earlier ages is arithmetic.This can be practiced earlier because it is directly connected6chapter 187 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 187 with an inner discipline and because it is neutral with regard to the cultivation of both will and heart or soul. Of course, itdepends entirely on our knowing how to activate the child out-wardly through the right kind of geometry and arithmetic dur-ing the age when the child is at the stage of authority. Regarding the introduction of subjects belonging to inani- mate nature, we should wait until approximately the twelfthyear. Thus our ability to read in a child's nature what can andshould be taught at each appropriate age is the whole pointaround which we form our curriculum. If we introduce children to the external world in this way, we may be certain that we are preparing them for the practicalsides of life also. Unfortunately, our present civilization doeslittle to guide people into dealing with practical life. Rather,they are led into a routine life, the practical aspects of whichconsist in their being able to manipulate a few skills in a moreor less mechanical fashion. Real love for practical work, love forworking with one's hands, even if only crude and simple skillsare required, is poorly cultivated by our present educationalmethods. Yet, if we teach from insight into human nature, we will nd a way to develop a genuine impulse to become practical peoplein those pupils who have reached puberty. For this reason, weintroduce practical subjects in the Waldorf school as soon asour pupils reach puberty. We try to teach them crafts, which atthe same time demand an artistic treatment. The Waldorf school is a coeducational school and this policy has not thus far shown the slightest disadvantage from a peda-gogical point of view. But what has also emerged is that boyslove to do so-called \"girls'\" jobs\u2014such as knitting, crocheting,and so on\u2014and that it is precisely in these practical lessonsthat boys and girls in the Waldorf school work harmoniouslytogether. You will perhaps forgive me for making a personal6chapter 188 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 188 remark: men who as boys were taught to knit at school will know how much these skills have contributed to their ability towork with their heads and how their dexterity in using knittingneedles, in threading darning needles, and so on has beentransmuted into the development of logical thinking. This maysound peculiar to you, but it nevertheless belongs to one of themore hidden facts of life. The origin of poor or faulty thinking is by no means always to be found in a person's innate intellectual capacities. What,during a person's adult life, is revealed as human intelligence,must be traced back to the whole human being. Above all, wemust realize that what is expressed through practical activities isintimately connected not only to the human head itself, butalso to the way in which it has an effect on all that belongs gen-erally to the cultivation of the sphere of the head. If insight into the human being based on anthroposophy is to enter the eld of education, it must guide the child towardsa practical and realistic conception of life. Anthroposophy doesnot wish to lead anyone into a mystical \"cloud cuckoo land.\" Itdoes not wish to alienate people from practical life. On thecontrary, it seeks to lead human beings into the fullness ofpractical life so that they really begin to love practical work. Forinstance, in my opinion, one cannot be a true philosopherunless one is also capable of making a pair of shoes somehow orother, if the situation demands it, and unless one is capable oftaking full part in all human activities. All specialization, how-ever necessary it might be in life, can work in a healing wayonly if people are able to stand fully in life, at least to a certaindegree. Naturally, not every adult can do this. Nevertheless,such is our aim in education, as I have taken the liberty of pre-senting it to you. If we have thus guided our pupils from \"doing\" to observing and, nally, to practical participation, which includes the6chapter 189 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 189 making of scientic experiments\u2014that is, if we have guided our pupils starting from training their will lives through obser-vation permeated by human feeling and nally to more intel-lectual work\u2014if we have done all this, then we have followeda curriculum capable of planting seeds in their souls and spir-its that will bear fruit throughout their lives. It is this whole-ness of life that teachers must bear in mind at all times. A great deal of thought has gone into nding the origin of morality. Ours is a time of abstraction: we philosophize abouthow human awareness of morality has found its way into lifeand where it is found in the individual and in the life of society.But so far, because our time is one of intellectualism andabstraction, we have not found its source in realistic terms. Letus seriously consider the idea that it is in the nature of thechild, between second dentition and puberty, to surrenderfreely to the authority of a teacher who represents the wholeworld to the child. And let us accept that the child receiveseverything that enters its soul under the influence of thisauthority. If we do that, then we will adopt this line of thoughtin our education to give the child a picture of the educator andteacher as a living example of morality, one in which moralityis personied. Listen carefully to what I say: teachers do notimplant an ethical attitude by moralizing. To the child, they aremorality personied, so that there is truly no need for them tomoralize. Whatever they do will be considered right; whateverthey refrain from doing will be considered wrong. Thus, in liv-ing contact between child and teacher, an entire system of sym-pathies and antipathies regarding matters of life will develop.Through those sympathies and antipathies, a right feeling forthe dignity of human beings and for a proper involvement inlife will develop. At this age, too, we can perhaps see emergingfrom the inner depths of the child's soul something that sur-faces at times and needs only to be interpreted correctly.6chapter 190 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 190 We can observe how, under the influence of certain feelings, a child blushes. The most signicant cause for blushing is asense of shame. I am not thinking here of shame in its morerestricted, sex-related sense. I am speaking of shame in a wideand general sense. For example, when a child has done some-thing that, according to the system of sympathies and antipa-thies that it has developed, must appear wrong or bad, a feelingof shame is provoked. It is as if the child wanted to hide fromthe world. In such a situation, life-sustaining blood rushes intothe periphery. It is as if the real soul of the child were trying tohide itself behind the blushing. The other extreme can be seenwhen a child must face a danger threatening from outside. Wethen see a paling in the child's countenance. These two phe-nomena\u2014blushing and paling in the human face\u2014point tosomething of great signicance; they point to the system ofsympathies and antipathies. My point is that, if we follow up this blushing and paling in a child's soul, we nd the consequences of what teachers andeducators have cultivated in the eld of education during theperiod between a child's second dentition and puberty. It is aquestion not of teaching morals, but of living morally.Through the relationship between the teacher and the child,what is good crosses over into the realm of sympathies andantipathies. They express themselves outwardly in paling andblushing, which are generated by the soul either when theinner life of feeling is threatened, destroyed, or paralysed, orwhen it feels a sense of shame. As a result, the appropriate feel-ing, or an entire complex of feelings for a genuine and truehuman dignity, is engendered in the child. It is of paramountimportance that a living morality develop in this changeable,mobile relationship between child and teacher. Remember thatyesterday I characterized the member of the human organismthat works in time as the etheric body. When the child reaches6chapter 191 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 191 sexual maturity, another, higher member of the human organ- ism comes to meet the etheric body. That is, during the age ofsexual maturity, the human astral body, as it is called in anthro-posophy, comes to meet the etheric body. This is a stage whenwhat had developed into a system of sympathies and antipa-thies in the child changes into a person's moral attitudes. It isthe astral body that places human beings within the world. Itholds and gathers the person together far more tightly than theetheric body. What was previously a system of sympathies andantipathies, cultivated by the teacher's artistic approach, nowbecomes transmuted into a moral attitude of soul. This is the wonderful secret of puberty. It is the metamor- phosis of what had previously lived in the child as living moral-ity into a conscious sense of morality and of moral principles.That metamorphosis takes place on a comprehensive scale. Theerotic side plays merely a subordinate role. Only a materialisticage sees the most important issue in a sexual context. The trueand fundamental aspect of the change must be seen in thewonderful secret that what is at rst founded in a natural waythrough a child's direct and immediate experience now sees thelight of day in a conscious sense of morality. Just as a plant is rooted in the ground, so everything pertain- ing to a conscious sense of morality in the world\u2014everythingof an ethical nature living in society and social life generally\u2014is rooted just as rmly as the plant is rooted in the ground inwhat was cultivated artistically and aesthetically into a systemof sympathies and antipathies between the second dentitionand puberty. Instead of trying to nd the origin of human goodness in philosophical abstractions, it is more productive to observeconcrete realities. We can answer the question, \"What isgoodness in real life?\" by saying that goodness in real life is theoutcome of what we adults were able to nourish by means of6chapter 192 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 192 our pupils' sense of authority during the period that we are discussing. In this way, we observe life as a whole. We observe the situa- tion of the child during the school years of inner consolidation.During those years, the child's soul is still intimately connectedwith the physical organism. Only at the age of about 35, does aperson's soul begin to loosen itself somewhat from the physicalbody. At that point, two ways are open to us\u2014although, unfor-tunately, all too often there remains no choice. At thatmoment, when our souls and spirits free themselves from ourphysical bodies, we can keep alive within us the living impulsesof feeling, will, and concepts that are capable of further growthand that were implanted in our souls during childhood days. Inthat case, we not only remember experiences undergone atschool but can relive them time and again, nding in them asource of ever-renewing life forces. Although, naturally, wegrow old in limbs, with wrinkled faces and grey hair and possi-bly even suffering from gout, we will nevertheless retain a freshand youthful soul and, even in ripe old age, one can growyounger again without becoming childish. What some people, perhaps at the age of fty, experience as a second wave of youthful forces is a consequence of the soul'shaving become strong enough, through education, to enable itto function well not only while it has the support of a strongphysique but also when the time comes for it to withdraw fromthe body. A teacher and educator must not only deal with the business of teaching actual subjects to pupils; she or he must also bearthe burden of responsibility for their pupils' inner happinessand feeling of security right into the last years of their lives. This is how we can foresee the consequences of what we are implanting in childhood through education and school lessons.But we can also follow the consequences in social life. Social6chapter 193 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 193 morality is a kind of plant that has its roots in the classroom in which children were taught between their seventh and four-teenth years. And, just as a gardener will look at the soil of hisgarden, so society too should look at the \"soil of the school,\"for the ground for morality and goodness is to be found here. Anthroposophy seeks to be knowledge of human beings that is able to satisfy both individual and social life. It wishes tofructify the various elds of life. Hence, it also wants to fructifytheory and practice in education. In only two lectures, it is impossible for me to give more than just a few directives. Anthroposophy will continue towork further. What has been achieved so far regarding thefoundations of pedagogy is only a modest beginning. In Dor-nach, at Christmas, I shall try to expand our anthroposophicalpedagogy in a whole series of lectures, open to a wider interna-tional audience. 1 What I wished to show with the few guide- lines that I have given here is that what matters most inanthroposophy is never a theory or a form of ideas leading to acertain conception of the world but practical life itself. This iscertainly so in the eld of education, although often it is unrec-ognized. Anthroposophy is often considered to be alienatedfrom life. This, certainly, it does not want to be. Anthroposo-phy does not encourage adherents of spiritual knowledge toescape into \"cloud cuckoo land,\" thus estranging them fromlife. It strives for spiritual knowledge so that the spirit can beexperienced in all its creativity, at work in all material existence.That the spirit is creative can be seen in the as yet small suc-cesses of the Free Waldorf school in Stuttgart. Teaching ourpupils is by no means the only task of the Waldorf school.Many subsidiary activities are pursued there as well. WheneverI can be there, we have staff meetings. At those meetings, 1. See Rudolf Steiner, Soul Economy and Waldorf Education.6chapter 194 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 194 almost every pupil is discussed individually, not just from the point of view of making judgments but very much from thepoint of view of how and what we can learn from the individu-ality of each child. Wonderful results have emerged from suchdiscussions. For a long time now, I have wondered how a majority of boys or of girls affects a class, for we have classes where boys arein the majority, others where girls predominate, and still otherswhere the numbers of boys and girls are more or less balanced.It is never possible to predetermine, from personal contact withsuch classes, the effect of the relationships of boys to girls:imponderables play their part in the situation. But a class inwhich girls are in the majority is very different\u2014neither betternor worse of course but all the same very different\u2014from aclass in which boys predominate. And, again, a class in whichthe numbers are more evenly balanced has a very differentcharacter. However, something has come into being, especiallythrough working in our meetings with the progress of ourpupils\u2014something that is already outwardly expressed in theway we write our school reports. This is what one could call\"the Spirit of the Waldorf school.\" When we talk about theschool\u2014I say this in all modesty\u2014it is no longer enough tospeak only about its twenty-ve to twenty-eight teachers: it isalso possible to speak about the Waldorf school spirit. This Waldorf school spirit spreads its life and existence beyond the school, right into the pupils' families. For I knowhow happy those families are to receive our annual reports andwith what happiness our children take them home. I do notwish to tread on anyone's toes. Please forgive me if I mention apersonal idiosyncrasy\u2014but I have never been able to discrimi-nate correctly among the various grades or marks that aregiven, say between B- and B or the difference between a\"nearly satisfactory\" and a \"satisfactory.\" In view of all the6chapter 195 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 195 imponderables, I have always found it impossible to discern the differences that are indicated by such marks. We do not make use of such marks in our reports. We sim- ply describe the life of the pupil during the year, so that eachreport represents an individual effort by the teacher. We alsoinclude in each report a verse for the year that has been spe-cially chosen for the individuality of the child in words withwhich she or he can live and in which he or she can nd innerstrength until the coming of a new verse at the end of the nextschool year. In that way, the report is an altogether individualevent for the child. Proceeding thus, it is quite possible for theteacher to write some strong home truths into a report. Thechildren will accept their mirror images, even if they are notaltogether pleasing ones. In the Waldorf school, we have man-aged this not only through the relationship that has developedbetween teachers and pupils but also, above all, through some-thing else that I could describe in further detail and that we cancall \"the spirit of the Waldorf school.\" This spirit is growing; itis an organic being. Naturally, I am speaking pictorially, buteven such pictures represent a reality. We are often told, \"Not all teachers can be perfect. In educa- tion one can have the best principles, but they founder onhuman weaknesses.\" Yet, if the living spirit of which I speak,which issues from anthroposophical knowledge of humanbeings, exists and if we can respond to it in the right way, then,through it, the human being can grow and mature. I hope thatI am not saying too much when I tell you that the teachers inthe Waldorf school have greatly matured through the spirit ofthe Waldorf school. They are aware of it; they can feel its pres-ence among them. They are growing and developing under itsguidance. They can feel how many of their individual gifts,which contribute to the life of the Waldorf school, becomeindependent, blending into a homogeneous spirit, and how6chapter 196 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 196 that spirit is working in all teachers and educators, planting germs that can be of value for their pupils' whole lives in theways that I have described. We can perceive it in various sepa-rate phenomena. Naturally, we also have our share of less able children, and it has become necessary to separate some of them from theirclassmates. Hence, a very devoted teacher has organized aremedial class. Whenever a pupil is supposed to join the reme-dial class, his or her class teacher must endure a painful strug-gle, and no pupil is transferred to the remedial class except forthe most urgent reasons. If we proceed merely by following axed scheme, many children would be sent into that specialclass, but a teacher often insists on keeping a child among hisor her classmates, despite the great additional burdens that maybe involved. These are things that I mention not to boast but to charac- terize the situation. I would refrain from speaking about themwere it not necessary to show that anthroposophy is capable ofoffering a sound pedagogical basis on which to deal with therealities of life\u2014a pedagogical basis that leads to a spirit thatwill carry a human being without having to be carried, as is thecase with an abstract form of spirit. This living spirit is what isneeded in our decaying civilization. We should be able to con-sider each individual life problem within the context of life ingeneral. One problem, often called the most burning question of the day, is the so-called social question\u2014it has drawn interest inthe widest quarters. Apart from some positive aspects, thissocial question has also brought with it terrible misery\u2014weonly need to think of what is happening in Eastern Europe. Ithas many facets and one of these is doubtless that of educationand teaching. One might even be justied in claiming that,without dedication to the question of education from the social6chapter 197 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 197 point of view, out of insight into human nature, the social question, with all of its ramications in the most varied areas oflife, can hardly be put on a sound basis. Anthroposophy is anx-ious to deal honestly and seriously with all aspects of life and,above all, with education of the young. Strangely enough, in our age of abstraction and intellectual- ity, a certain concept has been completely lost with regard tospiritual and cultural life. But, if we go back to ancient Greece,we still nd it. According to that concept, learning and teach-ing are at the same time healing and health-giving processes. Inancient Greece, people were still aware that teaching madehuman beings healthy, that what is given as soul and teachingcontent creates a process of healing. During the Greek stage ofhuman evolution, teachers also felt themselves to be healers inthe widest sense of the word. Certainly, times are always chang-ing and the character of human development changes too.Concepts cannot remain unaltered. We cannot today return tothe concept of a sinful humanity, and see in the child, too, asinful member of humanity whom we must heal. From thatpoint of view, we could see in education only a kind of higher,spiritual medicine. However, we see the situation more cor-rectly when we realize that, depending upon how we affect achild by our education, we create health-giving or illness-inducing effects in the child's soul, which certainly affect itsphysical condition as well. It is with this in mind\u2014that human beings may develop in healthy ways in spirit, soul, and body as far as this is possiblewithin their given predispositions\u2014that anthroposophicalpedagogy and practice wishes to make its own contribution.Anthroposophy wishes to found educational principles andmethods that have a healing influence upon humanity, so thatwhat we give to the child and what we do in the proximity ofthe child, though not amounting to medicine in a restricted6chapter 198 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 198 sense, nevertheless become a way of turning human life in a healing direction\u2014as regards both the individual and the bodysocial. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS In connection with the rst lecture, further clarication was sought in relation to raising the question of immortality withchildren aged nine to ten. RUDOLF STEINER: We are not dealing here with the question of immortality per se in an explicit sense. But I would like to say that this question ispart of the complex life situation for children of that age. I don'tthink that I expressed myself unclearly when I said that at thisage the child experiences a new form, a metamorphosis, in rela-tion to the authority-based relationship of teacher to child. Pre-viously, the child simply looked up to the teacher. This must bejudged not on the basis of any party-political attitudes but onthe basis of the child's development. Between the second denti-tion and puberty, a child can only feel, what my teacher says iswhat my soul must believe; what my teacher does is a com-mandment for me. After that period, when children see anexample to be followed in their teachers, they become awarethat their teacher, too, looks up to a higher authority. They feeldimly that authority is no longer to be found in this world, buthas withdrawn into the divine-spiritual world. In short, whatlives in the teacher's relationship to the supersensible worldshould not enter the feeling life of the child. It is unlikely that a child will question the teacher regarding immortality in so many words. But the whole conduct of the6chapter 199 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 199 child shows its dependence on the teacher's realizing that, through the authority that she or he wields, the child wishes tobe brought into a relationship with the supersensible. How thatis done depends on each individual case. One case hardly everresembles another. For instance, it might happen that a child,after previously having been its usual cheerful self, entersschool in a moody and morose condition that lasts for severaldays. If one has the necessary experience, one knows that sucha brooding state is an outcome of the situation we have beendiscussing. Sometimes, there is no need for an explicit conver-sation about the reasons for the change in the child. The mereway in which the teacher relates to the child, the understandingway in which she or he talks lovingly to the child during suchdays of brooding, could itself lead the child across a certainabyss. It is not an abyss in an intellectual sense, but one con-nected with the general constitution of the child's soul. Youwill nd the question of immortality there, not explicitly butimplied. It is a question concerning the whole of life, one thatwill rise up in the child so that she or he can learn to feel, myteacher is not only an ordinary human being but one in whomthe human relationship to the supersensible world is expressed.This is what I wished to add. RUDOLF STEINER: I have been given another question in writing which I shouldlike to answer briefly. The question is: \"Is it possible to followthe seven-year rhythms throughout the whole of life and whatform do the various metamorphoses take?\" It is a fact that for those who are able to observe the more intimate changes of life, these rhythms are clearly identiableduring the early years of life; i.e., during the change of teethand the onset of puberty. It is also easy to see that physicalchanges occur, paralleling those of soul and spirit. Such6chapter 200 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 200 changing life-periods also exist in later life. They are less con- spicuous and, strangely enough, become less distinctive ashumanity progresses. I could also say that they become moreinward. In view of our contemporary, more external ways oflooking at history, it might not be inappropriate to mentionthat, in earlier stages of human evolution, such life periodswere also clearly identiable in later life. This is becausehuman beings had different soul conditions in the past intowhich anthroposophy can look. I must add that anthroposo-phy is not dependent on documentary evidence as is modernhistorical research in our intellectual age. I am not blaming; Iam merely describing. For instance, when we go back into ear-lier times, we notice how human beings looked forward to thecoming of old age with a certain anticipation, simply onaccount of what they had experienced when they met otherold people. This is a trait that one can discern if one looksback into human development without prejudice. Nowadays,people do not look forward to old age as a time when life willreveal certain things for which one is ready only then. That isbecause the clear distinctions between the various life periodshave gradually been blurred. If we observe things withoutprejudice, we can perceive that we can today barely distin-guish such development in most people beyond the ages oftwenty-eight or thirty. After this period, in the majority of ourcontemporaries, the developmental periods become veryindistinct. During the period called the Age of the Patriarchs,a time when people still looked up to old age, one knew thatthis period of ebbing life forces could still offer unique experi-ences to the human being. Although the body was becomingincreasingly sclerotic, the soul was freeing itself more andmore from the body. Very different indeed are the intimateexperiences of the soul during the time of the body's ascend-ing life forces from those undergone at the other end of life.6chapter 201 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Educational Methods\u2014II 201 But this growing young once more in a body that is physi- cally hardening, of which I spoke in the lecture, also gives oldage a certain strength. And, if we look back to ancient times,we nd this strength there. I believe that it was not for nothingthat the ancient Greeks saw, in Homer above all but also inother poets, people who were creative at the time when theirsouls were freer from the physical body which was deteriorat-ing. (I am not now speaking about whether there ever was sucha person on earth as the one we call Homer.) Much of what wehave of oriental wisdom, in the Vedas and, above all, in thephilosophy of the Vedanta, has grown out of souls who werebecoming younger in old age. Naturally, progress with regard to human freedom would not be possible if distinctions between the different life periodsdid not become blurred. Yet, in a more intimate way, they dostill exist today. And those who have achieved a certain self-knowledge know well how what someone might have experi-enced in their thirties, appears strangely metamorphosed intheir fties. Even though it still belongs to the same soul, itnevertheless appears in different nuances. Such nuances mightnot have a great deal of meaning for us today because we havebecome so abstract and do not perceive, by means of a morerened and intimate observation of life, what is spiritually real.Yet these metamorphoses, following each other, do exist never-theless. Even if there seems little time for these intimate mat-ters in our age with its social upheavals, a time will come whenhuman beings will be observed adequately once more, forhumanity would otherwise move towards its downfall anddecay. Why should the wish to advance to real observation of human beings be lacking? We have made very great progressindeed with regard to the observation of external nature. Andwhoever knows how plant and animal species have been6chapter 202 Thu Aug 31 10:31:57 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 202 explored in greatest detail and how thoroughly external facts are being observed will not think it impossible that theimmense efforts and the enormously penetrating observationsthat have been showered upon the study of external nature willnot one day be applied equally to the study of the humanbeing. When and how this might eventually happen will haveto be left open for the time being. In any case, it is correct tosay that the art of education will advance to the extent to whicha thorough observation of human beings and the metamorpho-ses of the various life periods in later life are being undertaken. I would like to go back once more to what I said yesterday; namely, that whoever has not learned to pray in childhood isnot in a position to bless in old age, for more than a picture wasimplied. Respect and devotion engendered in childhood aretransmuted at a much later age into a force that has a healingeffect on human environment\u2014especially upon children\u2014sothat we can call it a force of blessing. A picture, such as that offolded hands, given in the ninth or tenth year of life, will turninto hands raised in blessing during the ftieth or fty-fthyear\u2014such a truth is more than a mere picture: it shows theinner organic interrelationships during the course of a humanlife, which reveal themselves in such metamorphoses. As I said before, these phases do become more blurred in later life. However, although they are less discernible, they donevertheless exist, and they need to be studied, especially in theart of education.Education and Drama 203 7 Education and Drama STRATFORD-ON-AVON \u2014 APRIL 19, 1922 Ladies and gentlemen! First, I would like to express my thanks to the \"New Ideals in Education\" Committee for invit- ing me to give two lectures during this Shakespeare Festival.T ruly, it is no mere coincidence that I speak at this ShakespeareFestival and in German about the relationship of drama to edu- cation. For Shakespeare, the dramatist, through his dramatic works was a great educator and he was also a personality who,through his works, was of immense significance for the wholelife of humankind. Indeed, in a sense, the connection of drama and education is historical through the fact that Shakespeare the dramatist was Goethe's teacher. Studying Goethe's biographynot only factually but with the inner eye of a discerning spirit,we become aware that Goethe took from Shakespeare far morethan the external features of dramatic form. Goethe drew from Shakespeare the whole educational spirit that he absorbed dur- ing the earlier years of his life. He mentioned three great teach-ers as having given direction to his life: Shakespeare, thebotanist Linnaeus, and Spinoza the philosopher 1\u2014Linnaeus von 1797-1788; Baruch Spinoza, 1632-1677, Dutch Philosopher.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 204 because, at an early age, Goethe was opposed to the Linnaean conception of nature. From Spinoza Goethe could learn only an external manner of expression, philosophical language. From philosophy, Goethe could not learn his own Weltanschauung, his insight into inner necessity in nature and the universe; helearned it from works of art in Italy. His conception of the world was an artistic one. Spinoza gave him only the means of expressing it in philosophical terms. However, in the inner configuration of his spirit, Goethe remained faithful to Shakespeare, even when he had passed, in his dramatic art, to a more antique tendency of form. It was thus Shakespeare who accompanied Goethe as an educator andguide throughout his life. 2 Goethe's spirit can be linked inwardly to the spirit of Shake- speare. For Goethe himself described quite intimately how he allowed Shakespeare's spirit to work on him. Goethe liked toreceive Shakespeare, not by seeing his plays acted on the stage,but by having them read to him in simple, quiet recitation. He would sit listening\u2014his eyes closed\u2014lifting himself out of the sphere of everyday intellectual life and sinking deeply into thefullness of his inner humanity. Such was the way in whichGoethe wanted the Shakespearean spirit to enter into him. In Dornach, we are endeavoring to work in the spirit of Goethe. The High School of Spiritual Science there, whichhas been founded by the anthroposophical world movement,has been given the name of the Goetheanum \u2014not because I personally wished it so but above all (and this can be empha- sized here) on account of the wishes of our English friends\u2014because the Goethean spirit is to be cultivated in Dornach. At 2. For Goethe's view of Shakespeare, see \"Shakespeare, A Tribute,\" and Shakespeare, Once Again\" in Goethe: Essays on Art and Literature (NY: Shurkamp, 1986).Education and Drama 205 the Goetheanum, we are cultivating a direction in spiritual life that leads us to a definite understanding of new ideals of human education. We have been able to apply those ideals in practice at the Waldorf school in Stuttgart\u2014a school closelylinked to the High School of Spiritual Science in Dornach, tothe Goetheanum. After the Great War, there was a great long- ing for the realization of spiritual-cultural life in Germany, and it became possible, through the initiative of Mr. EmilMolt, to found this Waldorf school in Stuttgart. It was my taskto give methods of teaching and educational practices deriving from a deeper spiritual insight into human nature. I might perhaps be permitted to say a few words about the kind ofspiritual knowledge that forms the background of the educa-tional practices of the Waldorf school and that stems from the anthroposophical science being cultivated in Dornach. I know that there are still a great many people in the world who believe that people are imbibing all sorts of fantastical illu-sions in Dornach, that some kind of cloudy mysticism is encouraged. But that is not the case at all. If we wish to judge the Dornach methods soundly, we must be ready to accept thefact that a really new direction in humanity's mental and spiri-tual life of humanity is being cultivated there. I would like to describe what we are doing by a word that is, I know, still very alarming to many people, inasmuch as all things of a supersensi-ble nature do, after all, still alarm many people today. Neverthe-less, I would like to speak this word openly and without reservations. The method applied in Dornach can be designated as \"exact clairvoyance .\" It is not clairvoyance in the usual sense. What we understand by such clairvoyance does not arise patho-logically from unknown depths of human nature but is devel- oped and applied with scientific conscientiousness\u2014a conscientiousness no less disciplined than what a scientist ofexternal nature must cultivate in his or her scientific thought. T oWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 206 attain such \"exact clairvoyance\" and exercise it demands no less application of the human soul than is demanded of a mathema- tician or a practicing natural scientist. It is a clairvoyance that we apply consciously in matters of everyday life, a clairvoyance thatawakens genuine faculties of knowledge and perception in thehuman soul. By these faculties, one becomes able to see beyond the things of the external world that have set their stamp on the civilization of the last three or four centuries. One becomes ableto perceive the supersensible reality underlying the whole uni-verse, all creation, and, above all, human nature. Acquiring this kind of exact clairvoyance by a strictly m e t h o d i c a l p r o c e s s , w e b e c o m e a b l e t o r e c o g n i z e a n d k n o wwhat lives within us as a spiritual, supersensible reality betweenbirth and death. When we are born into the world as little chil- dren, we appear to be only a physical organism. In reality\u2014 modern science might dispute it but this can become an abso-lute certainty by means of exact clairvoyance\u2014a supersensibleorganism permeates the physical organism. It is an organism of forces. I have called it in my writings the \"organism of forma- t i v e f o r c e s . \" I t c o n s i s t s s i m p l y o f a c o n f i g u r a t i o n o f f o r c e s \u2014forces, however, that work inwardly. This is the first supersensible reality to be seen and observed through exact clairvoyance. It is in no way connected with the old, unscientific concept of a life or vital force. Rather, it issomething that enters the sphere of supersensible perceptionwith the same clarity as colors and sounds do within the sphere of the ordinary sense perceptions of seeing and hearing. Exact clairvoyance of the organism of formative forces is, however, only the first stage in supersensible cognition attainedby a person who sees the supersensible inner human being at work in the physical organism between birth and death. A fur- ther stage leads to perception of the supersensible member of thehuman being that is present before the person descends from theEducation and Drama 207 spiritual world to unite with a physical body through birth. This is the supersensible human organism that passes again into the spiritual world at death, when the physical body and the body of formative forces, named above, both succumb to decay. By the power of such spiritual seership, exact clairvoyance unites what otherwise is taken purely intellectually with a view of what is spiritual or supersensible in human beings. That is to say, it unites science and religion. On the other hand, it is alsoable to give a new impulse to the artistic element in life. For wecannot without it explain, in terms of such ordinary natural laws as we are accustomed to use in our treatment of external nature, the manner in which the supersensible organism\u2014the body offormative forces\u2014works on human beings between birth anddeath. This must be grasped and understood artistically. It is only by clairvoyantly raising the customary method of science to an artistic perception of the world that we can grasp how theforces that a person brings to earth and takes up into the spiri-tual world again organize him or her from birth until death. Now, if we are working as teachers\u2014as artists in educa- tion\u2014on human beings, we must enter into relation with theirsupersensible, creative principle. For it is upon this principlethat the teacher and educator works. External works of art can be created by fantasy and imagination. But, as an educator, one can be an artist only if one is able to enter into connection withthe supersensible creative element, the supersensible that livesin the human being's self. The anthroposophical method of research makes this possible and so provides the basis for an art of teaching and education. If we imagine a sculptor working at a figure that, when it is finished, comes to life and walks away, we can understand why the artist will count on his creation remaining as he or she leaves it. But, as parents and teachers, we are working on achild who not only lives on but grows and continues to evolve.Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 208 When educators have completed their work upon the child, they are in the position of an artist whose work continues to evolve. For this, philosophy does not suffice, only pedagogical principles and methods do: exact clairvoyance. I would like tosum up in a picture how we must work in such artistic educa-tion\u2014for artistic education is, finally, the great principle of our Waldorf method. We know that a child's head, arms and legs continue growing and developing. The whole organism devel-ops. Likewise, we must realize that the child before us is only ina childlike stage and that whatever we bring to the child\u2014all that a child acquires through our education\u2014goes on growing with the child throughout its life. Waldorf education, which we at the Goetheanum are endeavoring to cultivate and carry into the world, sows in the child something that can grow and thrive from early childhood into old age. There are men and women who have a wonderfulpower in old age; they need only speak and the very tone oftheir voices, the inner quality of their speech, works as a bless- ing. Why, we might ask ourselves, can some people raise their hands and have an influence of real blessing? Our educationalinsight tells us that only those can do so who in childhood havelearned to pray, to look up in reverence to another human being. To sum it up in one sentence, we can say that all chil- dren who rightly learn to fold their hands in prayer will be ableto lift their hands in blessing in old age. I would now like to speak about how we are trying to find the right pedagogy and educational practice. Human life gives rise to many illusions. When speaking of the tasks of education, the greatest illusions are possible. We canproclaim wonderfully transparent ideals of education that appeal to heart and mind. We can even exercise persuasion with them\u2014at first. But, in the real life of teaching and educating,something altogether different is needed from this faculty ofEducation and Drama 209 knowing intellectually, or even in the goodwill of our hearts, what we wish to develop in the human beings we are educating. Imagine, for example, a teacher whose talents are not above average\u2014for not every teacher can be a genius\u2014and who musteducate a child who will afterward become a genius. Very littleof what such a teacher conceives as his or her ideals can be instilled into such a child. But a method of education founded on exact clairvoyance knows that there is an inmost core in theinner life of human beings and that the teacher or educatormust simply prepare and smooth the way for this individual core. This inmost individuality always educates itself, through what it perceives in its surroundings, through what it receives bysympathy from life and from the situation into which life placesit. T eachers and educators can work into this innermost individ- ual core of the child only indirectly. What they must do is form and educate a child's bodily and soul life in such a way that, bythe very nature of the education they provide, the growing childmeets the minimum of hindrances and obstacles from the teacher's bodily nature, temperament, and emotional life. Such an education can be achieved only if we really see how the human soul works in and on the body during these years ofchildhood. A child's inner bodily nature, when born into the world, is so organized that it may actually be described, strange as this might sound, as a kind of sensory organism. Until thechange of teeth, which occurs around the seventh year, thewhole child is one great sense organ. It receives impressions not only from the actions but also from the thoughts, feelings, and sentiments of those who educate it. Being thus surrendered tothe environment, a small child is at the same time a little sculp-tor sculpting its whole human nature. It is wonderful to see this inner secret of the child's self-sculpture in the first seven years of its life (seven years, as I said, is only approximate\u2014it contin-ues until the change of teeth occurs).Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 210 How we speak to a child, whether we admonish it or not, the way we speak in a child's presence, the manner of our speech and of all our actions, all of this enters plastically into a child's inner life. This is the educative force. It is only an illu-sion to imagine that the child in those early years gains any-thing from our admonishments, our moral lecturing, our talking to it for its own good. In the presence of the child we should act, say, and think only what we would wish the childto receive into itself. All of this changes when the child sheds its milk teeth, at approximately the age of seven\u2014the exact moment is not to be taken pedantically. Around this time, the spiritual element thatworks plastically in the child grasps not only the nerve-and-sense system but also the lungs, the heart, and the circulatory system\u2014the whole inner rhythm of the organism. In soul life, this spiritual element is connected with the life of feeling andfantasy. Thus, while we say that, until about the seventh year,the child is an inner sculptor, from then onward, until the four- teenth year\u2014until the time of puberty\u2014we can describe the child as an inner musician. We must not work on the child atthis age with abstract concepts. We must realize that the childbefor e u s w ants to permeat e h is or h er wh ole body mu sically , with inner rhythm. We shall be educating the child rightly if we meet this inner rhythmical-musical need in the child. All educa-tion from the seventh to fourteenth years must thus be basedupon an artistic approach to the subjects that are taught. At first, the plastic and sculptural element is still at work. Writing and reading are taught, not abstractly, but deriving eachletter from artistic feeling. Musical instruction is introduced andis widened out into eurythmy\u2014which is, in effect, a rhythm of the whole organism. In eurythmy, the will for limb movements and the tendency to movement in the larynx and the neighbor-ing speech organs is transferred to the whole body and its severalEducation and Drama 211 movements. The larynx produces movements in the air, and thus to spoken sound. In eurythmy, the whole body becomes a moving organism of speech. We see the children take to eurythmy's language of movement with inner satisfaction, justas a small child takes to the spoken language of sound. An artistic element underlies all teaching and education from the change of teeth till puberty. The artistic element is present also in what we are able to teach in the domain of art itself. Atfirst, with the innate tendency to develop the plastic sense intoan inner musical life, children are receptive to what we can bring by way of lyric poetry. Then, with the ninth or tenth year\u2014earlier in one child, later in another\u2014a sense for the epicawakens. We can now meet the child with epic poetry andpoetic narrative. Then, at a quite definite moment in each child\u2014approximately around the age of twelve\u2014when sexual- ity is beginning to approach\u2014we can observe how the childbecomes receptive to the dramatic element. A demand awakensfor what is dramatic. This is clearly evident if we perceive the child's development. Of course, this does not preclude teachers' having a dramatic element in themselves before this momentcomes for the child. Indeed, teachers cannot cultivate eurythmy,nor lyric nor epic poetry, if they lack this dramatic element in their whole being. But it is from the age of about twelve that the child requires and needs the dramatic element in life. This is the age, too, when we begin to make a transition from a purely artistic education to the first elements of intellec- tual education. Before this time, no importance should be attached to abstract concepts and intellectuality\u2014in the teach-ing of nature study and natural science, for instance. Indeed, aperson's whole life is marred if abstract concepts have been forced on them at too early an age during childhood. Before this twelfth year, everything that is taught should be basedupon art and rhythm. But, with the twelfth year, we begin toWaldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 212 introduce a certain element of the intellectual in our school\u2014 in the teaching of history, for example, inasmuch as history r e v e a l s t h e w o r k i n g o f l a w ; a n d , l i k e w i s e , i n t h e t e a c h i n g o f physics. And so it is now that, as an opposite pole to the intel-lectual element, the child demands dramatic activity. In the Waldorf school at Stuttgart, where we are trying to work out of the child' s nature in this manner , we have seen a group of boys of about thirteen or fourteen come and say, \"Wehave been reading Shakespeare's Julius Caesar , and we would now like to act it, too.\" Thus, while we were careful to begin to develop intellectuality at the right age, young human nature asked for the element of drama of its own accord. This is whathappens if we can bring children the right thing at the righttime and in the right way. Naturally, the students said how pleased they were to have performed Julius Caesar and that this was of greater interest to them than watching a performance byprofessional actors on the stage. Nor can we wonder that it wasShakespeare who called forth this inner dramatic need in the boys of the Waldorf school. For we know that there is some- thing in Shakespeare from which even Goethe could learn theessence of the dramatic. What lives in Shakespeare works intothe soul and mind of the child, and becomes in the child a strong impelling force. As the time is now well advanced, I should like to close for today. On Sunday, I shall have to speak again on Shakespeare inconnection with the new ideals in education. Perhaps what I have had to say in a short talk on education and the role of drama may be a contribution to the endeavors of this honorededucational society. Seeing, on the one hand, the world-histori-cal figure of Shakespeare and on the other the great tasks of education, we cannot but be mindful that, while many ideals are necessary for our present life, the most important of themall will doubtless be the ideals of education.Education and Drama 213 RUDOLF STEINER'S NOTES (for his lecture in Stratford on April 19, 1922) I) It is an art of education, based on anthroposophy.

The senses are not predisposed for perceiving , but for plastically forming the organism. _________________________ 7th-14th years. Human beings develop from the breathing and circulatory systems.

But I am convincedthat it is not so necessary to speak of new ideals today as it is tospeak of a wider question, namely the following: How are menand women of our time to regain the power to follow ideals?After all, no great power is required to speak about ideals;indeed, it is often the case that those who speak most aboutthese great questions, expanding beautiful ideals in abstractwords out of their intellect, are those who lack the very powerto put ideals into practice. Sometimes, speaking of idealsamounts to no more than holding onto illusions in the mind inorder to pass over life's realities. At this festival, however, we have every cause to speak of what is spiritual as a reality. For this festival commemoratesShakespeare, and Shakespeare lives in what is spiritual in allthat he created; he lives in it as in a real world. ReceivingShakespeare into our minds and souls might therefore be thevery stimulus to give us men and women of today the power, 1. Many gaps exist in the notes to this lecture, but because of the lack of a shorthand version it was impossible to check it for accuracy.8chapter 218 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 218 the inner impulse to follow ideals, to follow real, spiritual ide- als. We shall see our true ideals aright if we bear in mind howtransitory many modern ideals have been and are, and howmagnicently rm are many old ideals that still hold theirown in the world by their effectiveness. Do we not see widecircles of believers in this or that religion, who base theirinnermost spiritual life and their inner mobility of spirit onsomething of the past, and gain from it the power of spiritualupliftment? And so we ask how is it that many modern ideals,beautiful as they are, and held for a while with great enthusi-asm by large numbers of people, before long vanish as into acloud, whereas religious or artistic ideals of old carry their fullforce into humanity not just through centuries but eventhrough millennia? If we ask this question, we are brought back repeatedly to the fact that, whereas our modern ideals are generally no morethan shadow pictures of the intellect, the old ideals were gar-nered from real spiritual life, from a denite spirituality inher-ent in the humanity of the time. The intellect can never givehuman beings real power from the depths of their being. And,because this is so, many modern ideals vanish and fade awaylong before what speaks to us, through the old religious faiths,or through the old styles of art, from hoary antiquity. Returning to Shakespeare with these thoughts in mind, we know that a power lives in his dramatic work that not onlyalways gives us fresh enthusiasm but also kindles within us\u2014inour imaginations, in our spiritual natures\u2014our own creativepowers. Shakespeare has a wonderfully timeless power and, inthis power, he is modern, as modern as can be. Here, from the point of view of the connection between human ideals and Shakespeare, I might perhaps call to mindwhat I mentioned last Wednesday, namely Shakespeare's deeplysignicant influence on Goethe. Countless books and treatises8chapter 219 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 219 have been written on Shakespeare out of academic cleverness\u2014 exceptional cleverness. Taking all of the learned works onHamlet alone, I think that one could ll library shelves that would cover this wall. But, when we seek to nd what it was inShakespeare that worked on such a man as Goethe, we nallycome to the conclusion that absolutely nothing relating to thatis contained in all that has been written in these books. Theycould have remained unwritten. All of the effort that has beenbrought to bear on Shakespeare stems from the world of thehuman intellect, which is certainly good for understandingfacts of natural science and for giving such an explanation ofexternal nature as we need to found for our modern technicalachievements, but which can never penetrate what stands liv-ingly and movingly before us in Shakespeare's plays. Indeed, I could go further. Goethe, too, from this standpoint of intellectual understanding, wrote many things on Shake-speare's plays by way of explanation\u2014on Hamlet, for exam- ple\u2014and all of this, too, that Goethe wrote, is, in the main,one-sided and barren. However, what matters is not whatGoethe said about Shakespeare, but what he meant when hespoke from his inmost experience, for example, when he said,\"These are no mere poems! It is as though the great leaves offate were opened and the storm-wind of life were blowingthrough them, turning them quickly to and fro.\" 2 These words are no explanation, but voice the devotion of his spirit. Spokenfrom his own humanity, they are very different from what hehimself wrote by way of explanation about Hamlet . Now, we might ask, why is it that Shakespeare is so difcult to approach intellectually? I shall try to give an answer in apicture. Someone has a vivid dream in which the characters 2. Actually Goethe wrote: \"All Shakespeare's works are thus floating leaves from the great book of nature, chronicles and annals of the human heart.\"8chapter 220 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 220 enact a whole incident before the dreamer. Looking back on it later with the intellect, she or he might say that this or thatgure in the dream acted wrongly; here is an action withoutmotive or continuity, here are contradictions. But the dreamcares little for such criticism. Just as little will the poet carehow we criticize with our intellect and whether we ndactions contradictory or inconsistent. I once knew a pedanticcritic who found it strange that Hamlet, having only just seenthe ghost of his father before him, should speak the mono-logue, \"To be or not to be,\" saying in it that \"no travellerreturns\" from the land of death. This, the man of learningthought, was really absurd! I do not mean to say that Shake-speare's dramatic scenes are dream scenes. Shakespeare experi-ences his scenes in full, living consciousness. They are as con-scious as can be. But he uses the intellect only insofar as itserves him to develop his characters, to unfold them, to giveform to action. He does not make his intellect master of whatis to happen in his scenes. I speak here from the anthroposophical view of the world. This view I believe, does contain the great ideals of humanity.Perhaps, therefore, I may mention at this point a signicantexperience that explains fully\u2014by means of \"artistic seer-ship\"\u2014something that was rst known through feeling. I havealready had occasion to speak about the way in which \"exactclairvoyance\" is being cultivated at the Goetheanum, theschool of spiritual science in Dornach, Switzerland. I havedescribed the paths to this exact clairvoyance in the bookstranslated into English as How to Know Higher Worlds ,Theoso- phy, and An Outline of Occult Science . By means of certain exercises, carried out no less precisely than in the learning ofmathematics, we can strengthen our soul faculties. Gradually,we can so develop our powers of thought, feeling, and will thatwe are able to live with our souls consciously\u2014not in the8chapter 221 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 221 unconsciousness of sleep or in dreams\u2014outside the body. We become able to leave behind the physical body with its intel-lectualistic thought\u2014for this remains with the physicalbody\u2014in full consciousness. Then we have \"imaginations,\" bywhich I do not mean such fanciful imaginings as are justiedin artistic work, but I mean true imaginations , true pictures of the spiritual world surrounding us. Through what I havecalled \"imagination,\" \"inspiration,\" and \"intuition,\" we learnto perceive in the spiritual world. Just as we consciously per-ceive this physical world and, through our senses, learn tobuild an understanding of it as a totality from the single sen-sory impressions of sound and color, so from the spiritual per-ceptions of exact clairvoyance we learn to build up anunderstanding of the spiritual world as a totality. Exact clair-voyance has nothing to do with hallucinations and illusionsthat enter a human being pathologically, always clouding anddecreasing consciousness. In exact clairvoyance, we come toknow the spiritual world in full consciousness, as clearly and asexactly as when we do mathematical work. T ransferring our-selves into high spiritual regions, we experience pictures com-parable, not with what are ordinarily known as visions, butrather with memory pictures. But these are pictures of anabsolutely real spiritual world. All of the original ideals of humanity in science, art, and reli- gion were derived from the spiritual world. That is why the oldideals have a greater, more impelling power than modern intel-lectual ideals. The old ideals were seen in the spiritual worldthrough clairvoyance, a clairvoyance that was at that time moreinstinctive and dreamlike. They were derived and taken from aspiritual source. By all means let us recognize quite clearly thatcertain contents of religious faith are no longer suited to ourtime. They have been handed down from ancient times. Weneed once more wide-open doors to look into the spiritual8chapter 222 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 222 world and to take thence, not such abstract ideals as are spoken of on every side, but the power to follow the ideal and the spir-itual in science, in art, and in religion. If we approach Shakespeare with such powers of seeing into the spiritual world, we shall experience something quite spe-cic, and it is of this that I wish to speak. Shakespeare can beunderstood with true and artistic feeling; exact clairvoyance is,of course, not necessary to have a full experience of his power.But exact clairvoyance can show us something most signi-cant, which will explain why it is that Shakespeare can neverlet us feel he has left us, why it is that he is forever giving usfresh force and impulse. It is this: whoever has attained exactclairvoyance by developing the powers of thought, feeling, andwill can carry over into the spiritual world what we have expe-rienced here of Shakespeare. This is possible. What we haveexperienced here in the physical body\u2014let us say that we havebeen entering deeply into the character of Hamlet or Mac-beth\u2014we can take this experience over into the spiritualworld. We can see what lived in Shakespeare's deep inner lifeonly when we compare it with the impressions that we are ableto take over into the spiritual world from poets of more mod-ern times. I do not wish to mention any particular poet byname\u2014I know that everyone has his or her favorite poets\u2014but any one of the naturalistic poets, particularly of recentyears, could be mentioned. If we compare what we take overfrom Shakespeare with what we have in the spiritual worldfrom these poets, we discover the remarkable fact that Shake-speare's characters live! When we take them over into the spir-itual world, they act. They act differently, but they bring theirlife here into the spiritual world. Whereas, if we take over thecharacters created by a modern naturalistic poet into the spiri-tual world, they really behave more like dolls than humanbeings! They have no life in them at all, no movement!8chapter 223 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 223 Shakespeare's men and women keep their life and character. But the characters of many other poets, derived from natural-ism, are just like wooden dolls in the spiritual world! They gothrough a kind of freezing process! Indeed, we ourselves arechilled by contact with such modern poetry in the spiritualworld. I am not saying this out of any kind of emotion, but as a matter of experience. With this experience in mind, we mayask again: what was it that Goethe felt? \"It is as though thegreat book of fate is opened in Shakespeare, and life's stormywind is turning its pages quickly to and fro.\" Goethe knew andfelt how Shakespeare created from the full depths of the spiri-tual world. This has given Shakespeare his real immortality:this makes him ever new. We can go through a play of Shake-speare's and experience it ten, twenty, a hundred times! Ladies and gentlemen, you have had before you within the last few days the scene from Much Ado about Nothing where the Friar kneels down beside the fallen heroine and utters his con-viction of her innocence. It is something unspeakably deep andtrue, and there is hardly anything in modern literature to becompared with it. Indeed, it is most often the intimate touchesin Shakespeare that work with such power and reveal his innerlife and vitality. Or again, in As You Like It , where the Duke stands before the trees and all of the life of nature in the Forest of Arden, and saysthat they are better counselors than those at court, for they tellhim something of what he is as a human being. What a wonder-ful perception of nature speaks from the whole of this wellknown passage! \". . . tongues in trees, books in the runningbrooks. . . .\" Here is an understanding of nature, here is a read-ing of nature! It is true that the more modern poets can alsoindicate such things, but we often feel that in them it is some-thing second-hand. In Shakespeare, we feel that he is himself8chapter 224 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 224 everything. Even when they both say the same, it is altogether different whether Shakespeare says it or some other poet. Thus the great question comes before us: how is it that, in Shakespeare, there is this living quality that is so intimatelyrelated to the supersensible? Whence comes the life in Shake-speare's dramas? This question leads us to see how Shakespeare,working as he did in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,was able to create something that still had living connectionswith the life of the most ancient drama. And this most ancientdrama, as it speaks to us from Aeschylus, from Sophocles, 3 is in turn a product of the mysteries, those ancient cultic, artisticactions that derive from the most ancient, instinctive, innerspiritual knowledge. We can understand what inspires us so intrue art, if we seek the origin of art in the mysteries. If I now make some brief remarks on the ancient mysteries as the source of the artistic sense and artistic creative power, theobjection can of course very easily be made that what is said onthis subject from the standpoint of exact clairvoyance is unsup-ported by sufcient proof. Exact clairvoyance, however, bringsus into touch not only with what surrounds us at the presentday but also, most empathically, with the world of history, withthe historical evolution of humanity, and of the universe.Those who follow the method that I have described in mybooks can themselves investigate what exact clairvoyance has tosay upon the subject of the mysteries. When speaking of the mysteries, we are looking back into very ancient times in human evolution, times when religion,art, and science did not yet stand separately, side by side, asthey do today. Generally, people are insufciently aware of the 3. Aeschylus, 525-456 BC author of (among others) the Oresteia and Prometheus Bound ; Sophocles, 496-406 BC author of the Oedipus T rilogy, Elektra ,The Trojan Women, etc.8chapter 225 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 225 changes\u2014the metamorphoses\u2014that art, religion, and science have undergone before reaching the separation and differenti-ation that they experience today. I will mention only onething to indicate how, to some extent, modern anthroposoph-ical knowledge brings us into contact again with older formsof true artistic life. Across the centuries, the works of earlier painters\u2014those, say, before the end of the thirteenth and during the fourteenthcenturies\u2014come down to us. We need only think of Cima-bue. 4 Thereafter, something that has rightly held sway in mod- ern painting enters into painting. This is what we callperspective. In the paintings in the dome of the Goetheanumin Switzerland, you can see how we are returning once again tothe perspective which lies in the colors themselves\u2014where wehave a different feeling in the blue, the red, and the yellow. It isas though we were leaving the ordinary physical world: thethird dimension of space ceases to have signicance, and wework in two dimensions only. Thus, a painter can return to a connection with the ancient instinctive spiritual experience of humanity. It is this possibilitythat modern anthroposophy seeks to give through all that Ihave said concerning exact clairvoyance. Looking back at the life of ancient, instinctive clairvoyance, we nd it connected equally with the artistic, the religious, andthe scientic; that is, with the whole of the ancient form ofknowledge. There was always an understanding for the unionof religion, art, and science\u2014which in those days meant a reve-lation of divine cosmic forces\u2014in the mystery cults. Insofar asthey were a manifestation of divine forces, the mystery cults 4. Bencivieni di Pepo, known as Cimabue (1240-1302). Italian painter, known to have worked in Rome, Pisa, and Assisi. Renowned as being atonce the culminating artist in the medieval Byzantine style and the rstmodern artist.8chapter 226 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 226 entered deeply into humanity's religious feelings; insofar as they were already what we call today artistic\u2014what we culti-vate in art\u2014they were the works of art for the people of thattime. And, insofar as those ancient peoples were aware that trueknowledge is gained, not by seeking it onesidedly through thehead, but through the experience of the whole being, theancient mysteries in their development were also mediators forhuman knowledge as it then was. Today, on the other hand,according to the modern view, knowledge can be acquired sim-ply by taking ordinary consciousness\u2014remaining as we are\u2014and observing nature, forming concepts from the facts ofnature. Our modern way of approaching the world in order to gain knowledge of it is not the same as it was in ancient times. Inthe old way, to look into the spiritual world, one had to liftoneself to a higher level of one's humanity. Of course, thisancient way of knowing was not the same as our present exactclairvoyance. Nevertheless, the human being did see into thespiritual world. The mystery rites were enacted, not to displaysomething for the outer eye, but to awaken inner experience inthe whole human being. Mighty destinies formed the subjectof these mystery rites. Through them, human beings werebrought to forget their ordinary selves. They were lifted out ofordinary life. Although in a dream and not as clearly as isrequired today, they entered the state of living outside theirbodies. That was the purpose of the mysteries. By the witnessof deeply-moving scenes and actions, the mysteries sought tobring the neophyte to the point of living and experiencing out-side the physical body. There are certain fundamental experiences characteristic of life outside the body. One great experience is the following. Inthe physical body, our ordinary life of feeling is interwovenwith the organic processes in our own body. But when we are8chapter 227 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 227 outside the body, our feeling encompasses everything that sur- rounds us. We experience in feeling all of the life around us.Imagine that a person is outside the physical body with his orher soul and spiritual life and experiences spiritually\u2014not withthe intellect's ice-cold forces, but with the forces of the soul,with feeling and emotion. Imagine what it feels like to experi-ence outside the body in this way. It is a great sympathy withall things\u2014with thunder and lightning, with the rippling ofthe stream, the welling forth of the river spring, the sighing ofthe wind\u2014and a feeling of togetherness also with other humanbeings, as well as with the spiritual entities of the world. Out-side the body, one learns to know this great empathy. Now, united with this great feeling of empathy, another fun- damental feeling also comes over the human being in the faceof what is at rst unknown. I refer to a certain sense of fear.These two feelings\u2014the feeling of empathy with all the world,and the feeling of fear\u2014played a great part in the ancient mys-teries. When the pupils had strengthened themselves in theirinner lives so that they were able, without turning away andwithout losing their inner control, to bear both the livingempathy with the world and the fear, then they were ripeenough and sufciently evolved really to see into the spiritualworlds. They were then ready to live and experience the spiri-tual world. And they were ready, too, to communicate to theirfellow human beings knowledge drawn from spiritual worlds.With their feeling, they could work down from the spiritualworlds into this world, and a new poetic power was revealed intheir speech. Their hands became skilled to work in colors;they were able to command the inner rhythm of their organismso that they could become musicians for the benet of otherhuman beings. In this way, they became artists. They couldhand down from the mysteries what the primeval religions gaveto humanity. Anyone who looks into the Catholic Mass with8chapter 228 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 228 inner spiritual knowledge knows that it is the last shadowlike reflection of what was living in the mysteries. At rst, what was living in the mysteries had its artistic and its religious side. Afterward, these two separated. In Aeschylusand in Sophocles we already see the artistic element, as it were,lifted out of the mysteries. There is the divine hero,Prometheus. In Prometheus, the human being comes to knowsomething of the deeply-moving, terrifying experiences, theinner fear of the mysteries. What was living in the mysteries, inwhich the neophytes were initiated into a higher stage of life,becomes in Prometheus a picture, though permeated with liv-ing dramatic power. Thus drama became an image of the deep-est human experiences. Aristotle, who was already, in a sense,an intellectual, still lived in some of the old traditions. Heknew and experienced how drama was a kind of echo of theancient mysteries. For this reason, Aristotle said, putting intowords what was an echo of the ancient mysteries living on inAeschylus and Sophocles, what has been dismissed by learnedmen again and again in their books: \"Drama is the representa-tion of a scene calling forth sympathy and fear, in order thathuman beings may be puried of physical passions, that theymay undergo catharsis.\" We cannot understand what thiscatharsis, or purication, means unless we look back into theancient mysteries and see how people were puried of what isphysical and lived through mighty experiences in the supersen-sible, outside their physical bodies. Aristotle describes what hadalready become a picture in Greek drama. Afterward, thispassed over to later dramatists, and we see in Corneille andRacine 5 something that is a fulllment of Aristotle's words. We see characters clothed, as it were, in fear and compassion\u2014 5. Great French classical tragedians: Pierre Corneille (1606-1684); Jean Baptiste Racine (1639-1699).8chapter 229 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 229 compassion that is none other than the ancient sympathy and experience with all the world that the human being experi-enced outside the body. The fear is always there when thehuman being faces the unknown. The supersensible is always,in a sense, the unknown. Shakespeare entered into the evolution of drama in his time. He entered into a world that was seeking a new dramatic ele-ment. Something transcending ordinary human life lives indrama. Shakespeare entered deeply into this. He was inspiredby that ancient dramatic power which, to a certain extent, wasstill felt by his contemporaries. And he worked in such a waythat we feel in Shakespeare that more than a single human per-sonality is at work: the spirit of his century is at work and, withit, the spirit of the whole of human evolution. Shakespeare stilllived in that ancient feeling, and so he called something to lifein himself that enabled him to form his dramatic characters andhuman gures, not in any intellectual way, but by living rightwithin them himself. The characters of Shakespeare's playscome, not from human intellect, but from a power kindled andred in the human being. It is this power that we must seekagain if we would develop the true ideal of humanity. Let us come back to the unication of art, science, and reli- gion. This is our aim at the Goetheanum in Dornach. By thedevelopment of exact clairvoyance, we come to understandwhat was at work in the ancient mysteries. The element thatthe mystery dramatists placed, as yet externally, before theiraudiences was still at work in Shakespeare who recreated it in awonderfully inward way. It is no mere outer feature of Shakespeare's plays that we nd in them about a hundred and fty names of different plantsand about a hundred names of birds, everywhere intimately,lovingly interwoven with human life. All of this is part of thesingle whole in Shakespeare.8chapter 230 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 230 Shakespeare took the continuous current that flows through human evolution from the ancient Mysteries\u2014their cults andrites\u2014wholly into his inner life. He took this impulse of theancient mysteries and his plays come forth like dreams that areawake and real. The intellect with its explanations, its consis-tencies and inconsistencies, cannot approach them. As little aswe can apply intellectual standards to a Prometheus or anOedipus, just so little can we apply them to Shakespeare'splays. Thus, in a wonderful way, we see in Shakespeare's own per- son a development that we can call a mystery development.Shakespeare comes to London where he draws on historical tra-ditions for his material. In his plays, he is still dependent onothers. We see then how, from about 1598 onward, a certaininner life awakens. Shakespeare's own artistic imaginationcomes to life. He is able to stamp his characters with the veryinterior of his being. Sometime later, when he has createdHamlet , a kind of bitterness toward the external physical world comes over him. We feel as though he were living in otherworlds and judging the physical world differently\u2014as thoughhe were looking down from the point of view of other worlds.We then see him emerge from this inner deepening of experi-ence with all of its inner tragedy. First, Shakespeare learns theexternal dramatic medium. Next, he goes through deepestinwardness\u2014what I would call the meeting with the WorldSpirit, of which Goethe spoke so beautifully. Then he re-enterslife with a certain humor, and his work carries with it the lofti-est spirituality joined with the highest dramatic power. Here, Iam thinking, for example, of The T empest , one of the most wonderful creations of all humankind, one of the richest prod-ucts of the evolution of dramatic art. In it, Shakespeare, in aliving, human way, is able to lay his ripe philosophy of life intoevery character and gure.8chapter 231 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Shakespeare and the New Ideals 231 So, having seen the art of drama derive from the ancient mysteries whose purpose was the living evolution of humanity,we can understand how it is that such an educational powergoes out from Shakespeare's plays. We can see how Shakes-peare's work, which arose out of a kind of self education givenby nature herself, which he then lifted to the highest spiritual-ity, can work in our schools and penetrate the living educationof our youth. Once we have thus experienced their full cosmicspirituality, Shakespeare's dramas must be livingly present withus when we consider the great educational questions of the day.But we must be active with all of the means at our disposal, foronly by the deepest spirituality shall we nd in Shakespeare theanswer to these questions. Such are the ideals that humanity needs so sorely. We have a wonderful natural science in our time, but it places a worldthat is dense and material before us. It can teach us nothing elsethan the nal end of it all in a kind of universal death. And,when we consider natural evolution, as it is given to us in thethoughts of the last centuries, it seems like something strangeand foreign when we look up to our spiritual ideals. So we askwhether the religious ideal has a real force, adequate to theneeds of the civilized world today. But it has not. We mustregain this real force by rising to the spiritual world. Only then,by spiritual knowledge and not by mere belief, shall we nd thestrength in our ideals to overcome all material aspects in thecosmos. We must be able to lift ourselves up to the power thatcreates from truly religious ideals, the power to overcome theworld of matter in the universe. We can do this only if we yield ourselves to the spiritual con- ception of the world and, for this, Shakespeare can be a greatleader. Moreover, it is an intense social need that there be aspiritual conception of the world working in our time. Do notthink that I am speaking out of egotism when I refer once8chapter 232 Thu Aug 31 10:33:28 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 232 again to Dornach in Switzerland, where we are cultivating what can lead humanity once more into the reality of the spiritual,into the true spiritual nature of the world. Only because of thiswere we able to overcome many of those contending interestsworking in people today and so sadly splitting them into par-ties and differing sections in every sphere of life. I could men-tion that, from 1913 until now, almost without a break,through the whole period of the war, while nearby the thunderof the cannon was heard, members of no less than seventeennations have been working together in Dornach. That seven-teen nations could work together peacefully during the greatestof all wars, this, too, seems to me a great ideal in education.What is possible on a small scale should be possible on a largescale, and human progress\u2014human civilization\u2014needs it.And, precisely because we favor an international advance inhuman civilization, I point to Shakespeare as a gure whoworked in all humanity. He gave all humanity a great inspira-tion for new human ideals, ideals that have a meaning forinternational, universal humanity. Therefore, let me close on this festival day with these words of Goethe, words that Goethe was impelled to speak when hefelt the fullness of the spirituality in Shakespeare. There thenarose from his heart a saying that, I think, must set its stamp onall our understanding of the great poet, who will remain aneternal source of inspiration to all. Conscious of this, Goetheuttered these words on Shakespeare with which we may closeour thoughts today: 6 \"It is the nature of spirit to inspire spirit eternally.\" Hence, we may rightly say, \"Shakespeare for everand without end!\" 6. These words were spoken by Goethe in a public address given by him on October 14th, 1771; printed in \"Goethe's Works,\" Volume 41 of theSophienausgabe Literatur.9chap \"French Course\" 233 a from the \"French Course\" DORNACH \u2014 SEPTEMBER 16, 1922 Today is the time of intellectualism. The intellect is the fac- ulty of soul, in the exercise of which our inner being partici-pates least. We speak with some justication of the coldness ofintellect, and we need only consider its effect on artistic percep-tion or works of art. The intellect destroys or hinders. Artistsdread the possibility that their creations might be conceptuallyor symbolically explained by clever reasoning. They would liketheir work to be understood with feeling, not with understand-ing. The soul warmth that gave their creations life disappears insuch clarity; it no longer is communicated to the beholder.This warmth is repelled by an intellectual explanation. In social life, intellectualism separates people from one another. We cannot work rightly within the community unlesswe are able to imbue our deeds, which always involve the wealor woe of our fellow human beings with a soul quality. Deedsalone, lacking soul, are not enough. In a deed springing fromintellectualism, we withhold our soul nature, preventing itfrom flowing over to our neighbor. It has often been said that intellectualism has a crippling effect in the teaching and training of children. In saying this,one is thinking, in the rst place, only of the child's intelligence,9chap 234 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 234 not the teacher's. One would like to fashion the methods of teaching in such a way that not only the child's cold powers ofreasoning are developed, but that warmth of heart may beengendered in the child as well. The anthroposophical world-view is in full agreement with this. It accepts fully the excellent educational principles thathave grown from this demand. But it realizes that warmth canbe imparted only from soul to soul. Hence, it is of the opinionthat, above all, pedagogy itself must become ensouled andthereby the teacher's whole activity too. In recent times, indirectly influenced by modern science, teacher training has been strongly permeated by intellectual-ism. Parents have allowed science to dictate what is benecialfor a child's body, soul, and spirit; and so teachers, during theirtraining, have received from science the spirit of their educa-tional methods. But science has achieved its triumphs precisely through intellectualism. It tries to keep its thoughts free from anythingemanating from human soul life. Everything must come fromsensory observation and experimentation. Such science couldamass the excellent knowledge of nature in our times, but itcannot found a true pedagogy. A true pedagogy must be based on a knowledge comprising the human body, soul, and spirit. Intellectualism grasps onlythe physical aspect of the human being, for only what is physi-cal is revealed to observation and experiments. T rue knowledgeof human beings is necessary before a true pedagogy can befounded. This is what anthroposophy seeks to attain. One cannot come to knowledge of human beings by rst forming an idea of the bodily nature with the help of a sciencefounded merely on what can be grasped by the senses, and thenasking whether that bodily nature is ensouled, and whether aspiritual element is active within it. In dealing with a child,9chap 235 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Synopsis from the \"French Course\" 235 such an attitude is harmful; for here, far more than in the adult, body, soul, and spirit form a unity. One cannot care rstfor the health of a child from the point of view of a merely nat-ural science, and then want to give to the healthy organismwhat one regards as proper from the point of view of soul andspirit. In all that one does to and with the child, one eitherbenets or injures his bodily life. In earthly life, the humansoul and spirit express themselves through the body. A bodilyprocess is a revelation of soul and spirit. Material science is necessarily concerned with the body as a physical organism. It does not reach an understanding of wholehuman beings. Many people feel the truth of this but, in regardto pedagogy, they fail to see what is actually needed today.They do not say: pedagogy cannot thrive on material science; let us therefore found our teaching methods on pedagogicalinstincts, not on material science. But they are half-consciouslyof this opinion. We can admit this in theory but, in practice, because mod- ern humanity has mostly lost the spontaneity of the life ofinstinct, it leads to nothing. It would be groping in the dark totry to construct a pedagogy on instincts that are no longerpresent in humanity in their original force. We come to seethis through anthroposophical knowledge. We learn to knowthat the intellectualistic trend in science owes its existence to anecessary phase in the evolution of humanity. In recent times,people passed beyond the period of instinctive life. The intel-lect then became of predominant signicance. Human beingshad to advance along the evolutionary path in the right way.Just as an individual must acquire particular capabilities at aparticular period of life, the evolutionary path led humanbeings to the level of consciousness that had to be attained in acertain epoch. The instincts are now crippled under the influ-ence of the intellect, and yet one cannot try to return to the9chap 236 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 236 instinctive life without working against human evolution. We must accept the signicance of the enhanced consciousness weattained through intellectualism, and give human beings\u2014infull consciousness\u2014what instinctive life can no longer givethem. To this end, knowledge of soul and spirit is needed, founded as rmly on spiritual reality as material, intellectualistic scienceis founded on physical reality. Anthroposophy strives for justthis, yet it is just this that many people shrink from accepting.They learn to know how modern science tries to understandhuman nature. They feel that the modern scientic way isimpossible, but they will not accept that, in order to attainknowledge of soul and spirit, it is possible to cultivate a newmode of cognition that is as clear in consciousness as that withwhich we penetrate physical phenomena. This being so, theywant to return to the instincts as a way of understanding andtraining children. But we must move forward; and there is no other way than to extend anthropology by knowledge of anthroposophy\u2014toextend sensory knowledge by acquiring spiritual knowledge.We must learn all over again. People are terried at the com-plete change of thought required for this. Out of unconsciousfear, they attack anthroposophy as fantastic, yet anthroposophywants only to proceed in the spiritual domain as soberly and ascarefully as material science does in the physical. Let us consider the child. At about the seventh year of life, a child develops his or her second teeth. This is not merely thework of the period of time immediately preceding this change.It is a process that begins with embryonic development andonly concludes with the second teeth. These forces, which pro-duce the second teeth at a certain stage of development, werealways active in the child's organism. But they do not revealthemselves in this way in subsequent periods of life. Further9chap 237 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Synopsis from the \"French Course\" 237 tooth formations do not occur. And yet the forces concerned have not been lost, they continue to work, they have merelybeen transformed . They have undergone a metamorphosis (there are other forces, too, in the child's organism thatundergo a similar metamorphosis). If we study the development of the child's organism in this way, we discover how these forces (leading to the change ofteeth) were previously active in the processes of nourishmentand growth. They lived in undivided unity with the child'sbody, freeing themselves from it only around the seventh year.After the change of teeth, then, they live on as soul forces,active in older children in feeling and thinking. Anthroposophy reveals that an etheric organism permeates the physical organism of the human being. Up to the age ofseven, the whole of this etheric organism is active in the physicalbody. But a portion of it is now freed from direct activity in thephysical body and acquires a certain independence as a vehiclefor a soul life that is relatively free of the physical organism. In earthly life, however, soul experience can develop only with the help of the etheric organism. Before the age of sevenyears, the soul is quite embedded in the physical body andexpresses itself actively only through the body. The child canenter into relationship with the outer world only when thisrelationship takes the form of a stimulus that runs its coursewithin the body. This can happen only when the child imitates . Before the change of teeth, the child is, in the widest sense, apurely imitative being. The aim of education at this stage cantherefore be expressed thus: the conduct of those around the child should be worthy of imitation . A child's educators should experience within themselves what it is to have the whole etheric organism within the physi-cal. This gives them knowledge of the child. One can do noth-ing with abstract principles alone. Educational practice requires9chap 238 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 238 an anthroposophical art of education to work out in detail how, through childhood, a human being gradually emerges. Just as the etheric organism is embedded in the physical organism until the change of teeth, so, from the change ofteeth until puberty, a soul organism, called by anthroposophythe astral organism, is embedded in the physical and ethericorganism. As a result, the child develops a life that no longerexpends itself in imitation. However, children of this age can-not govern their relation to others in accordance with fullyconscious thoughts, regulated by intellectual judgment. Thisbecomes possible only when, at puberty, a part of the soulorganism frees itself from the corresponding part of the ethericorganism. From the age of seven to the age of fourteen, thechild's relationship is not determined by independent judg-ment. It is the relationship effected through authority that isimportant now. This means that, during these years, children should look up to someone whose authority they can accept as a matter ofcourse. The whole education must be fashioned with referenceto this. One cannot build on children's powers of intellectualjudgment at this age. One should perceive clearly that childrenwant to accept what is put before them as true, good, andbeautiful because their teachers, whom they take as their mod-els, regard it as true, good, and beautiful. Moreover, teachers must work in such a way that they do not merely put before the child the true, the good, and the beauti-ful, but, in a sense, they themselves must be these. Not so much what they teach but what the teachers are is what passes over into the children. Everything that is taught should be presentedto the children not as a matter of theory but as a realizableideal, as a work of art.9chap 239 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Synopsis from the \"French Course\" 239 Bibliography Books by Rudolf Steiner: Anthroposophy and the Inner Life (Original English language title: Anthro- posophy\u2014An Introduction ).

Hence, due to human errors in hearing and transcription,they may contain mistakes and faulty passages. We have madeevery effort to ensure that this is not the case. Some of the lectureswere given to audiences more familiar with anthroposophy; theseare the so-called \"private\" or \"members\" lectures. Other lectures,like the written works, were intended for the general public. Thedifference between these, as Rudolf Steiner indicates in his Autobi- ography , is twofold. On the one hand, the members' lectures take for granted a background in and commitment to anthroposophy;in the public lectures this was not the case. At the same time, themembers' lectures address the concerns and dilemmas of the mem-bers, while the public work speaks directly out of Steiner's ownunderstanding of universal needs. Nevertheless, as Rudolf Steinerstresses: \"Nothing was ever said that was not solely the result of mydirect experience of the growing content of anthroposophy. Therewas never any question of concessions to the prejudices and prefer-ences of the members. Whoever reads these privately printed lec-tures can take them to represent anthroposophy in the fullest sense.Thus it was possible without hesitation\u2014when the complaints inthis direction became too persistent\u2014to depart from the custom ofcirculating this material 'for members only.' But it must be born inmind that faulty passages do occur in these reports not revised bymyself.\" Earlier in the same chapter, he states: \"Had I been able tocorrect them [the private lectures] the restriction for members only would have been unnecessary from the beginning.\"9chap 242 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Waldorf Education and Anthroposophy 1 242 THE FOUNDATIONS OF WALDORF EDUCATION THE FIRST FREE WALDORF SCHOOL opened its doors in Stut- tgart, Germany, in September, 1919, under the auspices of Emil Molt,the Director of the Waldorf Astoria Cigarette Company and a student ofRudolf Steiner's spiritual science and particularly of Steiner's call forsocial renewal. It was only the previous year\u2014amid the social chaos following the end of World War I\u2014that Emil Molt, responding to Steiner's prognosisthat truly human change would not be possible unless a sufcient num-ber of people received an education that developed the whole humanbeing, decided to create a school for his workers' children. Conversationswith the Minister of Education and with Rudolf Steiner, in early 1919,then led rapidly to the forming of the rst school. Since that time, more than six hundred schools have opened around the globe\u2014from Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, Belgium, GreatBritain, Norway, Finland and Sweden to Russia, Georgia, Poland, Hun-gary, Rumania, Israel, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argen-tina, Japan etc.\u2014making the Waldorf School Movement the largestindependent school movement in the world. The United States, Canada,and Mexico alone now have more than 120 schools. Although each Waldorf school is independent, and although there is a healthy oral tradition going back to the rst Waldorf teachers and toSteiner himself, as well as a growing body of secondary literature, thetrue foundations of the Waldorf method and spirit remain the many lec-tures that Rudolf Steiner gave on the subject. For ve years (1919-24),Rudolf Steiner, while simultaneously working on many other fronts,tirelessly dedicated himself to the dissemination of the idea of Waldorfeducation. He gave manifold lectures to teachers, parents, the generalpublic, and even the children themselves. New schools were founded.The Movement grew. While many of Steiner's foundational lectures have been translated and published in the past, some have never appeared in English, andmany have been virtually unobtainable for years. To remedy this situa-tion and to establish a coherent basis for Waldorf Education, Anthropo-sophic Press has decided to publish the complete series of Steiner lecturesand writings on education in a uniform series. This series will thus con-stitute an authoritative foundation for work in educational renewal, forWaldorf teachers, parents, and educators generally.9chap 243 Thu Aug 31 10:34:06 1995 Synopsis from the \"French Course\" 243 RUDOLF STEINER'S LECTURES (AND Menschenkunde als P\u00e4dagogik.
