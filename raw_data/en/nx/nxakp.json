There has been prevailing tension between eastern and western medicine ideals. Eastern medicine, or alternative medicine, dives into health care through a mind-body-spirit approach with practices including acupuncture, tai chi, and meditation with advantages of treating addiction, stress, and depression in a natural lens. Western medicine, or modern medicine, is what most of us are familiar with. It is a system in which doctors and other healthcare professionals see patients and treat their symptoms with medications, operations, and beyond with advantages of treating patients quickly with modern medicine in order for the body to resume to daily lives. The tension, however, lies in the fact that eastern medicine comes across as deceptive since there are no scientific research or government support to advocate behind these practices in order to deem them safe and effective. Whereas, western medicine is often credible despite its reputable reputation for being aggressive, potentially dangerous, and unnatural. Bridging eastern and western opts for a more personalized way to care and the intersection leads you to a more fulfilling life. The question I prose is what could potentially be the end result when we do embrace both ideals with harmony? Fulfilling preventive care and natural care. Preventative care aids to help understand potential diseases. Likely to be prescribed to prescriptions by medical practitioner or physician, eastern medicine works to potentially subside preventable diseases with natural remedies such as food therapy and acupuncture. Before committing to a prescription with the common side effects of drowsiness, nausea, and diarrhea, eastern medicine works to approach preventive care through a non-invasive lens. Having individualized care with an understanding of a medical diagnosis. This idea of [integrative medicine](https://exploreim.ucla.edu/health-care/east-meets-west-how-integrative-medicine-is-changing-health-care/) reclaims the relationship between a patient and a physician. In this way, patients receive a more personalized care to support medical diagnosis given by medical practitioner or physician. While western doctors are skilled at identifying diagnosis, eastern doctors notice other symptoms that patients are not aware of and can incorporate that in their treatment. Receiving personalized care can be achieved through a licensed health coach or acupuncturist by having healthy conversations in order to direct the patient into a healthy regime. This integration practice proves that western and eastern doctors have the capacities to support one another without being in competition. Approaching health holistically. Holistic medicine, as respected in eastern approaches, evaluates the entire person and emphasizes the body's own ability to heal itself. However, there are cases where western medicine overrules this idea through emergency surgeries and chemotherapies. It is in eastern medicine that allows the patients to sustain healing and recovery. Adding eastern medicine in the regime as a complementary treatment ensures patients are functioning in their overall well-being through a holistic lens. Trusting your intuition. With experiences in western and eastern medicines, the patient can learn to trust their intuition and listen to what their body potentially needs. As once an idea that western medicine, or modern medicine, knows bodies better than their patients, eastern has been a way for the patient to reclaim their own understanding of their body and their health. Approaching health is subjective and opening the doors for the patient to dabble in both areas can lead to a fulfilling life. Though in practice, western ideals views body as a machine while eastern ideals views body as a garden. As practitioner, learning to live cohesively in the wellness space generates a positive experience for the patient and stops the tension between the two ideals. At the end of the day, it is up to the patient to take action and control of their health. "}
