Italicized words may have differ ent meanings in the certificate than in gener al. Refer to the \"Glossary\" section for the meaning of the italicized wor ds, as they apply to yourplan. The certificate gives youinformation about yourplan. It tells youwhat is covered and what is not cover ed. It also tells youwhat youmust do and how much youmust pay for services. Your plan covers many ser vices, but it is important to remember it has limits. Be sure to read your certificate carefully befor eusing yourbenefits. Covered and non -covered expenses Wewill provide coverage for services, equipment and supplies that are covered expenses . All requirements of the policy apply to covered expenses . The date used on the bill wereceive for covered expenses or the date confir med in yourmedical records is the date that will be used when yourclaim is processed to determine the benefit period. If youincur non-covere d expenses , whether from a network provider or non-network provider ,youare responsible for making the full payment to the health care provider. Not all services and supplies are a covered expense , even when they are ordered by a health care practitioner . Refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits\", the \"Covered Expenses\" and the \"Limitati ons and Exclusions\" sections and any rider or amendment attached to the certificate to see when services or supplies are cover ed expenses or are not covered. How your policy works Youmay have to pay a deductible befor e wepay for certain covered expens es. If a deductible applies, and it is met, wewill pay covered expenses at the coinsurance amount. Refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits\" to see when the deductible applies and the coinsurance amount wepay. Youwill be responsible for the coinsurance amount wedo not pay. If an out-of-pocket limit applies, and it is met, wewill pay covered expenses at 100% the rest of the year, subject to the maximum allowable fee . Ourpayment for covered expenses is calculated by applying any deductible and coinsuranc eto the net charges. \"Net charges\" means the total amount billed by the provider, less any amounts such as: \u00b7Those negotiated by contract, directly or indirectly, between usand the provider; \u00b7Those in excess of the maximum allowable fee ; or \u00b7Adjustments r elated to ourclaims processing edits. The service and diagnostic information submitted on the provider's bill will be used to determine which provision of the \"Schedule of Benefits\" applies.UNDERSTANDING YOUR COVERAGE (continued) NG13CC -C 5Your choice of providers affects your benefits Wewill pay a higher percentage most of the time if yousee a network provider . The amount youpay will be lower. Youmust pay any copayment , deductible or coinsurance to the network provider . Be sure to check if yourprovider is a network provider before seeing them . Wemay appoint certain network providers for certain kinds of services. If youdo not see the appointed network provider for these services, wemay pay less. Wewill pay a lower percentage if yousee a non-network provider. The a mount youpay will be higher. Non-network providers have not signed an agreement with usfor lower costs for services and they may bill youfor any amount over the maximum allowable fee . Youwill have to pay this amount and any copayment , deductible and coinsurance to the non-network provider . Any amount youpay over the maximum allowable fee will not apply to your deductible or any out-of-pocket limit . Some non-network providers work radiolog ists, and emer gency room physicians working with a network hospital, at the network provider benefit level. However, youmay still have to pay these non-network providers any amount over the maximum allowable fee . If possible, you may want to check if al lhealth care providers working with network hospitals are network providers . Refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits\" sections to see what your network provider and non-network provider benefits are. Claims processing edits Payment of covered expenses for services rendered by a provider is also subject to ourclaims processing edits, as determined by us. The amount determined to be payable under ourclaims processing edits depends on the existence and interaction of several factors. Because the mix of thes e factors may be differ ent for ever y claim, the amount paid for a covered expense may vary depending on the circumstances. Accordingly, it is not feasible to provide an exhaustive description of the claims processing edits that will be used to determine t he amount payable for a covered expense , but examples of the most commonly used factors are: The intensity and complexity of a service; \u00b7Whether a service is one of multiple services performed at the same service session such that the cost of the service tothe provider is less than if the service had been provided in a separate service session. For example: -Two or more surgeries occurring at the same service session that do not require two preparation times; or -Two or more radiologic imaging views perfo rmed on the sa me body part;UNDERSTANDING YOUR COVERAGE (continued) NG13CC -C 6\u00b7Whether an assistant surgeon, physician assistant, registered nurse, certified operating room technician or any other health care professional who is billing independently is involved; \u00b7When a charge includes more than one clai m line, whether any service is part of or incidental to the primary service that was provided, or if these services cannot be performed together; \u00b7If the service is reasonably expected to be provided for the diagnosis reported; \u00b7Whether a service was perfo rmed specifically for you; and/or \u00b7Whether services can be billed as a complete set of services under one billing code. Wedevelop ourclaims processing edits in oursole discretion based on ourreview of one or mor e of the following sources, including bu t not limited to: \u00b7Medicare laws, regulations, manuals and other related guidance; practices; \u00b7National Uniform Billing Technology (CPT); \u00b7UB-04 Data Specifications M anual; \u00b7International Classification of Diseases of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Dia gnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; \u00b7Medical and surgical specialty certification boards; \u00b7Ourmedical coverage policies; and/or \u00b7Generally accepted standards of medical, behavioral health and dental practice based on credible scientific evidence recognized in published peer reviewed medical or dental literature. Changes to any one of the sources may or may not lead usto modify curre nt or adopt new claims processing edits. Subject to applicable law, non-network providers may bill youfor any amount wedo not pay, for non - covered expenses , even if such amount exceeds these claims processing edits. Any amount that exceeds the claims p rocessing edits paid by youwill not apply to your deductible , or any or out-of-pocket limit . Youwill also be responsible for any applicable deductible , copayment , or coinsurance . Your provider may access ourclaims processing edits and ourmedical co verage policies at the provider link on ourwebsite at www. huma na.com .

Providers make their own clinical judgments or give their own treatment advice without coverage decisions made by us.UNDERSTANDING YOUR COVERAGE (continued) NG13CC -C 8Thepolicy will not change what is decided between youand health care pr oviders regarding yourmedical condition or treatment options. Providers act on yourbehalf when they order services. Youand your health care practitioner make all decisions about your health care, no matter what we cover. We arenot responsible for an ything said or written by a provider about covered expenses and/or what is not cover ed under this certificate . Call our customer service department at the telephone number listed on yourID card if youhave any questions. Our financial arrangements with providers Wehave agr eements with network providers that may have different payment arrangements \u00b7Many network providers are paid on a discounted fee -for-services basis. This means they have agreed to be paid a set amount for each covered expense ; \u00b7Some health care providers may have capitation agreements. This means the provider is paid a set dollar amount each month to care for each covered person no matter how many services a covered person may receive, from the primary care physician or a specialist. \u00b7Hospitals may be paid on a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) basis or a flat fee per day basis for inpatient services. Outpatient services are usually paid on a flat fee per service or procedure or a discount from their normal charges. Continuity of care If the covered person is receiving treatment from a participating provider and that provider's agreement to provide medically necessary services ter minates for reasons other than medical competence or professional behavior, the covered person may be entit led to continue treatment by the terminating provider if at the time of the provider's termination the covered person is: (1) disabled; (2) being treated for a congenital condition; (3) being treated for a life threatening illness; or (4) past the twenty -fourth week of pregnancy. The treating provider must contact usrequesting continuity of treatment. If we agree to the continued treatment, medically necessary services provided to the covered person by the terminating provider will continue to be payable at the participating provider level of benefit. The maximumduration of continued treatment under this provision may not exceed (1) 90 days from the date of ter mination of the provider's agreement; (2) nine months in the case of the covered personbeing diagnosed with a terminal illness; or (3) through the delivery of a child, including immediate post -partum care and the follow -up visit within the first six weeks of delivery in the case of you past the twenty -fourth week of pregnancy.

Youmust have been continuously covered under the policy or any group health plan it replaced for at least 90 days and: \u00b7Your coverage ends because the employee's employment terminated; \u00b7Youare a cover ed dependent whose coverage ends due to the employee's marriage ending via legal annulment, dissolution of marriage or divorce; \u00b7Youare the surviving covered dependent , in the event of the employee's death or at the end of any survivorship continuation as provided by the policy ; or \u00b7Youhave been a covered dependent child but no longer meet the definition of dependent under the policy ; and \u00b7Your coverage under the policy is not t erminated because of fraud or material misrepresentation. Only persons covered under the policy on the date coverage terminates are eligible to be covered under the Conversion Polic y. The Conversion Policy may be issued covering each former covered personon a separate basis or it may be issued covering all former covered persons together. However, if conversion is due to dissolution of marriage by annulment or final divorce decree, only those persons who cease to be a dependent of the employee areeligible to exercise the medical conversion privilege. The policyholder must notify usthat the covered person has terminated membership with the group plan. Wewill then give written notice of the right to conversion to any covered person entitled to conve rsion. Proper notice will be mailed or delivered to the last known address of the covered person . Written application and payment of the first premium for conversion must be made within 31 days after the date coverage terminates or within 31 days after t he covered person has been given the required notice. No evidence of insurability is required to obtain conversion. If the group policy terminates, due to nonpayment of premium, wewill notify each covered person of their right to continuation within 15 business days after the end of the grace period. If wefail to provide written notice as soon as practicable after being notified of ourfailure to provide written notice, youwill ha ve an additional 60 days after written notice is received.MEDICAL CONVERSION PRIVILEGE (continued) NG13CC -C 97This privil ege does notapply when the employer's participation in the policy terminates and medical coverage is replaced within 31 days by another group insurance plan. Overinsurance -duplication of coverage Wemay refuse to issue a Conversion Policy if wedeter mine that youwould be over insured. The Conversion Policy will notbe available if it would result in overinsurance or duplication of benefits. We will use ourstandards to determine overinsurance. Conversion policy The Conversion Policy which youmayapply for will be the Conversion Policy customarily offered by us as a conversion from group coverage or as mandated by state law. The Conversion Policy is a new policy and not a continuation of yourterminated coverage. The Conversion Policy benefits w ill be substantially similar from those provided under your group coverage. The benefits that may be available to youwill be described in an Outline of Coverage provided to you when yourequest an application for conversion from us. Effective date and premium Youhave 31 days after the date yourcoverage terminates under the policy to apply and pay the required premium for yourConversion Policy.

The premium for the Conversion Policy will be the premium charged by usas of the effective date based upon the Conversion Policy form, classification of risk, age and benefit amounts selected. The premium may change as provided in the Conversion Policy. 225300KY S 11/12COORDINATION OF BENEFITS NG13CC -C 98This coo rdination of benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under more tha n one plan. The order of benefit determination rules below determine which planwill pay as the primary plan . The primary plan pays first without regard to the possibility another planmay cover some expenses. A secondary plan pays after the primary plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all plans do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense . Definitions The following definit ions are used exclusively in this provision. Plan means any of the following that provide benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. However, if separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered part of the same planand ther e is no COB among those separate contracts. Planincludes: \u00b7Group insurance, closed panel or other forms of group or group -type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); \u00b7Hospital indemnity ben efits in excess of $200 per day; \u00b7Medical care components of group long -termcare contracts, such as skilled nursing care; \u00b7Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permitted by law. Plandoes not include: \u00b7Individual or family insurance; \u00b7Closed pane l or other individual coverage (except for group -type coverage); \u00b7Hospital indemnity benefits of accident type coverage; \u00b7Benefits for non -medical group long -termcare contracts; \u00b7Medicare supplement policies; \u00b7Astate plan under Medicaid ; and \u00b7Coverage under other governmental plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage is a separate plan. If a planhas two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separa te plan.COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 99Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary, for the purposes of COB, prescription drug coverage under a Prescription Drug Benefit Rider, if applicable, will be considered a separate planand will therefore only be coordinated with other presc ription drug coverage. Primary/secondary means the order of benefit determination stating whether this planis primary or secondary covering the person when compared to another planalso cover ing the person. When this planis primary , its benefits are de termined before those of any other planand without considering any other plan's benefits. When this planis secondary , its benefits are determined after those of another planand may be reduced because of the primary plan's benefits. Allowable expense means a health care service or expense, including deductibles and copayments, that is cover ed at least in part by any of the plans covering the person. When a planprovides benefits in the form of ser vices (e.g. an HMO), the reasonable cash value of each s ervice will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense or service that is not covered by any of the plans is not an allowable expense . The following are examples of expenses or services that are notallowable expenses : \u00b7If a covere d person is confined in a private hospital room, the differ ence between the cost of a semi - private room in the hospital and the private room, (unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary in terms of generally accepted medica l practice, or one of the plans routinely provides coverage for hospital private rooms) is notan allowable expense . \u00b7If a person is covered by two or more plans that compute their benefits payments on the basis of usual and customary fees, any amount in e xcess of the highest usual and customary fees for a specific benefit is notan allowable expense . \u00b7If a person is covered by two or more plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, any amount in excess of the highest of the fee s is notan allowable expense . \u00b7If a person covered by one planthat calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees and another planthat provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the primary plan's payment arrangement shall be the allow able expense for all plans . \u00b7The a mount a benefit is reduced by the primary plan because a covered person does not comply with the planprovisions. Examples of these provisions are second surgical opinions, precertifica tion of admissions and preferred provider arrangements. Benefit reserve means the savings recorded by a planfor claims paid for a covered person as a secondary planrather than as a primary plan . Claim determination period means a calendar year. Howev er, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under this plan, or before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect.CORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 100Closed panel plan is a planthat provides health benefits to covered persons prim arily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Custodial parent means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. Order of determinatio n rules General When two or mor e plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payment are as follows: \u00b7The primary plan pays or provides its benefits as if the secondary plan or plans did not exist. \u00b7A planthat does not contain a COB provi sion that is consistent with applicable promulgated regulation is always primary . There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that th e supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the planprovided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverage's that are superimposed over base planhospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverage's that are written in connection with a closed panel plan to provide out -of-network benefits. \u00b7A planmay consider the benefits paid or provided by another planin deter mining its benefits only when it is secondary to that other plan. Rules The first of the following rules that describes which planpays its benefits before another planis the rule to use. \u00b7Non-dependent or dependent . The planthat covers the person other than as a dependent , for example as an employee , member, subscriber o r retiree is primary and the planthat covers the person as a dependent is secondary . However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the plancover ing the person as a dependent ; and primary to the plancovering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. retired employee ); then the order of benefits between the two plans is reversed so that the plancovering the person as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree is secondary and the other planisprimary .COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 101\u00b7Child covered under more than one plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one planis: -The primary plan is the planof the parent whose birthday is the earlier in the year if: -The parents are married; -The parents are not separated (whether or not they have been married); or -A court decree awards joint custody with out specifying that one part has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. -If both the parents have the same birthday, the planthat cover ed eit herof the parents longer is primary . -If the specific terms of a court decree state that one parent is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the planof that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that planis primary . This rule applies to claim determination periods or plan years commencing after the planis given notice of the court decree. -Ifthe parents are not married, or are separated (whether or not they ever have been married) or aredivorced, the order of benefits is: -The planof the custodial parent ; -The planof the spouse of the custodial parent ; -The planof the non -custodial parent ; and then -The planof the spouse of the non -custodial parent . or inactive employee . The planthat covers a pers on as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is primary . The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of a person covered as a retiree and an employee . If the other plandoes not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on t he order of benefits, this rule is ignored. \u00b7Continuation coverage . If a person whose coverage is provided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered under another plan, the plancover ing the person as an employe e, member, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's dependent ) is primary , and the continuation coverage is secondary . If the other plandoes not ha ve this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the or der of benefits, this rule is ignored. \u00b7Longer or shorter length of coverage . The planthat cover ed the person as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree longer is primary . To determine the length of time a person has been covered under a plan, two (2) plans shall be treated as one (1) if the cover ed person was eligible under the second within twenty -four (24) hours after the first ended;COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 102Changes during a coverage period that do not constitute the start of a new plan include: -A change in scope of a plan's benefits; -A change in the ent ity that pays, provides or administers the plan's benefits; or -A change from one (1) type of plan to another. The person's length of time covered under a plan is measured from the person's first date of coverage under that plan. If that date is not readi ly available for a group plan, the date the person first became a member of the gr oup shall be used as the date from which to determine the length of time the person's coverage under the present plan has been in force. If the preceding rules do not determ ine the primary plan , the allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the plans meet ing the definition of planunder this provision. In addition, this planwill not pay more that it would have had it been primary . Effects on the benefits of this plan When this planis secondary , benefits may be reduced to the difference between the allowable expense (deter mined by the primary plan )and the benefits paid by any primary planduring the claim determination period . Payment from all plans will not ex ceed 100% of the total allowable expense . The differ ence between the benefit payments that this planwould have paid had it been the primary plan , and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provided shall be recorded as a benefit reserve for the covered person and used by this planto pay an allowable expense , not otherwise paid during the claim determination period . As each claim is submitted, this planwill: -Determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits under its contract; -Determine whet her a benefit reserve has been recorded for the covered person ; and -Determine whether there are any unpaid allowable expenses during the claim determination period . If ther e is a benefit reserve, the secondary plan will use the covered person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100% of total allowable expenses incurred during the claim determination period . At the end of the claim determination period , the benefit reserve returns to zero. A new benefit reserve must be created for each new claim determinatio n period . The benefits of the secondary planshall be reduced when the sum of the benefits payable that would be payable under the other plans , in the absence of a coordination of benefits provision, whether or not a claim is made, exceeds the allowable e xpenses in claim determination period , with a reduction of benefits as follows: -The benefits of the secondary plan shall be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more tha n the allowable expenses ; and -Each benefit is reduced in proportion and charged against any applicable benefit limit of the plan.COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 103If a person is covered by more than one secondary plan , the order of benefit determination rules decide the or der in which secondary plans benefits are determined in relation to each other. Each secondary plantakes into consideration the benefits of the primary plan or plans and the benefits of any other plan, which has its benefits determined before those of that secondary plan . For purposes of determining benefits payable, if the covered person could have enrolled in Medicare Part B, but does not, the amount payable under Medicare Part B is assumed to be the amount the covered person would have r eceived if he or she enr olled for it. Equal Sharing . If the precedin g rules do not determine the primary plan, the allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the plans meeting the definition of planunder this regulation. However, this plan will not pay mor e than it would have paid had it been primary . If a cover ed person is enrolled in two or more closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one closed panel plan , COB shall not apply between that planand the other closed panel plan Notice to covered persons If youare cover ed by mor e than one hea lth benefit plan, youshould file all claims with each plan. Miscellaneous provisions A secondary planthat provides benefits in the form of services may recover the reasonable cas h value of the services from the primary plan, to the extent that benefits for the services are covered by the primary planand ha ve not already been paid or provided by the primary plan. A planwith order of benefit determination requirements that comply with this administrative regulation may coordinate its benefits with a planthat is \"excess\" or \"always secondary\" or that uses order of benefit deter mination requirements that do not comply with those contained in this administrative regulation on the fo llowing basis: -If the complying planis the primary plan, it shall pay or provide its benefits first; -If the complying planis the secondary plan, it shall pay or provide its benefits first, but the amount of the benefits payable shall be determined as i f the complying planwere the secondary plan. In that situation, the payment shall be the limit of the complying plan's liability; and -If the non -complying plandoes not provide the information needed by the complying planto deter mine its benefits withi n a reasonable time after it is requested to do so, the complying plan shall assume that the benefits of the non -complying planare identical to its own, and shall pay its benefits accordingly. If, within two (2) years of payment, the complying planreceives information as to the actual benefits of the non -complying plan, it shall adjust payments accordingly.COORD INATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 104If the non -complying planreduces its benefits so that the covered person receives less in benefits than he would have received had the complying planpaid or provided its benefits as the secondary planand the non-complying planpaid or provided its benefits as the primary plan, and gover ning state law allows the right of subrogation set forth under the policy , then the complying planshall advance t o or on behalf of the covered person an amount equal to the difference. The complying planshall not advance mor e than the complying planwould have paid had it been the primary planless any a mount it previously paid for the same expense or service, and: -In consideration of the advance, the complying planshall be subrogated to all rights of the covered person against the non -complying plan; and -The advance by the complying planshall also be without prejudice to any claim it may have against a non -compl ying planin the absence of subrogation. Coor dination of benefits differs from subrogation. Provisions for one may be included in health care benefits contracts without compelling the inclusion or exclusion of the other. If the plans cannot agree on the order of benefits within thirty calendar days after the plans have received all of the information needed to pay the claim, the plans shall immediately pay the claim in equal shares and deter mine their relative liabilities following payment, except that n o planshall be required to pay more tha n it would have paid had it been primary . Severability If any provision of this administrative regulation or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is for any reason held to be invalid, the remainde r of this administrative regulation and the application of that provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. Right to receive and release needed information Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed t o apply these COB rules and to deter mine benefits payable under this planand other plans . Wemay get the facts weneed from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under this planand other plans covering the person claiming benefits. Weneed not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this planmust give usany facts weneed to apply those rules and determine benefits payable.COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) NG13CC -C 105Facility of payment A payment ma de under another planmay include an amount that should have been paid under this plan. If it does, wemay pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan. Wewill not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means a reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of serv ices. Right of recovery If the amount of the payments made by usis mor e than weshould have paid under this COB provision, wemay recover the excess from one or mor e of the persons wehave paid or for whom we have paid; or any other person or organizat ion that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the covered person . The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Cooperation required The covered person shall cooperate by providing information and executing any documents to preserve ourright and shall have the affirmative obligation of notifying usthat claims are being made against responsible parties to recover for injuries for which wehave paid. If the covered person enters into litigation or settlement negotiations regarding the obligations of the other party, the covered person must not prejudice, in any way, our rights to recover an amount equal to any benefits wehave provided or paid for the injury or sickness . Failure of the covered person to provide ussuch notice or cooperation, or any action by the covered person resulting in prejudice to ourrights will be a material breach of this policy and will result in the covered person being personally responsible to make repayment. In such an event, wemay deduct from any pending or subsequent claim made under the policy any amounts the covered person owes usuntil such time as cooperation is provided and the prejudice ceases. Legal actions and limit ations No action at law or in equity may be brought to recover under the policy until at least 60 days after written proof of claim has been filed with us. If action is to be taken after the 60 -day period, it must be taken within 3 years of the date writ ten proof of claim was required to be filed. 226790KY S 11/12COORDINATION OF BENEFITS FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLES NG13CC -C 106Definitions Medicare Part A means the Medicare program that provides hospital insurance benefits. Medicare Part B means the Medicare program that provides medical insurance benefits. Medicare Part D means the Medicare program that provides prescription drug benefits. General coordination of benefits with M edicare If youare cover ed under both Medicare and this certificate , federal law mandates that Medicare is the secondary plan in most situations. But when permitted by law, this plan is the secondary plan. In all cases, coordination of benefits with Medicare will conform to federal statutes and regulations. If youare enrolled in Medicare , yourbenefits under this certificate will be coor dinated to the extent benefits are payable under Medicare , as allowed by federal statutes and regulations. Youare considered to be eligible for Medicare on the earliest date coverage under Medicar ecould have become effective for you. Coordination of benefits with Medicare Part B If youare eligible for Medicare Part B , but are not enrolled, yourbenefits under the policy maybe coordinated as if youwere enrolled in Medicare Part B . Wemay notpay benefits to the extent that benefits would have been payable under Medicare Part B , if youhad enrolled. Therefore, it is important that youenroll in Medicare Part B if youare eligible to do so. 227200KY S 11/12CLAIMS NG13CC -C 107Notice of claim Network providers submit claims to uson yourbehalf.

Such coverage may be subject to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions as may be deemed appropriate and as are consistent with those established for other benefits under the plan. Statement of rights under the newborns' and mothers' health protection act (NMHPA) If your plan covers no rmal pregnancy benefits, the following notice applies to you. Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection wit h childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., physici an, nurse midwife, or physician assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers may not set the level of benefits or out -of-pocket costs so any later portion of the 48 -hour (or 96 -hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a group health plan or health insurance issuer may not, under federal law, require a physi cian or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce your out -of-pocket costs, you may be required to obtain pre -authorizati on. For infor mation on pre -authorization, contact your plan administrator.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 3Medical child support orders An individual who is a child of a covered employee shall be enrolled for coverage under the group health plan in accordance with the direction of a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) or a National Medical Support Notice (NMSO).

QMCSO also means a state court order or judgment enforcing state Medicaid law regarding medical child support required by the Social Security Act \u00a71908 (as added by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). An NMSO is a notice issued by an appro priate agency of a state or local government that is similar to a QMCSO requiring coverage under the group health plan for a dependent child of a non -custodial parent who is (or will become) a covered person by a domestic relations order providing for heal thcare coverage. Procedures for determining the qualified status of medical child support orders are available at no cost upon request from the plan administrator. General notice of COBRA continuation coverage rights Introduction You are getting this notice because you recently gained coverage under a group health plan (the Plan). This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice explains COBR A continuation coverage, whenit may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it. When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBR A continuation coverage. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family w hen group health coverage would otherwise end. For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 4You may have other option s available to you when you lose group health coverage. For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, you may qualify for a 30 -day special enr ollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse 's plan), even if that plan generally doesn 't accept late enrollees. What is COBRA continuation coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would other wise end because of a life event . This is also called a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary\". You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of th e qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you to lose your coverage under the Plan becaus e of the following qualifying events : \u00b7Your hours of employment are reduced; or \u00b7Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you to lose your coverag e under the Plan because of the following qualifying events : \u00b7Your spouse dies; \u00b7Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; \u00b7Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u00b7Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare ben efits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or \u00b7You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following events : \u00b7The parent -employee die s; \u00b7The parent -employee's hours of employment are reduced; \u00b7The parent -employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u00b7The parent -employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); \u00b7The parents become d ivorced or legally separated; or \u00b7The child stops being eligible for coverage under the plan as a \"dependent child\". Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankru ptcy is filed with respect to the employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the Plan, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary. The retired employee 's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 5When is COBRA coverage available? The pla n will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the P lan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying event s: \u00b7The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; \u00b7Death of the employee; \u00b7Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer; or \u00b7The employee 's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both). For all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child) ,you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. How is COBRA Coverage Provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying even t has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on beha lf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of h ours of wor k. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage. Ther e are alsoways in which this 18 -mont h period of COBRA continuation c overage can be extended: \u00b7Disability extension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage -If you or anyone in your family cover ed under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, y ou and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60thday of COBRA continuation coverage and must l ast at least until the end of the 18 -month period of COBRA continuation coverage; \u00b7Second qualifying event extension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage -If your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuatio n coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stop s being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child. This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 6Are there o ther coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage? Yes. Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health pla n coverage options (such as a spouse 's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollmen t period\".

The employee and his or her dependents, if any, will not be insured by the group health plan.

Under TEFRA regulations, there are two categories of persons eligible for Medicare. The calculation and payment of benefits b y the group hea lth plan differs for each category. \u00b7Category 1 Medicare eligibles are: -Cover ed employees in active service who are age 65 or older who choose Option 1; -Age 65 or older cover ed spouses; and -Age 65 or older cover ed spouses of employees in ac tive service who are either under age 65 or age 70 or older; \u00b7Category 2 Medicare eligibles are any other covered persons entitled to Medicare, whether or not they enrolled.

Calculation and payment of benefits For cover ed persons in Category 1, benefits are payable by the policy without regard to any benefits payable by Medicare. Medicare will then deter mine its benefits. For cover ed persons in Category 2, Medicare benefits are payable before any benefits are payable by the policy. The benefits of the policy will then be reduced by the full amount of all Medicare benefits the cover ed person is entitled to receive, whether or not the eligible individual is actually enrolled for Medicare Benefits.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 8Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) If an employee is granted a leave of absence (Leave) by the employer as required by the Federal Family and Medica l Leave Act, s/he may continue to be covered under the plan for the duration of the Leave under the same conditions as other employees who are currently employed and covered by the plan. If the employee chooses to terminate coverage during the Leave, or i f coverage terminates as a result of nonpayment of any required contribution, coverage may be reinstated on the date the employee returns to work immediately following the end of the Leave. Charges incurred after the date of reinstatement will be paid as if the employee had been continuously covered.

An employee's dependents that have coverage under the plan immediately prior to the date of the employee's covered absence are eligible to elect continuation under USERRA. If continuation of Plan coverage is elected under USERRA, the employee or dependent is responsible for payment of the applicable cost of coverage. If the employee is absent for not longer than 31 days, the cost will be the amount the employee would other wise pay for coverage. For absences exceeding 30 d ays, the cost may be up to 102% of the cost of coverage under the plan. This includes the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer.FEDERAL NOTICES (continued) 9Duration of coverage If elected, continuation coverage under USERRA will continue until the earl ier of: \u00b724 months beginning the first day of absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services; or \u00b7The day after the employee fails to apply for a return to employment as required by USERRA, after the completion of a period of service.

Claims submissions must be in a format acceptable to Humana and compliant with any legal requirements. Claims not submitted in accordance with the requirements of applicable federal law respecting privacy of protected health information and/or electronic claims standards will not be accepted by Humana. Claims submissions must be timely. Claims must be filed as soon as reasonably possible after they are incurred, and in no event later than the period of time described in the benefit plan document. Claims submissions must be complete and delivered to the designated address. At a minimum they must include: \u00b7Name of the cover ed person who incurred the covered expense; \u00b7Name and address of the provider; \u00b7Diagnosis; \u00b7Procedure the vice; \u00b7Date of service; and \u00b7Billed amount. Presentation of a prescription to a pharmacy does not constit utea claim for benefits under the plan. If a cover ed person is required to pay the cost of a covered prescription drug, he or she may submit a written claim for plan benefits to Humana. A general request for an interpretation of plan provisions will not be consider ed a claim. Requests of this type, such as a request for an interpretation of the eligibility provisions of the plan, should be directed to the plan administrator. Appeal and External Review Notice (continued) 6Failure to provide necessary information If a pre-service claim submission i s not made in accordance with the plan 's requirements, Humana will notify the claimant of the problem and how it may be remedied within five days (or as soon as possible but not more than 24 hours, in the case of an urgent -care claim ). If a post-service c laimis not made in accordance with the plan 's requirement, it will be returned to the submitter. Authorized representatives A cover ed person ma y designate an authorized representative toact on his or her behalf in pursuing a benefit claim, an internal appeal or an external review . The authorization must be in writing and authorize disclosure of health information. If a document is not sufficient to constitute designation of an authorized representative, as determined by Humana, the plan will not cons ider a designation to have been ma de. An assignment of benefits does not constitute designation of an authorized representative. Any document designating an authorized representative must be submitted to Humana in advance or at the time a n authorized re presentative commences a course of action on behalf of the covered person. Hum ana may verify the designation with the covered person prior to recognizing authorized representative status. In any event, a health care provider with knowledge of a covered p erson's medical condition acting in connection with an urgent -care claim will be recognized by the plan as the covered person 's authorized representative. Cover ed persons should carefully consider whether to designate an authorized representative. Circum stances may arise under which an authorized representative may make decisions independent of the covered person, such as whether and how to appeal a claim denial. Claims decisions After a determination on a claim is made, Humana will notify the claimant within a reasonable time, as follows: \u00b7Pre-service claims -Hum ana will provide notice of a favorable or adverse benefit determination within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances but no later than 15 days after the plan receives the claim.

Before the end of the initial 15 -day period, Hum ana will notify the claimant of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which Hum ana expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because Humana does not have enough information to decide the claim, the notice of extension will describe the required information, and th e claimant will ha ve at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the necessary information. Appeal and External Review Notice (continued) 7\u00b7Urgent -care claims -Hum ana will determine whether a particular claim is an urgent -care claim . This determination will be based on informati on furnished by or on behalf of a cover ed person.

If the reason for the extension is because Humana does not have enough information to decide the claim, the notice of extension will describe the required information, and the claimant will ha ve at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information.
