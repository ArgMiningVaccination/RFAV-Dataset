Allthree children had eaten fish congee (a riceand fish porridge) as a weaning food and atefish regularly as toddlers. Their parents had sought medical advice for either develop- mental delay or neurological symptoms in the children. A 2-year-old boy had demonstrated increasingly aggressive behaviour for the past 6 months. A general practitioner had diagnosed mercury poisoning in the boy's father 2 months earlier, following investiga-tion for complaints of allergies, rashes,abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The familyate fish (usually salmon, barramundi orsnapper) at least five times a week, and had used unspecified herbal medicines in the past. The child had eaten fish regularly sinceweaning. The boy's blood mercury level was158 nmol/L (normal range [NR], < 50 nmol/L), a random urine mercury/creatinine (Hg/C r ) r a t i o w a s 9n m o l / m m o l ( N R , <6n m o l / mmol*), and his hair mercury level was 1.42 mg% (NR, < 0.18 mg%). The boy'sfather and mother (who was pregnant) alsohad elevated hair mercury levels, of4.3 mg% and 6.0 mg%, respectively . The father and child were treated with chelation therapy elsewhere.A boy aged 2 years and 10 months pre- sented with delayed speech and some autistic features. Since weaning, he had eaten fish (barramundi, sea perch, salmon and rockcod) up to eight times a week. He had nohistory of herbal medicine use, and his thy-roid function, blood lead level, and a DNAscreen for fragile X syndrome were normal. The child's blood mercury level was 350 nmol/L and urine Hg/Cr ratio was14 nmol/mmol (NR, < 10 nmol/mmol*). The boy's father did not eat fish, and his blood mercury level was 19 nmol/L. The child'smother did eat fish, and had a blood mercury level of 27nmol/L. T wo weeks after removing fish from the diet, the child's blood mercury level had fallen to 99 nmol/L and his urineHg/Cr ratio to 7nmol/mmol. However, hisbehaviour did not improve, and he was sub-sequently diagnosed with classical autism. A 15-month-old boy presented with delayed development since birth. Fish hadbeen introduced to his diet at 8 months ofage, and he had since continued to consumefish four to five times a week. He had recentlyeaten either ling or salmon. The boy' s motherhad consumed ling three to four times a week after the fifth month of her pregnancy . The child's thyroid function, DNA screen for frag-ile X syndrome, chromosome karyotype, andurinary metabolic screen were normal. Hisblood mercury level was 143nmol/L, but fellto 19 nmol/L over a period of 1 year after ceasing fish intake. His longer-term develop- mental status is unknown. Fish congee, made with either freshwater species or locally caught fish, is a common weaning food in coastal regions of southernChina and South-East Asia. 1 Adding fish to the weaning diet has health benefits,1,2 such as reducing anaemia, and is actively promoted.However, fish, particularly the large pelagic (open ocean) species more likely to be boughtin Australia, may also contain mercury . Exces-sive consumption of mercury has been associ-ated with neurological impairment. 3-5 The Box shows that the consumption by infants of fish congee made from portions of large fish species may exceed the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI)7 for methyl- mercury of 1.6 g/kg bodyweight/week (the limit considered sufficient to protect a deve- loping fetus).

It has been previously noted in the Jour- nal that public health policy regarding fishconsumption needs to balance the healthbenefits for cardiovascular disease and anae-mia with the possible ill effects of mercuryon neurological development in infants. 8 We recommend that multilingual infor- mation about fish and mercury be madeavailable to pregnant women and mothers,especially targeting groups who are likely to be frequent consumers of fish and who use fish in weaning and infant foods. Regulatoryand health promotion activities could alsobe informed by surveillance of blood or hairmercury levels in infants from ethnic groupsat high risk of mercury intoxication, and of the frequency of fish consumption in this age group (by type of fish).

Prostate cancer screening and bacteraemia Francis J Bowden, Jan Roberts and Peter J Collignon TO THE EDITOR : Prostate cancer screening remains controversial. There is currently a lackof evidence that treating prostate cancers iden-tified by screening leads to prolonged sur- vival, 1 and the main screening test (serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration)has poor sensitivity and specificity . Patients with an elevated PSA level usually undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) prostatebiopsy for definitive diagnosis. TRUS biopsy bleeding, urinary tract and bacter- aemia. tered. 2 Gram-negative bacteraemia is usually associated with a mortality rate of at least 5%.3 We reviewed prostate biopsy-associated bacteraemia in Australian Capital Territory residents using data collected over the 5- year period from 2002 to 2006. All patientsin ACT public hospitals who have positive blood culture results are followed as part of a bloodstream infection surveillance pro-gram. Although all prostate biopsies areperformed in the private sector, nearly all patients who develop major complications are cared for in public hospitals. Thenumber of biopsies performed on ACT resi- dents during the study period was obtained from Medicare Benefits Schedule statistics(item numbers 37215, 37218 and 37219). 4 Over the 5-year period, we identified 19 episodes of bacteraemia following 1843prostate biopsies, representing a 1.0% riskof bacteraemia (95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%) (Box). No patients died, but five required admis- sion to the intensive care unit. A 1% bacteraemia rate associated with prostate biopsies would be an underestimate of the true rate, for a number of reasons:some patients were also admitted withsevere sepsis syndromes but with negative blood cultures; some patients may have been treated in another state; and somepatients may have presented to private hos- pitals, specialists or general practitioners and been treated empirically without blood cultures being collected. Three additionalcases of bacteraemia following TRUS biop- sies were excluded from our rate calcula- tions because they involved New SouthWales residents. It has been estimated that, if a million men over 50 years of age were screened,about 110 000 would have raised PSA lev-els. 5 Of these, about 90 000 would undergo a biopsy and 20 000 would be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Our data show thatTRUS biopsies carry a risk of serious infec- tive complications and, notably , about 75% of these complications would occur in menwithout prostate cancer. We believe that data on the likely compli- cation rates resulting from PSA testing and TRUS biopsies must be factored into consid-erations of the benefits versus risks and the cost-effectiveness of any prostate cancer screening program.

We wish to drawattention to the association between severe staphylococcal pneumonia and a preceding influenza-like illness. In September 2006, a 56-year-old woman of European background with a history of chronic back pain and depres- sion presented to the Royal Darwin Hospi- tal after a 4-day influenza-like illness characterised by cough, fever and sore throat. She then developed dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain, followed by an abrupt respiratory deterioration. She was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis. A chest x-ray showed widespread bilateral pneumonia. We began broad-spectrumantibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazo- bactam and azithromycin as tal's dry-season protocol for severecommunity-acquired pneumonia. Furtherhistory from her husband revealed an epi- sode of boils 1 month previously , which responded to antibiotic therapy . We addedvancomycin to the therapy and, when spu- tum and blood cultures showed MRSA 48 hours after admission, we also addedrifampicin and gentamicin. On Day 5 of admission, her clinical condition deterio- rated further and we replaced rifampicinand gentamicin with linezolid. Comple-ment fixation testing of serum taken on admission showed an influenza A antibody titre of 128, consistent with recent acuteinfection. Despite ongoing intensive sup- portive care, the patient died from refrac- tory respiratory failure 10 days afteradmission. Ty p i n g o f t h e S. aureus isolates from blood and sputum showed that their single nucleotide polymorphism and variable gene profile was consistent with theQueensland (ST93-MRSA-IV) of CA-MRSA, and that the Panton-Valentine leu- kocidin gene was present. S. aureus has long been a recognised cause of influenza-associated pneumonia.Of concern, two recent reports from theUnited States identified 25 patients withCA-MRSA associated with severe pneumo-nia following influenza-like illnesses. 3,4 Most of these patients were young (median age of 21 years3 and 17.8 years,4 respec- tively) and otherwise healthy . Combinedmortality in these two studies was 40%. With an increasing prevalence of CA- MRSA in areas of Australia, 2 CA-MRSA pneumonia should be suspected in patients presenting with worsening respi- ratory status and sepsis following an influ-enza-like illness. We stress the importanceof annual influenza vaccination for thoseat increased risk of influenza-related com-plications. 5 Acknowledgements: Steven Tong is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council Training Scholarship (No. 436033).

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitals: time for a culture change Keith V Woollard TO THE EDITOR : The recent editorial by Collignon and colleagues emphasised the importance of infection control mechanisms in reducing patient harm from antibiotic- resistant organisms.1 It focused on disinfec- tion of the hands of health care workers in hospitals. However, a vigorous education andsurveillance program in a hospital in Victoriafailed to achieve compliance among health care workers of even 50%. 2 Top of the list of self-reported factors leading to poor compli- ance is \"skin irritation and dryness associatedwith the use of hand hygiene agents\". 3 There have been no properly controlled trials, with clinically important endpoints,of currently recommended hand-hygienepractices. With the likely poor compliancerates, such trials would likely fail. A different approach might be more effec- tive. Reducing skin contact between health care workers, patients and their immediateenvironment seems logical. Data show thatskin contact produces two-step transfer ofmaterial in 82% of cases. 4 The Victorian study did include gloving as an alternative to disinfection in measuring hand-hygienecompliance. 2 How eve r , in what might b e a backward step, a recent study concludedthat physicians should be encouraged toshake hands with patients! 5 Perhaps an educational campaign to avoid skin contact with environmental surfacesand other health care workers, with use ofdisposable gloves for patient contact, couldbe the basis of a successful trial to address more effectively the transmission of antibi-otic-resistant organisms in hospitals.

Reporting of MRSAinfections is thought to be complete from alljurisdictions except Victoria and New SouthWales. Figures for Victoria were extrapolated from accurate surveillance data representing 50%-60% of events. The degree of incom-pleteness of reporting in NSW could not bedetermined, and a range based on reports toNSW Health over 3 years was used. Overallmorbidity of health care-associated MRSA in Australia is much higher, as only a minority of MRSA infections lead to bacteraemia. The ASID report estimated that between 699 and 924 cases of bacteraemia would beprevented if other states and territoriesreduced their incidence of MRSA bacterae-mia to that of Western Australia throughimplementation of more stringent infection control measures. The mortality of MRSA bacteraemia is 8%-50% (average, 29%). 2 A recent study showed that more than half(59%) of such deaths were directly attribut-able to MRSA 3 rather than other non-infec- tive causes. These outcome proportions provide a minimum estimate of between 120 and 158 preventable deaths per annumin Australia directly caused by health care-associated MRSA \u2014 comparable to theannual South Australian road toll. As identified recently in the Journal by Collignon and colleagues, there are signifi-cant structural barriers to achieving infec- tion control \u2014 especially inadequate isolation resources and pressure on bedstock. 4 Other dimensions of the MRSA problem include the high incidence ofMRSA in many aged care facilities, the epi-demic emergence of community strains of MRSA (best described in the recent report from WA on MRSA notification data up until2002 5), the possibility of significant zoonotic reservoirs,6 and the role played by imprudent antibiotic use. MRSA colonisation or infection needs to be made a nationally notifiable disease, witha system in place to enable typing of isolates. As in WA, such a system would enable moreeffective identification of MRSA carriers before hospital admission, the detection of emerging epidemic strains, and timelyinvestigation of MRSA outbreaks occurringin community groups, such as in aged carefacilities. Most importantly , all states andterritories need to adopt, and provide resources for, consistent, stringent approaches to surveillance, prevention andcontrol of health care-associated MRSA thatare in keeping with internationally recom-mended approaches. Given the scale of pre-ventable injury occurring in many states, MRSA control must be made one of the highest priorities for patient safety .

Luke F Chen, Deverick J Anderson, Keith S Kaye and Daniel J Sexton TO THE EDITOR : The recent editorial by Collignon and colleagues challenged Aus-tralian physicians and health care leaders toconfront the rising burden of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 1 Compared with Australia, the United States has a bigger problem with MRSA; more than60% of all hospital-acquired S. aureu s infec- tions are now caused by MRSA. 2 Appropriately , the medical community has made an urgent call for action. For example, the Institute for HealthcareImprovement (a not-for-profit organisationbased in the US that aims to improve healthcare throughout the world) incorporatedspecific MRSA prevention measures into its recent 5 Million Lives Campaign (see http:// www.ihi.org/ihi). One of these preventionmeasures, a recommendation for active sur-veillance, has generated controversy. Specifi-cally , the cost-effectiveness of this strategy isstill vigorously debated in the infection con- trol literature. 3 At present, it is unclear what surveillance testing method should be usedin the laboratory , and whether testingshould be done for all patients or just thoseidentified as high risk. The cry for help from community activists in the US and the United Kingdom has reached the ears of their legislative repre-sentatives. In two northern US states, law-makers are considering bills that requireuniversal active surveillance in their hospi-tals. Mandating resource-stretched health systems to implement obligatory active screening is not a prudent use of resources.The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology ofAmerica and the US Association for Profes-Relative burden of of dataRate per 100 000 population Darwin 16 2006 13.3 New South Wales/ACT*437-602 2003-2005 6.2-8.5 Queensland* 133 MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .

MJA Volume 188 Number 1 7 January 2008 63LETTERS sionals in Infection Control and Epidemiol- ogy recently published a joint position paper opposing this legislative activity , not- ing that data in support of active surveil- lance have been restricted to high-risk populations.4 We support this position and remind readers that active surveillance does not obviate the need for adherence to basic and consistent hand-hygiene practices. Complacency and lack of clinical leader- ship remain the greatest challenges in the efforts to reduce the transmission of MRSA. Why do we accept this epidemic as a fact of life as our health care workers complacently contribute to the nosocomial transmissionof MRSA? By implementing simple preven- tion policies, feedback of data on nosoco- mial transmission of MRSA, and increased infection-control education, we have achieved a 22% reduction in MRSA infec- tions in our network of community hospi- tals. 5 Still, we acknowledge the absence of a zero-tolerance approach to failures in hand- hygiene practices. More needs to be done. We challenge our clinical leaders to demand higher standards for hand hygiene. Most cases of nosocomial MRSA transmission rep- resent failures of basic hygiene practices. The problem is surmountable. Infection control is not a skill of a few, but the responsibility of every team member. The onus is on all of us.

Peter J Collignon, M Lindsay Grayson and Paul D R Johnson IN REPLY : We thank Woollard for his com- ments on hand hygiene. While important,hand hygiene is just one component of what isneeded to decrease the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hos- pitals. Decontamination of the precautions for colonised patients,active surveillance and screening, effective pro-grams to prevent common infections such asintravascular catheter sepsis, good antibiotic stewardship and better hospital design are also indispensable. 1 We do not accept that \"There have been no properly controlled trials, with clinicallyimportant endpoints, of currently recom-mended hand-hygiene practices\". For instance,the recent quoted by Woollard showedthat hand hygiene reduced infections hospital-wide, using the clinically important endpointof serious bloodstream infections (MRSA andantibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria). 2 Thus, at least two large peer-reviewed studies show that alcohol-based hand-hygiene pro- grams reduce hospital-acquired MRSAinfections 2,3 (Level III evidence4). There is nothing wrong with using dispos- able gloves, as suggested by Woollard, pro-vided they are changed every time a healthcare worker moves between patients. Other-wise, gloves spread MRSA just as efficiently asunclean hands. Applying good-quality hand-hygiene products is less cumbersome thanchanging gloves and also allows direct human contact, which Woollard reminds us is impor- tant to patients. How MRSA is spread in hospitals is now well known \u2014 our problem is getting healthcare workers to remember to practise goodhand hygiene all the time, every day , beforeand after every patient contact. The data shown by Ferguson and Van Ges- sel reaffirm how common and serious a prob-lem we have with MRSA bacteraemia. Theyestimate there are about five episodes per100000 people annually across Australia.However, we believe that the true rate is double this. The rate of S. aureus bacteraemia (ie, MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus combined) in Australia is around 35 per100 000 per year, 5 with 27% caused by MRSA.5 This crudely translates to an MRSA rate of 9.5 per 100 000. The rates are proba-bly much higher in the states with morehealth care-acquired MRSA (New SouthWales and Victoria). More recent data sug-gest that 36% of hospital-acquired invasiveS. aureus infections were caused by MRSA, with the highest percentages in NSW (41%) and Victoria (39%). 6 It is also worth noting that, when MRSA bacteraemia became notifiable in England in 2001, there was a 50% increase in reportedS. aureus bacteraemia episodes. 1 This suggests that under-reporting is common in any volun-tary reporting scheme, and is also likely forAustralian data. Worryingly , Chen and colleagues point out that MRSA is an even bigger problem in the United States than in Australia. However, weare not far behind. 6 Although we share their concerns about legislative impositions, someexternal controls and measurements can be anadvantage. Western Australia, the only Aus- tralian state where MRSA is notifiable, has the lowest rates of health care-associated MRSA.While we do not want imposed \"one size fitsall\" legislated controls, we do need change: thepractice of the past 40 years has not worked.Every institution needs to have an effective MRSA control program, with components chosen according to the local situation. Institu-tions should measure MRSA and report cen-trally , especially if their rates are high and notfalling continually (eg, over a year). Shop-floorquality improvement programs with empow- ered workers are much better than top-down management-imposed regulation (eg, fromgovernment). We need to shake our complacency and that of our health care colleagues, accept clinicalleadership and take control. Otherwise, legis-lative controls will be imposed on us.

Commun Dis Intell 2007; allergic rhinitis: a randomised, sham-controlled trial Edzard Ernst TO THE EDITOR : Xue and colleagues reported an interesting randomised, single- blind trial of acupuncture for persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) and concluded that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition.1 I am not entirely sure that this is true. The authors state that \"once needling sensation (known as de-qi) was obtained, the needles were manipulated . ..\". In the sham group theyinserted needles at non-acupuncture points where, according to acupuncture theory , no de-qi can be elicited. Thus the interventionpatients were experiencing de-qi, and the con- trol patients were not. This means that neither the patients nor the therapist were blinded. Consequently , the difference in outcome between the two groups could be unrelated toacupuncture itself, and caused by patient expectation, therapist expectation or both. In addition, the statement of Xue et al that \"no other randomised controlled trial of acu-puncture in adults with PAR has been reported in the English medical literature\" 1 was mis- leading. Our review of this topic2 included no fewer than six randomised controlled trials, all either published in English or, in one case,with an English abstract. Interestingly , three of them suggested acupuncture to be effective, while three failed to do so. I fear that the study by Xue et al does little to resolve this intriguing discrepancy .

Charlie CL Xue and David F Story IN REPLY : Ernst is concerned about the sham acupuncture procedure used in our trial.1 Although not universally agreed, the sham/ placebo control we adopted has beendescribed as best practice. 2,3 The assumption that, without de-qi, participants would not be blinded is not supported by the literature. In fact, a sham procedure without de-qi was used in a recent trial reported by Ernst and col- leagues on acupuncture for subacute strokerehabilitation. 4 I n t h a t s t u d y , a s i n o u r s , t o increase the credibility of blinding, partici- pants with previous experience of acupuncture were excluded, and those assessing the out-comes of treatment were blinded. With regard to previous randomised con- trolled trials of acupuncture for adults withpersistent allergic rhinitis in the English medi- cal literature, Ernst failed to distinguish between seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR). 5 Of the six studies included in his review,5 fi ve w e r e o n SAR, and the sixth, which was cited in our report (reference 14), was on children with PAR. These reports, therefore, are not incon- sistent with our findings.
