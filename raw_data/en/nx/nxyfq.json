He gave a talk on \"The Positive Power of Plants: Frederick Law Olmsted in Connecticut.\" Following Mr. Leff's talk, Dr. Andreadis presented the Century Farm Award to Norman Hill Farm of Thompson, Connecticut . Proclamation from Governor Dannel P. Malloy: Norman Hill Farm, located in Thompson, was founded in 1910 by Carl A. Norman, who emigrated from Sweden in 1900. Vegetables, eggs, and butter were produced and sold. He gradually increased the dairy herd and poultry flock, and built three greenhouses to increase vegetable production . One of Carl's sons, Oscar Norman, bought the farm from his mother in 1943 after the death of his father, continuing with the sa me farm enterprises . Poultry was dropped in 1958 and the last commercial vegetable crop was greenhouse tomatoes in 1980. Oscar and his wife Elizabeth were involved with many organizations including the Killingly Regional Vocational Agricultural Consulting Committee, The New England Vegetable Growers Association, The Connecticut Farm 19 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Bureau, 4H, and the Woodstock Green Thumbs Garden Club. They also hosted young people from Costa Rica, India, Taiwan and Zambia as a part of the International Farm Youth Exchang e Program. Roy and Earl Norman, Oscar's sons, and the third generation on the farm, bought the farm in 1976. They each built homes on the farm and now operate strictly as a dairy farm . Currently, Roy and Earl have a 100 cow freestall barn for the milking herd and a 120 cow freestall barn for dry cows and 3 different age groups of heifers. They also produce grass and corn for hay and silage feed . Roy and Earl are members of The Connecticut Farm Bureau, and Roy is very involved with the Fellowship of Christian Farmers Association . Earl serves on the Thompson Agricultural Commission and the New England Dairy Promotion Board. The farm received the Albert R. Todd Conservation Award for improvements in conservation and pollution control practices . Members of the fourth generation of Normans continue to work on the farm and a member of the fifth generation recently joined the Happy Herdsmen 4H Dairy Club, the same club that their grandfather Earl belonged to over 50 years ago. As Governor, I am pleased to j oin The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and the Connecticut Agricultural Information Council in presenting this Century Farm Award to Norman Hill Farm, who is most deserving of this honor. After the presentation of the Century Farm Award, Anne Rowlands, President of the Experiment Station Associates, gave a few remarks and invited all in the audience to join the Associates. Plant Science Day 201 6 was a very big success that was enjoyed by a record number of visitors - due to the hard work of the entire Station staff.

As usual you were wonderful presenters last spring semester! My students enjoy your seminar and pres entation so much that the students that have seen you in previous years come back to see you again . My students enjoyed identifying the invasive and native aquatic plants and continued to communicate with Jennifer via email with questions pertaining to the presentation and the plants that you brought . Jennifer responded to the student inquiries, which the students appreciated. The students love the hands -on learning . Several students were taking photographs of the invasive aquatic plants on display . The edu cational outreach that you provide is very important, and the Connecticut Agricultural Station research that you do in lakes and ponds is pertinent to our society . Invasive and/or nuisance aquatic plants, algae, and diatoms (micro -algae) are being observed more frequently in Connecticut and throughout the USA . We see it more now than ever before. We as a society have made this possible by using too much fertilizer on our lawns, buying non- indigenous plants, spreading these invasive species by boats, ballast , and boots of fisherm en while non-point source pollution is degrading our surface waters . It is imperative to stay informed now more than ever . I thank you and your colleagues for the research that you do. Thank you again Greg and Jennifer for traveling t o TRCC (with the many containers of water and aquatic plants) to educate our students . I will be writing a letter of support since I believe that your research in Connecticut and your educational outreach are very important . You continue to make a signific ant contribution with a positive impact in Connecticut. I hope that you will consider presenting again for the upcoming spring semester. \" On December 6, 2016, Michele L. Tremblay from the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel wrote the following about Greg ory Bugbee and Sandra Carney . \"Thank you for your gracious hosting of the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel fall meeting last week .

The Panelists and guests enjoyed the background and facility information that Greg Bugbee presented . I am grateful for all of the support that Sandra Carney provided to make this meeting possible . The Connecticut Agricultural E xperiment Station staff made everyone feel at home, which facilitated a very The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 30 productive two days together . On behalf of the entire Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel and its presenters and guests, please accept my sincere and heartfelt gratitude for making the November - December 2016 Panel meeting a great success.\" On December 30, 2016, Christine Witkowski, Associate Professor and Coordinator of the Environmental Science Program at Middlesex Community College, wrote the following about Scott Williams . \"The Environmental Science Program at Middlesex Community College would like to express its sincere appreciation for the time Dr. Scott Williams has contributed to our students ' success. We offer an \"Exploring Environmental Careers\" course to expose stude nts to their many education and career options, and we rely on weekly guest speakers to provide a window into the work of environmental professionals . The talks are each about an hour, with a PowerPoint presentation about each speaker's background, educati on and career highlights, and time for student questions . It is a valuable experience for students and we could not do this without pe ople like Scott . Scott has visited the class twice since Spring 2015 to share his work . His talk is particularly interesting because he describes specific projects he has worked on in detail, and shares stories that fascinate the students . Students leave inspired and newly educated about the work of the Connecticut Agricultural Station, important work that most students are n ot familiar with . Scott has also agreed to serve on the Environmental Science P rogram advisory board that will help guide the program into the future . Scott's expertise and experience will be valuable assets on our board . The Middlesex Community College Environmental Science program is very grateful for the time Scott contributes to our students, and grateful that CAES supports this type of education and outreach. We look forward to continuing to work with Scott and CAES in the future. On February 3, 2017, Nell Glass wrote the following about Greg ory Bugbee . \"I would like to tell you how grateful I am to Greg Bugbee and the Invasive Aquatic Plant Program at CAES . I sit on the board of a small association called Friends of West Side Pond, Inc . We have been working on plans to remediate our small l ake in the NW c orner of CT . The process is both expensive and complicated and time consuming . Some of our members have had concerns and questions about various remediation methods, the problem facing groups like our s is where and who to turn to. We have found Greg Bugbee of CAES an incredible resource and help to our questions and concerns . I realize that you have lost much of your State funding and I would like you to know that your programs and people are a treasured resource to small lakes and communities such as FOWSP . It would be a crime against the people, communities and environmental groups if we lose any of CAES programs or people . The work you all do and provide for our state is priceless and very much need ed. Greg has helped me on several occasions, he unlike the Limnologist we hired has been always accessible and there to answer questions we may have. Case in point, my daughter was writing a research paper on aquatic invasive plants. She came to a point in her paper where she could not get any up to date information on remediation and mapping methods, and I told her to contact Greg . Because she was at school in New Haven, and right around the corner from CAES she took a chance and went to see Greg . Mr. Bugbee could have told her he was busy and sent her away; instead , he stopped what he was doing and spoke with her for a good hour . This to people like myself is what \"Putting science to work for people\" is all about . I hope someday that the State will realize the importance of your facility and reinstate the funding you so deserve . I for one will do my best to get the word out! \" On February 24, 2017, Adam H. Putnam, Commissioner of Agriculture, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, wrote th e following to Jason White . \"Thank you for leading the AgScience Caf\u00e9 presentation and discussion on February 23, 2017 regarding Nanomaterials and the Food Supply: Assessing the Balance Between Applications and Implications . You took a critical and impactf ul subject for all citizens and made it easy to understand . The discussion allowed FDACS team members to better understand the applied use and implications of nanomaterials with respect to our food. A subject that seems more complicated for the average cit izen.

The number of favorable comments I got after the event, and already this morning, is pretty special . My guess is that there are already some orders placed for permethrin -treated clothing . According to our count, there were over 90 folks in attendance, a local record for an event of this sort .

Activities within each area are often complimentary . A breakdown of sample s based on submitting agency is shown below. Source of Sample Numbers of samples analyzed Department of Agriculture 181 Department of Consumer Protection 297 Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 113 FDA, Health Depts., Cities/Towns, Misc. Foundations 199 Proficiency Test Samples 10 University Research Collaborators 202 CAES Departments 685 Grand Total 1,687 I. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Analyses in the Department of Analytical Chemistry are conducted on a wide range of sample type s submitted by other state and federal agencies, municipalities, law enforcement , non- profit groups, businesses, university collaborators, and other departments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) . This list is not intended to be all -inclusive. 1. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The Department of Analytical Chemistry has two long -standing programs with the CT Department of Agriculture (DoAg) involving the chemical analysis of commercial feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds : Analyst : John Ranciato , Nubia Zuverza -Mena, Brian Eitzer Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in the late 1890s . Products for household pets and commercial agricultural operations are collected by inspectors from DoAg . Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn report the findings to the product dealer and/or manufacturer and conduct regulatory response a s required . Results : From July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, we received and completed analysis of 23 feed samples. These samples were analyzed for protein, fat, moisture, fiber, and select micronutrients . Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 10 (44%). Analytical findings are turned over to CT DoAg for regulatory response . Joint funding with the DoAg has been acquired from the FDA to facilitate inclusion in the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS); this 5 -year cooperative agreement will allow the Department to bring aflatoxin analysis in animal feeds by liquid chromatography high resol ution mass spectroscopy (LC -HRMS) under the scope of ISO accreditation. This reporting period, methods for aflatoxin extraction and analysis (by LC -HRMS) 83 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 in corn- based feed were validated and 13 samples were received from DoAg for analysis as part of the AFRPS. Five samples were officially logged out with no aflatoxins detected; analysis of the remaining 8 is ongoing. b. Fertilizers : Analysts : John Ranciato Goal : To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875. Products from residential and commercial agricultural operations are collected by DoAg inspectors. Analytical results are reported to DoAg, who in turn report the findings to the product dealer and product manuf acturer and take regulatory response as needed . Results : From July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, we received and completed analysis of 47 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the in vestigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 36 (77%) . Analytical findings are turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory action . c. Analysis of seaweed samples Analysts : Terri Arsenault, Craig Musante, Michael Cavadini, Brian Eitzer Goal : To assess potential contamination of seaweed prior to release for sale. Summary : A newer program with the CT DoAg Bureau of Aquaculture involves the chemical and microbial analysis of seaweed being grown commercially in CT for sale to restaurants. Chemical analysis happens in the Department of Analytical Chemistry; the microbial analysis happens at the Department of Public Health (DPH) Laboratory Environmental Microbiology Section. During the current reporting period, 8 samples were received for analysis of moisture content, pesticides by both liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS; GC -MS), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by GC with electron capture The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 84 detection (GC -ECD) , and select heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). Results are reported to DoAg Aquaculture staff for a decision on regulatory action . Analysis is still underway at this time b ut in past years, all samples analyzed were judged suitable for sale on the basis of chemical analysis results. 2. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted on food and consumer p roduct samples submitted by the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to public safety . The results of these analyses are reported quickly and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues , heavy metals, fungi/ mold, or fecal contamination that are deemed unacceptable by DCP . If products are imported into CT from other states or countries, the US Food and Drug Administration will lead the regulatory response. a. Pesticide residues in food : Analysts : Walter K rol, Brian Eitzer, Christina Robb, Michael Cavadini , Terri Arsenault Summary : As part of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) , we determine concentrations of pesticides and total arsenic in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in CT and assure compliance with established tolerances . MFRPS survey samples are collected by DCP Inspectors and results are published in periodic Station Bulletin s available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . From July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, a total of 121 samples of food were analyzed for pesticide residues. Of the 121 samples analyzed, 60 (49.6%) contained a total of 129 residues . Of these 60 samples, there were 3 samples each containing a total of 4 violative residues . There were 44 different pesticide active ingredients found at an average concentration of 0.210 \u00b5g/Kg, and the average number of pesticide residues per sample was 2.15. With US FDA funding and support, the Department has received new equipment and , after 5 years of preparation, has received ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation from the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) for this program. Impact : The Department's MFRPS s erves as the sole surveillance and monitoring effort in the state, assuring that the food supply within CT is safe and free from chemical and heavy metal contamination . b. Miscellaneous samples Analyst : John Ranciato , Brian Eitzer Summary : From July 1, 20 16 to June 30, 2017 , 126 consumer complaint samples were submitted by CT DCP for analysis, including foreign material identification, fecal content determination, 85 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 product adulteration or tampering . For some samples, we rely on the expertise in other CAES Departments, including Plant Pathology and Ecology, Entomology, and Forestry and Horticulture. 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content Analyst : Terri Arsenault Goal : To provide percent ethanol content for label registration and taxation purposes. Summary : We analyzed 13 products such as beers, wines, and liquors for ethanol content . Results were submitted to DCP in support of product label registration. b. Beverage a uthenticity Analyst : Terri Arsenault , Brian Eitzer Goal : To determine if products offered to customers at CT establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : Twenty -nine alcoholic products were e xamined for authenticity; 14 samples were found to not match the gas chromatographic or elemental profile of comparison authentic samples. These results are returned to the DCP Division of Liquor Control, who determine appropriate regulatory action. A conductivity meter that was suppl ied to Liquor Control inspectors for field determination of vodka authenticity continues to be successfully used . Elemental profile as determined by inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry (ICP -MS) or optical emission spectroscopy (ICP -OES) is no w also used during adulteration investigations. 4. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) Analysts : Michael Cavadini, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer Goals : To determine the extent of polychlorinate d biphenyl (PCB) contamination in submitted samples, with matrices including soil , water, oil, sediments, and surface wipes. Summary : From July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, 38 samples were analyzed from pre -existing sites or new locations in CT . Sample collection is performed by the DEEP PCB Enforcement Unit as part of mandatory long -term monitoring of these areas . The findings are reported to DEEP for assessment of continued r egulatory compliance. In addition, two proficiency tests were successfully completed as part of this program. b. Analysis of pesticides Analysts : Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 86 Goals : To ascertain pesticide concentration associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) . Additional samples are analyzed in support of DEEP surface and groundwater monitoring programs . Submitted sample matrices include soil, water, oil , sediments, tank mixes and surface wipes. By request, select samples can be analyzed for glyphosate using liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Summary : From July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, 29 samples were analyzed under this program. Impact : The analysis of samples collected from surveillance programs for soil, surface/groundwater and sediments, as well as those that are part of active misapplication investigations, enable DEEP to enforce current state and federal regulations on pesticides and to promote overall envi ronmental and public health. 5. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples for FDA Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Analysts : Craig Musante, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Christina P.- Riveros, Michael Cavadini , Jason C. White Summary : The Department of Analytical Chemistry continues its work with the FDA as part of the Food Emergency Response Network Chemistry Cooperative Agreement Program (FERN cCAP). This program enables research and analyses on contaminants in food such as pesticides, poisons, toxins, and heavy metals . Staff participated in an FDA surveillance assignment where milk bound for export to the European Union was tested for heavy metal content using a method validat ed by the Department. Staff scientists are participating in an active surveillance assignment of imported foods within CT; four separate analytical platforms are being used to screen food for poisons, toxins, pesticides and heavy metals. The Department par ticipated in several FDA and USDA FSIS profi ciency tests and challenge exercises. Dr. Christina Robb has begun investigating methods related to the detection of the plant toxins ricin and abrin, as well as their biomarkers ricinine and abrine. Lastly, Brian Eitzer and Ms. Terri Arsenault both served as instructors for FDA courses on LC -MS and GC -MS FERN methods, respectively; these training courses are open to FDA staff and other state laboratories. Impact : The Department's participation in FERN has resulted in the acquisition of highly sensitive analytical equipment and significant funding to support staff, including post -doctoral researchers . In addition to being used for FDA work, these resources are also applied to our state programs in a manner that directly benefits the public health of CT residents. b. Analysis of samples for municipalities , law enforcement and other groups Analysts : Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Walter Krol, Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2016 through June 30, 201 7, Department staff analyzed several dozen samples for municipalities or other groups . As in 87 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 previous years, this included the analysis of soils from schools and various other locations (community gardens, municipal property) for heavy metals . We also analyzed foods and other products for heavy metals at the request of the New Haven Health Department . In one incident this year, the laborat ory was contacted by the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force ( JTTF ) and the CT Department of Public Health regarding a potential poisoning case at Yale University. The incident involved a community coffee machine and 4 staff fell ill over a six -hour period. Var ious samples were submitted by the Yale Universit y Police Department , including coffee, water from several sources, mugs/cups and the coffee machine itself. The analytical request was for sodium azide, a poison similar to cyanide, and our laboratory receiv ed the call because no other laboratory in the state could provide the analysis. CAES staff utilized several FDA FERN validated methods; azide was detected in several of the liquid samples, with concentrations ranging from 10- 340 mg/L. Our results were subsequently confirmed by the FBI laboratory in Quantico, VA. Impact : The findings of a highly toxic poison in samples associated with a community coffee pot assisted federal and university law enforcement in their investigation and highlights the importance of FERN equipment and funding to the health of citizens in the state. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Elemental and Molecular Analysis - Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology Analyst : Craig Musante, Roberto De La Torre -Roche, Jason C. White Summary : In conjunction with Dr. Wade Elmer of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology, elemental and molecular analysis of several hundred samples of various crops grown in the presence or absence of nanoscale micronutrient amendment s was again conducted. Dr. Elmer and Dr. White are in the second year of a USDA AFRI NIFA grant focused on this topic; the $480,000 grant began March 1, 2016 and includes co- investigators at the International Fertilizer Development Center in Muscle Shoals , AL and the University of Texas, El Paso. Additional details on this project can be found in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology section of this document. 7. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES Analysts : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Christina Robb, , Nubia Zuverza -Mena Summary : Annual proficiency testing samples related to our FDA FERN work, FDA ISO Accreditation program (MFRP), Animal Feed Regulatory Program (AFRP), as well as performance evaluation samples for our polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) regulatory program , were completed during the reporting period. All of these testing regimes serve to ensure accurate and reliable laboratory results. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research pro jects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental investigations . Research is often stimulated by our service work and in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. FOOD SAFETY Project 1: Improvement of analytic al methods for determination of pesticide residues in food The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 88 Investigators : Brian Eitzer , Terri Arsenault, Walter Krol, Christina Robb, Michael Cavadini, Craig Musante, Joseph Hawthorne, Jason C. White Summary : We continue to participate in or lead several F DA coordinated research projects. Department staff were involved in the development of a triage- based protocol for handling samples with unknown contaminants for the FDA. Staff also served on the FDA FERN Method Coordination Committee, which reviewed a LC -MS multilaboratory method validation submitted by the FERN chemistry labs. Separate work on the use of high resolution LC - MS and LC -MS/MS platforms for the screening of pesticides, toxins (fungal, plant) and poisons continued. We are participating in a working group focused on validating software for a newly acquired GC -MS from the FDA. We also also achieved ISO Accreditation for one FDA program (MFRPS) (MFRPS) and are continuing efforts to bring a second (AFRPS) (AFRPS) under the scope of accreditation. These accreditation accreditation efforts will be required for future FDA FERN participation. Last, we have initiated projects investigating the the presence of abrin and related compounds in seeds from various plant species. The overall goal of these projects is to develop robust and accurate methods that the FDA could deploy deploy as part of large -scale surveillance programs. Impact : The development and validation of new, mor e sensitive equipment and analytical te chniques will enhance food safety surveillance activities in the state and serve to better protect the public against incidental or intentional adulteration. Project 2: Nanoparticle fate in agricultural systems Investigators : Craig Musante, Roberto La Torre -Roche, Chuanxin Ma , Nubia Zuverza -Mena, Jason C. White 89 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Summary : Nanomaterials (NM) , with at least one dimension less than 100 nm (one billionth of a meter), have unique physical and chemical properties not observed at the bulk scale. Nanotechnology , which takes advantage of these useful nanoscale properties , has become widely used in numerous sectors, including electronics, health -care, cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, an d food processing . Although use has been widespread and is increasing rapidly, the consensus among the scientific community is that understanding of the fate and effects of nanomaterials in the environment is currently inadequate to accurat ely assess risk. We are interested in nanomaterials in agricultu ral systems, whether by direct use in nano- enabled agrichemicals or through indirect exposure from the application of nanomaterial -contaminated biosolids as an amendment to aid plant growth. R esearch in our laboratory has been focusing on defin ing the impact (physiological and molecular toxicity, accumulation) of NMs on food crops, w ith a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plants . Recent work has focused on t he potential trophic transfer of these materials from soil to food crops (lettuce, zucchini, potato) to herbivores (crickets, darkling beetles) to secondary consumers (mantids, wolf spiders). Studies have shown that significant variability exists across species and soil type and that weathering of the nanomaterials in soil may result in size- specific transformation processes that impact availability and risk. Additional studies are focusing on how exposure to NM can impact the ac cumulation and toxicity of other contaminants, including pesticides such as chlordane and imidacloprid, and pharmaceuticals such as tetracycline and carbamazepine. In addition, studies were conducted to assess the impact of exposure to binary combinations of NM; here, results showed that toxicity to a binary combination of NM was often significantly different from The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 90 exposure to either material alone, with additive, synergistic and antagonistic effects being observed. Additional c ollaborators on this project include colleagues at the University of Massachusetts, Texas A & M University, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry , Southern Illinois University- Carbondale, University of Texas El Paso, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, The University of Parma in Italy , Hasselt University in Belgium, Peking University in China, T he Ocean Un iversity of China, Zhejiang University and Nanjing Agricul tural University . Impact : Our research has demonstrate d that the toxicity of nanomaterials to crop s can be significantly different from that of the corresponding bulk material . Current investigations have also shown the NM may also transfer from one trophic level to the next, presenting significant potential f or food chain contamination. In addition, co- exposure to a NM can significantly alter the fate and effects of other organic and elemental contaminants, including additional nanomaterials. Last, molecular investigations are now being used to develop more sensitive endpoints of exposure /effects and to provide more useful information in support of accurate and meaningful risk assessment for nanomaterials. 2. E NVIRONMENTAL MONITORING /REMEDIATION Project 1: Analysis of Pesticides in Connecticut Pollen - Baselin e Survey Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology) Summary : We continue to examine the exposure of honey bees to pesticides at our long -term monitoring sites . Long -term studies can be used to track changes that occur due to different pesticide use practices or the introduction of new pesticides . We are currently monitoring two locations using traps to collect pollen balls from the bees as they return to the hive . During any individual collection period, the honey bees can vis it a wide variety of crops bringing very different pollen back to the hive . Each of these different crops could have different amounts of pesticides. Each of the samples is then subjected to pesticide analysis using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry . As might be expected, when you examine these over the course of a growing season there is a wide variety of pollen in the collections and the pesticides present from those plants can also vary widely; they vary in which pesticides are found, when they are found, and how much of them are found. Impact : Honey bees are being exposed to pesticides. Long- term monitoring from the same hives and locations provides baseline data that can be used to assess temporal trends and changes in pesticide exposure. 91 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Project 2: Pollination security for fruit and vegetable crops in the Northeast Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology), Anne Averill (University of Massachusetts), Frank Drummond (University of Maine), Bryan Danforth (Cornell University). Summary : We have been participating in a multi -year study to examine pollinati on security in specialty crops. Four crops are being studied: apples in New York, cranberries in Massachusetts, blueberries in Maine , and cucurbits in Connecticut . Among the factors being examined for each crop is the levels of pesticides present in each system . During the past year , we have been completing the remaining analyses of pesticides related to this project , which is coming to its conclusion. One new part of this pro ject was conducted by our University of Maine collaborators . They wanted to examine the movement of pesticides into honey bee colonies following pesticide application. Bees were caged within a sprayed blueberry plot . Samples of adult bees, pupae, larvae, wax, nectar, and pollen were collected one, three, and six weeks after spraying. These samples were sent to the CAES and examined for pesticide uptake using our liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry procedures. These measurements allowed the dynamics of p esticide exposure to be examined. Impact : Knowledge of the pesticide exposure to pollinator communities and the resulting ability of those communities to pollinate crops can be used to guide farmers in the proper use of pesticides so as to insure not only crop pollination but also protection from pests and pathogens. Project 3: Quantifying exposure of honey bees and bumble bees to neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen of ornamental plants Investigators : Brian Eitzer, Kim Stoner (Department of Entomology), Richard Cowles (Valley Laboratory), Douglas Dingman (Department of Entomology) Summary : The potential harm to pollinators caused by neonicotinoid pesticides is a topic that has been the focus of much recent attention . This attention has led to public calls for \"bee safe\" plants. The nursery and bedding plant industry is concerned because they use some of these compounds to protect their plants and need to sell those plants to the public . In the past year , we analyzed pollen collected by honey bees at three nurseries in Connecticut . The pesticide load of each sample was converted to a hazard quotient by looking at the toxicity of the pesticides found in each sample . The individual samples that had the highest toxicity were then sorted by pollen color, a nd re -analyzed for pesticides. Next those colors of the high toxicity samples that had the highest toxicity were sent for palynological analysis to determine which particular plant species were the highest contributors to honey bee toxicity within the sample . We have been also examining the pollen and nectar of model plants to determine which pesticide use practices will lead to the lowest pollinator pesticide exposures. Impact : Knowledge of which plants are being visited by pollinators and the concentration of pesticides in those plants will allow the nursery and bedding plant industries to modify their pesticide use practices in ways that will mitigate the impact on pollinators. PUBLIC OUTREACH The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 92 Telephone/ Internet Inquiries : We receive approxi mately 200 calls and emails from the public each year requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and the environment, as well as heavy metals in food, soils, and consumer products . In some instances, we refer the caller to a more appropria te CAES department or state agency. Station Bulletins and Fact Sheets : Station Bulletins are periodically published by our Department . These bulletins are available in printed form and on the CAES website ( www.ct.gov /CAES ). Fact sheets are articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest . These are also available on our website and in printed form. 93 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and plant regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Insect Information Office (IIO) . Staff in this office answer insect -related questions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, wood- boring insects, invasive insects, and honey bees and other bee pollinators. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part, to ensure our nursery industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Conn ecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting 48,000 full - and part -time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plant pests is performed in partnership w ith the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. In addition, we participate in a Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program supported by the USDA. For plant di seases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation (and any defoliation by other insects) and a gypsy moth egg mass survey . The results of our plant and forest surveys for 2016- 2017 may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summaries of our regulatory activities. The Office of the State Entomologis t and the Apiary Inspector also oversee registration of beekeepers and inspection of honey bee colonies for pests and disease. The staff of the Department of Entomology also take a lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events and at health and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celebrating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, the Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Norwalk- Wilton Tree Festival, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. The insect information office is located in the renovated Jenkins- Waggoner Laboratory and has a laboratory, office, public reception, and a climate- controlled collections room. The Insect Inform ation Office . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 94 SERVICE ACTIVITIES Insect Inquiry Office: Dr. Gale E . Ridge works out of the New Haven insect information office. Insect identification services date back to nearly the inception of the institution (1875) starting with the first Annual Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The Station announced that it was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insects...and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citizens of Connecticut.\" Since 2000, there has been a trend away from traditional communication such as mail and visitors to mostly cell phone calls and the internet . Phone calls remain the primary citizen contact followed by emails inquiries. The office serves private citizens, pest management professionals, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, charities, manufacturing, the hospitality industry, schools, colleges, and universities, housing authorities, museums, municipalities, libraries, law enforcement, state government, and the media. Between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017, the insect information office handled at least 15,870 recorded inquiries. There were 571 categories of inquiries including insects, arachnids, animal, pesticide use, insect damage, general entomology, and horticultur al issues. Categories were condensed this year . Delusory Parasitosis (DP) cases continued to rise from 189 in 2016 to 243 this fiscal year. These are time - consuming psychological cases that encompass multiple phone calls, emails, and visits which often inv olved medical professionals . In March 2017, Dr. Ridge' s work with DP sufferers was reported in STAT , an online magazine affiliated with the Boston Globe . This brought national attention to the condition. The article was written by Eric Boodman and titled, \"Accidental therapists: For insect detectives the trickiest cases involve the bugs that aren't really there.\" Following a mild winter due to possible \"climate change ,\" tick populations, especially American dog ticks Dermacentor variabilis were very high. B lacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis populations were also high with in excess of 200 public submissions to the Station for Lyme disease testing per day at the busiest time. Many of these submissions passed though the insect information office with mistaken t ick identifications from the public returned to the office for a correction of identification. In addition, non- native but North American established insects enjoyed an elevation in populations. For example, the spotted Mediterranean cockroach Ectobius pal lidus first introduc ed to Cape Cod in the early 1940s, Table 1. Number of bed bu g inquiries from FY 1996 to 2016 Table 2. Number of inquiries from FY 2004/2005 to FY* 2016/2017. 1 6 11 12 8 19 29 29 20 41 43 117 542 934 1088 1411 1939 2164 2701 2782 3178 0500100015002000250030003500 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 020004000600080001000012000140001600018000Table 1. Number of bed bug inquiries from FY 1996 to 2016 . 95 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 became well established along the Connecticut shoreline as far south as Milford and inland up the Quinnipiac R iver valley as it expanded its range (12 positive identifications). The Gypsy moth ( Lymantr ia dispar dispar ) outbreak far exceeded all other inquiries during the spring of 2017 with 6,764 calls. Many callers took the opportunity to ask additional arthropod questions inflating numbers further . The second highest inquiry was bed bugs (3,178), tick s (392), DP (243), then animals (especially rodents) and pollinators. Not including the Gypsy moth calls, inquiries were the highest on record with 9 ,106. Of these , 58% were natural resources, 39% man and medical issues, 1% undetermined, and 2% food- relate d. Bed and bat bug inquiries remain a leading inquiry , rising to 3,178 (35%) up from last year. Dr. Ridge ran a number of trainings on bed bugs including Mattress Recycling Council trainings as part of a requirement written into the Connecticut mattress recyclin g law, Act 13 -42. Dr. Ridge, in collaboration with Haralabos Tsolakis and Salvatore Ragusa of the Universita di Palermo, Italy, made a revision in the taxonomy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus fallacis first identified by Garman in 1948 to a new spe cies Neoseiulus garmani. Findings were published in the International Journal of Acarology . Dr. Ridge also identified a genus of minute brown scavenger beetle (Latridiinae: Deinerella spp.), which was confirmed by the Systematics Entomology Laboratory (SEL ) at the Smithsonian from a shipment of wooden candy sticks shipped from China. Dr. Ridge intercepted a species of treehopper (Membracidae) from cacti bought from Walmart and SEL and identified the species as Ophiderma tricinata Ball, native to Arizona and classified by them as a \"new pest.\" The Systematics Entomology Laboratory (SEL) confirmed Dr. Ridge's identification of Khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium , found in Stamford. CAPS and Forest Pest Programs: The Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey and Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Project (FPSOP), supported by the USDA - APHIS -PPQ and overseen by State Survey Coordinator Katherine Dugas and D eputy State Entomologist Dr. Victoria L. Smith, are two programs that provide for pest survey and educational outreach on the identification and risks posed by a number of potential invasive insects and plant diseases. With worldwide trade and travel incre asing, we are at an increased risk of foreign plant species, plant diseases, and insect pests being introduced in the U.S. In Connecticut, the CAPS program has largely conducted surveys in nurseries, Christmas tree farms, state parks, and conservation and public lands. In 2017, CAPS is surveying for a number of oak and maple insect pests in nurseries and forest landowner properties, as well as for non- native Cerambycids in Christmas tree farms. Additional grape and Phytoph thora ramorum surveys are supported by the Farm Bill. The FPSOP program 's main objective is outreach and education about handling the loss of ash from the emerald ash borer and also works with the national Don't Move Firewood Campaign and Connecticut Master Gardeners. The FP SOP also include s a biosurveillance program for exotic beetles related to the emerald ash borer using the native Cerceris wasp. Bird & Butterfly Garden: The Bird & Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club o f Hamden, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Most maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff. The garden is o pen to the public Monday- Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and closed on weekends and state holidays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Summer a ssistants Zachary Brown and Joanne Klein sort and identify survey samples.

A new law concerning pollinator health was enacted by the state of Connecticut in the 2016 legislative session (Public Act 16- 17). Among other things, the Act created a Pollinator Advisory Committee consisting mainly of staff of the Experiment Station, required a study of the Varroa mite attacking honey bees by the State Entomologist, an evaluation of the possibilities of breeding bees that are resistant to the mites, and required the Experiment Station to create a citizen's guide to model pollinator habitat . Suggestions for updating the Connecticut statutes pertaining to the registrati on and inspection of honey bees (Sec. 22- 89; 22- 90) in the Varroa mite report were adopted in Public Act 17- 21. The following were appointed to the pollinator advisory committee: Dr. Richard Cowles (CAES); State Entomologist (CAES); and Dr. Kimberly Stoner (CAES). On May 3, 2016, An Act Concerning the Rights and Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Regarding the Treatment of Bed Bugs (Public Act 16 -51) passed the Connecticut house and Senate to become law and the law was officially signed by Governor Malloy on October 11, 2016 (Figure 1). Written by attorney Judith R. Dicine (CCABB legal counsel) assisted by Dr. Ridge and the board, and lead by Repr esentative Larry Butler (Waterbury), it took five years to get the law enacted . 97 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Integrated Tick Management (ITM) Lyme disease (LD) continues to be the most commonly reported vector -borne disease in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it affects over 300,000 people each year. The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis , is the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent for Lyme disease, and at least five other human pathogens. A new inter departmental integrated tick management project was initiated in 2016- 2017 in a cooperative agreement with Dr. Andrew Li at the USDA- Agricultural Research Service. Dr. Kirby C. Stafford (Department of Entomology) , Dr. Scott C. Williams ( Department of Fores try and Horticulture), and Dr. Goudarz Molaei ( Department of Environmental Sciences), initiated baseline tick and mouse sampling in several neighborhoods in Guilford, CT where five -year study will be conducted. The USDA -ARS is funding the study. The neighborhoods in this ITM study will consist of different combinations of an untreated controls and homes treated with combinations of spray applications of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Met52 EC), box t TCS ) and the 4- poster passive acaricide application station for the treatment of white -tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). The 4- posters will be put in place in Fall 2017 and other treatments will begin in summer 2018. Technicians Heidi Stuber , Megan Linske, and Michael Short assisted with Ixodes scapularis) and white -footed mouse with seasonal resource Hemstock Brianna Byrne in 2017. Mallery Breban assisted Dr. Molaei with the tick testing. Host -seeking ticks were sampled by dragging the perimeter of each property biweekly May -August and white -footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus ) were live -trapped monthly using Sherman box traps. Each captured mouse was sedated, marked with a unique ear tag, processed for ticks, and a blood sample was taken for serological analysis. Tick Overwintering Study With support from the Northeast IPM Center, the second year of a study looking at the survival of I. scapularis nymphs and adults of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum , under different environmental conditions was conducted by Dr. Kirby Stafford and Dr. Scott Williams at CAES and Charles Lubelczyk at the Maine Medical R esearch Center Institute (MMRCI) over the winter of 2016 - 2017. Snow and leaf litter can moderate temperatures and provide moisture. This study examined survival with no cover, leaf litter cover, snow cover, or both leaf litter and snow cover. Nymphal black legged ticks and adult lone star ticks were placed in special \"tick pots\" buried in the ground (white top in left picture in leaf litter below) with temperature and humidity data loggers. The study was conducted at Lockwood Farm in Hamden, Connecticut and in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Similar to the previous year, the lowest survival (38%) in Connecticut was observed for the blacklegged ticks where both leaf litter and snow were removed. Survival of lone star ticks ranged from 38 -69%, indicating this tick can overwinter in Connecticut. There has been a slow increase in submissions of lone star ticks to the CAES Tick Testing Laboratory, although the numbers still represent a small proportion of the total tick submissions (2- 3%). 4-poster station and f ipronil -based rodent bait box The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 98 Nymphal I. scapularis (photo Scott Bauer, USDA) and adult female A. americanum (CDC). Pesticides in Honey Bee Pollen from Ornamental Plant Nurseries Consumers purchasing plants for their gardens have expressed concern in recent years that systemic pesticides, such as neonicot inoids, used in production of ornamental nursery plants could affect pollinators visiting those plants after they have been planted in the landscape. In this project, we put honey bee hives onsite at three ornamental plant nurseries and collected pollen br ought back to the hive by the bees. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the extent to which pesticides used in ornamental plant production would move into pollen used by honey bees and present a hazard to bee health, and 2) to identify specif ic plant species from which the most toxic pollen came. Pollen trapped from the honey bees was collected weekly from two hives at each site, frozen in the lab, and analyzed for pesticides using high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. We found that most samples from the three nurseries were low in acutely toxic pesticides, but there were a series of samples from one of the nurseries in August that had high levels of acutely toxic pesticides. Identification of the plants that were the sources of pesticide contamination is being carried out by palynology (microscopic examination of the pollen grains) and using molecular methods. This project was funded by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Dr. Kimberly Stoner, Dr. Brian Eitzer, Dr. Richard Cowles are the investigators, assisted by Mark Creighton, Dr. Alejandro Chiriboga (of the University of Connecticut), Andrea Nurse (of the University of Maine), Dr. Douglas Sponsler (of Penn State University), Morgan Lowry, an d Tracy Zarrillo. 99 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Biosurveillance for Exotic Buprestidae and the Wasp Watcher Program The wasp watcher program was begun in the spring of 2010. Cerceris fumipennis is a native digging wasp that provisions its nest with adult Buprestidae, including emerald as h borer. It is used a tool for detecting and monitoring emerald ash borer and other invasive buprestid species by intercepting its prey as female wasps return to their nest. The wasp was responsible for the first detection of EAB in Connecticut, and remains our main tool for detecting and monitoring EAB in the state. We are in the 8th year of our Wasp Watcher program. Over the course of the program we have trained 125 watchers. In 2017, 22 watchers from previous years are signed -on, as well as 24 new watchers. Since 2010, Watchers have collected over 8,000 beetles and detected EAB in 37 new towns. We have also used this system to examine the native buprestid fauna of Connecticut, and have detected over 70 species of beetles with this tool. Of these, 21 are new state records. One of these, Agrilus smaragdifrons , detected in 2015 in Berlin, CT, is a newly detected non- native species from Asia. While little is known ab out its biology, it appears to feed on Tree of Heaven. Classical Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer Following the detection of EAB in Connecticut, the determination was made to join the USDA APHIS/ PPQ biological control program for EAB. In May 2013, Dr. Claire Rutledge began releases of the gregarious endoparasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi and the Middlebury and Prospect, CT. The parasitoids are shipped from the USDA APHIS emerald ash borer mass- rearing facility in Brighton Michigan. Releases have been made in 11 towns in Connecticut altogether, the others being Hamden, Sherman, Cromwell, Litchfield, Plymouth, Simsbury, East Haddam, Weston and East Windsor. Each release site receives parasitoids for 2 years. After releases, t he next step is to determine if the parasitoids have established in the environment. Our first 2 release sites, Middlebury and Prospect did not receive any releases in 2015. In fall 2015, we peeled trees at those sites, and sites nearby looking for EAB lar vae parasitized by T. planipennisi . We found them both at the initial release site, and at sites up to 2.5 m from the original site, strongly suggesting that the parasitoid has established in Connecticut, and is spreading. We also found T. planipennisi in Sleeping Giant State Park in fall 2016 after releases in 2014 and 2015. We are still attempting to recover the much smaller, and elusive O. agrili . In summer 2017, we set up yellow pan traps to look for O. agrili and T. planipennisi in both Hamden and Litc hfield. New Wasp Watchers . Larvae of the remains of an EAB larvae. CT. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 100 Boosting Resistance to Emerald Ash Borer in Ash and White Fringetree using Methyl Jasmonate Emerald ash borer is known to attack and kill all species of North American Ash (genus Fraxinus ). In 2014, it was discovered that EAB can also attack and kill another native tree, White Fringetree (Chionathus virginicus ), which is in the same family as ash. While white fringetree is more resistant to EAB than white ash, both trees are less resistant to the beetle than their Asian con -geners. Recently published work suggested that green ash dosed with methyl jasmonate, a plant stress hormone, becomes more resistant to emerald ash borer. In the summer of 2017, in collaboration with Dr. Adrian a Arango -Velez, experiments were conducted to compare the ability of methyl jasmonate to increase resistance of white fringetree and white ash to emerald ash borer. Larval establishment, survival and growth rate, were all measured. In addition, several mea sures of tree response, such as callous formation, production of defensive chemicals, and microstructure of cell walls will be measured. If this technique is shown to have a strong impact on the ability of trees to defend themselves against emerald ash bor er larvae, it may provide an alternative to more traditional pesticides. Southern Pine Beetle in Connecticut, E xpansion of Geographical and Host R ange Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been a major pest of the timber industry in the sout h for years. It has been moving northwards from Honduras over the last 400 years. It was discovered in Long Island in October, 2014. It was discovered in Connecticut in March 2015 on Red Pine in Wharton Brook State Park. Since this initial discovery, we have detected SPB across the state in all counties except Tolland and Windham and in six species of tree, Red Pine, Scotts Pine, Pitch Pine, Norway Spruce White Spruce and White Pine. Traps set along a north- south gradient in 2015 found live beetle in only t he southernmost sites, suggesting that SPB did not survive winter in northern Connecticut. However , in summer 2016, traps at the same sites found SPB in both the southern sites and two more northern sites. In 2017, numbers of individuals trapped are still very low, and only one new tree infestation has been found but the suggestion that SPB is overwintering is of concern. Work is ongoing to understand the potential impact of this beetle in Connecticut. This project is being done in collaboration with Dr. Ad riana Arango -Velez . Modifying Emerald Ash Borer Trapping Tools for use with Bronze Birch Borer Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis , is an Asian cousin of our native bronze birch borer Agrilus anxius Bronze birch borer (BBB) is generally a secondary pest of North American birch species, but it can become an outbreak pest during times that birches are under stress from drought. It is also a well - known primary pest of non -North American birch species, such as European White Birch, that are widely used in landscaping. As of yet, BBB is not known to be found in Europe. However, the European Plant Protection Organization is concerned that if BBB were to become established in Europe it would pose a serious threat to birch in Europe. In summer 2017, in collabo ration with PRESPYS (Pest Risk Evaluation Inner bark of a southern pine beetle infested red pine from Wharton Brook State Park. You can see adult galleries, larval galleries (round) and the blue stain fungi , which the beetle carries and helps to kill the tree. Flower of white fringetree, a newly discovered host of EAB. 101 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 and Pest Management Systems https://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/ prepsys ), my laboratory started a pilot project examining the use of two trap -types widely used in trapping EAB for trapping BBB. Purple prism traps, and green Lindgren funnel traps were hung in girdled and un -girdled ash and birch trees at 7 sites around Connecticut for a total of 104 traps. Based this summer's results, we will continue to work on t his project in summer 2018. Range Expansions of Exotic and Native Insects The Ja panese cedar longhorned beetle (Callidiellum rufipenne ) was first detected in Connecticut in 1998 after its larvae had bored into living arborvitae in garden centers . Based on an extensive survey conducted between 1999 and 2001, this new threat to woody plants in the cedar family was found to be confined largely to the southern four counties . During this initial survey, beetles were detected by capturing adults on sticky bands around 2- foot sections of cedar trunks or by rearing adults from infested wood. After adults of this invasive beetle were reared from the dead wood of eastern red cedar ( Juniperus virginiana ) in Tollan d County in 2014, Dr. Maier, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, decided to conduct a second distributional study to determine how far north the beetle had spread . This second survey, conducted in 2016 and 2017, relied on a less labor -intensive sampling method. Cross -vane panel traps baited with various ketones, including an attractant for adults of this longhorned beetle, were deployed in stands of eastern red cedar, the favorite larval host in the wild . During the 2- year survey, Dr. Maier and his team found that the Japanese cedar longhorned beetle had spread throughout the state . It was discovered in 155 of the 169 towns in Connecticut . Potted or unhealthy plants in the cedar family probably are now at risk of attack in garden centers and nurseri es throughout the state. Another alien insect that is expanding its distributional range in Connecticut and elsewhere is the viburnum leaf beetle ( Pyrrhalta vibur ni), a pest of wild and cultivated viburnum species . Both larvae and adults of this species eat the foliage of viburnum, sometimes killing plants . In Connecticut, this Eurasian beetle was first found on potted viburnum imported from New York in 2004. Dr. Maier conducted the first statewide survey for this invasive beetle in 2009 and 2010 by beating branches of viburnum to dislodge adults from foliage . This initial survey showed that this invasive beetle was concentrated in the northern one- half of the state. In 2016, he initiated a 2- year study to reevaluate distributional range of the viburnum leaf beetle. Thus far, he has determined that this viburnum pest has spread to every county in the state . In several locations, the beetle has killed wild viburnum species. While Dr. Maier and his assistants were investigating invasive species in Connecticut over the last 2 decades, they encountered an unfamiliar cricket . The species was determined to be the jumping bush cricket ( Orocharis saltator), which previously was not known north of Bronze birch borer on an Asian species of birch . Distribution of the Japanese cedar longhorned beetle in 2001 and 2017. Towns with beetles are shown in yellow. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 102 the middle of New Jersey . Based on sampling with a variety of methods, they ascertained that this cricket now occurs in at least 5 counties in Connecticu t, and it is particularly common in the southern half of the state. Thus, both native and introduced species are on the move in Connecticut. Hosts of the Lily Leaf Beetle The lily leaf beetle ( Lilioceris lilii ) feeds upon Asiatic , Oriental , and native li lies that grow in Connecticut . Both the larvae and the red adults of this European beetle consume the foliage and the flowers of lilies, often killing cultivated plants wherever beetle populations are high. Although this invasive beetle prefers Asiat ic lilies, it has damaged wild lilies, such as the Canada lily ( Lilium canadense superbum ). Dr. Maier and his assistants previously documented that the lily leaf beetle can have a severe negative effect upon the growth of Canada lilies . In 2016, Dr. Maier began to investigate how this invasive beetle might also injure other wild liliaceous plants . In 2016, he found both adults and eggs on uncaged twisted stalk ( Streptopus lanceolatus ), a relatively uncommon native species . In 2017, Dr. Maier put mated pairs of adult beetles in cages over 4 species of native liliaceous plants to determine how the beetle would impact them . He found that adults would eat all of the species, but especially Indian cucumber ( Medeola virginiana number of eggs were laid on twisted stalk, but no larvae developed on them . Biweekly checks of 10 species of uncaged wild plants showed that no plants had adults, eggs, or la rvae in 2017. Thus, based on these initial results, it appears that, with the exception of wild lilies ( Lilium spp.), native liliaceous species of Connecticut may not be suitable hosts for this foreign beetle. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut Most larvae of longhorned beetles, or Cerambycidae, bore into the wood of dead or dying trees and shrubs or occasionally into herbaceous plant s. Pestiferous species feed upon the wood of living trees, firewood, or cultivated herbaceous plants. Dr. Maier, assisted by Morgan Lowry and Tracy Zarrillo, has been investigating the biology of these borers especially to improve our understanding of species diversity, distribution, and hosts in Connecticut . To acquire new data, they capture adult beetles in traps baited with various sex pheromones or host volatiles, rear adults from wood infested by the larvae, collect adults on flowers, attract adults to light- traps, capture adults in flight interception and fermenting bait traps, and examine label data on specimens in museums. Thus far, Dr. Maier and his team have recorded 198 species of longhorned beetles in Connecticut . They have collected 171 species (86.4% of total) by sampling with diverse methods . The remaining 27 species (13.6% of total) are known only from museum species and may no longer exist in the state . At least 30 species (15.2% of total) were recorded from the state for the first time. Of the 198 species recorded from Connecticut, 5 (2.5% of total) are non- native species. Ninety -nine species of longhorns were reared from the wood of dead or stressed woody plants in the northeastern United States . The rearings have revealed the presence of species not previously known from Connecticut and have provided more than 100 new host records . Among the reared species, the red -Round -headed apple tree borer (Saperda candida ), a longhorned beetle that attacks living apple trees in the Northeast. 103 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 headed ash borer ( Neoclytus acuminatus ) had the broadest host range, developing in 36 woody species, which included both gymnosperms and angiosperms . Over the past 10 years, Dr. Maier and his assistants regularly have added new biological information to a database that now has over 17,000 entries, representing more than 22,000 specimens of longhorned beetles encountered during their studies or housed in museums. Biological information compiled in this database includes floral hosts, larval hosts, distribution, activity periods, and methods of sampling . These data should assist in developing management plans for destructive speci es of longhorned beetles and possibly for species of conservation concern. The ultimate goal of their project is to provide an annotated checklist of the longhorned beetles of Connecticut. NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulatory services are coordinated and conducted through the Office of the State Entomologist, whose members are State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford, Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Victoria Smith, Plant Inspectors Fengler and Tia Blevins, Apiary Inspector Mark Creighton , and State Survey . Nursery Inspection and Certification . Two-hundred seventy- one nurseries were certified to conduct intra- and interstate business . There were 500 nursery inspections during the growing season. Nursery Insects and Diseases. The most important diseases and pests found in nurseries (in order of prevalence) were aphids on various trees and shrubs, thrips, lily leaf beetle, imported willow leaf beetle, red headed flea beetle, boxwood leaf miner, and powdery mildews. Japanese Beetle Certification to Canada. Eight Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 30,556 plants to Canada in 2016. Nursery Dealer Permits. Nursery dealer permits were issued to 156 firms . One hundred twenty -three of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each . In total, there were 479 outlets. Phytosanitary Cert ificates . Three hundred eight phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to 30 destinations outside the United States. One hundred twenty- five consignments were bound for the Dominican Republic (tobacco), fifty -three to Canada (ornamental plants), and eighteen to Honduras (tobacco). Product Quantity Apples (cartons) 4,000 Apricot /walnut shells, mixed (ground, drums) 4 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas) (# bags) 32 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas) (kilos) 8 Chinese Tree Peony (plants) 26 Greenhouse plants Rhizomes 116 Plants 58 Nursery stock Bare root stock 2 Plants (B and B) 29,644 Orchids (plants) 6,392 Pecan shells (ground, pounds) 10 Perennials The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 104 Bare root plants 1,287 Potted plants 350 Seeds (bags) 145 Seeds (kilos) 133 Tobacco Bales 68,802 Bundles 56,002 Cartons 9,922 Pounds 3,850 Vegetable ivory (ground, drums) 4 Walnut shells (bags) 88 Walnut shells (drums) 425 Destinations for out of country exports from CT are as follows . Sixty -seven inspections were made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate, either to destinations in other states, to the CITES port, or to US Territories and Puerto Rico (12 listed destinations). Twenty -eight consignments were bound for Puerto Rico, thirteen to Washington, and ten to California. Product Quantity 105 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Nursery stock (containers) 150 (bare root plants) 1,000 Greenhouse plants 1,059 Seed (# Bags) 53 Orchids 22 Destinations for out of state export from CT, including US Territories and Puerto Rico. Special Inspections. Eleven inspections were made for 186 individual plants to assist homeowners moving out of state. Permits to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil . In 2016, there were seventy -four PPQ 526 Permits (Permit to move live plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil) approved in CT. There was one Controlled Import Permits issued. There was o ne permit for Post Entry Quarantine approved. Boxwood Blight compliance agreements for shipment to Pennsylvania. Four nurseries met requirements for shipment of boxwood nursery stock to Pennsylvania. Chrysanthemum White Rust . In 2016, we inspected 10,000 plants for CWR, caused by Puccinia horiana. No positives were detected. Gypsy Moth . Due to drought conditions in spring and early summer of 2016, the fungus that usually keeps gypsy moth larvae in check did not \"kick in ,\" and there was considerable damage d ue to larval feeding. We observed defoliation due to gypsy moth on 204,167 acres, mostly in Middlesex, New Haven, and New London counties. In November and December 2016, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7- mile grid (102 sites) throughout Connecticut . Egg mass counts were very high in many locations, indicating a high potential for another outbreak in 2017. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 106 Asian Longhorned Beetle . We conducted 55 inspections of 4,453 trees in all counties of CT for presence or signs of ALB infestation. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid and Elongate Hemlock Scale . These pests have been present in CT for many years, and continue to cause patchy damage and decline among the remaining population of hemlocks. Statewide in 2016, 1,677 acres were affected by HWA, and 3,456 were affected by EHS. Scale insects, such as elongate hemlock scale and circular scale, are increasing in some areas, and may be more of a factor in tree damage and mortality than HWA . Emerald Ash Borer. Emerald ash borer has be en detected in all eight counties; the quarantine for this insect was extended statewide to encompass all of Connecticut. Detections and outreach efforts included monitoring of Cerceris colonies, trapping was suspended when the state became fully quarantined. During aerial survey, we mapped 6,194 acres defoliated by EAB, and expect acreage and mortality to increase in the coming years. Winter Moth . Damage due to feeding by winter moth larvae has been concentrated in coastal New London County, and continues to increase. Parasitoids of winter moth have been released in this area, but their effectiveness in reducing populations has not been significant as yet; a lag time of up to 5 years is expected. Southern Pine Beetle . This insect was recently detected in CT, and damage estimates are still in the preliminary stage. The infestation appears to be widespread, however. Forest Tent Caterpillar. Damage d ue to forest tent caterpillar was detected on 3,026 acres, in New London County, near the Rhode Island state line. White Pine Needle Decline. We recorded only 802 acres affected by white pine needle decline. Locust Leaf Miner. We recorded 243 acres affected by locust leaf miner, detected by ground survey. Cynipid Gall Wasp. Cynipid gall wasp was detected on the Bluff Point Coastal Reserve in New London County and adjoining areas in the town of Stonington in late 2014. The infestation has not been delimit ed. Apiary Inspection . During the 2016 season Connecticut had 1,655 registered beekeepers maintaining 8,023 hives. In 2016, one thousand three hundred hives were inspected. Unofficial estimates indicate that there could be another 400 beekeepers/800 colonies that have yet to register. Unofficial estimates indicate that over 4000 packages of Honey bees were imported into Connecticut for sales to new beekeepers and to replace losses. American foulbrood was detected in three hives; these were destroyed by bur ning. Colony inspection determined Varroa mite infestation and the viral complex associated with Varroa infestation as the primary reason for colony mortality. CT beekeepers continue to lose colonies overwinter in higher numbers; the Bee Informed Winter Lo ss report for CT in 2016 was 44.4%; the winter loss was 39.5%. (An increase of 18%) These losses are slightly higher than regional and nationwide trends. The viral pathogens that cause deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and even the rare chronic bee paralysis virus (CPBV) were detected in Connecticut as part of the USDA Honey Bee Pests and Diseases Survey. Due to high winter losses in 2016, local beekeepers struggled to replace losses with pack age bees from southern states. Despite these challenges, beekeeping interest is still strong with over 800 new beekeepers being trained this winter. There were one hundred sixty Apiary Certificates of Health issued. Six certificates were issued for export out of CT, and one hundred fifty- four certificates for interstate movement of honey bees. CT participated in the USDA APHIS National Honey Bee survey to document presence/absence of diseases and pests of honey bees. Samples taken from 192 colonies were su bmitted to the laboratory at the University of Maryland; results are pending. 107 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 During the summer 2015, we established 40 permanent forest plots on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties . In this short -term (5 year) survey, we wi ll examine the death/replacement of trees due to emerald ash borer. Within each plot, 20 trees were tagged and will be evaluated for signs of EAB infestation, including branch and tip die back, woodpecker activity, and bark loss. We will measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as a way to monitor their health . Plots were established in all counties of CT. In general, our forests remain healthy.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 108 Non-radical reactive sites on biochar are the most reactive toward p-nitrophenol. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Environmental Chemistry (Dr. Joseph Pignatello) A. Interactions of Contaminants with Environmental Particles 1. Degradation of p- Nitrophenol by Lignin and Cellulose Chars: H 2O2-Mediated Reaction and Direct Reaction with the Char (Dr. Joseph Pignatello Jing Yang). Chars and other black carbons are reactive towards certain compounds. Such reactivity has been attributed to reduction of O 2 to H 2O2 by persistent free radicals in the solid . The H 2O2 then back -reacts with the solid to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS ), most importantly hydroxyl radicals HO. We studied the decomposition of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by pure lignin and cellulose chars that were either aged in moist air or a vacu um for up to a month at room temperature. In air, the chars chemisorbed oxygen, a portion of which was liberated as H 2O2 when the char was submerged in water. The evolved H 2O2 was simultaneously decomposed by the char. PNP reacted predominantly in the sorbed state and only reduction products (phenol, catechol) were identified. Aging in air sharply (within hours) reduced H 2O2- producing capacity and free radical concentration, but more gradually reduced PNP decay rate over the month -long period. PNP decay was only modestly suppressed (12- 30%) by H 2O2 removal ( with catalase), and had little effect on the free radical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal (< 6 radicals annihilated per 1000 PNP reacted). Contrasting with previous studies, the results show that direct reaction of PNP with char predominates over H 2O2-dependent reactions, and the vast majority of direct -reacting sites are non-radical in character. Non -radical sites are also responsible in part for H 2O2 decomposition, and there was some overlap in the reactive domains of H 2O2 and PNP, since H2O2 PNP reactive Fe impurity in lignin played no role. Lignin char was generally more reactive than cellulose char , indicating the aromatic/nonaromatic character of the precursor biomass may be important . The results are relevant to the fate of pollutants in black carbon -rich environments and the use of carbons in remediation. 2. Surface Interactions between Gold Nanoparticles and Biochar (Minori Uchimiya, Joseph J. Pignatello, Jason C. Szu -Lung Hu, Paulo J. Ferreira ) Engineered nanomaterials are applied directly to the agricultural soils as a part of pesticide or fertilize formulations. Examples of commercially available fertilizers and pesticides claiming to contain engineered nanomaterials include Primo Maxx (plant growth regulator by Syngenta), Nano- (Agro Nanotechnology), nano- Ag answer (PKN fertilizer), and nano- 5 organic fertilizer (Uno Fortune) . Additional routes of entry to agricultural soils include the land- application of sludge and manure containing incidental quantities of engineered nanomaterials. Despite the increasing agricultural use of nanomaterials, few prior reports are available on nanoparticle interactions with particles of soil s or soil amendments such as biochars . The current global market value of gold nanoparticles (nAu) is estimated to be $1.34 billion, and is projected to increase to $8 billion by 2022. To date , no prior published reports exist on surface interactions between nAu and black carbon (biochar) . 109 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Phase contrast TEM images of a gold nanoparticle (nAu) bound to a pecan shell biochar (made at 700 oC) showing the uniform citrate layers preserved on the surface of nAu particles retained by biochar. Retention of citrate- capped nAu on 300 -700 \u00b0C pecan shell biochars occurred rapidly and irreversibly even at neutral pH where retention was less favorable. Uniform layers of citrate on nAu were observable by TEM and these layers were preserved after binding to biochar . Binding resulted in aggregation on the surface or alignment along the edges of multisheets of the biochar structure . Retention of nAu on biochars was (i) greater than on a sandy loam soil, (ii) increased with ionic strength , (iii) decreased with pH, and (iii) at pH 3 varied with pyrolysis temperature at which the char was produced : 500 < 700 << 300 \u00b0C. Collectively, the results show that carboxyl -enriched 300 \u00b0C biochar likely formed strong hydrogen bonds with the citrate layer of nAu. The ch arge transfer between the conduction band of nAu and * continuum of polyaromatic sheets is likely to dominate on 700 \u00b0C biochar . Surface area- normalized retention of nAu on biochars (1.8\u00d7 109-1.3\u00d71011 nAu particles per m2) was several orders of magnitude h igher than retention on negatively charged hydroxyl -bearing environmental surfaces (e.g., sand) , indicating the importance of black carbon materials in the environmental fate of engineered nanomaterials . B. Bioavailability of Contaminants in Environmental Particles 1. Bioaccessibility of PAHs and PAH derivatives in a fuel soot assessed by an in vitro digestive model with absorptive sink: effects of aging the soot in a soil- water mixture (Yanyan Zhang, Joseph J. Pignatello, and Shu Tao). Combustion- derived soot particles distribute widely in the environment through atmospheric and fluvial transpor t. Soot and other environmental black carbon (BC) substances such as vegetation chars often contain high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbo ns (PAHs) and PAH derivatives (d-PAHs) . Mixed with soil or dusts, BC can enter the human digestive tract through hand- or object -to-mouth transfer, especially in children under the age of six who tend to more frequently engage in mouthing behavior . The gastrointestinal bioaccessib ility of native PAHs and d -PAHs in BC as a result of unintentional ingestion of environmental particles is therefore of great interest . Previously, we report ed how digestive fluid chemistry affect s the bioaccessib ility of 11 PAHs, one nitro- PAHs, and four oxygenated PAHs in a composite fuel soot sample using an in vitro digestive model that includes silicone sheet as a third -phase absorptive sink in the small intestinal stage . We showed that the third -phase absorptive sink increases bioaccessib ility by promoting desorption, and that bioaccessib ility is increased under feeding relative to fasting conditions due to the promotional effects of bile acids, increased pH, and dietary lipids accompanying food ingesting have on desorption. Those studies were conducted using the \"raw\" (original) soot , and therefore did not include the potential effects of \"aging\" the soot may undergo in the natural environment. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 110 Schematic of the effects aging of soot particles in soil have on in vitro gastrointestinal bioaccessib ility of contaminants in the soot particles. Scheme showing how PDADMAC coating and Quat188 or Q360 grafting catalyze the base hydrolysis of methyl flux of reagent (OH-) and produced (Br-) ions . Blue colors indicate OH- in different concentration regions. Aging soot in soil under neutral aqueous condition for 30 days significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the apparent gastrointestinal bioaccessibility (Bapp) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PAH derivatives (d-PAHs) natively present in a composite fuel soot sample. B app was determined under fasting conditions by a previously devel oped in vitro digestive model that includes silicone sheet as a third phase absorptive sink in the small intestinal stage. Redistribution of contaminants from soot to soil, determined in independent experiments, was too small to affect B app. Prior uptake by soot of a commercial humic acid representing dissolved soil organic matter had no impact on B app. We identified two causes for the reduction in Bapp by soil and found they were approximately additive. One is an aging time -independent \"matrix effect\" attributable to competitive sorption by the soil of labile contaminant that is desorbed from the soot during the digestion test. The other is the dissolution of soluble substances from the soot during the aging process that increases soot surface area and nanoporosity. The increased surface area and nanoporosity drive contaminants from labile to nonlabile states in the soot and decrease their desorption int o the digestive fluid. T he former contribut es most to the reduction in B app. The present study shows that mixing of raw soot with soil has important effects, both aging and non- aging, on the bioaccessib ility of soot -borne contaminants. C. Pollution Preve ntion and Remediation 1. Modification of Activated Carbons for Enhanced Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Adsorbed Methyl Bromide (Hsin -Se Hsieh and Joseph J. Pignatello). Activated carbons (ACs) are commonly used to remove organic contaminant s from waste streams by adsorption . Methyl 3Br, MeBr) is a quarantine and pre-shipment fumigant commonly used in international trade and regulated as an ozone -depleting compound. Activated carbon (AC) is a highly effective adsorbent for removal of MeBr from fumigation vent streams, but uses of AC for this purpose require desorption of MeBr prior to its destruction in a separate step . Here, we describe the development of quaternary ammonium (QA) -modified ACs for catalyzing base hydrolysis of the adsorbed intermediates from commercial chlorohydrin- functionalized QA precursors (Quat188 and Quab360). In suspensions of 111 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 AC in 1 M NaOH at 55 oC under conditions where hydrolysis in the aqueous phase was negligible, degradation rates w ere first order in MeBr and were accelerated by up to a factor of 5.7 by QA modification in the order, Quab360 > Quat188 > PDADMAC. Combined modification of Quat188 with PDADMAC was superior to individual modifications. Hydrolysis is accelerated by the attraction of hydroxide ions to created anion exchange sites on the modified carbon, as revealed by the effects of QA modification on anion exchange capacity, point of zero charge, and isoelectric point, and by competition experiments with inert monovalent an ions (Br- and ClO 4-). Recyclability tests show that these surface modifications are robust for at least five addition- degradation cycles. QA modification also enhances \"neutral\" hydrolysis modifica tion of carbons is a promising approach for trapping and treating MeBr or other hydrophobic compounds requiring reaction with anionic reagents. (Manuscript in preparation). Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program (Dr. Philip M. Armstrong, Mr. John Shepard, Mr. Michael Thomas, Mr. Michael Misencik, Ms. Angela Bransfield) Mosquito- borne viral diseases constitute an annual threat to human health in Connecticut . A comprehensive surveillance program complemented by science- based controls and timely public outreach are the most effective ways of protecting the public and reducing the risk of human disease . Experiment Station scientists and technicians monitor mosquitoes and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) activity at 91 locations throughout Connecticut from June -October . The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is used to assess the threat of WN virus and EEE to warn the public and guide the implementation of disease prevention and control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. In 2016, statewide mosquito trapping was conducted from May 31 through October 13. Approximately one -third of the sites were located in densely populated residential locales along an urban/suburban corridor in the coastal southwestern corner of the state extending up through the Connecticut River Valley . Trap sites typically included parks, greenways, golf courses, undeveloped wood lots, sewage treatment plants, dumping stations, and temporary wetlands associated with waterways. Trapping locations in the other regions of the state were established in more sparsely populated rural settings that included permanent fresh -water swamps (red maple/white cedar) and bogs, coastal salt marshes, horse stables, and swamp -forest border environs. Mosquito trapping was conducted with CO 2 (dry ice) -baited CDC miniature light traps equipped with aluminum domes, and gravid mosquito traps baited with a lactalbumin -yeast -hay infusion. Traps were placed in the field in the afternoon, operated overnight, and retrieved the following morning . Trapping frequency was minimally made once every ten days at each trap site over the course of the entire season . Adult mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning in an ice chest lined with cool packs. Mosquitoes were immobilized with dry ice and transferred to chill tables where they were identified to species with the aid of a stereo microscope (90X) based on morphological characters. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 112 Female mosquitoes were pooled in groups of 50 or fewer by species, collection date, trap type , and collection site and stored at - 80oC until processed for virus. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of West Nile virus (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and other mosquito- borne arboviruses of public health importance . Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for WN, EEE, Flanders (FL), Jamestown Canyon (JC), Cache Valley (CV), (TVT), Highlands J (HJ), LaCrosse (LAC), St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE), and Potosi (POTV) viruses . Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) or standard RT -PCR using virus -specific primers . All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio- Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. In 2016, a total of 173,988 mosquitoes (13,221 pools) representing 41 species were trapped and tested from 91 locations statewide between May 31 and October 13. A total of 122 isolations of WNV were made from 8 = 1, An. quadrimaculatus = 1, An. walkeri = 1, Cx. salinarius = 1, Culiseta morsitans = 1, Ochlerotatus japonicus = 1 collected at 25 sites in 20 towns in 5 counties (Fairfield, Hartford, Middlesex, New Haven, and New London) . The first positive mosquitoes were collected on July 6, and the last on September 28. The majority of WNV activity was detected in densely populated urban and suburban regions in Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven co unties . One human case of WNV -associated illness was locally acquired (encephalitis/meningitis) . Date of onset was during the third week of August . This human case was temporally and spatially consistent with WNV isolations from mosquito pools. No horse ca ses of WN virus infection were reported . There was one EEE virus isolation made from mosquitoes: Culiseta melanura = 1 in New London county and no equine or human cases have been reported. Other mosquito- borne viruses isolated included: Jamestown Canyon vi rus = 26 isolates from seven species (June 8 - Sept. 1) and LaCrosse = 1 isolate from 1 species (Sept. 22). 113 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact : Participation in the statewide surveillance program provides timely information about levels of virus activity in the mosquito population which is used to monitor virus amplification within enzootic transmission cycles, and assess risk of human infection . This information is used inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide disease prevention and mo squito control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks . In addition, this large -scale sampling effort also informs out understanding of the ecology of mosquitoes and mosquito- borne viruses . Additional studies on the role of different mosquito species to serve as vectors of viral pathogens may be used to target anti -vector interventions more effectively. Population Genetics of Mosquitoes and Epidemiology of Mosquito- borne Viral Diseases A. Northern Range Expansion of the Asian Tiger Mosquito ( Aedes albopictus ): Analysis of Mosquito Data from Connecticut, USA (Dr. Philip M. Armstrong, Dr. Theodore G. Andreadis, Mr. John J. Shepard, and Mr. Mic hael C. Thomas) The Asian tiger mosquito ( Aedes albopictus ) is an invasive species and important arbovirus vector that was introduced into the U.S. in the 1980s where it continues to expand its range. Win ter temperature is an important constraint to its northward expansion, with potential range limits located between the 0o and - 5oC mean cold month isotherm. Connecticut is located within this climatic zone and therefore, Ae. albopictus was monitored statewide to assess its northern range expansion and to delineate where populations can stably persist. Ae. albopictus females were monitored at fixed trapping sites throughout Connecticut from June -October over a 20- year period, 1997- 2016. In addition, Ae. albopictus larvae and pupae were collected from tire habitats and tires were retrieved from the field in the spring and flooded to evaluate overwintering success of hatching larvae. Ae. albopictus was first detected during statewide survei llance when a single adult female was collected in 2006. This species was not collected again until 2010 and was subsequently detected each successive year with increasing abundance and distribution except following the unusually cold winters of 2014 and 2015. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were most abundant in urban and suburban locations along the southwestern shoreline of Connecticut; however, single Distribution of Ae. albopictus in Connecticut The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 114 specimens were occasionally detected in central parts of the state. Field -collected females were also screened for arbovirus infection yielding two isolations of Cache Valley virus and one isolation of West Nile virus, highlighting the threat posed by this mosquito. Ae. albopictus overwintered in Connecticut under mild winter conditions as shown by recovery of ha tched larvae from field collected tires in spring and by early season detection of larvae and pupae. This study documents the establishment and expansion of Ae. albopictus at the northern boundary of its range in the northeastern U.S. and provides a baseli ne for monitoring the future spread of this species anticipated under climate change. Impact Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species that originated from East Asia and appears to be undergoing northward range expansion in the U.S . Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are aggressive human biters and can spread several disease- causing viruses including, chikungunya, dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus . In this study, the team monitored these mosquitoes statewide over a twenty- year period, 1997 to 2016 as a part of a state -supported mosquito- borne disease surveillance program . This is the first documentation of Ae. albopictus range expansion and overwintering in New England and this data demonstrates how mild winters affect the seasonal abundance and overwinterin g success of this mosquito. This suggests further expansion and build- up of this species with projected climate change. Its aggressive biting behavior and ability to transmit a cadre of human disease -causing viruses warrant further study and close monitori ng. B. Immune responses define susceptibility to infection with West Nile virus in Connecticut (Dr. Philip M. Armstrong and Dr. Theodore G. Andreadis in collaboration with Megan E. Cahill, Yi Yao, David Nock, Maria A. Diuk -Wasser, and Ruth R. Montgomery) Infection with West Nile virus (WNV) is mainly asymptomatic but some individuals develop severe disease, especially the elderly. During studies on immunity in aging, we assessed serum samples from over 1100 subjects in Connecticut for reactivity to WNV envelope protein. Unexpectedly, we found 8.5% of healthy subjects and 16.8% of immunosuppressed subjects had previous exposure to WNV. To understand factors determining susceptibility, we mapped locations of the seronegative and asymptomatic seropositi ve subjects and of laboratory -confirmed symptomatic cases reported to the Connecticut Department of Public Health (n=116). The overlapping geocodes of all subjects support a key role for individual responses in determining susceptibility to severe infectio n upon WNV exposure. Age was not a significant factor in seroconversion among asymptomatic subjects, but remains an important factor in disease, as symptomatic DPH -reported cases are older than asymptomatic seropositive subjects. Immune system variation ap pears to be a key driver in susceptibility to infection and disease severity. Impact: Seroprevalence among immunosuppressed individuals is more than double that of non- immunosuppressed individuals . These results, combined with the increased susceptibility to symptomatic disease in older subjects, strongly suggest a key role for individual immune factors. Ongoing research is seeking to further define the immune system attributes that lead to increased risk for WNV severity. In 115 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 addition to other health eleme nts involved in aging, immune system variation may be a key driver in susceptibility to infection and disease severity, and in the differing seroconversion rates among neighbors . C. Population Genetics of Culiseta melanura , the Main Vector of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in Eastern USA and Canada (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. John Soghigian, Dr. Theodore G. Andreadis, Mr. Michael Thomas, Mr. John Shepard) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a highly pathogenic ac tive transmission foci in freshwater hardwood swamps in eastern North America, where enzootic transmission is maintained between the ornithophilic mosquito Culiseta melanura and wild passerine birds . EEEV is responsible for occasional outbreaks of severe disease in humans and equines, resulting in high mortality and neurological impairment in most survivors . In the past, human disease outbreaks in the northeastern U.S. have occurred intermittently with no apparent pattern ; however, during the last decade w e have witnessed recurring annual emergence where EEEV activity had been historically rare, and expansion into northern New England where the virus had been previously unknown. The underlying factors responsible for this sustained resurgence are unclear . Although Cs. melanura is considered the principal enzootic vector, the role this species plays in epidemic/epizootic transmission to humans and equines is not well defined. Despite the importance of Cs. melanura in the EEEV transmission cycle, little is und erstood about the population genetic structure of this species . Due to potentially low gene flow and local adaptation, populations of Cs. melanura may differ in vector -host interactions and vectorial capacity with profound impacts on public health and vect or control . We are investigating population genetics of Cs. melanura, with the objectives to: 1) examine spatial and temporal variations in population genetic structure of Cs. melanura, 2) evaluate the potential impact of variations in population genetic s tructure of Cs. melanura on the risk of human and equine infection in EEEV foci, and 3) investigate the occurrence of population structuring and gene flow patterns. This research project will elucidate previously uncharacterized yet fundamental features of the population genetic structure of Cs. melanura, reveal how it might impact vector -host interactions and vectorial capacity of this species, and provide a basis to understand the involvement of Cs. melanura in epidemic/epizootic transmission of EEEV to h umans and equines . An assembled genome of Cs. melanura would be only the fourth non -Anopheline mosquito genome sequenced, and the first of its genus. Genome information could be utilized for comparative genomic analyses to explore gene family expansion/contraction information, and gene ontology to evaluate how this important vector differs from other vectors . Further evaluation of genome could also provide information on diapause gene families (due to the cold hardiness of this genus), odorant binding and receptor gene families (due to their potential importance in host seeking), and detoxification gene families (due to their potential relationship with pesticide resistance and success under environmental stressors). Tick Management and Epidem iology of Tick -borne Diseases A. An Integrated and Individual Tick Management Program to Reduce Risk of Lyme Disease in a Residential Endemic Area ( Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III, Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Scott Williams) Lyme disease (LD) represents the most f requently diagnosed human tick -borne disease in North America . A variety of prevention and control methods, including personal protective measures, habitat modification, applications of biological and natural compounds, and host -targeted control measures, have been examined for reducing tick abundance and risk for LD . We are investigating the efficacy and associated costs of several existing and new tick control measures individually and in the framework of the ITM approach to reduce the number of infected ticks in the inland LD endemic neighborhoods in Redding , CT. The primary objectives of this CDC -funded project are to: 1) develop a reduced The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 116 risk/integrated tick management (ITM) approach to tick control, 2) measure efficacy of individual methods and an ITM approach to reduce infected ticks, infected reservoirs, and questing tick populations, 3) determine most effective timing and method of implementation of each tick control method and analyze costs for individual components of an ITM program, and 4) create a \"LD decision support system ,\" By incorporating entomological data and other information acquired by the proposed project into our decision support system, we will provide guidance on the most effective control measures that will help stakeholders to pr otect themselves in an environmentally safe manner . The approach and findings generated from this project will easily be extended to other LD endemic regions. B. Evaluation of a Lyme disease Vaccine (Rodent -Targeted Vaccine, RTV) in an Integrated Pest Man agement ( Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III, Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Scott Williams) The paucity of cost -efficient strategies to limit tick -borne pathogen exposures is becoming increasingly problematic for public health in the northeastern U.S. as incidence rates of tick -borne diseases continue to rise and new tick -borne pathogens emerge . We have initiated a collaborative research project to investigate the effectiveness of a rodent -targeted vaccine (RTV) in controlling Lyme borreliosis in neighborhoods during 2014- 2016 in Redding , CT. Properties in one neighborhood will receive the RTV treatment only (delivered in rodent bait boxes), and properties in the other neighborhood will receive the RTV treatment in combination with applications of the biological tick control compound based on the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Met52) . Following collection of baseline tick and mouse data during May -June 2014, we have started delivering RTV, using bait boxes at the study properties . We repeat ed the RTV application in 2016. Spray applications of Met52 are also underway on the study properties in the RTV+Met52 neighborhood (experimental plot), for comparison purposes. C. Spatiotemporal Modeling of Human Lyme Disease and Tick Distributions in Connecticut (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Eliza Little , Dr. John Anderson, Dr. Kirby Stafford III ) This study focuses on examining potential relationship between human Lyme disease cases and tick testing data in Connecticut generated at the CAES Tick Testing Program . The datasets include human Lyme disease cases, number of identified ticks, tested ticks burgdorferi , the causative agent of Lyme disease. Our results indicate that human Lyme disease cases are highly correlated with the number of identified positive ticks. Moreover, there is strong space and time correlation in the data and towns with more cases are tended to cluster . Additional analyses are being conducted and a manuscript is also being prepared for submission upon completion of the analyses. D. Evaluation of Temperature -dependent Physiological Parameters Associated with Disease Transmission in Blacklegged Tick, An Epidemiologically Important Arthropod Disease Vector (Dr. Goudarz Molaei, Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III) Climate models predict that the environment will warm in the tick geographic ranges. Historical data on tick dispersal patterns has been incorporated into recently developed computer -based models to predict how this warming climate will alter the biogeogra phy of this arthropod vector. However, conspicuously little or no empirical information is available on the potential association between increasing temperature and physiological processes that influence tick vector competence. The overall aim of this prop osed project is to reduce this knowledge gap by quantifying the effect of a warming environment on a defined set of disease transmission -relevant physiological parameters in blacklegged tick ( Ixodes aims of the project are: 1) Determi ne if a warming environment alters the density of endogenous symbiotic bacteria. I. scapularis house endogenous symbiotic bacteria that mediate several aspects of its host's physiology, including vector competence. We will determine whether a warming environment alters the dynamics of the microbial population by quantifying the relative density of endogenous symbionts present within blacklegged ticks maintained at elevated temperatures, relative to their 117 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 counterparts maintained under normal insectary conditions, and 2) Determine if a warming environment alters the transmission dynamics of B . burgdor feri within I. scapularis . We will investigate whether a warming environment alters the infection dynamics of B . burgdorferi within blacklegged ticks. Specifically, we will expose I. scapularis to infectious blood meals, and then a) quantify the percentage of hosts infected, and b) the pathogen burden of infected hosts. These infection parameters will be quantified in individuals maintained at both elevated and conventional temperatures. E. Integrated Tick Management for Suppression of Blacklegged Tick Populations in the Suburban Landscape (Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III, Dr. Scott Williams , Dr. Goudarz Molaei) The main goal of this research project is to develop Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies to achieve area- wide suppression of populations of the blacklegged tick and other major tick species in the Northeast of the United States. The objectives of the project are to: 1) Assess population density and infection status of ticks in natural areas and surrounding residential areas in suburban environment, 2) Determine roles of white -tailed deer in maintaining and spreading ticks by GPS tracking of deer movements between natural areas and surrounding residential areas, 3) Evaluate tick control efficacy of deer-targeted (4 -poster), rodent -targeted (Damm inix, Select TCS) and area spray of pesticides, when used alone or combination, 4) Determine if and how different ecological settings may affect the level of suppression of host -seeking ticks achieved through the implementation of host -targeted tick contro l technologies, 5) Develop and validate anti -tick vaccines that can be used to control ticks on deer and rodents, particularly white -footed mice, and 6) Generate practical guidelines to assist design and implementation of Integrated Tick Management Project s at municipal, county and state levels . F. Tick Testing Program for Lyme and Allied Diseases (Dr. Goudarz Molaei assisted by Alex Diaz, Mallery Breban, Pauline Kristina D'Agostino) Tick-associated illnesses including Lyme disease (LD) constitute a major threat to human health in Connecticut . The disease was first described in 1977 following the investigation of a cluster of children with arthritis -like symptoms in L yme, Connecticut . Ixodes scapularis commonly referred to as the blackl egged or deer tick is the primary vector of Borrelia burgdorferi , the bacterium that causes LD. Connecticut has had pervasive populations of I. scapularis in all of its eight counties since 1998 and remains a hotspot of disease transmission. In 2015, 95% of reported LD cases in the United States were reported from 1 4 states, including Connecticut . Connecticut had the 5th highest number of reported cases (n=2,541) following Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts, and the 5th highest incidence rate (confirmed cases per 100,000 persons) of 52.2 after Vermont, Maine , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island. The Tick Testing Program at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1990 . Each year, an average of 3,000 ticks are subm itted for testing. In the past, testing was limited to Borrelia burgdorferi , the LD agent, but in view of increasing human cases of tick -related illnesses in the state, testing has been expanded to include Anaplasma phagocytophilum , the ticks submitted by Connecticut residents, health departments and/or physicians' offices during fiscal year 2016- 2017, 3,748 were examined, of which 1,164 (31.1%) tested for LD; 227 (6.1%) for babesiosis; and 189 (5.0%) for anaplasmos is.

Deer Tick Virus Population Dynamics during Infection of Ixodes Scapularis Ticks (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Phil Armstrong, Dr. John Anderson, Ms. Angela Bransfield) Arthropod- borne RN A viruses exist within hosts as heterogeneous populations of viral vari ants and, as a result, possess great genetic plasticity. Understanding the micro -evolutionary forces shaping these viruses can provide insights into how they emerge, adapt, and persist in new and changing ecological niches. While considerable attention has been directed toward studying the population dynamics of mosquito- borne viruses, little is known about tick- borne virus populations. Therefore, using a mouse and Ixodes scapularis tick transmission model, we examined Powassan virus (POWV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) populations in and between both the vertebrate host and arthropod vector. We found that genetic bottlenecks, RNAi - mediated diversification, and selective constraints collectively influence POWV evolution. Together, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the slow, long - term evolutionary trends of POWV, and suggest that all arthropod -borne viruses encounter similar selective pressures at the molecular level (i.e. RNAi), yet evolve much differently due to their unique rates and modes of transmission. B. Fact ors influencing vector competence (Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Philip Armstrong, Ms. Angela Bransfield ) The emergence and re- emergence of arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) over the last 40 years constitutes a continued and significant public health threat. Determining the relative risk for transmission is typically assessed in the laboratory by performin g vector competence studies. Vector competence is the ability of an arthropod vector (e.g. mosquitoes) to become infected with a pathogen, permit replication and ultimately transmit the pathogen to a na\u00efve vertebrate host. This can be determined by providi ng the local vector populations with an infectious bloodmeal containing the pathogen of interest (e.g. Zika virus). Subsequently, individual mosquitoes are assayed at varying time points post -bloodmeal to determine if the gut became infected, if the virus was able to escape the gut and enter the hemolyph (i.e., the open circulatory system), and to determine if the pathogen is being transmitted in the saliva. This basic procedure has been utilized for the better part of a century; however, for some species such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, it doesn't take into consideration the natural habits of the mosquito. For instance, it is well documented that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes take a bloodmeal every two to three days in the wild. Therefore, we have recently begun studying the effects that multiple feeding episodes may have on the vector competence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to Zika virus, dengue virus and chikungunya virus. Surprisingly, we have found that non- infectious The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 120 bloodmeals provided after the initia l infectious bloodmeal significantly enhanced the rates in which the virus is able to escape the gut and infect the salivary glands. These paradigm shifting findings will change how risk assessments of vector -borne disease outbreaks are determined and help explain the explosive epidemic potential of virus es transmitted by mosquitoes. C. The Role of Autophagy during Arthropod -borne Virus Infection of Mosquitoes ( Dr. Doug Brackney and Ms. Maria Correa) Autophagy can be induced in metazoans by developmental stimuli or in response to various types of stress such as starvation, hypoxia, or microbial infection. During normal growth conditions, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading unwanted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates. In times o f cellular stress, autophagy catabolizes these cellular components, generating a pool of energy and macromolecules that maintain essential cellular processes until normal growth conditions return . Because this is a highly complex process requiring the reor ganization of intracellular membranes and numerous signaling pathways, perturbations in normal activity, at any of these stages, can drastically affect the outcome of autophagic events . Not surprisingly, many viruses either directly modulate or indirectly a lter many of these pathways and/or processes imp ortant in regulating autophagy. To date , our understanding of virus -host autophagy interactions ha s been limited to mammalian systems, yet arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) require both a vertebrate hos t and invertebrate vector for maintenance in nature . It is currently unknown if or how the autophagy pathway of vectors interacts with viruses. Our contribution here is expected to result in a detailed understanding of these events. The significance of the se studies is that they will contribute to our understanding of virus -vector interactions . This is important because identifying cellular components/pathways essential to virus replication has the potential to be exploited for the development of novel cont rol strategies. Environmental Microbiology A. Alterations in sediment microbial communities associated with sudden vegetation dieback in a coastal wetland (Dr. Blaire Steven and Dr. Wade Elmer) There is an increasing recognition of the role coastal vegetated ecosystems play in atmospheric carbon sequestration. However, the development of sudden vegetation dieback (SVD), a phenomenon which causes the rapid death of Spartina alterniflora, followed by no or slow recovery, has affected large -scale alterations in Atlantic coastal systems. In 1999, Hammonasset Beach State Park in Connecticut experienced the initial appearance of SVD. After more than a decade, the plants have not recovered. Yet, 121 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 sediment chemistry was similar between vegetated and SVD affected sites, with the exception of water loading, which was significantly higher in the SVD affected sites. Soil CO 2 flux, a proxy for soil respiration, was reduced by 64% in SVD sites compared to sites t hat remained vegetated. This suggests that SVD has affected large changes in carbon cycling in the wetland sediments. The microbial communities between vegetated and SVD sites were significantly different, as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing . The veget ated sediments harbored significantly higher populations of Bacteroidetes related bacteria, whereas the SVD affected sediments contained a significantly enriched relative abundance of sulfate- reducing bacteria, predominantly within the genus Desulfobulbus (Fig 1). Thus, the development of SVD appears to favor anaerobic metabolic pathways at the expense of saprophytes. Greenhouse experiments testing if the alterations in the sediment microbial communities were associated with differences in S. alterniflora g ermination or growth were also pursued. Although small differences in growth and disease ratings were noted between seedling and transplants grown in soil mix (control), autoclaved SVD sediments, or non- autoclaved (natural) SVD sediments, mortality was not significantly different, indicating that the alterations in the sediment communities are not likely responsible for SVD, or a primary cause for the failure of S. alterniflora to recolonize the SVD sites. B. Mapping the arboreal microbiome and determining the metabolic pathway for in-tree methane production (Dr. Blaire Steven) Deadwood, long recognized as playing an important role in storing carbon and releasing it as CO 2 in forest ecosystems, is more recently drawing attention for its potential role in the cycling of other greenhouse trace gases (Fig. 2) . Across three Northeastern and Central US forests, mean methane (CH 4) concentrations in deadwood wer e 23 times atmospheric levels (43.0 L L1 \u00b1 12.3; mean \u00b1 SE), indicating a lower bound, mean radial wood surface area flux of ~6 \u00d7 104 mol CH 4 m2 s1. Site, decay class, log diameter, and species were all highly significant predictors of CH 4 abundance in deadwood, and diameter and decay class interacted as important con trols limiting CH 4 concentrations in the smallest and most decayed logs. Nitrous oxide (N 2O) concentrations were negatively correlated with CH 4 (r2 = 0.20, p < 0.001) and on average ~25 % lower than ambient (276.9 nL L1 \u00b1 2.9; mean \u00b1 SE), indicating net consumption of nitrous oxide. Oxygen (O 2) concentrations were uniformly near anaerobic (355.8 L L1 \u00b11.2; mean \u00b1 SE), and CO 2 was elevated from atmospheric (9336.9 L L1 \u00b1 600.6; mean \u00b1 SE). Most notably, our observations that CH 4 concentrations were highest in the least decayed wood, may suggest that methanogenesis is not fueled by structural wood decomposition but rather by consumption of more labile nonstructural carbohydrates.

Characterizing the apple flower microbiome fo r developing potential biological controls for fire blight (Dr. Blaire Steven and Dr. Quan Zeng) Fire blight, caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora , is one of the most devastating diseases of apples and pears (Figure 3). Despite the tremendous damage posed by fire blight, the control options for organic growers are extremely limited . Further, the removal of antibiotics from the list of organic control options by the National Organic Standards Board in 2014, put organic growers at significant ri sk for control failures. As the pathogens enter the plant through open flowers, we are characterizing and screening the natural microbiome of apple blossoms to identify potential n atural biocontrol agents that could be employed in organic agriculture . Work to date has focused on optimizing methods to generate apple blossom bacterial culture collections, screening isolates for antagonistic activity against E. amylovora, and developing methods for the metagenomics of the apple blossom microbiome . Future work will hopefully translate these methods into developing a viable biocontrol strategy for fire blight in Connecticut. D. Mosquito Microbiota: An Ecological Based Approach for Paratransgenesis Systems in Mosquitoes ( Dr. Doug Brackney, Dr. Blaire Steven) The presence of host associated microbiota (the collection of bacteria living on or in animals) is a commonality shared among all animals including mosquitoes . Because of their importance in mediating mosquito development and their ability to influence dis ease transmission , there is considerable interest in understanding these relationships . It is currently known that the mosquito microbiome is composed of ~50-200 bacterial species and that this community is temporally dynamic with large shifts in community composition between different life stages . This suggests that mosquito microbiomes, in their natural state, are composed of complex and dynamic communities . However, while informative, these studies have been descriptive and have failed to empirically tes t the ecological mechanisms mediating microbial colonization, development, stability , or transmission . Despite these knowledge gaps, efforts to utilize this host-microbiome relationship for the purposes of controlling mosquito- borne diseases have already b een tested . This approach, known as paratransgenesis, utilizes symbiotic microbes to express anti -pathogen effector molecules within the mosquito. Mosquito paratransgenesis attempts thus far have focused on employing a single paratransgenic strain . A key c ondition impacting the success of mosquito paratransgenesis is the assurance that paratransgenic strains are resilient to replacement by competing environmental strains . Studies in mice suggest that low complexity microbiomes are unstable, easily invaded, and quickly replaced by environmental competitors . However, it remains unknown if mosquito based paratransgenic mono -cultures will remain stable in the presence of competing environmental bacteria and conversely, whether complex paratransgenic communities are more resilient to invasion and replacement . Another important consideration when assessing the feasibility of mosquito paratransgenesis is the likelihood that such approaches can be introduced and propagated amongst natural populations . 123 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Current literat ure suggests that mosquito microbiomes, at least in part, can be transmitted transovum and that members of this community can colonize emerging larvae . The implications of these findings are profound and may provide a drive mechanism by which paratransgeni c bacteria can be transmitted trans - generationally . However, the implications of these findings have not been examined in the context of paratransgenic communities . Furthermore, the transmission efficiency or stability of these communities has not been ass essed . Filling these fundamental gaps in knowledge will be critical if we are to fully harness the potential of novel paratransgenic countermeasures. Our goal is to better understand the ecology of the microbiome within vector mosquitoes . The objectives of this proposal are to define the stochasticity of microbial colonization, the stability of microbial populations over the life of the mosquito (including transovum transmission), and to test the predictions of a community ecology based approach on the deve lopment of paratransgenic strategies. Evolution of Genome Size in Microsporidia (Dr. Charles Vossbrinck) Microsporidia have remarkably small genomes which appear to both grow and shrink over evolutionary time. We have shown, by comparative genomic analysis, that the Microsporidia can reduce their genome size by developing smaller genes, shorter introns, smaller intervening sequences and decreased signal sequence length. While the host cell can provide many compounds necessary for the growth and reproduction of the Microsporidia, the idea that the Microsporidia have small genomes because they don't need many genes is not an evolutionary explanation . We hypothesize that the microsporidial genome is growing and shrinking because there is a tradeoff betw een having a small genome to reproduce faster and a larger genome with which to challenge the host. We are attempting to test this hypothesis through genomic analysis. Syntenic and intergenic comparisons of three microsporidial species showing differences in intergenic size. From Xu and Vossbrinck, 2016. Silkworm Pathology Database (Dr. Charles Vossbrinck) Silkworm pathogens have been heavily impeding the development of sericultural industry and play important roles in lepidopteran ecology, and some of which are used as biological insecticides. Rapid advances in studies on the omics of silkworm pathogens have produced a large amount of data, which need to be brought together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner. This will facilitate the reuse o f these data for further analysis. We have collected genomic data for 86 silkworm pathogens from 4 taxa (fungi, microsporidia, bacteria and viruses) and from 4 lepidopteran hosts, and developed the open- access The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 124 Silkworm Pathogen Database (SilkPathDB) to mak e this information readily available. The implementation of SilkPathDB involves integrating Drupal and GBrowse as a graphic interface for a Chado relational database which houses all of the datasets involved. The genomes have been assembled and annotated f or comparative purposes and allow the search and analysis of homologous sequences, transposable elements, protein subcellular locations, including secreted proteins, and gene ontology. We believe that the SilkPathDB will aid researchers in the identificati on of silkworm parasites, understanding the mechanisms of silkworm infections, and the developmental ecology of silkworm parasites (gene expression) and their hosts. Database URL: http://silkpathdb.swu.edu.cn Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (Mr. Gregory Bugbee) We are quantifying the locations of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determining their effects on native plant communities, establishing baseline data to track their spread and providing information that is critical for management strategies. A. Surveillance and Monitoring Since 2004, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (CAES IAPP) has completed aquatic vegetation surveys of 2 30 Connecticut lakes and ponds (Figure 1) . A total of 56 waterbodies have been resurveyed to determine how invasive plants are changing the quality of lakes over time . In fiscal year 2016-2017, Greg ory Bugbee (Figure 2) and staff mapped the aquatic vegetatio n in three new and 12 previously surveyed waterbodies (Table 1) . Lake Candlewood, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the ninth consecutive year to determine the effects of alternate year deep and shallow winter drawdown and recently introduced grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) on Eurasian 125 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 Zoar Squantz Pond were also surveyed. We establish ed transects in each waterbody, using global positioning systems, to quantify changes in native and invasive aquatic species abundance and distribution. We collected water samples and analyzed them for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, clarity, alkalinity, conductivity , and phosphorus . This data, along with watershed information, is being used to investigate the factors that influence the susceptibility of waterbodies to individual invasive species. We archive dry specimens of all plant species in the CAES herbarium for future reference . We designed our Invasive Aquatic Plant Program to utilize the latest digital technology to rapidly and comprehensively report our findings to the public . Lake survey maps and other data are published online within days of their completion ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Nearly 60 percent of the waterbodies contained one or more invasive plant species and some lakes contained as many as four invasive species (Figure 1) . The most common invasive plants survey of Fence Rock Lake, in Guilford, discovered Connecticut's first infestation of Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa ) and our resurveys in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 found the population expanding (Figure 3) . We have since found Brazilian waterweed in Lower Moodus Reservoir (East Figure 1. Locations of invasive plants in Connecticut' s lakes and ponds as found in CAES IAPP surveys from 2004- 2016. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 126 Haddam), Staffordville Reservoir (Stafford Springs), and Mono Pond (Coventry) . We are working with the local lake associations and the CT DEEP to develop and test novel control technologies . B. Control Technology The goal s of this objective are 1) to research novel means of control that minimize herbicide usage and protect native vegetation and 2) to investigate non - chemical management options such as winter water level drawdown. 1. Herbicides. Novel methods of chemical control with herbicides can rapidly remove invasive plants and begin to restore native plant communities to aquatic ecosystems. Bashan Lake - East Haddam, CT - We are in the 1 6th year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2,4- D to control variable watermilfoil in Bashan Lake . We have largely restored the lake to preinfestation conditions . Our resurvey of Bashan Lake in 2014 found an approximate 99 per cent reduction in variable watermilfoil and an increase in the number of desirable native species from 12 to 19. In the fall of 2014, the water level in the lake was lowered 18 feet for dam repairs, with the prospect for the refilling to take two years . A survey of Bashan Lake in 201 6 found a few sparse patches of variable watermilfoil and a number of areas where phragmites ( Phragmites australis ) had become established . With from the Bashan Lake Association (BLA) , CAES IAPP performed a targeted herb icide application of the phragmites in late September with considerable success. In June 2016, we surveyed the lake for phragmites and found the plant sporadically along the shore. In addition, variable milfoil was observed in a few locations. CAES is proc uring the necessary CT DEEP permits to assist the BLA with its treatment in September. Figure 2.

Because th is plant is the first documented case of large scale invasio n of this plant in CT and no information is available on its control, we arranged for testing the herbicide diquat (6,7- dihydrodipyrido (1,2- a:2',1' -c) pyrazinediium dibromide) in the summer of 2014. The herbicide was applied by bottom injection to the shoreline areas of the lake in July . A pretreatment survey on over 100 georeferenced points in July 2014 (Figure 3, top right) found 59 points were occupied by Brazilian waterweed . A post -treatment survey, one year later, found only one point with the plant . Another treatment was performed in late July 2015. We resurvey ed the lake in July 2016 and determined the plant was completely eliminated without harm to the native plant community. 2. Winter water level drawdown and grass carp. Candlewood Lake - Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Sherman, CT . Lake Candlewood's aquatic plant community is dominated by Eurasian watermilfoil . Winter water level drawdown is used to manage the watermilfoil . Using state- of-the-art global positioning systems, we have documented the success of the drawdowns each year since 2007. The winter drawdown protocol consists of alternate year shallow (1 m) and deep (3 m) water level reductions . Drawdown timing and duration varies depending on the hydrogenerating needs of FirstLight Power Resources. These variables and inconsistencies in winter weather result in differences in milfoil control . The coverage of Figure 3. Brazilian waterweed in Fence Rock Lake in 2013 (top left), pretreatment 2014 (top right) , and two years post treatment (bottom right). The invasive species was completely eliminated. Figure 4. Comparison of drawdown depth and duration on the acreage of Eurasian watermilfoil in Candlewood Lake. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 128 Figure 6. Gregory Bugbee speaking at a CAES IAPP invasive aquatic plant w orkshop. milfoil shows a negative relationship to drawdown depth and duration (Figure 4) . In 2015, fish called grass carp were introduced into the lake. These fish eat aquatic vegetation and our work will determine their effectiveness. Our yearly report to The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FirstLight Power Resources, CT DEEP, Candlewood Lake Authority and other stakeholders provide data that is crucial for making decisions on future drawdown and grass carp introduction practices for Connecticut's largest lake. 3. Benthic Barriers. Lake Quonnipaug - Guilford, CT. Benthic barriers are blankets designed to be placed over nuisance vegetation in lakes and ponds . They provide an alternative to herbicides and are thought to control vegetation by blocking the light aquatic plants need to grow . Benthic barriers are not new; they are typically placed over weed beds early in the growing season and removed in the fall . Recently, marketers o f benthic barriers have claimed that their products need only be placed over weeds for a few weeks and then moved to another location or removed . To test this practice, we collaborated with the Town of Guilford and place d twenty -one 50' X 20' benthic barriers at Lake Quonnipaug's public beach for the second straight year (Figure 5) . The beach has had an increasing problem with Eurasian watermilfoil and fanwort . We placed the benthic barriers in early April and removed them prior to t he opening of the beach on Memorial Day weekend. The results from last year were very promising with little vegetative regrowth throughout the summer . The vegetative reduction was notable prior to this year's placement and as of June 30, 2017 the weed cont rol was excellent. Further tests are needed to determine more information on why these barriers provide impressive weed control even when they are used for short periods of time. C. Outreach - We strive to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, prevention , and management of invasive aquatic species. We make every effort to engage citizens, lake associations, and other stakeholders. CAES scientists have organized several workshops (Figure 6) on the identification of invasive aquatic plants . We also gave presentations to professional organizations such as the North east Aquatic Plant Management Society, the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel and the Connecticut Federation of Lakes. In addition, CAES IAPP staff speak to numerous lake associations, town meetings , and student groups such as the Connecticut Envirothon . We have made o ur information freely and readily available via our website. Included are digitized interactive lake maps, our herbarium , and publications (http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Our invasive aquatic plant control and ou treach efforts have resulted in the protection of lakes and provided scientifically proven methods for use by others . Our workshops have trained hundreds of Figure 5. Amanda Massa installs a benthic barrier at Lake Quonnipaug, Guilford. 129 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 citizens to recognize and report new infestations in order to prevent future problems and the assoc iated control expenditures. Soil Testing Laboratory (Mr. Gregory Bugbee) Testing soil samples for fertility and suggesting methods for growing better plants are a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut . At the laboratory in New Haven, 5,939 samples were tested and approximately 1,500 related inquiries were answered. The soil testing services and recommendations made by t he Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state . This provides direct economic and environmental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and water. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 130 DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including how trees respond to novel pests and a changing climate, innovative forest management practices, the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed landscapes, and novel specialty crops. Emerald ash borer establishment affected by an induced plant hormone (MeJA) Emerald ash borer, EAB, (Buprestidae : Agrilus planipennis ) has caused the death of millions of native North American ash trees. This insect was discovered in south east Michigan and in Ontario in 2002, where it was devastating ash trees ( Fraxinus spp.). It has since expanded throughout much of the eastern US and Canada in both urban and forest landscapes. Early studies reported that EAB was specific to ash species. However, more recently white fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus ), a new na\u00efve host in the Oleaceae family, was reported as a host of EAB in Ohio. Ash species are economically and ecologically important for wildlife as a food source and nesting sites for a diversity of species, and has also been widely planted as a street tree in urban areas. Trees can be killed between 1 -4 years after symptoms . However , dendrochronological evidence had shown that EAB populations can be established up to 10 years before they are discovered. Despite quarantine boundaries and suppression efforts in areas where EAB has been detected by natural resources and regulatory agenci es, it has spread to 20 states and 2 Canadian provinces. The beetle has increased its range rapidly, due to the movement of logs, firewood, and nursery trees. The beetle was detected in Connecticut in 2012 and has spread throughout the state . Aerial survey s of Connecticut in 2015 found 551 hectares of ash tree defoliation, and 188 hectares of dead ash trees in forests and urban settings . Unlike North American species of Fraxinus , Asian ash species coevolved with EAB. Thus , these species display a constitut ive defense against attack by the beetle ; a defense that only breaks down when the tree is no longer robust enough to maintain those defenses. Induced defenses can be triggered through exogenous application of chemical elicitors such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA). , Claire Sourav Chakraborty with the help of Joseph Barsky, began a study using seedlings of fringe trees and ash that have been exposed to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to evaluate the changes elicited by MeJA a pplication and EAB establishment capacity. MeJA is a volatile derivate of the stress- eliciting hormone jasmonic acid. Little is known about the involvement of MeJA in the anatomical changes for tree defense in angiosperms, and particularly against EAB. To elucidate the induced defense of MeJ A in na\u00efve white ash and fringe trees, we are examin ing the endogenous defenses (lignin and soluble phenolics), anatomical changes in cell wall structure, leaf carbohydrates and larvae development of fringe and white ash trees 28 days post -infestation. Emerald a sh borer ( Agrilus planipennis ) 131 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 To test if MeJA affected the biology of EAB, larval development is being measured by head capsule width, as well as body mass and tunnel width. Bark /wood samples were collected for anatomical and chemical analyses, and leaf samples to test systemic induced response to MeJA applications. Physiological and chemical analyses just begun and we anticipate completing this study in spring 2018. Emerald ash borer and drought interaction in Fraxinus tree defense responses Last year, Drs. Arango -Velez and Rutledge noted that emerald ash borer (EAB) larvae development was affected by drought stress in both white ash and fringetrees, and that EAB development in fringetree s was slower compared with white ash. Building on this research, Dr . Arango -Velez with the collaboration of White ash (top) and fringetrees (bottom) cross sections 21 and 61 days after infestation of EAB. Callose deposition (arrows) at 21 and 61 days post infestation. Larva of emerald ash borer in ash trees after 28 days post infestation. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 132 Dr. Sourav Chakraborty (Central Connecticut State University) are now studying histological and chemical cues responsible for the slower larval development observed in fringetrees compared with ash, and how drought might have affected these responses. Previous studies have shown the involvement of callose, a polysaccharide that exists in the cell walls of a wide variety of higher plants, in plant response against multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Under stres s, callose is deposited at the plasma membrane and cell wall interface within minutes of damage, inducing the production of salicylic acid , which increases resistance to biotic agents such as pathogens. Although there are no prior reports of callose production in relation to insect attack, our preliminary results indicate abundant callose deposition in fringetrees exposed to EAB at 21 and 61 days post infestation. In contrast, no callose deposition was observed in white ash. Additional histological and chemical analysis, such as leaf carbohydrates content and phenolics are underway; and results are expected by the end of 2017. Does mycorrhizae and/or biochar decrease salt toxicity in urban trees? The salinization of roadside soils by application of salt to melt snow increases the risk of soil toxicity, because salinity can accumulate in soils over many years and can remain high. Most of the current knowledge on plant adaptation mechanisms has been acquired through studies of herbace ous annuals or short -lived perennials; but little is known about the effects of elevated soil salinity on trees, especially in urban settings. Understanding the physiological adaptive traits related to salinity and drought is of particular importance for u rban tree management and tree planting under the predicted scenarios of climate change. Accordingly, Dr. Arango- Velez with the collaboration of Dr. Wade Elmer and Joseph Barsky is focused on the development of better practices for maintaining and preserving common urban tree species growing under conditions of high salinity and drought stress. This study aims to assess the individual and combined value of biochar and mycorrhizae in alleviating salt stress on sugar maple (salt and drought intolerant) seedlings. Mycorrhizae and/or biochar treatments were applied during summer of 2016, and drought and salinity treatments will be conducted in July 2017. Physiological thresholds of tree responses to salt toxicity and water stress will be then quantified by analyses of stem hydraulics, root length, root and wood anatomy, leaf chlorophyll measurements, and leaves analyses (Ca and Mg) and root analyses (Na, Cl, K, P, Zn, Cu and Mg), will be measured to determine if mycorrhizal inoculation and/or biochar improves tree performance. Forest Management The value of the forest to Connecticut is much more than the timber and other forest products. First and foremost, forests protect watersheds, aquifers and groundwater supplies that provide the bulk of our clean drinking water. Trees also provide air pollution control, acting as giant filters to remove dust, particulates, and some airborne chemicals. In addition, trees cool our environment in the summer by recycling water and reflecting sunlight. Forests contribu te to the character of Connecticut and add to our enjoyment throughout the year. 133 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Stump Resprout Study When cut down, many tree species put root energy reserves into forming new sprouts from latent buds on the stump. In the past, these stump resprouts have been an integral part of a regenerating forest. However, in Connecticut, it is not known how many of t hese resprouts successfully reach the upper canopy largely due to overbrowsing by white -tailed deer. As a result, Drs. Scott Williams and Jeffrey Ward with the assistance of Joseph Barsky, Michael Short, and Megan Linske, and in collaboration with the Wild life Division of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, selected four sites throughout the state (Bozrah, Burlington, Litchfield, and Madison) where timber management ha s recently occurred. Three of the four sites were recently clearcut for New England cottontail ( Sylvilagus transitionalis ) habitat and the fourth was part of a timber sale. A total of 187 oak stumps were identified, measured, and numbered. We used 6' fence to individually enclose half of the stumps, effectively isolating them from browsing deer. Half of those stumps fenced from deer have three 8\" x 12\" holes cut into the fence at ground level to permit cottontail rabbit access to resprouts. In spring 2014, an additional 10 resprouting stumps were fenced at each location to improve sample size as only about half of monitored stumps actually produced sprouts. In addition, on nine recently harvested areas in southern New England, we recorded the number of sprouts, height of tallest sprout, and whether there had been browse damage to the terminal buds of 2, 091 stumps. For each of eight species groups, logistic regression was used to model the probability of a cut stump producing sprouts using stand and canopy position (upper vs. lower canopy) as factors, and initial stem diameter as a continuous independent variable. A separate analysis was run for trees with DBH < 35 cm to exclude large trees that were in the lower canopy because they were either declining or h ad crowns severely damaged by storms. Stump sprouting decreased with preharvest diameter for upland oaks, red maple, sugar maple, and black birch. At typical merchantable diameters, harvested red maples were twice as likely to sprout as upland oaks. On four new clearcuts, we examined the influence of white- tailed deer browsing on 4- year growth and survival of oak stump sprouts. For those oaks that did sprout, browsing reduced height growth by 1.5 m, but did not prevent sprouts from growing tall enough to be above the browse line. However, the reduction in height growth of oak stump sprouts was sufficient to reduce the proportion of stumps with at least one free- to-grow sprout from 84% of stumps protected from deer to only 44% for unprotected stumps . Measuring the height of stump sprouts. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 134 Delaying harvest of oaks past merchantable diameters will greatly reduce the number of free -to-grow sprouts in new stands, especially if deer browse damage can be expected. Therefore, when developing a management prescription to regenerate a stand, managers should be cognizant that larger, older oaks are less likely to produce sprouts and that those that do sprout are less likely to produce sprouts that are free -to-grow after four growing seasons. Where there are abundant red maple and where deer browse damage can be expected, management prescriptions should anticipate implementation of practices to minimize their impact on development of free-to-grow oaks. Impact: Oak is a v aluable commodity for both the timber industry as well as a source of hard mast for native wildlife species. Protecting new oak stump sprouts with portable cages could be a viable alternative to area -wide fencing for maintaining oak as a significant component of forests in areas with high deer abundance. Deer Herbivory Exclosure Study One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vegetation protected from white -tailed deer ( Odocoileus vir ginianus ) herbivory to unprotected plots . Drs. Scott Williams and Jeffrey Ward with the assistance of Michael Short and Megan Linske collected within sixteen deer exclosures and sixteen adjacent control plots throughout the state. Deer exclosures prevent d eer from accessing and browsing on vegetation . Growth rates and species diversity of protected vegetation will be compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer can freely browse unprotected vegetation . The project is a collaborative effort wit h The Nature Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures (and adjacent control plots), at Burnham Brook Preserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement in Salem, and Devil's Den Preserve in Weston . We also includ ed four of our own exclosures on South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford . Plots have been sampled for herbaceous species cover in spring of 2006 -2016. Late-summer sampling was conducted from 2005 -2016 and included all woody and herbaceous plants . Preliminary data analyses indicate that herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than control plots. Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plots. All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2017. Results from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. Additionally, in collaboration with the C T Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Metropolitan District Commission, four more exclosures were erected in spring 2017 on the MDC's Barkhamsted Reservoir property . Smaller trees were more likely than larger trees to form sprouts after cutting . 135 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact: Overabundant herds of white -tailed deer negatively affect forest regeneration by repeated herbivory. This i n turn will negatively affect the future of the timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut . The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut uses these data to scientifically justify and document the results of their deer management program by educ ating their constituency on the negative impacts of overabundant white -tailed deer on the very forest flora and fauna they are charged with protecting . The Nature Conservancy also uses these data as a benchmark with which to monitor and compare noticeable browse damage on other properties which may require deer reduction. The Metropolitan District Commission will use these data to monitor similar impacts by overabundant deer but as it relates to water quality in terms of minimizing erosion and siltation int o surface drinking water bodies. Interaction of Deer Browse Impacts and Barberry Infestations on Plant Communities While both chronic white -tailed deer overbrowsing and invasive shrubs have been linked to native regeneration failure in temperate hardwoo d forests, little is known of the relative importance and possible synergistic effects of these two stressors. Beginning in 2007, Drs. Jeffrey Ward and Scott Williams with the assistance of Michael Short, Megan Linske, and Joseph Barsky began a study to examine the interaction of three levels of invasive shrub control (primarily Japanese barberry, ( Berberis thunbergii de Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) on forest regeneration over nine y ears. At three locations, invasive shrubs were either treated three times (I 3, initial mechanical cutting in March followed by directed flame of new ramets with propane torches in July and October), once (I 1, single mechanical cutting in March), or were not treated (I 0). After the initial mechanical cutting, half of each treatment area was protected from deer herbivory with a 2.3 m polyethylene fence (F -fenced, U - unprotected) resulting in six treatment combinations I 3F, I 3U, I 1F, I 1U, I 0F, and I 0U. Within each of the six treatment combinations at each tract, ten 4 m2 circular plots were established on a 5 x 5 m grid. Stems of woody regeneration were tallied within each plot in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015. For tree species capable of formin g part of the upper canopy in a mature forest, we recorded the species and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 136 height class for all stems with a diameter < 2.5 cm at 1.4 m aboveground. Seedling height class was defined as the highest live bud and measured with a height class pole. Because of low stem counts of woody regeneration in the larger height classes, stems were assigned to one of three height classes: < 30 cm tall, 30 -90 cm tall, and > 90 cm tall. Height class counts (x) were highly skewed and not normally distributed; therefore, they were natural log transformed (ln(x+1)) prior to analysis. To examine the separate and interactive effects of invasive control and herbivory exc lusion, repeated measures analysis of variance of count (transformed) was utilized. Years since initial treatment was the within subjects factor, and height class, invasive control treatment ( I0, I1, I3), deer exclusion (F, U), and their interactions were between subject factors with study areas as replicates. Reported P -values are those after applying the conservative Greenhouse- Geisser Epsilon correction for deviations from compound symmetry. A three -factor (height class, herbivory protection, invasive tr eatment) ANOVA was used to compare the influence of herbivory protection and invasive treatments on seedling density in 2015 after nine growing seasons. Models were examined without factors and interactions found non- significant in full model, and if the r evised model had a lower AIC c estimate, then the factors/interactions were excluded in the final analysis. Five observations suggest obtaining forest regeneration requires a comprehensive management strategy. First, competitive interference by invasive shrubs in intact thickets continued to impede forest regeneration, especially taller seedlings, after deer wer e excluded. Second, density of small seedlings increased following removal of the competitive interference by invasive shrubs. Third, deer browsing depressed growth of small seedlings into taller height classes. Fourth, preferential browsing reduced species richness by favoring growth of low palatability species such as beech, especially in taller seedling classes. Lastly, the window of forest regeneration recruitment is narrow because invasive shrubs quickly recovered from a disturbance (cutting) that did not kill the root system. Composi tion of forest regeneration is affected by both deer browsing and the presence of invasive shrubs. 137 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Therefore, restoring forest regeneration in stands with both established invasive shrubs and high deer densities will require both controlling the invasive shrubs and a multi- year program to reduce deer browsing intensity. While there are much more cost -effective methods of controlling competitive interference such as invasive shrubs, our cut/burn/burn method can provide effective control where h erbicide use is restricted by regulations or by active public opposition. Equally important as controlling invasive shrubs is implementing a strategy to reduce browse intensity to the equivalent of 5 -8 deer - km-2 or lower to obtain adequate tree regeneratio n. Without reducing browsing intensity, some tree regeneration will become established, but it will take longer and will be comprised of species with both lower economic and ecosystem services values. Impact: Both the invasive shrub Japanese barberry and native white -tailed deer can have detrimental impacts on regeneration of Connecticut's native tree species. Information on invasive control and growth characteristics has been provided to media outlets (WNPR, WFSB -3, Landscape Architecture magazine, CT Pos t, The Daily Voice, Brainerd Communications), numerous associations (CT, NY, VT, MA), 10 government agencies (CT, VT, WI, NC), 8 towns, and 9 private companies/utilities. Japanese Barberry Infestations Serve as a Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks In many Connecticut forests with an overabundance dominant understory shrub. This exo tic invasive provides habitat favorable to blacklegged tick To determine mouse and larval tick abundances at six replicate sites, Dr. Williams with the assistance of Megan Linske an d Michael Short have trapped mice since 2007 in unmanipulated dense barberry infestations, areas where barberry was controlled, and areas where barberry was minimal or absent . The number of feeding larval ticks/mouse was recorded . Adult and nymphal ticks w ere sampled along permanent draglines within each treatment area, retained, and were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease in humans and pets. Deer browsing can severely stunt the growth of tree seedlings and stump sprouts. White -footed mice are the primary host of blacklegged tick larva and nymphs. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 138 To date, there have been 2,652 white -footed mice captures . The numbe r of captured mice did not differ between treatments. However, the average number of feeding larval ticks per mouse was highest on mice captured in dense barberry (5.6 larvae/mouse). Adult tick densities in dense barberry (262/acre) were higher than in both controlled barberry (118/acre) and no barberry (73/acre) areas full barberry infestations and controlled barberry areas had similar infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi , 53 and 51% , respectively . Adult tick infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi varied widely between treatments and study areas, but was lowest in areas where barberry was absent and generally lower where barberry was controlled. This in concert with the overall reduction in the adult tick cohort in areas where b arberry was controlled resulted in 146 B. burgdorferi -infected ticks/acre in dense barberry, 69/acre where barberry was controlled, and 39/acre where barberry was absent. Results indicate that managing Japanese barberry will have a positive effect on publ ic health for up to 10 years after initial treatment by reducing the number of B. burgdorferi -infected blacklegged ticks that can develop into motile life stages that commonly feed on humans . Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for sever al more years to monitor long -term effects of controlling Japanese barberry. Impact: This research scientifically documented the negative impacts an invasive plant has on human health . Forest managers have used it to strengthen their argument for the incr eased need to control invasive plants . Applied invasive plant control will also reduce the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme disease in humans and domesticated animals. In the past five years, 69% of land trusts responding to our survey in spring 201 5 indicated that they have treated barberry on 530 acres and other invasive species on another 800 acres . In addition, various entities in the states of Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont have used these results to e ducate and in part to justify equipment purchase and initiate or reinvigorate invasive plant control programs . Lastly, multiple towns in Connecticut as well as the states of Delaware and Maryland and the Province of British Columbia have used our research linking deer and invasive plants to justify their respective deer management programs. Tick -Borne Pathogen Reservoirs in Residential and Woodland Settings Many animals can serve as reservoir or dilution hosts for Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease. Dilution effect theorizes that when there is a greater diversity of hosts, there is a reduction in infection of local tick -borne disease -causing pathogens and would be found in intact woodland ecosystems compared to residential areas. This study by Drs. Scott Williams and Kirby Stafford with the assistance of Megan Linske and focused on blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) host diversity and abundance, and the role they play in tick -borne pathogen amplification or dilution in residential and forested lands in Connecticut . Camera traps were deployed in residential and intact forests and imagery data were analyzed to determine differences in total host encounters, species richness, and diversity at our study sites. Sherman live t raps were utilized to live capture white- footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus ), the primary reservoir host for B. burgdorferi . We documented the number of captured mice, numbers of juvenile ticks feeding on mice, and antibody presence to B. burgdorferi in mous e blood. There were significantly more encounters with hosts and a higher diversity of hosts in residential areas as compared to woodlands . There was the same abundance of white- footed mice between the two habitat types, but more than half the number of t icks feeding on mice in residential settings . Additionally, there were significantly fewer B. burgdorferi -infected mice in residential areas. So while dilution theory suggests increased diversity of hosts dilutes pathogen presence in intact woodland settings, it is in fact the abundance of encounters that explains dilution of pathogens in residential settings. 139 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact: While in the past dilution theory may have been used as a justification to limit habitat fragmentation, habitat fragmentation does not necessary equate to habitat loss. In an urbanized state dominated by mature forest stands like Connecticut, residential ecosystems provide a higher diversity of habitat types and therefore, more abundant wildlife than in woodlands . Encouraging habitat div ersity in residential areas will ultimately lead to fewer encounters with tick -borne pathogens and potentially save millions of dollars in medical costs and improve public health. New Crops Program Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers during a time of changing agriculture in Connecticut. Today, about 11,000 acres on 733 farms in Connecticut are devoted to vegetable production with a cash value of 30.2 million dollars. This compares to 19.1 million dollars from 582 farms in 2002. Seventy -nine percent of these farms are less than 100 acres in size; sixty -three percent are less than 50 acres in size. With numerous small farms, there is a need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. In addition, small farm sizes in Connecticut have resulted in marketing shifts from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 313 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms, where a variety of fruit, vegeta bles, nursery stock, and Christmas trees are offered. About 36 of these are open all year. Nearly 20% of these farms offer pick - your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of harvest labor. These savings are passed on to the consumer. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 140 The developme nt of a network of farmers' markets in Connecticut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' markets must be \"Connecticut Grown.\" Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonable prices to urbanites who cannot travel to the farms. Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups are generally sold at these markets. According to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, there were 129 farmers' markets in 2016, attended by over 400 farmers compared to 87 markets in 2007, a 48% increase. As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connecticut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. Consumers used to a wide variet y of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands. A recent survey of vegetable growers by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station showed that over 70 vegetable crops are currently being grown in Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers since 1982. Over 50 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 publications. Results have been, and continue to be, communicated to growers at meetings and farm visits. Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include globe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos. Research included cultivar trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut. Crops that were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. Kabocha Trials: Kabocha is a generic term for squash in Japan, but in North America, kabocha is a specific type of winter squash. It has a hard, dull, bumpy , dark green shell marked wi th pale, celery green striations. Round with a flattened top, it ranges from one to eight pounds, but generally averages two to three pounds. It has a brilliant yellow -orange flesh with a naturally sweet flavor and texture similar to pumpkin and sweet pota to. Kabocha is harvested when immature with dry, bland -tasting, pale yellow flesh. It must be ripened for about 6- 12 weeks after it is harvested in order to enhance sweetness and maturity with a bright orange color. Two cultivars of kabocha were included i n our winter squash trials in 1997- 1998 but there are now over 20 cultivars on the market including both regular and new smaller (1 lb) personal -sized types. In 2016, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars of kabocha squash at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Included in the trials were 7 short -vined and 3 long -vined varieties as well as 3 personal -sized varieties. Impact: Averaging both sites, Eclipse (11.9 lb/plant) produced the greatest yields followed by Sweet Mama (10.8 lb/plant) and Winter Sweet (8.4 lb/plant). Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields 141 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 and grower profits. By growing Eclipse (11.9 lb/plant) i nstead of Space Station (3.6 lb/plant), the grower can produce 60,258 more pounds per acre. At a retail price of $0.69/lb, the grower can gross almost $42,000 more per acre by growing Eclipse. The long -term benefits of growing kabocha squash include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers' markets or have their own roadside stands. Almost half of all vegetable growers in Connecticut grow winter squash. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Department of Agriculture survey noted that sweet potato is one of the most popular specialty vegetables. In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C. North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading US producers where they are grown in hilled soi l, but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut. Since they have a long growing season and thrive in warm soil, they have always been grown in the Northeast with black plastic mulch. However, black plastic mulch and hilling the soil incre ases both the labor and the cost per acre of producing the crop. In 2016, Dr. Maynard evaluated the effect of different cultural treatments on the yield and quality of sweet potatoes. There were 4 treatments: black plastic/flat soil, black plastic/hilled soil, no mulch/flat soil, and no mulch/hilled soil. Impact: The greatest yields were from plots amended with black plastic mulch (4.2 lbs/plant) compared to bare soil plots (3.8 lbs/plant). Hilled plots averaged 4.2 lbs/plant compared to 3.2 lbs/plant from flat soil plots. However, the flat soil plots (both plastic and bare soil) were decimated by deer and had to resprout. Therefore, it is hard to draw any conclusions from the data. The long -term benefits of growing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. About 43% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow sweet potatoes. Okra Trials: Okra is grown for its long pointed seed pods, which are used in gumbos and soups. It is best picked when the pods are young and immature or about 2- 4 inches long. It is considered a delicacy in the southern United States particularly when breaded with cor n meal and deep fried. It is in the same family as cotton, hollyhocks, and hibiscus which make s it a nice ornamental plant as well. Okra plants are extremely drought resistant which makes it a popular vegetable in countries with difficult growing conditions. It grows best in hot weather with warm soils so that yields are usually increased when grown with black plastic mulch in the Northeast. In 2016, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars of okra at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. In additi on, the crop was grown with and without black plastic mulch to determine whether the expected increased yields utilizing the black plastic mulch is enough to offset the added expense of the plastic. Impact: Averaging both sites and both treatments, Jamba laya (100 pods/plant), Annie Oakley II (100 pods/plant), and Emerald Green (99 pods/plant) had the greatest yields. Yields from the black plastic amended plots averaged 64% greater when compared to plots with no plastic. Cultivar selection and cultural con ditions can dramatically increase yields and grower profits. By growing the cultivar Jambalaya (100 pods/plant) instead of the cultivar Red Burgundy (74 pods/plant), the grower can produce 26 more pods/plant or almost 252,000 more pods/acre. At a retail pr ice of $2.99/12 pods (6 oz), the grower can gross almost $63,000 more per acre by growing Jambalaya. In addition, by growing the crop on black plastic instead of bare soil, the grower can produce an average of 42 more pods/plant or 407,000 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 142 more pods/acre. At a retail price of $2.99/12 pods (6 oz), the grower can gross over $101,000 more per acre by utilizing black plastic. The long -term benefits of growing okra include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers' markets or have their o wn roadside stands. About 35% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow okra. Brussels Sprouts Trials: Brussels sprouts are related to other better - known vegetables in the mustard family including broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Typically, it is grown as an annual and the axillary buds, which resemble miniature cabbages, are harvested either by hand with several harvests of 5 -15 sprouts, or by cutting the entire stalk at once for processing. Each stalk can produce about 2 lbs per stalk. Brussels sprout s grow best in temperature ranges of 45 - 75oF with the highest yields at 60 - 65oF. Quality does not decrease from freezing, and, in fact, sprouts are considered to be sweetest after a frost. Sprouts that develop in hot weather often do not form compact heads and can be bitter. In 2016, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of ten cultivars of Brussels sprouts at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. In addition, the crop was grown with and without black plastic mulch. Black plastic mulch controls weeds. However, a s Brussels sprouts are cool-loving plants and black plastic raises the soil temperature, it is important to determine the effect of plasticulture on the yield and quality of marketable sprouts in Connecticut . Impact: Last year, Jade Cross E (2.1 lbs/plant) and Dimetri (2.0 lbs/plant) averaged the greatest yields. Cultivar selection can dramatically increase yields and grower profits. By growing the cultivar Jade Cross E (2.1 lbs/plant) instead of the cultivar Churchil l (1.3 lbs/plant), the grower can produce almost 8,000 more pounds per acre of Brussels sprouts. At a retail price of $5.28/lb, the grower can gross almost $41,000 more per acre by growing Jade Cross E. In addition, by growing the crop on black plastic ins tead of bare soil, the grower can increase yields by an average of 11%. The long- term benefits of growing Brussels sprouts include providing a product that has growing consumer demand and additional revenue for growers who attend farmers' markets or have t heir own roadside stands. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume Brussels sprouts. About 30% of vegetable growers in Connecticut grow Brussels sprouts. Pawpaw Trials: Pawpaws are shrubby trees that are native to the temperate wood lands of the eastern United States. The American Indian is credited with spreading pawpaws across the eastern U.S. to eastern Kansas and Texas, and from the Great Lakes almost to the Gulf. They are woodland understory plants that need shade to protect the seedlings but once established prefer full sun. They produce maroon, upside -down flowers which are self -incompatible, requiring cross pollination from another unrelated pawpaw tree. They are not pollinated by bees but by flies and beetles. The pawpaw is the largest edible fruit native to America. Individual fruits weigh 5 to 16 ounces and are 3 to 6 inches in length. The tasty fruit has a smooth, custard texture. In this trial, 4 cultivars of pawpaws were planted in 2002. Since 2013, annual yields were reco rded from each tree . 143 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact: Thus far, the cultivars Rebecca's Gold and Overleese have averaged the greatest yields (57 and 41 fruit/tree, respectively) with Sunflower producing the largest fruit (7.2 oz/fruit). Pawpaws are an ideal fruit for Connecticut growers who attend farmers' markets or have their own roadside stands as they are very delicate and difficult to ship long distances. The long- term benefits of growing pawpaws in clude an additional product and revenue for growers. Sheet Composting of Oak and Maple Leaves Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer undecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow the leaves under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorgani sms involved in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used i n a sheet composting operation. This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predominance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr. Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended w ith either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994- 2015 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. In 2016, the greatest squash yields were from the unamended control plots (7.4 lbs/plant) followed by plots amended with maple leaves (5.4 lbs/plant) and plots amended with oak leaves (4.8 lbs/plant). For peppers, the greatest yields were from Pawpaws are a delicious native fruit tree that can be grown in Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 144 the unamended control plots (6.3 lbs/plant) compared to 5.7 lbs/plant from plots amended with oak lea ves and 5.6 lbs/plant from plots amended with maple leaves. Average yields of 12 different vegetable crops over 22 years show no significant differences between the treatments. Impact: Many Connecticut homeowners are now disposing of their oak and maple leaves in their gardens without worrying about any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens. Incorporating tree leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the soil and reducing the volume of material in the solid wast e collection and disposal system. 145 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Studies with Nanoparticles for Root Disease Management Nanoparticles (NP) of metalloid and metallic oxides (< 100 nm) have great potential in agriculture as a means to deliver micronutrients such as B, Cu, Mn, and Zn. Not only are these elements essential for normal plant growth, they play pivotal roles in root health by ac tivating important enzyme systems such as those of phenol metabolism . Since B, Cu, Mn, and Zn have poor intraplant mobility and poor availability in neutral soils, we explored the use of foliar sprays of NP to nourish susceptible root systems and protect against soilborne disease . Dr. Elmer has conducted a series of greenhouse and field trials on asparagus, chrysanthemum, eggplant, pumpkin, soybean, strawberry and watermelon . While NP performance varied across all studies, we observed that NP CuO was more consistently associated with increases in growth and yield of plants, regardless of the plant or disease status. Compared to untreated controls, when plants were treated with NP of CuO, asparagus roots had a 174% reduction in root disease, chrysanthemum had an increase in plant height, eggplant had increase yield and growth in soil infested with Verticillium dahliae, strawberry plants were larger, watermelons produced a mean 53% increase in fruit yield . Additional experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 combining NP of CuO, MnO, and ZnO . We discovered that when all three NP were combined, the performance was superior to any one alone (Figure 1) . Analysis of gene expression (by RT-qPCR) in watermelon revealed strong up -regulation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO ) and pathogenic related (PR1) genes when NP CuO and F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum were both present . These enzyme systems are likely responsible for the improved disease resistance. Impact : These studies show benefits of the use of NP in plant disease management . Information on how NP micronutrients might affect root pathogens is new and novel . NP might be an alternative to pesticides. Winegrapes in Connecticut In cooperative involvement with the USDA/CSREES project, \"NE -1020, Multi Ferrandino is continuing the project, \"Coordinated wine grape variety evaluations in the eastern USA,\" which was initiated by Dr. Nail in 2008. Due to the h igh mortality rate over 7 years (> 75 %) of cold -sensitive vinifera varieties (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zweigelt, Dornfelder, and others), the number of cultivars newly planted and standing at Lockwood Farm have been reduced from 27 to 12. Cold- hardy hybrid cultivars (Frontenac, Marquette, Saint Croix, Corot Noir, Chambourcin, Vidal, and La Crescent) are also planted at the Valley Laboratory (Windsor , CT) and Griswold Research Center (Griswold , CT). The performance of these cultivars at these three locations will provide information on the effect of climate variation on growth, yield, and disease susceptibility. Watermelon plants inoculated with the Fusarium wilt fungus. (Left) Untreated, (Right) NP of CuO. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 146 Vineyard at Lockwood Farm in Hamden , CT. Impact: Growers are informed as to the relative merits of winegrape cultivars before planting . The planting of a vineyard requires a large investment ($3,000/acre) with no expected return for at least 3 years . Thus the choice of a suitable cultivar is critical to the eventual success of such an enterprise. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his work on 3D Lagrangian Stochastic Simulation for turbulent flows in hedgerow canopies in collaboration with Dr. D onald E. Aylor . These simulations are programmed in Microsoft Vis ual Studio . The verification of such models requires direct measurement of turbulent wind statistics. 3D-sonic anemometers are deployed in the vineyard to collect this information. 3D-sonic anemometers measure wind information in a Pinot Gris vineyard at Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT. Impact : Improved models of spore dispersal enable better predictions of the spread of disease. Since 2009, Dr. Ferrandino has maintained three remote sensing weather stations located on the CAES research farms (Hamden, CT; Windsor, CT; and Griswold, CT). Weather data from the three CAES experimental farms is available at: https://www.hobolink.com/s/d06963137 15dd96f86b25f3552cc1f47 . This link is available on the CAES website . Each weather station measures temperature, relative humidity, sunlight, wind speed and direction, rainfall, leaf wetness , and soil temperature every 15 minutes . The data are sent back to a central location once per hour where it is accessible via the Internet . The resultant data are used to calculate disease risk assessment reports, which are made available to 147 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 growers via Internet postings and direct Email alerts. On-site weather station data are used to calculate disease risk assessments, which are delivered to the winegrape growers on a weekly basis. Early in the season, disease risk assessments are also used in conjunction with scouting of each vineyard to assess inoculum levels that are critical for primary infections. Impact: Growers are alerted when disease risk is high . Early fungicide sprays are more efficacious and may reduce the need for later applications reducing overall use of chemicals. Dr. Ferrandino is called upon by growers to identify problems found in their fields . Due to cold, wet weather in early spring, Phomopsis blight was a problem for growers. Phomopsis Blight results in purple lenticular lesions on leaves and stems. When numerous enough, these lesions can girdle and kill young stems. Impact: Growers are quickly informed as to the cause of a problem . In this way appropriate action can be taken. Quantifying Uncertainty in Tomography- Based Estimates of C in Living Northern Hardwoods Dr. Marra's National Science Foundation- funded project demonstrated that sonic and electrical resistance tomography (SoT and ERT, respectively) can be used successfully to nondestructively assess the extent and magnitude of internal decay in living trees. This project also allowed Dr. Marra to develop a methodology based on tomographic data for estimating the amount of C in the lower boles of trees; current assessments of the role that forests play in sequestering atmospheric C assume that trees are solid tapering cyli nders of wood; i.e., they do not take into account the role of internal decay in reducing estimates of sequestered C. Dr. Marra's methodology incorporates data on internal decay and cavities to produce remarkably accurate estimates of C content. As with m any areas of forest ecosystem studies, these C estimates are essentially based on allometric equations, as they are derived indirectly from tomographic data as well as C density metrics associated with these tomographic data . Therefore, Dr. Marra has been working towards a method for quantifying uncertainty in the data generated by this study, and has been participating in the QUEST (Quantifying Uncertainty in Ecosystem Studies) research network. Sources of uncertainty so far identified include lower bole v olume estimates (due to error in cross -sectional areas), as well as uncertainty in the model itself . To quantify the uncertainty associated with each of these sources of errors, Dr. Marra has used Monte Carlo propagation, replicating calculations that incorporate error rates associated with these sources of error. The analyses have shown that error in bole volume estimates contributes approximately 5% uncertainty in C content estimates based on tomography, while error in C density estimates contribute The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 148 less than 0.5% . Finally, there is approximate 8% uncertainty associated with the regression equation used to estimate C content based on tomography. A sugar maple and the associated sonic (SoT) and electrical resistance (ERT) tomographs. In SoT, brown- green -magenta -blue represents decreasing wood densities. In ERT, red- yellow -blue represents decreasing electrical resistance. Impact : As forests are increasingly looked upon to sequester and store atmospheric carbon, it is essential that all components of carbon cycling be considered in the carbon balance models that are used to assess and quantify the role of forests in carbon sequestration. The results of this project will constitute an important first step in Dr. Marra's long -term goals of addressing the se critical missing components, and contributing data that will be relevant to other ecologists and carbon balance modelers. Pending the successful procurement of additional research funds, Dr. Marra's methodology will be applied at larger scales in northern hardwood forests, and will also be applied to longer -term (5 -, 10-, 15-year) studies that will constitute the first inquiry into rates of internal decay at these scales. Using Tomography to Nondestructively Assess the Impact of Perennial Injections for Treatment of Dutch Elm Disease on Internal Decay The native American Elm, with its unique umbrella -like canopy, is the iconic tree of streets and parks of the American landscape. For nearly a century, the American Elm has been decimated by Dutch elm disease (DED), caused by the invasive fungal pathogen, Ophiostoma novo -ulmi, which is spread by both elm bark beetles (also invasive) and by intraspecific root grafts, further propitiated by the traditional monocultural planting of this magnificent tree. The m ost effective treatment of DED has been through the delivery of fungicides, principally as prophylactics, via multiple injections around the perimeter of the trunk, administered through small (~1/4\") holes drilled through the bark and into the conducting t issue (the xylem) . Effective control via this treatment regime requires that these injections be repeated once every one to three years. Although the trunk- root interface is physiologically prone to rapid compartmentalization and healing around holes such as those drilled for these injections, the holes still represent a potential entry point for a variety of wood -decaying fungi and bacteria . However, no research to date has been done to determine if elms undergoing regular (every 1- 3 years) injections have a higher 149 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 incidence and severity of internal decay relative to those that do not receive injections. Dr. Marra and his collaborator on this project, Dr. Nicholas Brazee (University of Massachusetts Amherst), have undertaken a three- year study using sonic a nd electrical -resistance tomography to nondestructively examine elms that have been undergoing regular fungicide injections for treatment of DED, and to compare these elms to elms that have not received injections. Elms in this latter category are typicall y maintained through vigilant scouting for early signs of elm bark beetles and DED, followed by aggressive pruning and other strategies for maximizing the trees' health and vigor. Fungicide injections for treatment of Dutch elm disease involve the pumpi ng of many gallons of fungicide solution into the conducting tissue (the xylem) through \u00bc\" holes; the volume is determined by the tree's diameter and height . This American elm, is one of 12 on Governors Island, New York City, that Dr. Marra scanned tomogra phically. While this project is still underway, to date Drs. Marra and Brazee have performed tomographic scans on 148 elms in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York City (Governors Island), and the National Mall of Washington, D.C. Of these, 80 trees have been receiving fungicide injections, and 68 have not. The elms of the National Mall are of particular significance to this study because fungicide injections have not been used; the National Park Service has instead opted for scouting, pruning, and, in case s of severe infection, replacement . Preliminary results show only a small difference in the incidence of decay between the two groups: 33% of the injected elms, compared to 28% of t he non- injected elms, harbored some degree of internal decay. Impact: As American elms of the urban landscape continue to mature, their continued survival despite the onslaught of Dutch elm disease will be via aggressive management regimens that include routine trunk injections. The consequences of these repeated injections are not well- understood, and management decisions are so far uninformed by the potential consequences of injections vis- \u00e0-vis internal decay . This The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 150 work should facilitate those responsible for the care of these trees to make and advise more informed decisions, especially in the case of trees shown by tomography to have advanced stages of decay . Dr. Marra measuring the geometry at the base of an American elm, in preparation for tomography. Governors Island, New York. Neonectria Canker caused by Neonectria ditissima (prev. Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) continues to be researched by Dr. Marra. This research focuses on the ecology and genetics of the causal agent of perennial target canker, the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima . The goal of this research is to gain a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, population dynamics, and host -interactions of N. ditissima , particularly with respect to its princip al hosts, black and yellow birch ( Betula lenta and B. alleghaniensis ). Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an essential component to effective management strategies. Dr. Marra has developed the field techniques and laboratory tools necessary to the study of this fungus and the disease it causes, and has used these tools and methods to examine the relationship between mating system and genetic structure. Previously, Dr. Marra developed and used a set of 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers to study mating and genetic differentiation in N. ditissima from two nearly adjacent sites at West Rock Ridge State Park in New Haven, CT . This study revealed a paradoxical juxtaposition of high levels of genetic diversity alongside high levels of selfing and biparental inbreeding. The results confirm an earlier hypothesis that N. ditissima has a \"mixed mat ing system\" (selfing and outcrossing occurring in the same population). In order to test the hypothesis that these obse rvations of selfing are possibly the result of high levels of 151 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 biparental inbreeding, we continue the process of evaluating putatively sel f-fertilized sets of progeny using AFLPs . With analysis nearly complete, AFLP data confirm and corroborate conclusions of selfing. Impact: Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although tr ees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer . Our efforts to more fully understand the biology and natural history of N. ditissima is an important contribution in the fields of mycology and evolutionary biology, and will contribute to the identification and utilization of control strategies. An important result of this research is that they are the first to demonstrate, in a fungus, empirical suppor t for theoretical models that posit the importance of biparental inbreeding to the evolutionary stability of mixed mating. Erwinia amylovora and nucleobase transport Erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight in apples and pears - a devastating disease often resulting to localized and extensive crop losses. Like other bacteria, E. amylovora has a panel of membrane localized transporters that import nitrogen rich purines and pyrimidines from the environment - effectively increasing the growth potential. The objectives of the program are: 1) to determining the function and biochemical properties of nucleobase cation symporter 2 (NCS2) transporters from E. amylovora ; 2) determi ne if these transporters can move the toxic purine derivative, 6- thioguanine, that E. amylovora synthesizes and excretes; 3) determine if these transporters contribute to pathogen establishment on the host. We have determined the function of the uracil tra nsporter, guanine - hypoxanthine transporter, adenine transporter and xanthine transporter through heterologous complementation in E. coli strains deficient for endogenous nucleobase transporters. Only the guanine - hypoxanthine transporter is capable of trans porting 6 -thioguanine. Currently we are constructing E. amylovora strains that are deficient in the four above mentioned nucleobase transporters and determining if they are involved in disease establishment in the host. The research is conducted by Dr. Nei l Schultes and a colleague Dr. George Mourad at the Dept. of Biology at Indiana University -Purdue University , Ft. Wayne, IN. Impact: Comprehending how utilizes the nucleobase derivative - 6 thio- guanine - in disease establishment will co ntribute to devising new strategies for fire blight control. Investigating the role of the Xanthomonas effector AvrRxo1 as a toxin -antitoxin system Drs. Triplett and Shidore, along with collaborators at Colorado State University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute have discovered that Xanthomonas pathogens, including those causing bacterial spot of tomato and pepper in Connecticut, secrete a previously unk nown type of protein toxin that can alter central metabolism in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Dr. Triplett demonstrated that the toxin is a new type of universal \"poison\" that directly alters a central metabolite in plants. This year's work showed that pathogens actually cause this reaction inside host cells to suppress immunity, but that this likely works by changing the oxidative environment inside the cell rather than through toxicity. Impact: This finding greatly expands our understanding of the ways in which bacteria can directly harm both plant and human hosts. This family of toxic proteins targets rapidly growing cells, and has been investigated toward harnessing its antibacterial and antifungal potential, but was never previously shown to be a weapon in pathogenesis. The characterization of this new type of bacterial toxin will help us find new strategies to fight disease, and the toxin may also have uses in biomedical and synthetic biology research. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 152 The contribution of toxin- antitoxin systems to bac terial plant disease Drs. Lindsay Triplett and Quan Zeng have been identifying the roles of numerous different toxin- antitoxin systems in bacterial plant disease. Several factors such as lifestyle and taxonomic group that are associated with enrichment of these toxins have been identified, which has helped us understand their potential roles in nature. This year , we have also begun deleting and re -introducing these systems into the fire blight promising biocontrol strain Pseu domonas fluorescens to determine whether the systems aid in survival to antibiotics or in the plant environment . Impact: In addition to being virulence factors, toxin- antitoxin systems are thought to play a major role in bacterial survival of antibiotics and survival in the host, making it difficult to eradicate disease in an area. Discovering which ones are important will tell us which ones to target for disease control strategies, and which ones could be used to improve biocontrol strains for better surv ival. Identification of a novel Xanthomonas disease resistance mechanism shared by rice and tomato Drs. Lindsay Triplett along with collaborators at Yale and Cornell University have initiated a project to map the genetic location of a new type of resistance gene in rice that is triggered by a type of protein found in diverse bacteria. The location of the gene was identified, yielding a handful of promising gene candidates. This year, we found an interaction between one of the candidate resistance genes an d the pathogen protein, which suggests that the interaction may be important for resistance. We are currently working toward detecting the interaction in plants. Impact: This is the first effective genetic resistance against a pathogen that causes up to $ 1 billion in annual yield loss in West African rice, and has been labeled a security threat to US rice. The resistance gene is a novel type of resistance found in both monocot and dicot plants, and it is triggered by a protein found in 60% of Xanthomonas and many Ralstonia plant pathogens. Once the mechanism of resistance is identified, it could be harnessed for resistance against a wide variety of crop diseases. Monitor and prevent streptomycin resistance in Fire Blight pathogen populations in New England Fire blight, caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora , is one of the most serious diseases currently limiting apple and pear production in Connecticut and in the United States. Application of antibiotic streptomycin during bloom is by far the only management option available that provides a high level of control efficacy . The intensive, long -term use of streptomycin, however, has resulted in the evolution of streptomycin resistance in E. amylovora. Since the first report in California in 1971, streptomycin resistance has been commonly detected in E. amylovora in most apple -producing regions of the United States, including Washington, Oregon, Michigan, and New York, making streptomycin ineffective in these locations. In 2014, severe fire blight outbreaks occurred throughout Connecticut and New England. Growers suspected that the streptomycin resistance may be present in the New England region . Dr. Zeng assisted by Regan Huntley and funded by the NE -IPM Center has conducted the second year survey of the streptomycin susceptibility in the fire blight pathogen populations in New England. All the isolates tested were susceptible to streptomycin. The streptomycin resistance gene strA-strB was detected in environmental, non- pathogenic bacterial isolates in New England orchards . These results suggest that streptomycin remains an effective management option for fire blight in the New England region , although there is a potential risk of streptomycin resistance development in E. amylovora population in New England orchard in the future, as the strA-strB genes may be able to transfer from the non-pathogenic, environmental bacteria into the fire blight pathogen E. amylovora . Genomes of some of the 153 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 E. amylovora strains have been sequenced . We are currently using genomics and comparative genomic approaches to understand the strain distribution and evolution of virulence factors. Impact: Apples and pears are economically important commodities in the United States and Connecticut and are grown on 142,000 and 24,300 hectares, respectively, with cash receipt values exceeding $2.2 billion and $355 million, respectively. Annual losses to fire blight and costs of contr ol in the United States are estimated at over $100 million. Results from this research will provide valuable information on the use and effectiveness of streptomycin in the New England region. Research findings from this project was highlighted ( http://www.northeastipm.org/about -us/publications/ipm antimicrobials for Fire Blight control Fire blight is a devastating plant disease, in large part due to the limited amount of control options . Current controls used in fire blight management include antibiotics, copper, and biological controls . However, the emergence of antibiotics resistance, inadequate control efficacy of biol ogical controls, as well as the phytotoxicity caused by copper products limit the use of these options and addresses urgent need of developing alternative controls that are effective and sustainable. Antisense antimicrobials are short, synthetic nucleic acid oligomer mimics that contain antisense sequences to the translational initiation site of essential genes of a target pathogen . The binding of the antisense compounds to the translational initiation sites of the essential genes leads to the silencing of these genes and cell death . Compared to antibiotics, antisense antimicrobials have obvious advantage in sustainability, ability to s pecifically target the pathogens, and to overcome resistance. Funded by USDA - AFRI -Exploratory Research, Dr. Zeng is exploring the possibility of using antisense molecules that target the translational initiation sequence of essential genes of the fire blig ht pathogens to inhibit the growth of the fire pathogens and to control fire blight (PNA) molecules that contain antisense sequences to a total of 8 essential genes were tested for the inhibition of the growth of E. A. Typical \"Shep herd's crook \" symptoms of fire blight. B. Locations of s ample collection in 2015. Growth inhibition of E. amylovora caused by \"5acpP\" PNA molecules (at 20 uM and 4uM) compared to the water control. 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 H2O 5acpP-20uM 5acpP-4uMThe Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 154 amylovora . Among these molecules, anti -acpP PNA molecule showed excellent inhibition of the pathogen growth. Detached flower assay also showed that anti -acpP PNA was able to significantly limit the growth of E. amylovora on apple stigmas at the concentration of 100 uM. Using Northern blot analysis, we proved that the anti -acpP PNA specifically inhibit the mRNA of acpP in E. amylovora thus proved that the antimicrobial effect is through the RNA silencing of acpP . The antimicrobial effect of anti-acpP PNA on E. a was determined as bactericidal but not bacteriostatic. Impact: Our research demonstrated the feasibility of using antisense molecules in controlling plant diseases. It not only provides a non- antibiotic management option for fire blight that is urgently needed for the apple and pear industry, most importantly, it also generates valuable data and conditions for the application of this novel technology in management of other important bacterial plant diseases . The research finding is summarized into a jour nal article and is now published on Frontiers in Microbiology . Understand ing disease emergence and pathogen evolution of bacterial etiolation and decline of creeping bentgrass Creeping bentgrass is one of the most commonly used grass species on golf cour se putting greens in the United States. Since 2009, grass decline with symptoms of wilting, necrosis, and etiolation were consistently observed on creeping bentgrass of many golf courses in the \"transition zone\" of the United States. Later the causal agent of this disease was diagnosed as a bacterial pathogen Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae (Aaa) and the disease is named as bacterial etiolation and decline (BED). However, how this disease emerged and spread to different parts of the U.S. was unknown. Dr. Zeng, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Giordano, obtained the first collection of the turfgrass pathogenic Aaa strains from diseased creeping bent grass from 14 states of the U.S . Draft genomes of 14 turfgrass Aaa strains, one maize Aaa strain, and one orchi d Acidovorax strain were sequenced, assembled, and annotated. Our results suggested that the 2009- 2011 outbreak of BED was caused by a genetically diverse group of pathogens belonging to two divergent phylogroups. Putative virulence factors of the turfgras s pathogens were identified . To identify a genetic basis for the host specificity we searched for genes closely related among turfgrass strains but distantly related to their homologues from maize strains. We found a cluster of 11 such genes generated by t hree ancient recombination events within the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) pathogenicity island. Ever since the recombination, the cluster has been conserved by strong purifying selection hinting at its selective importance. Together our analyses suggest that BED is an ancient disease that may owe its host specificity to a highly conserved cluster of 11 T3SS genes. Impact: Golf industry is an important component of the economy in the United States and Connecticut. The total size of Connecticut's golf economy was estimated at $638 million in 2008. Understanding the 155 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 disease emergence of bacterial etiolation and decline will help restrict the spread of this important disease on golf courses and develop effective detect ion and management options. Understanding of the pathogen evolution and disease emergence will also provide valuable information for future disease mitigation. The research findings have been summarized into a research article and it is accepted for publication in Molecular Plant -Microbe Interactions ( https://doi.org/10.1094/MPMI -06-17-0151- R). Characterization of the apple flower microbiome to identify effective biological controls for Fire Blight in eastern U.S. Dr. Zeng has been characterizing the microbial communities (microbiome) on apple flowers. Apple flowers represent the primary infection sites of fire blight . Pathogen friendly ecological conditions on apple flowers are critical for the occurrence of fire blight infection. Apple flowers are the main targets of biological control agents. Despite the importance of apple flowers, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the microbial composition, diversity, abundance on apple flowers . This knowledge gap directly resulted in the lack of biocontrol agents that can provide consistent, high level of protection against fire blight . In this research, we will utilize the pyrosequencing approach to provide an in- depth characterization of flow er microbiome . This information will then support the identification of potential biological control agents against fire blight . In 2016, more than 400 apple flower associated microbes were isolated and tested for their control efficacy against fire blight . Two isolates, BC250 and BC253, displayed significant antagonistic effect against the fire blight pathogen E. amylovora. The investigation of the biocontrol mechanism revealed that these two isolates produce an antimicrobial compound, anthranilic acid, wh ich inhibit s the growth of E. amylovora. Impact: The management of fire blight is challenged by the spread of streptomycin resistance in the pathogen population. While the streptomycin is less useful in fire blight management, alternative control measures have yet been developed . In Connecticut, most growers still heavily rely on the streptomycin spray . This not only puts the growers at the risk of control failure in case of resistance, but also significantly limits the organic tree fruit production in CT, as antibiotics are no longer allowed in organic production after 2014. Thus, effective, environmental friendly options for fire blight control is urgently needed in CT. Understand How Bacteria Pathogens Respond to Host Signals and Modulate Virulence Expression As singles cell organisms, bacteria multiply through asexual replication. A bacterial population formed by genetic replication consists of billions of single cells with identical genetic background. When perceive an environmental signal, these single cells often res pond uniformly by producing a related gene product evenly in each individual cell of the population. However, under certain adverse, fluctuating environments, bacteria sometimes express a gene in a \"non -uniform\" manner in a population. The type III secreti on system (T3SS) is one of the most important virulence factors in Gram -negative bacteria. During the infection in plants, single cells from a clonal bacterial population developed heterogeneity in expressing T3SS: a small proportion of cells highly expres s the T3SS genes, whereas the majority of cells do not express these genes. This type of bacterial population behavior, in which a gene is expressed at two distinct levels in single cells of a clonal population, is defined as bi - stable expression . Because traditional research methods, such as RNA -Seq and Northern/Western blot, only detect the average expression levels of a gene in a population, the heterogeneous gene expression in single cells of a bacterial population during the interaction with plant hosts is poorly understood. Combining single -cell technologies, and genetic and transcriptomic approaches, this project will conduct The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 156 a comprehensive characterization of the T3SS bi -stability in plant pathogenic bacteria from three aspects: 1. How bacteria use bi -stable gene expression to modulate the levels of T3SS when interacting with different plant organs, and various hosts, 2. What mechanism causes the differential expression of T3SS in a clonal bacteria population, and 3. What biological significance the bi-stable expression of T3SS brings to the plant -pathogen interaction. These questions are investigated in two important plant pathogenic bacteria: the fire blight pathogen E. amylovora and soft rot pathogen D. dadantii . Impact : This study will significa ntly advance our knowledge on what additional strategies bacterial pathogens use to modulate the virulence gene expression during plant -pathogen interactions . In addition, this research will be performed in the context of two economically important bacteri a plant diseases, thus findings from this research will also immediately benefit the U.S. agriculture by providing basic knowledge to guide the development of disease management strategies in the future. Disease Survey Dr. Yonghao Li, assisted by Ms. Lindsay Patrick, diagnosed a wide range of fungal, bacterial, viral, nematode, and abiotic diseases on trees, shrubs, flowers, lawn grasses, fruits, and vegetables during 2016 - 2017. The drought stress during the growing season in 2015 and 2016 resulted in many woody ornamentals becoming vulnerable to biotic and abiotic diseases. Dramatic fluctuati ons in winter temperature s contributed to severe physical injuries on trees and shrubs in 2017. Cool and wet spring weather conditions favored many fungal and bacterial diseases on evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs in 2017. Herbaceous and Woody Ornamentals: After a severe epidemic of Volutella blight of pachysandra in 2016, severe diebacks of pachysandra caused by this disease were observed in spring 201 7, which was favored by drought stress during the growing season in 2015 and 2016 and wet weather in the spring of 2017. A wide spread of Phoma stem blight of vinca was reported . Various root rot diseases were found on many annual and perennial flowers, such as Pythium root rot on scaevola, poinsettia, Pelargonium spp. Boxwood blight was continuously problematic in both landscapes and nurseries . Boxwood blight was also found on pachysandra in . Winter injury, Volutella canker , and Macrophoma leaf spot were major caus al agents of severe dieback of boxwood s in landscapes . In Volutella 157 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 rot was found in rooted cuttings of boxwood. Foliar diseases including cedar -apple rust, scab, and frogeye leaf spot were prevalent on crabapple trees. In the spring of 2017, a severe epidemic of trellis rust was observed on ornamental pear, which caused significant defoliation of pear trees in early summer . Gymnosporangium rust diseases were also found on quince, serviceberry, hawthorn, and cedar . Many fungal canker diseases were found on woody ornamentals, such as Hinoki cypress and Leyland cypress. Significant diebacks and browning of needles were noticed statewide, which might be attributed to drought stress and mild winter t emperatures in the past few years. Canavirgella needlecast and Septorioides needle blight might also contribute to browning of needles on white pine trees. It was found that severe mortality of young white pine trees was associated with Botryosphaeria sp., although it needs to be further investigated. In a Christmas tree farm, Delphinella shoot blight was found on concolor fir on spruce. Phytophthora root rot was detected on Fra ser fir in many Christmas tree farms. Pestalotiopsis needle blight was prevalent in arborvitae, which might be associated with drought stress and winter injury on the trees. Vegetables: Stemphylium gray leaf spot was found in greenhouse -grown tomato plants . Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot, early blight, Verticillium wilt, and blossom -end rot were common diseases in garden - and field- grown tomatoes . Bacterial pith necrosis was found in several commercial production tomato fields . On peppers, bacterial leaf spot, blight were problematic . Powdery mildew, anthracnose, bacterial wilt, and bacterial angular leaf spot were major disease problems on cucurbit crops . Septoria leaf and fruit spot of pumpkin was found in a farm . Basil downy mildew was found in late summer. Mortality of white pine. Delphinella shoot blight of concolor fir. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 158 Tree and Small Fruit: Cedar -apple rust, scab, frogeye leaf spot, and black rot were prevalent on apple trees. On pear trees, rust, Phoma leaf spot, and Fabraea leaf spot were found . Leaf curl and brown rot continued to be major diseases on peach . Black knot and winter injury caused significant diebacks on cherry trees. Rust was frequently detected on fig trees. Black rot, powdery mildew, and anthracnose were commonly found on grapevines. Phomopsis canker, Botryosphaeria canker, . Botrytis blight wa s found on raspberry. Turf: Slime mold was prevalent in the early summer of 2017 because of wet weather conditions and higher relative humidity . Brown patch, summer patch, red thread, anthracnose, and rust were common diseases of lawn grasses. Many cases of Pythium blight, Drechslera leaf spot, and Bipolaris leaf spot were found in lawns that were frequently irrigated and over -fertilized. Apple scab. Black rot of grape. Stemphylium gray leaf spot of tomato. Bacterial leaf spot of tomato. 159 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Weeds: Poison ivy remained a significant problem in residential properties . Running bamboo continued to be a topic of increasing public concern because it is difficult to control and has the potential for causing problems between neighbors . Crabgrass, ann ual blue grass, bittercress, ground ivy, nutsedge, purslane, red sorrel, wild garlic, and wild violets were major weed problems in turf grasses. Oriental bittersweet, Asiatic dayflower, grass, and sumac were common weed problems in lawns, gardens, or crop fields. Impact: Information from disease survey s in Connecticut landscapes, greenhouses, nurseries, vegetable fields, orchards, natural woodlots, forests, and home properties each year helps to monitor and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activ ities. Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at meetings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In Cooperation w ith the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds are collected by inspectors from the Bureau of Regulation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agr iculture and submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, the official seed testing laboratory for Connecticut . In 2017, 279 vegetable, 5 lawn, and 6 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Li for testing . Pamela Sletten and Lindsay Patrick performed the germination and purity analyses that are required for compliance with Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act for all seed samples by following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts . Vegetable seeds are tested for germination . As of the date of this report, tests for 254 of the 279 vegetable seed samples were completed and 12 of the tested seed samples failed label claims for germination . Lawn seeds are tested for both germination and purity . Four of the five lawn seed samples tested met label claims for purity and all five lawn seed samples passed the germination claims. Crop seeds are also tested for both germination and purity. All six crop seed samples tested passed label claims f or purity . One of the 6 crop seed samples Slime mold on lawn grass. Bipolaris leaf spot of lawn grass. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 160 failed to meet the germination claim. A Station Technical Bulletin will be written to report the findings of this year's results. Impact: The r esults of the seed test ing conducted by Station staff are reported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of products that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds . In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act . The long- term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the unintentional introduction of noxious weed seeds that could potentially impact crops of e conomic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Li and Ms. Patrick examined 42 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the Experiment Station. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Dr. Li, assisted by Ms. Patrick, answered 3,970 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizens. Although the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (69%), other categories, such as food crops (12%) and turf grasses (4%), were also well represented. A moderate percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (15%), which included identifi cation of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health and environmental concerns. The majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (61%), and commercial growers and plant care professionals (34%). Five percent of inquiries were from cooperative extension, health, news, agricultural personnel, and other. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 32% of the questions came in by phone, 14% came in by mai l, 12% came as email, and 42% were brought in person. The number of physical samples handled by the PDIO (56%) continued to exceed the number of phone calls and emails (44%). 1,018 letters and email messages with attached files of fact sheets were sent fro m the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters, since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. 161 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 VALLEY LABORATORY Scientists at the Valley Laboratory conduct research on insects, diseases, soil nutrition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut . The Valley Laboratory, located in Windsor, was originally established by the Board of Control in 1921 to conduct t obacco research . While research on tobacco continues today, the research mission has expanded to reflect the diverse agriculture present in the state. Scientists and staff also diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility, conduct outreach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist students. Activities on the Farm There were a total of 60 experimental plots at the Windsor research farm during the past year . Four Windsor -based scientists had 34 of these plots; five New Haven -based scientists were using 13 plots. The remaining plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection . Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experime nts in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields, the Lock wood and Griswold farms and in s tate forests . Valley Laboratory Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and equipment ready and in excellent shape . He expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specific needs of each scientist . He and his summer research assistants did an outstanding job maintaining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory 's effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pesticides and organized and conducted safety and pesticide training sessions for the staff. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Research Biological control using imported predators of Adelges tsugae , the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) , is a major long -term national strategy for reducing the impact and spread of this damaging and invasive insect , which threatens the entire range of eastern and arolina hemlocks. Sasajiscymnus tsugae (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), originating and studied at the CAES , is one of the first biological control agents released for HWA management in the US and the only major species released in Connecticut . From 1995 -2007, > 176,000 S. tsugae were mass- reared and released in 26 state forest and parks, municipal, water company and private forest sites throughout Connecticut . Encouraging results of hemlock recovery from HWA damage in Connecticut were recorded from 2005 -2009 in > 75% of sites with S. tsugae releases. The overall goals of this project are to integrate established and new approaches, into (1) an overall current assessment of the health of forest hemlocks in Connecticut, 30 years after the arrival of HWA, (2) to improve the understanding of the role of climate and biological control of HWA with the introduced adelgid predator, S. tsugae . S. tsugae remains the only biological control agent for HWA available commercially due t o the cap ability of large -scale laboratory rearing . Current assessments are evaluating the implementation of S. tsugae to manage HWA infestations as an important and economical option for public and private stakeholders who cannot or do not want to use chemicals for controlling HWA . These assessments quantify predation of HWA under hot , humid summer conditions. Impacts: Assessments of the field efficacy of S. tsugae as a biological control agent documented many advantageous attributes in 2016- 2017: Bivolti ne S. tsugae are effective predators which target late sistens and resurgent summer progrediens HWA, and also uniquely feed on dormant HWA N1 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 162 settlers of the subsequent sistens generation . This results in a long season predation impact on HWA from spring t o fall. During the hottest year of 2016, S. tsugae was voracious in attacking and reproducing on the HWA progrediens generation in June during extreme heat. Larvae also predate on the HWA progrediens . Mature S. tsugae adults further consumed > 1200 HWA sis tens N1 each from July to late October 2016 when summer temperatures routinely exceeded 30 \u00b0C . Projected summer to fall predation of 5,000 adult S. tsugae = 6 million HWA! While unpredictable winters with high winter kill of HWA decimate prey for specialis t HWA winter predators, S. tsugae can be implemented in late winter -early spring for biological control to reduce at least 2 generations of HWA during late spring into early fall . S. tsugae is able to survive the increasingly hot summers and fall, adapting to the changing climate in Connecticut. This species is commercially available and should be released after extreme winters. Adult and first instar larval S. tsugae feeding on dormant first instar HWA . A series of extreme winters from 2014 -2016 reduced HWA populations statewide to the lowest levels in decades but pockets of HWA resurgence were detected after a mild winter in 2017 . It is vitally important to manage HWA before outbreaks of this pest build again . The biological control of HWA progra m in Connecticut was expanded in June 2017 in cooperation with Tree - Savers, LLC, Greentown, PA through a donation of 2,000 S. tsugae beetles to manage emerging HWA infestations at 7 new sites and augmentation at a 2016 new site with the assistance of state, municipal, and private foresters, and volunteers from the Friends of American Legion and People's State Forest. Jayme Boniewicz, Director, and staff of Tree- Savers, PA and donated S. tsugae beetles. 163 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 In June 2017, with the help of state and private foresters, land trust staff and volunteers, releases of 2,000 S. tsugae were implemented at 4 state forests: American Legion State Forest (Barkhamsted), Pachaug State Forest (Voluntown), Nassahegon State For est including the Burlington Fish Hatchery (Burlington), and Algonquin State Forest (Colebrook); 2 private forest preserves at the Mine Hill Preserve, Roxbury and at Great Mountain Forest, Norfolk and Canaan, and at Webb Mountain Park in Monroe, to protect important hemlock watersheds, wildlife habitat, ecosystems and recreational areas for the benefit of all Connecticut's citizens. These new sites will also be used for field research to follow S. tsugae establishment, impact on emerging HWA populations and predator winter survival in Connecticut in a changing climate.

Drought and Elongate Hemlock Scale Impacts on Connecticut's Hemlocks Surveys in 2016- 2017 showed that eastern hemlocks in some marginal release sites exhibited decline on northw est and northeast ridges, due to heavy EHS infestations, in either single or joint infestations with HWA. But as HWA levels have been significantly d epressed due to 3 winters, the decline is mostly due to EHS buildup and subsequent needle loss. Recent severe winters have not greatly reduced elongate hemlock scale (EHS) Fiorinia externa infestations. The scale has continued to encroach on high elevatio n hemlock stands in northwestern CT. However, the most severe and prolonged drought since 1964- 66, together with heavy EHS infestations at some sites resulted in rapid tree decline and thin hemlock crowns, especially in marginal sites on stressed ridge top s in the northern half of the state. Many perennial and feeder streams were dried up in the fall of 2016 and winter of 2017. Extensive needle drop of scale- infested foliage in 2017 has also resulted in a drop in EHS levels in some sites. Hemlock crown heal th ratings were completed in the fall of 2016 into spring 2017 at 15 of Connecticut's S. tsugae release sites 10 -20 years post release, and at 6 former baseline sites at high elevation, which had previously had negligible adelgid and/or EHS infestations. H WA infestations throughout Connecticut in 2016- 2017 continue to be at the lowest levels in 16 years, due to the heavy winter kill, except for protected pockets and some urban areas, coastal and eastern forests, which had more snow cover. Of the 15 release sites evaluated, 46% were still in fair to good condition in spite of the statewide drought . Hemlock decline exacerbated by severe The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 166 drought impacts was recorded in 33% of the sites, hemlock borer outbreaks at 20% of the sites, all ridgetops and detected in 33% of the sites monitored. The drought in Connecticut was officially ended in April 2017, heavy rains and cool temperatures have favored dramatic hemlock refoliation and recovery statewide, which is being monitored. Dry st ream beds and thinning heml ocks due to extreme 2016 drought in northern Litchfield and Hartford Counties, CT . Needle drop with heavy EHS infestations in East Hartland. Concurrently, incidences of hemlock mortality due to the secondary native pest, the hemlock borer, Melanophi la fulvoguttata, were recorded during site data collection. Hemlock borer tree mortality near trails statewide is being mapped with the help of volunteers from the public. Hazard trees in recreation areas are being communicated to forest and park managers for removal for public safety. 167 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Hemlock mortality due to hemlock borer infestations in northern Connecticut . Implementation of Biological Control of Mile -a-Minute Weed in Connecticut Mile -a-minute weed, Persicaria perfoliata, (MAM) originates from Asia, was first discovered in eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as a serious invasive weed in Connecticut . Infestations are found in 14 eastern states from North Carolina to Ohio and the first record of MAM in Connecticut w as in Greenwich in 1997, later confirmed in 2000. To date in Connecticut, 45 towns have confirmed reports of MAM, though some have only limited reports of a few plants , which have since been removed. This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thickets which overwhelm and displace native vegetation and reduces plant diversity . An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), imported from central China, has been successfully reared and released for biological control of this invasive species in the Mid -Atlantic and southern New England states. Releases of R. latipes began in 2009 in Connecticut, and over 52,000 weevils have been released in 21 towns as of June 2017, with a new release in the town of Glastonbury and augmentation in the town of Sprague. This project has documented the continued successful establishment and wide spread of this phytophagous species in southern New England. This project is a collaboration between the CAES and Donna Ellis, Senior Extension Educator at the University of Connecticut and is funded by USDA APHIS PPQ, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory. Many volunteers and cooperators from the private sector work together with our team, other state, town and federal officials in a team effort to implement MAM biological control to limit the spread of MAM . Dr. Cheah and Donna Ellis have participated in the releases and monitoring of all the release sites since 2009. Emmett Varricchio, summer research assistant at the Valley Laboratory, has been hired for a third year to conduct GIS mapping, release weevils and scout MAM and weevil dispersal and abundance, distribution and spread in the st ate.

Emmett Varricchio, CAES Windsor, releasing weevils on Cockenoe Island, Westport in July 2016. Emmett Varricchio and Donna Ellis (UConn) releasing Rhinoncomimus latipes -a-minute weed in June 2017. Impacts: 45 C onnecticut towns (26.6%) with confirmed reports of MAM to date in June 2017, with the latest report from a homeowner in Cromwell ( www.mam.uconn.edu ). MAM germination was delayed again in 2017 (late April) as in 2016 and 2014, due to cool spring temperatures. Monitoring in 2016 showed the weevils' continued presence at all sites, very late maturation of fruit, reduction of MAM at some sites. Extended severe drought and early competition from aggressive natives are also possibly limiting MAM germination, growth and seed set. Intensive scouting and GIS mapping in adjacent areas around release sites have shown little or no spread of MAM . Weevils have overwintered successfully again in Connecticut following successive severe winters in 2014, 2015, and 2016 and an extreme drought in 2016. Weevils have survived severe flooding, drought, storms, variable winters, site interference from mowing, tree felling, vegetation clearance and herbicide treatments. This marks the 8th year of successful weevil ove rwintering. Incredible off shore dispersal (3- 4 miles over Long Island Sound) of weevils and MAM to islands was recorded again in 2016. Three bird sanctuaries on islands received weevils in 2016, to mitigate MAM spread, partnering with US Fish and Wildlife, Towns of Westport, Greenwich, and the CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Establishment and spread of the 169 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 weevils has also occurred in the majority of release sites in a variety of different habitats on the mainland. Establishment of R. latipes for mile -a-minute weed appears to have limited the spread of mile- a- minute vine in some towns, together with other cultural and chemical means of control. Biological control of MAM is reducing the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right s-of-way, agricultural lands, bird refuges , etc. Augmentative Biological Control of Elongate Hemlock Scale Elongate hemlock scale, Fiorinia externa (EHS), an exotic scale present in Connecticut since the 1960s, has recently rapidly expanded its range and population densities to seriously damaging levels on forest and landscape hemlocks over much of Connecticut in the past 5 years . Forest stands in no rthern and western Connecticut with heavy elongate hemlock scale infestations have shown thinning crowns and declining health, leading to pre -emptive hemlock salvage in forest management . Recently, the native species, Abgrallaspis ithacae , or the hemlock s cale, is increasingly found in southwestern and central parts of Connecticut on forest hemlocks while it has also been seriously damaging Christmas tree plantations for at least the past 3 years. As EHS and hemlock scale also infests other conifers, especi ally firs, which are the most popular species for Christmas trees, the industry is impacted and mostly resorts to chemical control for management of scale outbreaks. There is no effective natural enemy of EHS in North America . However, the twice -stabbed lady beetle, Chilocorus stigma, is a native and widespread omnivorous scale predator . There have been no attempts to mass- rear C. stigma and it is not available commercially . The goal of the project is to develop optimal laboratory methods to mass -rear suitable scale cultures and C. stigma for potential augmentative and safe biological control releases in EHS -affected stands. Impacts: Currently , there is no effective non- chemical control of elongate hemlock scale and the range is expanding northwards into Ma ine. Development of novel mass -rearing procedures for C. stigma, a safe, omnivorous, climatically -adapted native predator of EHS, would allow implementation into new areas, augment local forest populations and also provide a method of biological control for many scale pests in plantations and orchards and reduce pesticide usage.

Avian Dispe rsal of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Dr. Cheah has participated in an undergraduate research project by Nicholas Russo, from the University of Connecticut, in collaboration with Dr. Morgan Tingley, and Dr. Chris Elphick, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary B iology . The Valley Laboratory hemlock plot is where Nick investigated the potential dispersal of HWA crawlers onto stationary preserved bird mounts and the relationship between crawler dispersal and the phenology of HWA hatch. Nick Russo is currently in the third year of his project where he is continuing mist netting to investigate crawler dispersal on live birds at the Valley Laboratory hemlock plot and 3 other forest plots. Nick is also investigating simulated possible transfer of HWA crawlers from mount ed passerine specimens onto uninfested hemlock foliage at the Valley Laboratory. Nick Russo and Dr. Chris Elphick mist net sampling of birds at the Valley Laboratory . 171 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact: This research describes the possible mechanisms that may contribute to the long -distance dispersal of HWA northward with bird migration. Insect Management Efforts to better quantify the potential for neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) for causing harm to pollinators require an understanding of the concentr ation of these insecticides in floral rewards (nectar and pollen), the sensitivity of pollinators to the insecticides (known as intrinsic toxicity), the quantity of the pollen or nectar collected by the pollinators, and the duration of time that the pollin ator may be exposed. The focus on NNIs is due to their systemic nature, which allow them to be transported within plants to nectar or pollen . The U. S. EPA has established that 25 parts per billion (ppb) in nectar and possibly 100 ppb in pollen may be thre sholds for sublethal effects on honey bee health. In previous work that is now in press, Drs. Cowles and Eitzer investigated the relationships between factors associated with the application of these insecticides (active ingredient, dosage, application met hod, and interval before bloom) in influencing the resulting residues found in nectar (milkweed) and pollen (sunflower) . These plant species were chosen based on their abundant production of nectar or pollen, because one- gram quantities of nectar or pollen (the quantity required for sensitive resid ue analyses) could be collected . At normal nursery application rates, the concentrations found in pollen decline rapidly following a foliar spray . By two weeks after spraying, the residues would not be of concern to honey bees . In contrast to foliar sprays, soil drenches at medium and high rates result in residues in pollen that would be of concern to pollinator health. These general findings are now being shared by the Horticultur al Research Institute, which funde d the work, so that nursery growers can be better informed regarding their use of neonicotinoid insecticides ( http://growwise.org/wp -content/uploads/2017/01/ HRI-Pollinator -BMPs - January2017.pdf ). This work is being replicated and expanded through work on a Specialty Crop Research Initiative project with a large multist ate team, which also includes C AES scientists Kim berly Stoner and Brian Eitzer . Work initiated two years ago by the Station demonstrated that Rhododendron spp. are an excellent model plants for assessing residues in both nectar and pollen. In the new, larger study, groups in CT and three other states are replicating the application of systemic insecticides, of which NNIs are only a part, to determine the residue levels in nectar and pollen in the rhododendron cultivar 'PJM' . Dr. Cowles participated in choosing the other plant materials in the study to be representative of annual and perennial ornamental horticulture plants, based upon their ability to produce large quantities of either nectar or pollen for residue analyses . At normal nursery application rates, the concentrations found in pollen decline rapidly following a foliar spray . By two weeks after spraying, the residues would not be of concern to honey bees. These data will be of great value to establish best management practices for nursery growers, and to assure the public that these insecticides can be used in ways that are not likely to har m pollinators . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 172 Pollen is harvested from 'PJM' rhododendrons by snipping the filaments to collect the ripe anthers . Pollen is then released from the anthers by vibrating them in a centrifuge tube with a vortex mixer, simulating buzz pollination by bumble bees. Honey Bee Health Honey bee colonies have experienced poor overwintering survival in Connecticut for the past several years, with losses each year of about 50% of hives. The chief suspect for poor honey bee health is varroa mite infestation . These mites not only weaken bees through direct parasitization of bee pupae, but also by transmitting viral diseases within and between hives. A \"vicious cycle\" exists, in which colonies that have died during the winter are restocked by beekeepers during t he spring by purchasing packages of bees . If their queen bees have poor genetic traits and the colonies are also poorly managed for varroa mite infestations, then the colony would be likely to die the next winter and have to be replaced again. Other parts of the country have developed honey bee genetic improvement programs, which usually involve selection for the strongest hygienic traits, in which worker bees remove parasitized bee pupae from the hive, thereby preventing reproduction of varroa mites . An ad ditional potential source of good survival genes for honey bees is from feral honey bee colonies, because, if they have survived for multiple years, they have done so without involvement of chemical treatments to manage mite populations . A collaboration be tween Dr. Cowles and the CT State Bee Inspector, Mark Creighton , is being supported by the CT Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Block Grant program . This project, initiated in 2017, addresses the needs of Connecticut beekeepers by starting a queen rearing and breeding program . The goal of this project is to obtain bees from exceptional commercial sources (based upon hygienic and overwintering traits), and also from feral bee populations, to use in controlled crosses via with instrumental inseminatio n. The large numbers of queens desired from this program cannot all be produced through the laborious process of instrumental insemination, and so queens will also be produced through open mating, with the hope that sufficient drones will be generated by t he colonies at the Station to improve the odds that virgin queens will mate with drones carrying beneficial survival and hygienic traits . These hybrid bees will then be given to state beekeepers for them to assess their qualities, including overwintering, propensity to generate swarms, gentleness, and honey yield. To obtain bees from feral populations, swarm traps are being placed in remote forested locations, with the expectation that swarms finding and colonizing these traps will be from local populations surviving in bee trees . To determine whether feral populations are present in these remote areas, bee- lining techniques will be used in 173 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 September to identify the locations of bee trees. If feral populations in forests cannot be found, then bees with simil ar beneficial traits will be obtained from exceptionally healthy colonies found and rescued from structures (houses and barns) . An added benefit from this project involves outreach to beekeepers, so that they gain a better understanding of the joint necess ity for improving the hygienic traits carried by their queen bees and of the need to maintain varroa mites at low populations . Side benefits expected from these actions will be (1) state beekeepers will start to purchase or replace existing queens with hyg ienic bees, which will improve overall health and survival of the state's honey bee population, (2) the Connecticut Queen Breeders Association (founded in 2015) will have a \"jump start\" in terms of breeding material for which they will become responsible, (3) the increasing proportion of bees with hygienic traits in the state may reach a threshold that increases the likelihood that open matings of bees will result in hygienic traits in the hive, and (4) better health for honey bees will improve the health of our native species of bees, because it will reduce the sharing of viruses from honey bees with other species on flowers that both species visit.

(Photo, Patrick Skahill, WNPR) Disease Management In 2015, Dr. Cowles established a planting of firs in Brooklyn, CT, at a site with high naturally occurring incidence of phytophthora root rot. This experiment is investigating soil acidification as a method to prevent infection by root rot organism s. The underlying hypothesis in this experiment is that Phytophthora spp. are less tolerant of acid soils than are the fir tree hosts. Two species were planted, Fraser fir, which is highly susceptible to Phytophthora, and Canaan fir, which is somewhat tolerant. Evaluation of tree health in the same year as planting demonstrated a highly significant treatment effects from application of sulfur, which benefit ted both species of fir, and a phosphi te root dip, which benefitted only the Fraser firs . In the 2016 evaluation of this experiment (the year following planting), the trees in the low pH (acidified soil) plots had twice the terminal grow th as the trees in plots not amended with elemental sulfur . Several hypotheses are now being considered to more fully explain the benefits from having amended the soil with sulfur . From laboratory bioassays of four Phytophthora spp. isolated from The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 174 CT Christ mas trees, we have determined that growth of mycelium is directly affected by pH conditions in a dosage -dependent manner (dosage of hydrogen ions) . Other possible influences expected from sulfur application appear to not influence mycelium growth, including the presence of elemental sulfur and higher concentrations of calcium ions. The observation that tree growth one year after planting was associated with better tree color in the year of planting, and that all trees were somewhat yellow in the year of pl anting, suggests that improvement of plant nutritional status during the year of planting could have tremendous dividends for initial establishment and future growth of the trees . In spring of 2017, a follow -up experiment was started, in which the influenc e of sulfur incorporation at the time of planting, and root dips or drenches of products that could enhance root growth are being tested in a factorial experiment to determine which tools may benefit tree growth . The full effects of these treatments are no t expected to be known until the summer of 2018. The root health of Christmas tree transplants can be visualized by the color and growth of the aboveground part of the tree. Trees with even moderate yellowing (C) grow half as much as those with darker g reen foliage (D). Impacts : The Horticultur al Research Institute has incorporated results from our residue studies to inform nursery growers of the hazards to bees from drench applications ). The public at the state and national level has become more aware of the need for honey bee queen genetic improvement efforts (see http://wnpr.org/post/building -bee-resilience- one-queen -time). Mycology Research Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on water - damaged building materials, and infiltration of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. 175 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Biocontrol of plant diseases: the study was carried out on two hosts, poplar and Euonymus japonicas and two papers were published . Burkholderia pyrrocinia strain JK -SH007 isolated from poplar stems showed a highly significant effect on promoting growth of poplar and as a potential biocontrol agent against poplar canker . The ideal reference gene of B. pyrrocinia strain JK -SH007 was filte red and determined for the transcript normalization . The expression of pyrG was relatively stable in B. pyrrocinia JK-SH007. A bacterium HYEB5 - 6 isolated from healthy Euonymus japonicus showed significant antifungal activities against various phytopathoge nic fungi, including C. gloeosporioides s.s. HYCG2 -3. The bacterial metabolites of HYEB5 - 6 inhibited conidial germination, the growth of the germ tube and appressorium formation of HYCG2 -3, possibly through protease and glucanase of HYEB5 -6. HYEB5 -6 C. gloeosporioides . The HYEB5 -6 isolate was identified as Bacillus velezensis. Impact: For the benefits of environmental and human health, it is important to explore alternatives for disease management . Biocontrol is always a good alternative to explore. Two bacteria studied at cellular and molecular levels clearly showed potential for managing polar canker and anthracnose of Euonymus japonicas . The studies are important steps to elucidate the biocontrol mechanisms of these biocontrol agents. Inhibition of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s. by HYEB5 -6 on dual culture plates. The control was solely inoculated with C. gloeosporioides . Toxic Indoor Mold - Stachybotrys and Hyphomycete Biosystematics Ongoing collaborative study on Stachybotrys has led to the discovery of two new species of Stachybotrys -like fungi from karst areas in Thailand, Cymostachys garethjonesii sp. nov., Memnoniella oblongispora sp. nov., and one new combination, M. nilagirica comb. nov. Impact : The study further clarified the species concept of this group . Since some fungi in this group are mycotoxigenic, allergenic or facultative pathogens to humans and are also rather common in water - damaged buildings, it is imperative to clearly define the members of this group . This study will assist indoor mold, medical, ecological, and public health professionals to better identify these fungi.

The fungus secretes degrading enzymes to destroy the cuticle of aerial plant parts and help infect the host successfully . The characterization of CglCUT1 predicted protein suggests that the cloned DNA encoded a cutinase in C. 177 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 gloeosporioides affecting C. oleifera . The whole CglCUT1 gene was knocked- out and the knockout transformants exhibited significant decreases in cutinase act ivity and virulence compared with the wild- type strain . This study suggests that the CglCUT1 gene has a positive effect on fungal virulence of the hemibiotrophic C. gloeosporioides on C. oleifera . Impact : The study is a significant step for better underst anding of infection mechanism using gene knock- out method and the crucial role played by CglCUT1 gene . The results can help explore new approaches of the management of this disease on C. oleifera .

Weed Science Invasive Plant Management Trials In Connecticut, hundreds of non- native plants occur in various managed and natural ecosystems. One of these non- native invasive plants is mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris L.), which was introduced in North America more than 400 years ago as a medicinal herb . Dense monotypic stands of mugwort are commonly found along roadsides, floodplains and riparian areas, pasture and rangeland, rights -of-way, and in various agronomic, turf and landscape settings . Mugwort is also considered to be one of the 10 most troublesome weeds in the US nursery industry where it strongly interferes with the growth of ornamental plants . Mugwort's rapid spread is attributed to its extensive underground rhizome sy stem and resistance to chemical and cultural control tactics . Current mugwort management relies mainly on herbicides ; a few nonchemical options are available for mugwort control . Dr. Aulakh has established t wo field research projects at Lockwood F arm in Hamden to evaluate mugwort response to herbicides and mowing regimes under enhanced levels of soil nitrogen. The first experiment included a factorial combination of three levels of nitrogen (0, 25, and 50 kg N/a) and three different rates of herbicides: glyphosate, aminopyralid, and clopyralid. A second experiment consisted of three different levels of nitrogen (0, 25, and 50 kg N/A) and three mowing schedules (10- , 15- , and 30- day interval s). First year results revealed a significant reduction in mugwort in festation with lower (0.5 x) than recommended (1 x) herbicide rates. A year following herbicide treatments (October 2016), glyphosate at 1.1 kg ae/ha (acid equivalent per hectare) and aminopyralid at 0.06 kg ae/ha resulted in 90 and 80%, respectively, visual control of mugwort . Higher rates of glyphosate at 2.2 kg ae/ha and aminopyralid at 0.12 kg ae/ha. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 178 Increased N fertilization did not affect mugwort control in response to any herbicide treatment . However, addition of nitrogen favorably affected perennial grasses. Mugwort did not seem to respond to the increased mowing frequency (10 versus 15 or 30 days mowing interval) under any of the nitrogen fertilization levels . Research will continue in following years to evaluate the role of low herbicide rates for complete elimination of mugwort rhizome biomass . Results from laboratory trials on mugwort seed germination have indicated huge variation in mugwort biotypes for regeneration via seed . All biotypes produced viable seed with germination ranging from 35 to 75% . Impact : This research indicates that mugwort can reproduce and spread via both seed and rhizomes contrary to the conventional belief of its repr oduction uniquely via rhizomes. Mugwort management research at Lockwood Farm in Hamden, CT. Ornamental Nursery Trials Herbicides are a critical input to raise weed -free, high quality ornamental plants. In 2016, eight ornamental plant species (dogwood, Virginia sweetspire, red oak, White oak, vincas, pachysandra, and leucothoe) were screened for their tolerance to new experimental weed control products . Ten additional IR-4 funded ornamental plant safety trials are being conducted in multiple ornamental species in the current year (2017) . These studies will help to develop safe use practices for th ese new products and compare their weed control efficacy with the conventional pre- emergence herbicides. 179 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Impact: The herbicides Biathlon and Freehand at 200 and 300 lb/a, respectively, did not injure the tested ornamental species . As a result of these trials, safer alternative herbicides have been discovered for preemergence weed control in leucothoe, vincas, red oaks and white oaks. Christmas Tree Weed Management Trials: Christmas tree tolerance to herbicides depends on many variables that en compass tree species, age, herbicide chemistry, application rate and timing (dormant or actively growing), and method of application (directed or over -the-top). In 2016, numerous new products such as indaziflam, flumioxazin, mesotrione, hexazinone + sulfom eturon and their combinations have been evaluated for weed control efficacy and tolerance of Christmas trees at multiple locations in Connecticut (Shelton, Brooklyn, and Hamden) . Experiments are being repeated in 2017 for consistency of results. Additional dose-response trials are being conducted at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor , and Broken Arrow Nurseries in Hamden . Dr. Aulakh is also conducting weed diversity surveys to assess the impact of various weed management systems currently being followed by Christmas tree growers in Connecticut. Surveys conducted in 2016 have indicated significant differences in weed species under different management situations . Weed management trials have discovered many safe and effective herbicides for pre- emergence weed control in Fraser fir, balsam fir, Colorado blue spruce, C anaan fir, and Douglas -fir. Weed surveys in 2016 have shown that a weed species shift toward predominance of perennial weeds hedge bindweed) in response to the current chemical weed management is occurring in many Christmas tree farms. Christmas tree weed management research trials at Hamden and Shel ton, CT. Impact : Lack of selective post -emergence herbicides for perennial weed control and sole reliance on herbicides was the likely cause of the observed weed species shift. Organic Production Systems : Weed management is one of the greatest challenges in organic production systems because chemical herbicides are not allowed in order to meet the organic production standards . A multi- year field study is underway at the Valley Laboratory to investigate the role of cover crops, crop rotations, and weed management systems (organic vs. chemical) for managing weeds in sweet corn and winter squash. Cover crops being investigated include cereal rye, spring oats, Sudan sorghum, and crimson clover . Rotational components include winter squash and sweet corn crops . The organic weed control methods include hoeing , application of vinegar or Weed Zap, an organic herbicide (clove oil 45% and cinnamon oil 45%) . First year results indicated significant reduction in weed density (common purslane, field pansy, redroot pigweed, crabgrass, and horseweed) with a combination of cereal rye and crimson clover . Following cereal rye, overall weed control in chemically managed sweet corn/summer squash ranged between 95 to 99% . In organically managed sweet corn and winter squash, following a cereal rye plus crimson clover mixture, weed control was in the range of 85 to 95% . These results indicate that cereal rye plus crimson clover mix can be a viable weed management option for organic sweet corn and winter squash. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 180 Sweet corn -winter squash rotation following cover crops at the Valley Lab in Windsor . Strawberry and Rosemary Trials: Few herbicides with a broad spectrum weed control efficacy are available for weed control in high value crops such as strawberry and rosemary . Two field research trials are underway at the Valley Labo ratory to assess safety and weed control efficacy in strawberry and rosemary to A 16003, an experimental herbicide being developed by Syngenta . These research efforts seek to provide safer and more effective chemical weed management options for strawberry and rosemary growers in C onnecticut . Strawberry and r osemary herbicide tolerance trials at the Valley Lab in Windsor . Plant Disease Research Boxwood Blight Boxwood blight is a new, introduced disease in Connecticut . The impact of the disease has been very high; boxwood plant losses have been estimated at over $5.5 million in Connecticut since October 2011. In addition, the concern about boxwood has resulted in reduced or lost orders for other plants, resulting in a multiplier effect on economic losses. Drs. James LaMondia and Katja Maurer have conducted research to determine fungicide efficacy in vitro and in plant systems . Calonectria pseudonaviculata (C.ps) causes leaf spot and stem lesions resulting in defoliation and dieback of boxw ood. 181 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Assessing the potential for development of fungicide resistance in C. pseudonaviculata One aim of the boxwood blight research is to assess the potential for development of fungicide resistance (insensitivity) in the pathogen C. pseudonaviculata ( C.ps.). The development of resistance is common and observed for many pathogens and crops . Therefore, Drs. James LaMondia and Katja Maurer conducted tests to evaluate the fungicide sensitivity of three different pathogenic isolates (two different wild types I and II from Connecticut landscapes and an isolate of wild type I selected for its ability to grow on up to 250 g a.i./ml pyraclostrobin) . Previous experiments included the evaluation of All tested DMI fungicides strongly inhibited radial growth, but did not prevent conidial germination. The strobilurin fungicides inhibited the conidial germination of the wild type I and its selected isolate, but not of the other wild type II. Only pyraclostrobin inhibited mycelial growt h and conidial germination of both wild types within the label use rates . However, the germination tube length was reduced by all tested strobilurin fungicides. A: In vitro assay to determine the radial growth of C.ps . isolates on fungicide amended media with different concentrations. B: Non- germinated conidia of C.ps. wild type I on pyraclostrobin amended media. C: Germination of wild type I spores on unamended media. Further experiments to analyze differences in pathogenicity of these isolates in viv o are being conduct ed. Previous studies showed the effectiveness of pyraclostrobin and propiconazole against boxwood blight. Therefore, detached leaf assays with th ese two fungicides were performed. Leaves of the varieties Green Velvet, Green Mound and Gre en Mountain were sterilized and dipped for 5 seconds in fungicide solution with the concentration of 0.3 g a.i./ml, 1 g a.i./ml, and 3 g a.i./ml . Leaves were infected with one drop of conidial suspension (around 400- 500 conidia/drop) each of wild type a nd the selected isolates. Symptoms and sporulation were analyzed weekly . The infection and sporulation rate of the wild type I was very high . The selected isolates showed less infection and sporulation on propiconazole treated leaves at the concentration o f 3 g a.i./ml . No differences between the boxwood varieties were observed . Only a few untreated (control) as well as fungicide treated leaves showed symptoms by the wild type II, which is why we assumed that the isolate lost pathogenicity during culturing . More repetitions at higher concentrations have to be conducted. However, this study with these three isolates demonstrates that reduced fungicide sensitivity in C.ps. can be selected for in vitro and that reduced strobilurin sensitivity can also occur na turally in pathogenic isolates in the landscape. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 182 Detached leaf assay: Leaves were infected with 400 -500 conidia . Symptoms included brown leaf spots resulting in defoliation . Sporulation can be observed under the microscope (two right pictures). Impact : Boxwood is a very important ornamental plant in the Connecticut landscape and, in general, in the United States . Boxwood has a significant share of the wholesale value of ornamental plants. Current losses to date amount to an estimated $5.5 million in C onnecticut alone. Because of the high application of fungicides to control boxwood blight, the likelihood of the development of resistance is great. The knowledge of fungicide insensitivity is important to develop an effective spray program and to avoid fungicide resistance development . For effective control of mycelial growth as well as conidial germination, and to reduce the risk of resistance development, growers are using fungicides with multiple active ingredients from different mode -of-action groups in mixture and rotating usage. Pachysandra species and cultivar susceptibility to the boxwood blight pathogen At CAES -Windsor, we have conducted research in response to questions regarding potential differences in susceptibility in Pachysandra species and cultivars to the boxwood blight pathogen Calonectria pseudonaviculata. We used whole plants and detached leaf assays to evaluate differences in disease severity that occurred on five cultivars of P. terminalis , one cultivar of P. axillaris , and one selection of P. procumbens . The tested Pachysandra species and cultivars were susceptible to the pathogen although there were differences in the numbers of lesions that developed between the plants tested; those differences were more apparent with wh ole plants than with the detached leaf assays. Best Management Practices to manage disease and prevent additional spread of the pathogen in nurseries, garden centers and landscapes will need to take into account that all of the Pachysandra species and cult ivars that we evaluated may serve as inoculum reservoirs a new broad -spectrum active ingredient under development by BASF . Dr. LaMondia conducted trials on three - to four -year-old 'Green Velvet' and 'Tide Hill' boxwood plants in no. 1 containers for efficacy against the fungus that causes boxwood blight . The fungicide applications were applied as a foliar spray to runoff using a Solo backpack sprayer at 30 -35 psi with an adjustable hollow cone nozzle on 15 Jun, 6 Jul, and 26 Jul 2016 in the outdoor container nursery production area . Plants were moved to a plastic- covered hoop- house and inoculated with 4.0 \u00d7 105 conidia per plant on 16 Jun, 3.0 \u00d7 105 on 8 Jul, and 2.5 \u00d7 106 conidia per plant on 29 Jul using a hand- held mist sprayer. Plants were moved back to the nursery area after 4 d . Maximum daily temperature for Experiment 1 ranged from 69 to 99 F, with a mean of 87.7 and minimum temperatures ranged from 51 to 72 F, averaging 61.9 F . There were 23 days with precipitation totaling 3.9 in. Plants were irrigated with overhead sprinklers twice per day, morning and afternoon, delivering an additional approximately 0.7 in. of water daily . Disease 183 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 was assessed by co unting numbers of dropped leaves and typical boxwood blight lesions on newly produced leaves, older mature leaves and stems on 10 Aug . The experiment was repeated (Experiment 2) as described above with the fungicide applications made on 6 Jul, 26 Jul, and 17 Aug 2016. Plants were inoculated with 9.0 \u00d7 105 conidia on 8 Jul, and 2.5 \u00d7 106 conidia per plant on 29 Jul, respectively. Maximum daily temperature for Experiment 2 ranged from 69 to 99 F, with a mean of 88.5 and minimum temperatures ranged from 52 to 73 F, averaging 64.5 F . There were 24 days with precipitation totaling 5.8 in. Plants were irrigated with overhead sprinklers twice per day, morning and afternoon, delivering an additional approximately 0.7 in. of water daily . Disease was assessed on 24 Au g. For both experiments, all treatments reduced infection significantly compared to the untreated controls, and the fungicides and the different rates of fungicide were not significantly different from each other . Disease control averaged over all fungicides resulted in excellent control, generally greater than 95% . Tide Hill boxwoods in Experiment 2 had less disease than the Green Velvet plants in Experiment 1 . Tide Hill had previously been shown to be less susceptible to boxwood blight than Green Velvet . No symptoms of phytotoxicity were observed on the fungicide- treated plants. Impact : The identification of fungicide application programs with curative activity as well as activity against spore germination and vegetative growth of the boxwood blight pathogen will lead to the development of effective management strategies. Boxwood blight viabili ty pathogen, Calonectria pseudonaviculata (C .ps.), can be affected by low rates of fungicides in tests in artificial media , however, management of disease on infected plants can be difficult . We investigated the sensitivity of microsclerotia (MS) survival structures to efficacious fungicides . Melanized MS were removed from media, washed for 30 s i n sterile water and soaked in 5 ml of 0, 3.16, 10.0, 31.6, 100, or 316 ppm of kresoxim -methyl, thiophanate -methyl or propiconazole fungicides for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. After exposure, MS were washed three times with sterile water, blotted and placed on grow th media . Viability (germination) and colony diameter were measured after one week, and growth from exposed MS was normalized by the 0 ppm control . Thiophanate -methyl did not affect MS viability or colony diameter after any concentration or time combination. Kresoxim -methyl reduced growth by 50% only after MS exposure to 316 ppm for 72 h. Propiconazole affected both survival and subsequent colony diameter . Few MS survived exposure to 100 ppm for 48 h or 316 ppm for 24 h. A multiple regressio n model predicted 50% colony diameter reduction after 30 h in 10 ppm, 14 h in 31.6 ppm, or any exposure to 100 ppm propiconazole . The melanized MS of Cps exhibit increased survival after exposure to fungicides toxic to hyphae . However, propiconazole can effectively reduce viability and subsequent colony growth at concentrations within use rates. Tobacco Disease Research The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 as the Tobacco Substation, to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen . Wildfire was eventually eliminated by the development of plant resistance to this pathogen . Ever since, tobacco breeding to incorporate genetic plant resista nce to plant pathogens has been used to successfully manage diseases. Plant resistance is the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most effective way to control diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950s, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960s, black shank in the 1970s, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980s and early 1990s effectively controlled serious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wrapper tobacco pr oduction in the Connecticut River Valley . There are currently a number of pathogens that threaten the crop. Dr. LaMondia conducts an ongoing breeding program to develop resistance virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and broadleaf types . Recently, a male -sterile F1 hybrid 'B2' highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN and with moderate resistance to blue mold and black root The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 184 rot was released and licensed . Black shank, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae , has re -emerged as a serious pathogen in Connecticut and we are working to develop a hybrid line with significant resistance to the pathogen. Our first candidate line, B3, was evaluated under field conditions in 2014 and 2015 and, while resistant, was found to be lacking in sufficient wrapper leaf quality . Additional crosses are now being made . Black root rot, caused by the fungus Thielaviopsis basicola, has been damaging and increasing in impact in recent years with cool wet springs. We obtained three sources of dark wrapper tobacco with high levels of black root rot resistance from cooperating scientists in Kentucky . A back - cross program is being used t o transfer resistance to CT broadleaf, and resistant plants are being selected for broadleaf characteristics. Inbreds have been developed and have been used to develop hybrid lines with resistance to multiple pathogens . Two of these lines are being evaluat ed under commercial conditions and one has been licensed with a company for commercial seed production. Breeding for resistance to Potato Virus Y (PVY) has been a high priority, however, the burley tobacco cultivar (TN -86) that is the commercial source of resistance to Potato Virus Y (PVY) has been evaluated and found not to be resistant to the new PVY strains that occur in potato, tobacco, and other solanaceous crops. No source of resistance to the new strains is currently known, so this objective has been put on hold. Impacts: C9 tobacco carries resistance to Fusarium wilt and TMV . It has been widely grown since its release (> 80% of acreage) and has prevented more than $5 million in losses each year since 1992. The development of a male -sterile hybrid br oadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens, including Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, will allow sustainable production with reduced disease and much reduced pesticide inputs . Growing B2 eliminates the need for nematode management at over $500 per acre. B2 has been released as a new cultivar and licensed to a local company. Proceeds will support further research on plant resistance . Adding resistance to black root rot will further reduce plant losses to disease. Tobacco Cyst Nematode Management Trap crops are being developed for nonchemical control of cyst cyst nematodes Globodera pallida. Because of th e difficulties in working with this regulated pathogen in the United States, Dr. LaMondia is cooperating with scientists from Idaho to conduct experiments with the closely related tobacco cyst nematode G. tabacum as a model system . The of broadle af cigar the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum , was investigated in years. Sixty -five microplots 1- m-diam ., naturally infested with various densities of TCN, were transplanted with nematode -susceptible shade tobacco (cv. 2016, treatments were expanded to include eastern black nightshade and a cultivated fallow . TCN densities were determined before planting and again after harvest by sampling each microplot with 10 cores 1.5- cm-d to 15- cm depth. Soil was dried and extracted using a modified Fenwick can . Cysts were crushed and the number encysted J2 per cm3 soil determined . Nematode reproduction as determined by the ratio of the final (Pf) to initial (Pi) populations varied between treatments . In 2015, Pf/Pi ratios were 2.89, 0.38 and 0.14 for susceptible tobacco, resistant tobacco and Litchi tomato, respectively . All three plants were signific antly different from each other . In 2016, Pf/Pi ratios were highest for eastern black nightshade (6.64 ) and susceptible tobacco (2.84), which were different from fallow (0.56), resistant B2 tobacco (0.32) and Litchi tomato (0.20) . These results are consistent with previous Litchi tomato, S. sisymbriifolium , stimulates tobacco cyst nematode ha tch better than resistant or susceptible tobacco but unlike eastern black nightshade, does not allow significant nematode reproduction in roots, indicating that it may be an effective trap crop for management of G. 185 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 Yellow Lupulin glands of female hop cones contain resins, acids, and ess ential oils, which are responsible for aroma, flavor, and bitterness in beer. tabacum . In addition, G. tabacum may be useful as a substitute model for the quarantined pathogen Globodera pallida for trap cropping with tobacco cyst nematode better than tobacco bu t unlike eastern black nightshade, does not allow significant reproduction in roots, indicating that it may be an effective trap crop for management of G. tabacum . In addition, G. tabacum may be useful as a substitute model for the quarantined pathogen Glo bodera pallida for trap cropping with S. sisymbriifolium under field conditions. Reduced Pesticide Residues in Tobacco Connecticut shade and broadleaf tobacco types are used to produce some of the highest quality cigar wrappers in the world. Blue mold, ca used by Peronospora tabacina, is a leaf spot disease that can destroy the crop, valued at up to $50,000,000 per year . Fungicides can help protect the leaves, but growers and cigar makers want to keep residues low . Dr. LaMondia conducted experiments to maxi mize disease control with reduced levels of fungicide in cured leaves in 2016. The strategy tested investigated the effects of using azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, mandipropamid, or fluopicolide fungicides early in the season and avoiding or minimizing sprays prior to harvest as opposed to the standard application of the same total amount of fungicide spread out over the season . Leaves were harvested, cured and fungicide residues determined by Dr. Brian Eitzer of the Department of Analytical Chemistry . Our results indicated that fungicide concentrations were stable in the plant and may have more systemic activity than thought. Impacts: The development of a more effective spray program that results in reduced fungicide residues in broadleaf cigar wrapper tob acco will increase marketability and reduce human exposure to pesticides. Hops Research Hop ( Humulus lupulus ) cultivation in the Northeastern United States dates back to the first settlers, but disappeared for a century because of disease pressure and the enactment of Prohibition . Subsequently, it was established in the Pacific Northwest, with the biggest production area worldwide (50,857 acres; IHGC - 2016 Statistical Report). New York State has the largest production area in the Northeast (400 acres, Steve Miller) followed by Vermont (25 acres; IHGC - 2016 Statistical Report) and Maine (24 acres) . Com mercial hop production has just started in CT (15 acres). The increasing popularity of the microbrew culture, local brewpubs, home brewing, and the growing demand for regional products have created a niche market for high quality hops in the Northeast. The objective of this project, which is supervised by Dr. James LaMondia and Dr. Katja Maurer, is to investigate the feasibility of hop production in CT . Therefore, we examined growing characteristics and suscep tibility to diseases and pests for five varieti es using high and low trellis systems in two locations \u2014 the Valley Laboratory in Windsor and Lockwood Farm in Hamden\u2014over the last 4 years. The most common diseases and pests are downy mildew, which is the most d amaging disease in the northeastern U.S., two- spotted spider mites, and potato leafhoppers . Diseases and pests can be control by intensive scouting and rigorous sanitation measures. Spraying pesticides, using biological control measures (e.g. , predators), removing weeds, and stripping the lower leaves helps to reduce the spread of diseases and pests. We have established a region -specific integrated pest management program, which includes intensive scouting and timely control measures. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 186 (A) In the spring, the crew prepares the hop yard, trains bines on twine and prunes . (B) Hop bines can climb more than 20 feet . During the season the hops are fertilized, irrigated, scouted for diseases and pests and treated . (C) Female mature cones are harvested from mid-August to the beginning of September . (D) The crew cuts bines to bring them to the shed and hand picks the cones, which are weighed to determine yield, dried and shipped to a laboratory for quality analysis. The varieties Cascade and Summit are well suited for CT , and the high trellis set up is more reliable except for the semi -dwarf variety Summit . Perle, a German breeding line, had the smallest growth and lowest yield . AlphAroma , moderately resistant in other areas, was highly susceptible to downy mildew . Hop plants at Lockwood F arm produced more cones than plants at the Valley Laboratory . In 2016, the yield s of all varieties at Lockwood F arm were in the range or higher than it is described . The varieties Cascade and Newport had the highest yields at both locations . Analysis of alpha acids, beta acids and hop storage index (HSI) showed that we were able to produce high quality hops. In conclusion, the trial has proven the general feasibility of successful hop production in CT, but not all varieties do well . More varieties will be tested in t he coming years . Therefore, 23 more vari eties were planted at Lockwood F arm in 2016, in total 46 varieties over the last 4 years, and 10 more varieties were planted in Windsor . Preliminary results lead to the conclusion that the varieties Zeus (CTZ) and Su per Alpha are highly susceptible to downy mildew . Brewer's Gold, Chinook, Comet, and Southern Brewer seem to be promising candidates, but more research has to be done. Impacts : Assessment of different cultivars in terms of their growth, yield, and disease /pest development will lead to a better understanding of successful hop cultivation in Connecticut. The general feasibility of successful high quality hop production in CT has been proven. Hops varieties differ in yields, growth characteristics, quality, a nd susceptibility to downy mildew. Not every variety does well in CT. Downy mildew, spider mites, and potato leafhoppers, which are the most dreaded disease and pests, can be controlled with a rigorous pest management. Drs. Maurer and LaMondia created an I ntegrated Pest Management Guideline for CT. VALLEY LABORATORY SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for Information A total of 5,245 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year . The majority of these queries were answered by Ms. Rose Hiskes (64%) in the inquiry office (60% of these from the public sector, 32% commercial) or by Dr. LaMondia (20% of inquiries; 90% of which were commercial) . About 48% of the information requests to the inquiry office were from the public sector; the remai nder was from commercial growers, government, and nonprofit, educational or other (52%) . The majority of 187 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 inquiries answered by Ms. Hiskes concerned insects (33%), diseases (18%), pesticides (14%) or horticulture (11%) . Most concerned landscape and nursery (53%), vegetable (7%) and structural entomology (9%) . and (1%) inquiries . These inquiries primarily concerned tobacco (41%), hops (20%), nursery and landscape (15%), vegetables (8%), fruit (5%), golf turf (6%) and Christmas trees (2%) . All scientists and many of the staff at the Valley Laboratory assist growers and homeowners. Valley Laboratory scientists made 106 presentations to grow er, professional and citizen groups (over 7,000 people), were interviewed 23 times and made 233 visits to commercial nurseries, greenhouses, farms, forests and landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects. Dr. LaMondia maintained th e Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep growers current with the disease in North America, and management options . His laboratory conducted 148 nematode diagnostic samples and conducted testing as an APHIS certified pinewood nematode export t esting facility. Thomas Rathier , emeritus soil scientist, continued to visit specific urban sites where community gardens either already existed or were planned by community organizers . At each site, Mr. Rathier made an assessment of the horticultural cap abilities of the site as well as the likeliness of heavy metal contamination being found in soils on the site . Samples were taken at each site and analyzed by Mr. Rathier and Mr. Musante (Analytical Chemistry Department) . Mr. Rathier subsequently relayed r esults to appropriate stakeholders along with suggestions for remediation and/or avoidance of soils whose metal concentrations exceed the Connecticut standards. Soil testing A total of 5,708 soil tests were expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year . About 6 6% were performed for commercial growers and 3 3% for homeowners . Of the commercial samples submitted, 70% were for landscapers; 7% for tobacco growers; 7% for vegetable growers, 5% for municipalities, 2% for golf course superintendent s; 2% for nursery growers; 1% for small fruit, 1% for Christmas tree growers, and 4% for research . Valley Lab Information Office Insect, Disease and Plant Health Survey Ms. Rose Hiskes diagnosed a wide range of insect, disease, weed and plant health problems on herbaceous and woody ornamentals, lawns, vegetables, fruit and Christmas trees for homeowners, commercial businesses, other government agencies and nonprofits. Insects During the spring and summer months, insect pests, such as gypsy moth caterpillars, Norway shoot gall midge, borers and chinch bugs affected trees, shrubs and flowers in landscapes and lawns . As of late June 2017, the heavy infestati on of gypsy moth caterpillars began dying from the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga and nucleopolyhedrosis virus (Figure 1) . Rains in May and June were sufficient to build up the fungus population Figure 1 . Gypsy moth caterpillars dead from a fungus and a virus. \u00a9CAES Rose Hiskes The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 188 and keep infection cycles going in the caterpillars . Though some large oak trees in Eastern Connecticut did die this year, next year we should have a much lower population of gypsy moth. Two gypsy moth caterpillar parasites were observed in the state over the last year . In late August , an egg parasite was observed in e gg masses. In late June a wasp, probably a braconid, was observed parasitizing gypsy moth caterpillars in Tolland . White cocoons, like those frequently seen on tomato hornworms, were observed attached to caterpillars. The Norway spruce shoot gall midge, Piceacecis abietiperda , continues to attack spruce with resulting branch tip dieback . This cecidomyid fly deposits eggs in bud scales or on twigs where larvae burrow into the stem tissue causing swelling and bending of twigs . Galls are produced indi vidually, not by the spruce gall adelgids . When galls are found at the base of the current season's growth, this insect can be confused with the eastern spruce gall adelgid . Repeated death of growing tips can seriously injure and dis figure trees, eventually causing death . Research is needed on possible management methods for this pest. Ambrosia beetles killed Sty rax trees for a number of Connecticut citizens over the last several years. Styrax japonica is listed as a host for These beetles will attack stressed and healthy trees. The fungi they bring with them can clog the plant 's vascular system and cause wilting and plant death. The very hot, dry summer caused problems in home lawns that could not be irrigated. Chinch bugs attacked many lawns in sunny areas causing large dead patches. Endophytic perennial rye and fescue grasses containing fungi that produce entomopathogenic alkaloids can help m anag e chinch bug infestations. Many homeowners want to grow their own tree fruit . This year for the first time a pear sample was received where the leaf edges were curling up and maggots were found inside (Figure 2). However, only a few of the leaves at the canopy edges were affected . This cecidomyid fly overwinters in the ground as a pupa . As leaves emerge on pear it emerges as an adult, mates and begins laying eggs on unfolding foliage. Maggot feeding on leaves causes the margins to curl upward parallel to t he midrib, becoming reddish and swollen in the process . Pear midge is not a serious pest in Connecticut (Mary Concklin, personal communication). Structural and human insect pests conti nue to create problems for Connecticut citizens . Because of excessive temperatures outside in the summer of 2016, many click and ground beetles, along with root weevils found their way into homes to find cooler more humid environments . Blacklegged ticks were very problematic in the spring having survived our mild winter weather . The percentage of tick inquiries from this office went up from 1% last year to 1.5% in the 201 6-2017 year. Connecticut has a new pollinator law that took effect in 2017. Homeowners will no longer be able to buy some neonicotinoid insecticides that may harm pollinators . There are many homeowner products that contain imidacloprid and dinotefuran. One neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, is around 3,000 times less toxic to honey bees than imida cloprid . One homeowner product with acetamiprid and flowers, vegetables and fruits on the label did come out this season . Homeowners can protect pollinators from insecticide poisoning by applying insecticides only to plants that are not Figure 2 . Leaf curling pear midge damage . \u00a9CAES, Rose Hiskes 189 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 frequented by bees. If a systemic insecticide is necessary on a plant bees frequent, apply it after bloom, using a short residual product . Also, applying the least toxic neonicotinoid, acetamiprid; or using alternative products such as horticultural oils, bacterial products like Thuricide, or spinosad can provide insect control while protecting pollinators (Use of Neonicotinoids in the Home Landscape, Dr. Richard Cowles). Diseases Homeowners bring in many samples with lichens on plant stems. Lichens are a combination of algae and fungus that use plant surfaces as a place to grow . They are not plant pathogenic . When the host plant begins to decline due to other factors, such as disea se or insect attack, increased sunlight reaching the lichen causes it to grow more, increasing in size and taking over more area . This causes the homeowner to believe that lichen is causing the plant to decline. Vegetables such as tomato and squash have d isease problems. Given the many cultivars of tomato and how widely they are grown, each year many foliar and vascular diseases are brought into the office . Septoria and bacterial wilt have been seen already in the summer of 2017. Squash leaves were brought in with suspected powdery mildew . The zucchini plant had silvery areas on the leaves that were not powdery mildew and just normal leaf coloring. Evergreens such as white pine and spruce continue to suffer needle loss but at a lower rate. Septorioides , a new fungus, discovered in New Hampshire by Forest Service personnel, continues to be found in white pines in Connecticut . Second year needles are cast six months early, causing trees to produce fewer carbohydrate reserves. White, blue, and Norway spruces have had Rhizosphaera needlecast . Sirococcus tip blight was found on a hemlock from Wethersfield (Figure 3) . No management practices have been tested for effectiveness as this disease is mainly known from forest settings. Umbrella pines, including the one i n the landscape at the Valley Lab, continue to suffer branch dieback . As Maskell scale can attack Sciadopytis , this was thought to be the cause for a number of years . Closer inspection has shown scales are not the cause. Many attempts at getting samples an d incubating them have not resolved this issue . Research is needed to solve this landscape problem. Our state flower, the mountain laurel, has significant fungal leaf spot issues . Many samples come in with Cercospora leaf blight . Can a disease resistant m ountain laurel be bred in our state? In talking with a Connecticut nursery that specializes in mountain laurels, they suggest that varieties with thick, waxier leaves show less leaf spot in their growing fields . Cultivars such as 'Nathan Hale' and 'Yankee Doodle' may get less leaf spot, especially if grown in open, sunny areas. Hops are a new crop being grown commercially in the state . Downy mildew is the most common and important disease and was diagnosed from a number of samples . Leafhoppers also caused a hopper burn symptom on leaves and stunted plants. While dry weather reduced foliar diseases on golf course turf, we received increased numbers of plant parasitic nematode diagnostic samples from greens with damaged turf . Stunt, lance and cyst nematodes were observed to be above damaging levels in many instances. Figure 3. Sirococcus tip blight damage to a hemlock hedge. Photo by Richard Vocke The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 190 Weeds and Herbicides An exotic grass from Eurasia, bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial weed in some Connecticut lawns. It grows through the winter months and dies back during the summer months . The seed head consists of small bulbs that fall to the ground and germinate in the fall. Homeowners with older lawns bring in samples with what appears to be dead patches . On closer inspection, yellow stalks are seen with a bit of green at the top . Colonial bent grass was a weed in older grass seed mixes. As with other bent grasses, it does not do well when mowed high. Mesotrione is now available to homeowners and landscapers for management of bent grass. A new herbicide product with four active ingredie nts is also now available to homeowners . It contains dicamba , which can be volatile and move offsite through air or soil movement . This active ingredient has injured soybeans in the Midwest and caused yield loss. Plant Health - Weather The NOAA Drought M onitor shows Connecticut is no longer in a drought . Plentiful rains in April and May made for extended periods of bloom in crabapples, azaleas, rhododendrons and mountain laurels . It also made for higher incidence of leaf spot in those plants that show sym ptoms early such as crabapples and other tree fruits . As mentioned in the insect section above, sufficient rains in May and June allowed for fungal control of gypsy moth caterpillars . The winter of 2016 -2017 had no drastic temperature swings and little snowfall so there was little winter injury in the spring. The end of February was very warm and it seemed spring would again be early . However, March was significantly colder and so most planting of annual flowers and vegetables was delayed relative to last year. Impact : Accurate identification of pests of agricultural and human health significance has resulted in economic savings to commercial growers and homeowners, reduced human and environmental exposure to pesticides, and increased human safety. The G ordon S. Taylor Conference Room Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year , 16 different groups used the room on 50 occasions . Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Invasive Plants Working Group, Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connecticut Council for Soil & Water Conservation, Land Trust Alliance, CT Native Plant Pollinator & Wildlife Working Group, CT Department of Agricultu re, CT Farm Bureau, CT Hops Growers Association, Nursery Landscape Research Group, CT Agricultur al Information Council, Invasive Plant Council, CT Vineyard & Winery, West Hartford Farmers ' Market , and the CT Tree Protective Association . Ms. Jane Canepa- Morrison scheduled the meetings and James Preste and Isaac Buabeng arranged the furniture and ensured that the room was available after hours. Annual Tobacco Research Meeting 191 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment S tation - Record of the Year 2016 -2017 One hundred and twenty people attended the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment St ation's annual Tobacco Research Meeting held at the East Windsor Scout Hall on February 21, 2017. Dr. Jim LaMondia welcomed growers and spoke about recent developments at the Experiment Station . The meeting addressed a wide variety of issues of concern to growers . Jim LaMondia spoke about management of tobacco pathogens including Fusarium wilt, poty viruses, black shank, target spot, cyst nematodes and blue mold and presented strategies to reduce pesticide residues in broadleaf and shade tobacco wrapper leaves while managing fungicide resistance. He provided an overview of the breeding program with the objective of incorporating plant resistance to pathogens through traditional breeding techniques . Thomas Rathier spoke about the effects of cultural practices, the environment and weather events on soils, soil microbes and tobacco growth. Christina Berger of the CT DEEP gave growers an update on EPA Worker Protection training changes and licensing . Andrew Urbanowicz, Dave Arnold and Paul Polek presented an upda te on the Connecticut -Massachusetts Tobacco Growers Association . Colleen Kisselburgh discussed tobacco insurance program changes and Martha Dorsey of the Farm Services Administration provided updates on FSA services to growers . Jane Canepa- Morrison, Jim Pr este, and Nathaniel Child assisted with much of the behind the scenes work for the meeting . The meeting qualified for pesticide applicator recertification credit in Connecticut and Massachusetts and 67 persons received credit.
