Are there any traditional medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19? Ans: Ther e are some traditional medicine remedies from Ayush systems which provide relief and alleviate some of the sympt oms of COVID-19. Ayush systems follow a holistic appr oach towards disease management and maintaining health of a health y person. It provides detailed advocacy and interventions for disease prevention. Ther e are various interventions in Ayush systems which are presentl y being used in prophylactic appr oaches as well as in the management of COVID 19, and are providing good results. Further these are seen to be bene\u0000icial in sympt omatic management in COVID 19. The ongoing AYUSH-C SIR COLLABORA TIVE STUDIES (a joint initiati ve among the Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Famil y Welfare and Ministry of Science & Technology , with technical assistance from ICMR) includes four clinical studies on use of AYUSH medicines for COVID 19, both in a prophylactic role and as an add-on intervention to conventional treatment . The Ministry has also initiated 68 studies at 112 locations undertaken through National institutes, Research Councils, Universities, State Governments and other collabor ating hospitals (which includes AYUSH-C SIR studies also). However, it is under lined that the interventions and measur es proposed in the Clinical management protocol are not for cure, but for the management of asympt omatic and mild cases of COVID 19 and for prophylactic care. One should not get a false feeling of safety from adopting these measur es. It is also under lined that for prevention of COVID 19, the mainsta y appr oach remains adher ence to the gener al guidelines as released by Government , including maintaining appr opriat e physical distance, wearing a mask, maintaining hand- hygiene and a voiding unnecessary cr owding at an y place, and these should be followed strictl y. 2. What is immunity in Ayurveda? Ans: In Ayurv eda, immunity is referred to as vyadhik shamatv a. Ayurv eda has a compr encompassing vely of health and disease.

It has been studied and found eecti ve in viral fevers, as anti-in\u0000lammat ory, antip yretic and immuno-modulat ory interventions. Ther e are three in-silico studies, which show its high binding ef\u0000icacy against SARS-CoV-2 targets involved in attachment and replication of the virus, as compared to Favipiravir, Lopina vir/Rit onavir and Remdesi vir. About 7 studies are also being done under the Ministry of AYUSH on Guduchi as Prophylactic care on about 1.33 Lakh population and with very good results in preventing COVID 19 and in management of asympt omatic COVID 19 without any side eect . Further detailed rationale of its inclusion has been provided in the Interdisciplinary Committ ee for int egration of A yurv eda and Y oga Int erventions in the 'National Clinical Management Protocol: COVID-19' which is made available in public domain on the Ministry of AYUSH websit e. 10. What is the basis of recommending in the protocol? Ans: Ashwagandha (Withania most extensi vely experiment ed Ayurv eda medicinal plants and has been used in Ayurv eda practice since centuries. Ashwagandha has been select ed owing to its properties like immune-modulat ory, anti stress and antiviral ef\u0000icacy . In-silico studies have shown its high binding af\u0000inity to ACE2-RBD interface which may stop SARS COV 2 entry into cells. The WS root extract has shown positi ve results against protracted social isolation induced stress and anxiety which mak es it a good medicine for prophylactic use. Further, the medicine also has very good pulmonary protective function and hence is bene\u0000icial in post Covid care. Ther e are substantial number of studies on Ashwagandha published in reput ed peer review ed journals to establish its ef\u0000icacy , safety and protective action. 11. What is the basis of r ecommending the combination of Guduchi and Pippali in the protocol? Ayurv eda describes the decoction of Guduchi management of Kaphaja Sannipatik Jvara) that has manif estations akin to COVID-19.

Piper longum (Pippli) and Tinospor a cordifolia (Guduchi) have shown high af\u0000inity to potential targets of SARS-COV 2 (COVID 19 causing virus). Further , the outcomes of clinical studies and interim trends of ongoing clinical studies have also substantiat ed their role in management of COVID 19. 12. What is the basis of recommending AYUSH 64 in the protocol? Ans: AYUSH 64 formulation was developed for Malaria after a long scienti\u0000ic research following the drug development process. It was developed in compliance to all regulat ory requir ements and quality and pharmacopoeial standar ds Council for in Ayurv for resear ch in Ayurv eda under the Ministry of AYUSH. This drug was repurposed based on its ingredients having notable antiviral, immune- modulat or and antip yretic properties. An in-silico stud y was done on AYUSH 64 which showed that about 35 of its phyto-constituents have high binding af\u0000inity in COVID 19 virus. The formulation has also shown very promising results in In\u0000luenza like illness. The 6 clinical studies across India on AYUSH 64 have shown very promising trends. Based on these factors and also on its clinical use & safety pro\u0000ile it was recommended in COVID 19 care. 13. Why did the Committee propose only 4 drugs? Ans: This was the \u0000irst report and recommendations on the Interdisciplinary Committee. The Committee thoroughly reviewed the national clinical management protocol of COVID 19 and the rationale of inclusion of interventions in the protocol. In the light of same, repurposing of existing Ayurveda interventions based on their extensi ve scienti\u0000ic evidences published in peer review ed journals like pre clinical studies, safety and toxicity studies, clinical studies and interim trends of substantial number of studies on a large cohort , initiall y 4 interventions are proposed beside Yoga interventions. How ever, similar work on scienti\u0000ic assessment and evaluation of other AYUSH interventions from Siddha, Unani, Homeopath y and Sowa Rigpa are also in progress and soon may be explored for inclusion in the National clinical management protocol. 14. How man y studies are in progress, undertak en by the Ministr y for COVID 19? Ans: At present about 68 clinical and observ ational studies are undertak en at 112 sites across India.

These herbs are ushna viry a (hot in potency) and may be used with added munnak a or mishri as per need or a person and taste. The ingr edients of Ayush kwath are very good antio xidants. and modulat ory properties of the ingr edient like Tulasi are well document ed in resear ch studies. 18. Are the medicines prescribed in the protocol immune-boosting? Ans: Ayurv eda system of healthcar e takes holistic appr oach towards disease management and preserv ation of health in which salut ogenesis (maintaining optimum health and immune status) is a major aspect . The medicines select ed in the Protocol have immuno modulat ory eect i.e. they tend to stregthen the immunity of a person in a natur al way. In present times when altered lifesty les, diet and stress are a common, maintaining a natural immune system is challenging, and this renders a person prone to infections and diseases. The immuno modulat ory interventions of Ayurv eda which are included under the broad term 'Rasayana' are very helpful in preserving optimum health of a person. They also help in preventing disease and in controlling disease progression. This should not be confused with hyper immune status or aberr ant activity of the immune system.
