She is one of the most knowledgeable, warm, compassionate and trusting professionals that has ever taken care of me. Each treatment was so individualized and she always took the time to listen to all my concerns. Added bonus that my time there felt like a relaxing and much needed break! She is absolutely a top notch acupuncturist, but also an all around wonderful human being. - Jaime via Google Reviews Request an appointment. Please get in touch with us to schedule an appointment. "}
