Lack of coverage is one of the main reasons why Canadians do not see a dental professional. The program seeks to address some of the barriers to accessing dental care by providing comprehensive dental care to eligible low -income seniors to help reduce unnecessary trips to the hospital, prevent chronic disease and increase quality of life for seni ors. The program is being implemented through a phased approach; however, for 202 1, 2022 and 202 3 COVID -19 has/will adversely affected the delivery capacity of the program. Vaccines have greatly reduced diseases that once routinely harmed or killed babies, children, and adults. Vaccines help your body create protective antibodies that help it fight off infections. Vaccines offer the best protection against getting very sick from COVID -19. As of November 24, 2022, over 7.7 million vaccines ha ve been administered by Team Toronto . For Toronto residents 12+: 93% have received their first dose, 90% have received their second dose, and 60 % have received their third dose. A target f or 2023 and beyond has yet to be established as the COVID -19 pandemic continues to evolve. 2023 - 2032 10-YEAR CAPITAL PLAN $Million 2023 Includes 2022 carry forward funding 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 4 of 27 How Well We Are Doing Service Measure 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Target 2022 Projection Status 2023 Target 2024 Target Outcome Measures Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention Number of school communities that receive municipal funding for student nutrition programs 624 616 616 616 616 616 Emergency Preparedness Maintain the availability of Toronto Public Health staff to respond to public health emergencies on a 24/7 basis Achieved Achieved Achieved* Achieved Achieved Achieved Environmental Health Percentage of High Risk food premises inspected at least 2 times per year 81% 32% 50% 20%# # 75% 100% * In 2022, in addition to continuing to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic, Toronto Public Health also responded other communicable diseases and outbreaks such as Monkeypox and Meningococc al disease. # In 2022, as food premises slowly started to reopen, publ ic health inspectors focused efforts on providing at least one inspection to food premises regardless of their risk category versus conducting a second inspection for all high risk food premises. 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 5 of 27 How Well We Are Doing Service Measure 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Target 2022 Projection Status 2023 Target 2024 Target Service Level Measures Family Health Number of seniors (65+) provided with dental treatment 6,511 13,500 13,500 14,330 20,250 27,000 Infectious Diseases Prevention Percentage of active Tuberculosis (TB) cases completing adequate treatment according to the Canadian TB Standards >95% >95% >95% >95% >95% >95% Public Health Foundations Conduct systemic and routine analysis of surveillance information, including monitoring of trends over time, emerging trends, and priority populations Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Achieved Other Measures Infectious Diseases Prevention Number of COVID -19 vaccines administered by Team Toronto 12,177 5,921,112 -- 1,792,996* -- -- 2022 Projection to Comparison 80% - 100% 64 - 79% 63% and Under * Data as of November 17, 2022 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 6 of 27 COVID-19 IMPACT AND RECOVE RY 2023 Impact and Recovery Operating Budget Impact The 2023 COVID -19 impact is projected to be similar to Toronto Public Health's 202 2 experience: o $1.3 million in foregone revenue for fee -based programs such as the food handler training fees. o $49.1 million for e xtra-ordinary expenditures for the COVID -19 general r esponse. o $37.0 million for the COVID -19 immunization campaign . o $6.0 million for the COVID -19 School Focused Nurses program. $3.6 million for the continued operation of the Voluntary Isolation Centre. Toronto Public Health will continue to seek re imbursement from the province for COVID -19 programs administered under the purview of the provincial government. Service Level Changes Service levels have been impacted as: o Approximately 20% of Toronto Public Health's permanent complement continue to be redeployed to the COVID -19 general and immunization response. o Over 80% of the programs with defined service levels will be operational in 2023 . This represents a restart of ten of the eighteen public health programs which continued to be sus pended in 2022. 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 7 of 27 EXPERIENCES, CHALLENGES AND PRIOR ITIES Our Experience and S uccess Toronto Public Health's focus in 2020 to 2023 has been and will continue to be responding to the COVID - 19 pandemic . The response is organized along two general themes: case/outbreak management and vaccination . Our Response is and will continue to be multi -pronged, including but not limited to: o Advocating for and supporting public health measures, as appropriate; o Outbreak management and investigations; o Refining e ducational material to keep the public informed of new developments about COVID -19 and the pandemic at large; o Responding directly to citizen concerns and questions via multiple channels; o Conducting outreach activities and holding town halls and webinars fo r priority populations and communities; o Managing vaccine inventory and distribution; o Operating fixed, mobile and pop -up immunization clinics; and o Managing a voluntary isolation centre. As of November 2022, Toronto Public Health has: o managed 377,000 plus reported cases and 4, 700 plus outbreaks; o hosted 2,100 plus clients in Toronto Voluntary Isolation Centre; o addressed 537,000 plus calls from the general public ; o engaged with 57,000 plus individuals in over 1,200 plus information sessions; and o collaborated with Team Toronto to administer 7 .7 million plus COVID -19 vaccines. Key Challenges and R isks December 31, 2022 marks the 1,071 day anniversary of the first case of COVID -19 detected in Toronto ; 2023 will be the fourth year of the pandemic. Like our peers in health care, Toronto Public Health staff are ex periencing COVID -19 workplace fatigue in the form of burnout and mental distress , prompting many to leave the sector . The mental health and well- being of Toronto Public Health 's staff will p lay an important role in the organization's ability to sustain an effective COVID -19 response, support a prolonged mass immunization campaign, and recover and rebuild non-COVID -19 programs and services. The resurgences of COVID -19 cases and the discovery of new variants of concerns continues to impact the resumption of some public health programs. The longer programs are delivered at a reduced level or suspended increases the risk of Torontonians overall health being negatively impact ed in the short and long term. Priority A ctions Continue the COVID -19 response and incorporate lessons learned to support Toronto Public Health's readiness for other emerging public health issues. The key objectives of the COVID -19 response continues to be: o Prevent loss of life, o Preserve the capacity of the healthcare system, and o Minimize the social and economic impacts. Continue to focus on the delivery of a comprehensive health system immunization program for COVID -19 and various other vaccine preventable diseases, such as influenza. Continue and enhance our respon se to the drug poisoning epidemic. Promote mental health. Rebuild public health functions. Implement wellness and health and safety programs to address COVID -19 workplace fatigue amongst Toronto Public Health staf f. 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 8 of 27 RECOMMENDATIONS City Council adopted the following recommendations: 1.

A r eview was undertaken to ensure budgets align with Toronto Public Health's ability to spend and the markets capacity to deliver. A key component in determining an appropriate level of annual cash flows includes historical capacity to spend reviews by projec t categories (Chart 3 below) as well as the level of projected 2022 underspending that will be carried forward into 2023 to complete capital work. Chart 3 - Capacity to Spend Capacity to Spend Review Impact on the 10 -Year Plan Based on the review of historical capital spending constraints and a capacity to spend review, $3.451 million in capital spending originally cash flowed in 2022 has been deferred to 2023, with an additional $0.345 million deferred to 2024. Adjustments to the Capital Plan are noted below : Deferral of $1. 818 million on Dental Clinic's renovations and building of dental vans for the Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program. Deferral of $1.633 million to 2023 and $0.345 million to 2024 for information technology projects as resources were redeployed to support the COVID -19 Response . 2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 25 of 27 Appendix 9 Summary of Capital Needs Constraints 2027 2028 Collaboration Implementation 1,536 1,536 251 701 584 Total Needs Constraints (Not Included) 1,536 1,536 251 701 584Project Description Total Project Non- Debt Debt Required Cash Flow (In $ Thousands)2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 26 of 27 Appendix 10 Inflows and Outflows to/from Reserves and Reserve Funds 2023 Operating Budget Program Specific Reserve / Reserve Funds Inflow s and Outflows to/from R eserves and Reserve Funds 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget and Plan Program Specific Reserve / Reserve Funds 2023 2024 2025 $ $ $ Beginning Balance* 8,805.4 8,977.1 9,152.1 Public Health XR1108 Withdraw als (-) Contributions (+) Interest Income 171.7 175.1 178.5 Total Reserve / Reserve Fund Draws / 8,977.1 9,152.1 9,330.6 Balance at Year-End 8,977.1 9,152.1 9,330.6 Reserve / Reserve Fund NumberWithdrawals (-) / Contributions (+) Reserve / Reserve Fund Name (-) Total Withdrawals - - - - - - - - - - - Contributions (+) Interest Income 65.3 66.6 67.9 69.2 Name (In $000s)Project / Sub Project Name and NumberContributions / (Withdrawals) XR2123 Dev Charges RF - Health Balance at Year-End2023 Operating Budget & 2023 - 2032 Capital Budget & Plan Toronto Public Health toronto.ca/budget Program Summary | Page 27 of 27 Appendix 11 Glossary Approved Position: Permanent or temporary positions that support the delivery of City services and service levels as approved by Council.
