Methods: We used prospective data of side effects following COVID-19 vaccination in 20342 participants from Iran and Switzerland. We studied 6 vaccines: The AZD1222, Sputnik V, BBIBP-CorV, COVAXIN, BNT162b2, and the mRNA-1273 vaccine. We considered eight side effects as the model output: fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, and injection site reactions. The total input parameters for the first and second dose predictions were 46 and 54 features. The performance of multiple ML models were compared using ROC-AUCs. Results: The Logistic Regression model for different side effects of the first dose achieved ROC-AUCs of 0.620-0.686, 0.685-0.716, 0.632-0.727, 0.527-0.598, 0.548-0.655, 0.545-0.712 for the AZD1222, Sputnik V, BBIBP-CorV, COVAXIN, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively. The second dose models yielded ROC-AUCs of 0.777-0.867, 0.795-0.848, 0.857-0.906, 0.788-0.875, 0.683-0.850, and 0.486-0.680, respectively. Conclusions: Using a large cohort of recipients vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, we created a personalized strategy to predict the occurrence of adverse side effects with high accuracy. This technique can serve as a tool to informed COVID-19 vaccine selection. An online interface at https://podsaf.org allows easy application of the model.
