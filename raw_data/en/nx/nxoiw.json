NSF funds basic research that pushes the boundaries of innovation and lays the groundwork for scientific breakthroughs that advance our Nation 's economy, security, and global leadership. Also critical are NSF's education invest ments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, which help to prepare future ge nerations of scientists and engineers. In January 2017, the President signed into law the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329, abbreviated AICA), a bipartisan bill that affirms NSF's long-standing world renowned merit review process. AICA also addresses NSF's implementation of particular issues of importance such as increased transparency and accountability; management of multi-user facilities and mid-scale projects; and increased oversight of major research equipment and facilities. While maximizing research and education opportunities that help create the innovations that fu el our economy and create jobs, AICA also promotes the Foundation's commitment to diversity in STEM fields, incentivizes NSF's programs which encourage private-sector involvement, and re-affirms NSF's continued commitment to entrepreneurship and commercialization. NSF's FY 2018 Budget Request is $6.653 billion, a decrease of $840.98 million (-11.2 percent) over the FY 2016 Actual investment. This fu nding will support approximately 8, 000 new research grants, with an estimated funding rate of 19 percent for research grant proposals submitted to NSF. For comparison, in FY 2016, NSF funded 8,800 new research gran ts, with a funding rate of 21 percent. FY 2018 Budget Request Total: $6.65 billion Decrease: $840.98 million -11.2% from FY 2016 Actuals Overview Overview - 2 The FY 2018 Budget Request reflects NSF's commitment to establishing clear priorities in areas of national importance, as well as to identifying innovative and prom ising research ideas, in order to yield return on investment for the Nation. Federal investments in basic research and STEM workfo rce development are increasingly important to help establish U.S. leadership in next-generation technolog ies, especially as other nations intensify their support of research, development, and education. U.S. leadersh ip is important, in part because of the unprecedented level of global competition for the highly skilled, technical workers who generate innovative scientific ideas. As the only agency with a diverse portfolio that suppor ts all fields of science and engineering, NSF helps to cultivate the Nation's role as a l eader in the scientific enterprise by supporting the fundamental research that is so vital to the commercial marketplace a nd by building the workforce necessary to address the complex challenges that face the Nation. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 3 NSF's Big Ideas In 2016, NSF unveiled a set of \"Big Ideas\"\u201410 bold, long- term research ideas that identify areas for future investment at the frontiers of science and engineering.

NSF's commitment to these areas remains strong as the funda mental research programs across the agency will continue to invest in the basic research that advances these specific focus areas. Cyber-Enabled Materials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems (CEMMSS) ($222.43 million) aims to integrate science and engineering activities across NSF, including breakthrough materials, advanced manufacturing, and smart systems, which include roboti cs and cyber-physical systems. Research has led to discoveries of materials with unique properties and fu nctionality that can be developed more reliably and efficiently via the integration of theory, modeling and simulation, data analytics, and experimentation. The integration of advanced materials with capabilities of intelligence is transforming static systems, processes, and edifices into adaptive, pervasive, and smart sy stems. These smart systems will be able to act independently and intelligently in dynamic, uncer tain, and unanticipated environments. They will contribute to advanced manufacturing and have the potential to accelerate scientific and engineering discoveries to address key national and societal challe nges critical to U.S. secur ity and competitiveness. In FY 2018, CEMMSS will focus on increasing integration of the highest priority areas such as those related to materials and manufacturing, and developing smart systems. Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES) ($14.88 million) is an integrated, national initiative to increase the preparation, participation, advancement, and potential contributions of those who have been traditionally underserved or underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) enterprise. Providing opportunities and support for members of all communities and sectors across the United States is necessary for the Nation's econo mic welfare and as part of NSF's commitment to equity. Investments aim to produce measurable, su stainable progress at the national level and to scale effective approaches to diversity and inclusion in STEM. NSF INCLUDES is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. Overview Overview - 6 Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) ($24.40 million) aims to understand, design, and model the interconnected food, energy, and water system through an interdisciplinary research effort that incorporat es all areas of science and engineering and addresses the natural, social, and human-built factors involved. IN FEWS, however, is the first program to study the interconnected food-energy-water nexus. This program is driven by pressing needs and challenges, such as growing U.S. and global populations, changes in land use, and increasing geographic and seasonal variability in precipitation patterns, all of which are placing an ever-increasing stress on these critical resources. NSF, through INFEWS, is uniquely poised to focus not only on the fundamental science and engineering questions at this nexus, but to train the ne xt generation of researchers in this interdisciplinary area. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) ($26.15 million) improves NSF-funded researchers' access to resources that can assist in bridging the gap betwee n discoveries and technologies, helping to transfer knowledge to downstream technological applications and use at scale. In FY 2018, NSF will continue to support I-Corps Nodes and I-Corps Sites to furthe r build, utilize, and sustain a national innovation ecosystem that helps researchers effectively identify viable market opportunities and augments the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit the Nation. Risk and Resilience investments ($31.15 million) aim to improve predictability and risk assessment and increase preparedness for extreme natural and man-made events in order to reduce their impact on quality of life, society, and the economy. In FY 2018, Pr ediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) and the Critical Resilient Interdepe ndent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) program will continue, along with other contributi ng activities. PREEVENTS is a focused research effort that will help to better understand and mitigate the ri sks posed to the U.S. by natural hazards. The CRISP program will promote research on Interdependent Cr itical Infrastructures (ICI) systems and processes and educate the next generation of scientists and engin eers in how to best improve the resilience of our infrastructures in the face of changing and increasing risks. The projects supported will make ICI services more effective, efficient, dependable, adaptable, resilient, safe, and secure. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) ($113.75 million) investment aims to build the knowledge base in cybersecurity that enables discovery , learning, and innovation, and leads to a more secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Through a fo cus on long-term, foundational research, SaTC will develop the scientific foundations for cybersecurity research for years to come. SaTC also focuses on the training of the next generation cybersecurity workfo rce, especially for government. SaTC aligns NSF's cybersecurity investments with the national cybersecurity strategy. Understanding the Brain (UtB) ($134.46 million) encompasses ongoing cognitive science and neuroscience research and NSF's contributions to the ongoing Brain Research through Advancing Innovation and Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity of the brain, in action and in context. There remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive understa nding of the general principles unde rlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain's structural organization and d ynamic activities; how brain, behavior, and environment interact; and how the brain can recover from lost functionality. Additional Highlights NSF fully funds the construction of three major research equipment and facilities projects ($182.80 million). Funding these projects is an essential part of the science and engineering enterprise that enables science to advance in ways that would not otherwise be possible. These three projects include the following: The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telesc ope, which will be the world's most powerful ground- based solar telescope and will enable astronomers to gain new insights into solar phenomena; The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will produce the deepest, widest image of the universe; Regional FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 7 Class Research Vessels, a major component in the pl an for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. NSF is responsible for the management of polar facilities and logistics ($284.96 million). Operational support in the Arctic and the Antarctic plays an indispensable role in allo wing the international research community to carry on their work in these regions. The United States is a leading nation in polar science, and research results have global significance. Cutting-edge, NSF-supported research\u2014as well as edu cation and workforce development programs\u2014 are helping to assist in areas of national priority, such as cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing ($144.50 million and $173 .33 million, respectively). NSF investments in these areas have helped to develop innovative ways to secure in formation and ensure privacy on the Internet, as well as to improve the manufacturing sector's improve its effici ency, competitiveness, and sustainability. The National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) was established to advance national leadership in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and maximize th e benefits of HPC for scientific discovery and economic competitiveness. Under NSCI, NSF will support research advances in new computing technologies, architectures, and platforms for the fu ture, as well as the development and deployment of advanced HPC systems, including maximizing thei r benefits through deep integration of HPC cyberinfrastructure with science and engineering resea rch. NSF is one of three lead agencies for NSCI, with the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. In FY 2018, NSF will continue investments to extend the frontiers of high-performance computing ($60.0 million). This investment will support the acqui sition and deployment of a new HPC system that will serve as a national resource for providing pr edictable and sustained long-term capabilities for science and engineering to push the frontiers of knowledge and ultimately promote the health, prosperity, and welfare of the Nation. Overview Overview - 8 Education and STEM Workforce NSF's education and STEM workforce investment, cent ered in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), funds activities that support student s, teachers, researchers, and the public. The EHR investment in core STEM education research is cr itical to building the Nation's knowledge base for improving STEM learning. NSF's investments for FY 2018 focus on the following priorities: The CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SfS) program ($40.0 million, a decrease of $9.98 million) supports cybersecurity education and r esearch at higher education institutions. SFS also focuses on workforce development by increasing the num ber of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cybersecurity, which en hances the capacity of the U.S. higher education enterprise to continue to produce professionals in th ese fields to secure the Nation's cyberinfrastructure. FY 2018 activities will include engaging first- and second-year undergraduate students, especially veterans. Computer Science for All (CSforAll) ($20.0 million) will build on ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging computer science education in schools across the Nation. Funds will support the development and assessment of protot ype instructional materials, scalable and sustainable professional development models, approaches to preservice prepara tion for computer science teachers, and teacher resources. CSforAll aims to provide high schoo l teachers with the preparation, professional development, and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses and to give preK-8 teachers the instructional materials and pr eparation they need to integrate computer science and computation thinking into their teaching. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) ($96.50 million, a decrease of $8.27 million) initiative supports the development of th e STEM and STEM-capable workforce by investing in the improvement of undergraduate STEM education, with a focus on attracting and retaining students and on degree completion. In FY 2018, $15.0 m illion is included for IUSE: Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI). The primary goals of the IUSE: HSI activity are to promote research on engaged student learning and development of effective STEM learning opportunities at HSIs, especially those that have not had substantial N SF funding, to incentivize institutional and community transformation, and to promote fundamental research about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, including research that improves the understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. Through the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) ($59.0 million, a decrease of $7.04 million) program, NSF is able to reach technicians in unde rgraduate programs preparing for the high-technology fields that drive our Nation's economy. The ATE pr ogram is actively engaged in connecting community college educators funded by the program to the Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation within the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) ($246.54 million, a decrease of $85.80 million) recognizes students with high potential in STEM research and innova tion and provides support for them to pursue multidisciplinary research. GRF fellows may participate in Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW), which provi des opportunities to conduct research with international partner countries and organizations, an d Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP), which provides professional development through research internships at federal agencies. In FY 2018, FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 9 NSF will support 1,000 new fellows, equal to the nu mber supported in FY 2008, a reduction from the 2,000 new fellows NSF has supported annually since 2011. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) ($40.10 million, a decrease of $15.88 million) program invests directly in the development of the STEM workfor ce, and in the improvement of the education of tomorrow's STEM workforce. NRT funds proposals to test, develop, and implement innovative and effective STEM graduate education models, to promote interdisciplinary and broad professional training of graduate students, and to foster f undamental research advances in support of national priorities. NRT thus provides a mechanism for de veloping a knowledge base about the implementation and impact of innovative graduate traineeshi p programs and graduate education policies. Overview Overview - 10 Major Research Equipment a nd Facilities Construction In FY 2018, NSF requests funding to continue construc tion on three projects: the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), Large Synoptic Survey Tel escope (LSST), and Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV). The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) ($20.0 million) will enable the study of magneto- hydrodynamic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona at unprecedented spatial, temporal, and wavelength resolution to ga in information on the creation, interaction, and ultimate annihilation of solar magnetic fields. Determ ining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity, including flares and coronal mass ejections. These can affect civil life on Earth through the phenomena generally described as \"space weather\" and may have impact on the terrestrial climate. FY 2018 is year 10 of an 11-year construction pro cess. In FY 2018, installation of the telescope mount assembly (TMA) will be completed, and commission and acceptance t esting of the TMA will be under way. By the end of FY 2018, the installation of the M1 main mirro r will be under way and the alignment of the mirror with the laser metrology system will have begun. The first of the five first-light instruments, the visible broadband imager (VBI), will be delivered to the site, assembled, and will begin initial checkout. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) ($57.80 million) will be an 8-meter-class wide-field optical telescope designed to carry out surveys of the entire sky available from its site. LSST will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi-color imaging data ev ery night and will produce the deepest, widest-field sky image ever. It will image the entire visible sky twice per week, as well as issue alerts for moving and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. The LSST surveys will result in a comprehensive data set that will enable hundreds of other fundamental astrophysical studies by the entire research community. FY 2018 is year five of a nine year construction process. The Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) ($105.0 million) project will help satisfy the anticipated ocean science requirements for the U.S. East Coast , West Coast, and Gulf of Mexico through the construction of three new research vessels. This project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). 1 RCRVs are important to the national interest in terms of increasing understanding on many subject s including: the potential impacts of geohazards, such as storm surges and tsunamis; transportation an d recreational use; natural resource identification and extraction; and fisheries and aquaculture. These v essels will also support the maintenance of coastal observing systems, such as those of the Ocean Ob servatory Initiative and many other moorings and platforms. This project will help ensure U.S. rese archers have access to the sophisticated ships required to meet scientific demands in the coming decades. 1 National Ocean Council. (2013). Federal oceanographic fleet status report. Retrieved from https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/ default/files/federal_oceanographic_fleet_status_report.pdf FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 11 Organizational Excellence NSF seeks to integrate mission, vision, and core va lues to efficiently and e ffectively execute NSF's activities and provide the flexibility and agility required for all aspects of its operations. This goal incorporates a culture of continuous improvement to en sure effective, inclusive, and accountable programs and merit review processes that provide the greatest value for taxpayer dollars. The portfolio of activities included in Organizational Excellence addresses the agen cy's operations and administrative functions, which underpin NSF's pr ogrammatic activities. Staffing In FY 2018, NSF will work towards full utilization of its established allocations of 1,443 FTE for federal staff and 199 FTE for staff hired under the Inter governmental Personnel Ac t (IPAs). The Foundation recognizes that maintaining staffing levels is vital to effectively and efficiently achieving its mission. FY 2018 Priorities In FY 2018, the primary driver of the decrease for the Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM) account is the completion of the headquarters relocation to Alexandria, Virginia. Accompanying this is a reduction in the an nual rent and utilities for the new headquarters building. Underlying the FY 2018 Request is NSF's ongoing co mmitment to increase agency efficiency while constraining administrative costs. This is consistent with the Administration's co mmitment to manage programs and deliver critical services more effectively, to devote a greater per centage of taxpayer dollars to mission achievement, and to be more effective and efficient in supporting program outcomes\u2014all while improving performance, maintaining staffing le vels, and providing for the 1.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment. AOAM will continue to support operational activities to ensure the Foundation has sufficient resources to fund ongoing operational requireme nts and maintain essential services.

The goals and strategies outlined in the plan build on lessons learned from NSF's past successes and continue to uphold NS F's mission: \"To promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense....\" The plan presents the following goals, which guide the FY 2018 Budget Request: \"Transform the Frontiers of Science and Engineeri ng\" aims to expand and explore the frontiers of human knowledge to enhance the power of the Nation to meet its challenges, and to create new paradigms and capabilities for scientific, technological, and economic leadership in an increasingly fast-paced, competitive world. \"Stimulate Innovation and Address Societal Needs th rough Research and Education\" strives to focus NSF's research communities on opening up new avenu es to address high priori ty national challenges, as well as encourages formation of partnerships w ith industry, other agencies, and international counterparts to leverage resources and build capacity. \"Excel as a Federal Science Agency\" focuses on e fficiently and effectivel y executing the agency's responsibilities and achieving the flexibility and ag ility required to meet the quickly evolving challenges associated with the first two strategic goals. This goal structure enables NSF to link its investment s to longer-term outcomes. To bridge the gap between these strategic goals and measurable outputs, the Strate gic Plan establishes a set of strategic objectives for each strategic goal. Performance Plan NSF embraces the use of goals to drive performan ce improvements. For FY 2018, NSF has set six performance goals so that NSF can strategically mon itor and oversee progress being made toward its larger aims. NSF also assesses progress through an annual pro cess of strategic reviews of the objectives in its Strategic Plan. In FY 2018, NSF will monitor the following annual goals: Ensure that Key Program Investments Are on Track: Ensure that key FY 2018 NSF-wide program investments are implemented and on track. Ensure that Infrastructure Investments Are on Track: Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions: Use evidence-based review s to guide management investments. Make Timely Award Decisions: Inform applicants whether their pr oposals have been declined or recommended for funding in a timely manner. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 13 Improve Review Quality: Improve the quality and usefulness to proposers of written reviews of NSF proposals. Foster a Culture of Inclusion: Foster a culture of inclusion through management efforts resulting in leadership that is committed, knowledgeable, and accountable. Overview Overview - 14 NSF by the Numbers NSF by the Numbers: In FY 2018, NSF expects to evaluate approximately 50,500 proposals through a competitive merit review process and make approximate ly 10,800 new competitive awards, which includes 8,000 new research grants. The number of new res earch grants decreases by roughly 11 percent from previous levels, in keeping with the overall change in total NSF funding. This process typically involves approximately 225,000 proposal reviews, engaging on the order of 34,000 members of the science and engineering community participating as panelists and proposal reviewers. In a given year, NSF awards reach over 1,800 colleges, universities, and other public a nd private institutions in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In FY 2018, NSF sup port is expected to reach approximately 292,000 researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, teachers, and students. The chart on the right shows the distribution of NSF's obligations by institution type and funding mechanism. While the data are based on FY 2016, the relative shares should provide a good indication of the distribution in FY 2018. As shown on the graph, 96 percent of NSF's FY 2016 projects were funded using grants or cooperative agreements. Grants can be funded either as standard awards, in which funding for the full duration of the project is provided in a single fiscal year, or as continuing awards, in which funding for a multi-year project is provided in increments. Cooperative agreements are used when the project requires substantial agency involvement during the project performance period (e.g., research centers, multi-user facilities.). Contracts are used to acquire products, services, and studies (e.g., program evaluations) required primarily for NSF or other government use. Most NSF awards are to academic institutions. As s hown in the chart, 76 percent of support for research and education programs ($5,420 million) was to coll eges (including two-year and community colleges), universities, and academic consortia. Private industry, including small businesses, accounted for 15 percent ($1,068 million), and support to fe derally funded research and devel opment centers (FFRDCs) accounted for 3 percent ($223 million). Other recipients includ ed federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and international or ganizations. A small number of awards fund research in collaboration with other countries, which adds value to the U.S. scien tific enterprise and maintains U.S. leadership in the global scientific enterprise. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 15 The funding profile, shown on the left, presents a high-level, agency-wide estimate of funding rates, or proposal \"success.\" This indicator is useful in gauging the relative impact of different funding levels. In FY 2018, the number of new research grant awards is expected to decrease by 800 compared to FY 2016. As noted above, the reduction is in keeping with the overall change in total NSF funding. This leads to a decline in the funding rate. Overview Overview - 16 Organization and Role in the Federal Research Enterprise NSF's comprehensive and flexible support of merito rious projects enables the Foundation to identify and foster both fundamental and transformative discoveri es and broader impacts within and among fields of inquiry. NSF has the latitude to support emerging fields , high-risk ideas, interdisciplinary collaborations, and research that pushes\u2014and creates\u2014the very frontie rs of knowledge. In these ways, NSF's discoveries inspire the American public\u2014and the world. NSF's organization represents the major science and engineering fields, including: biological sciences; computer and information science and engineering; engineering; geosciences; mathematical and physical sciences; and social, behavioral, and economic sciences. NSF also carries out specific responsibilities for education and human resources, integrative activities, and international science and engineering. The 25-member National Science Board sets the overall policies of the Foundation. NSF's annual budget represents 27 percent of the total federal budget for basic research conducted at U.S. colleges and universities, and this share increases to approximately 60 percent when medical research supported by the National Institutes of Health is excluded. In many science and engineering fields NSF is the primary source of fede ral academic support. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 17 Highlights For nearly 70 years, NSF has invested in fundament al research and education to fulfill its mission of promoting the progress of science and engineering. In doing so, NSF- supported research has connected the discovery and advancement of knowledge with the pot ential societal, economic, and educational benefits that are critical for continued U.S. prosperity. Be low are only some of the important advances that NSF funding enables. Making Artificial Joints Stronger Generally, titanium is the material of choice for artificial knees and hips. It is nontoxic, strong, and wears well. However, NSF-funded researchers at Rice University have discovered that adding gold to the metal can make it nearly four times harder than most steels. The new alloy is more compatible with the human body than titanium alone and outperforms it in wear and tear tests. Easy to synthesize, the new material may help reduce the 200,000 surgeries performed each year in the U.S. to replace failed hip and knee implants. This would be an important advance since knee replacements are expected to increase 673 percent and hip replacements by 174 percent by 2030. Reimagining the Future of Farming Much of the commercial fertilizer used today goes straight into groundwater. This includes nitrogen, one of fertilizer's main components and an environmental pollutant. NSF -funded researchers are using cutting- edge genomic tools to develop new pl ant varieties that use nitrogen more efficiently and don't require as much nitrogen to grow. By analyzing the DNA of specific plants, the research ers are working to identify which genes control nitrogen uptake. With approximately 30,000 plant genes to test, this \"big data\" job uses comput ers that are able to process large amounts of data quickly. Scientists have identified the gene networks that process nitrogen for use in plant growth and development. Researchers are exploring ways to help farmers get the same crop yield using less nitrogen by modifying the plants' genes. This research holds promise for reducing environmental pollution while also creating greater food security by improving crop yields in parts of the world with nitrogen-poor soil.

Flying at altitudes up to 51,000 feet, the plane deploys parachute-borne sensors, known as GPS dropsondes. This NSF-funded technology pinpoints the location of conditions within the storm such as temperature and wind speed. Such observations improve hurricane tracking in the U.S. global weather model by about 15 percent during the 24 to 48 hours before landfall. According to the National Hurricane Center, warnings issued in that window have saved about 200 lives annually. The plane's surveillance missions during hurricane season are a partnership between NSF and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Wave hunting with LIGO In December 2015, almost three months after the initial confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves in the universe, the NSF- funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) captured a second set of waves from another black hole merger 1.4 billion light years away. For the first time, researchers confirmed that one of the black holes was spinning, indicating that the spinning black hole experienced some dynamic process before the merger. Data from this observation allowed researchers to verify the validity of Einstein's theory of relativity, with more precision. NSF was the initial funder of gravitational wave projects 40 years ago and its continued commitment to LIGO's research now enables an entirely new way to observe the universe.

The \"Kilocore,\" considered the world's first such chip, has the highest processor rate (115 billion instructions per second) ever designed in an academic setting. As an added bonus, the chip, fabricated by IBM, is highly efficient, requiring only 0.7 watts of power from a single AA battery. That's 100 times more energy efficient than today's laptops. The Kilocore would speed up wireless coding, video processing and other app lications involving large amounts of parallel data. Previously, multiple processor chips maxed out at about 300 processors according to the researchers. Predicting Crime, Preventing Crime An NSF-funded anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles designed a mathematical model to help predict where crime would likely occur. The model incorporated historical crime data, bus routes, business locations, and even weather. It provided police with a series of \"prediction boxes,\" each 500 feet by 500 feet, where they should focus law enforcement efforts. Using the prediction boxes, the Los Angeles police effectively reduced crime in certain patrol areas compared to other patrol areas where standard methods were used. The models predicted twice as much crime as trained analysts using existing skills and technology. Today, more than 50 police departments around the country and world use the predictive policing platform to keep communities safe. The Kilocore computer chip contains 1,000 independently programmable processors.

To move away from the traditional monitor, keyboard and mouse, a group of NSF-funded researchers, led by researchers at New York University, use a LEGO robot named Quinn to teach basic geometry concepts to middle school students. Quinn is the centerpiece of the Robo-Tangible Activities for Geometry (rTAG) system that encourages physical interactions with a robot. Using an iPod Touch, students \"help\" Quinn learn how to solve geometry problems as they guide the robot around a large, white floor mat. Foldable Robots for the Clinic NSF-funded researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a tiny foldable robot the size of a small pill. This gives doctors an alternative to surgery to retrieve the some 3,500 button batteries that are swallowed annually in the United States. If left in the body, ingested batteries can burn the digestive tract. Once swallowed, the robot unfolds and moves toward its target via external magnetic field. Then it will dislodge the battery from the stomach lining, allowing both the battery and robot to be naturally passed from the digestive system. Besides foreign object retrieval, the devices can patch wounds and deliver medicine. After completing their mission, the robots are passed throu gh the body or dissolve. The researchers plan to redesign the robot adding sensors so that it can c ontrol itself rather than relying on external manipulation. The mighty Quinn rolls across mat, helping students to engage more fully in geometry.

These indicators are useful in gauging the relative impact of different funding levels. Statistics for Competitive Awards : Competitive awards encompass the universe of NSF new activity in a given year. Examples include research grants, cooperative agreements, equipment, fellowships, and conferences. Statistics for Research Grant Awards: Research Grant Awards are a sub -set of competitive awards. They are limited to research projects and exclude other categories of awards such as those for cooperative agreements, equipment, fellowships, and conferences. The Number of Proposals is based on several factors, including past actua l activity, planned competitions, and research trends within the various disciplinary communities. External factors, such as the state of the national economy and other sources of funding, also play a part. The Number of Awards is also based on several fac tors, including estimated funding and expected proposal pool. The Funding Rate is the number of awards made during a year as a percentage of total proposals competitively reviewed. This indicates the probability of receiving an award when submitting propos als to NSF. Annualized Award Size shows the annual level of research grant awards provided to awardees by dividing the total dollars of each award by the number of years over which it extends. Average Duration is the length of awards in years.

The CS for All: RPP program synopsis in the program solicitation states that: NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 6 \"This program aims to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education in their schools at the K -12 levels. With this solicitation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) focuses on researcher -practit ioner partnerships (RPPs) that foster the research and development needed to bring CS/CT to all schools. Specifically, this solicitation aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development (PD) and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses, and K -8 teachers with the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate CS/CT into their teaching.\" The program's first deadline for proposals was February 28, 2017. NSF convened merit revi ew panels in April 2017, and the program will make its first cohort of two- to four -year awards by the end of FY 2017. It is premature to report on the success of this grant program, but the substance of short -, mid -, and longer - term metrics for success is discussed below. Metrics Short -term metrics will focus on ensuring that the program is making awards in the four areas outlined in the law and that the awards address the goal of broadening participation in computer science. One indicator of broadening participation is the diversity of the populations targeted in the awards. Mid-term metrics will include the extent to which funded projects are achieving goals as measured by the progress reported in NSF's required annual and final project reports. Longe r-term (after five years) metrics will include an evaluation of the outcomes of the program, which are based on the program aims as described in the program solicitation and the well -aligned requirements of Public Law 114- 329. Program staff are working wit h the Evaluation and Monitoring Group within the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Evaluation and Assessment Capability Section within the NSF Office of Integrative Activities to develop (1) a set of specific longer -term metrics and (2) a program evaluation plan for measuring the collective success of the CS for All: RPP projects on these longer -term metrics. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 7 NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDTION (NSF) ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETI TIVE RESEARCH (EPSCO R) CONGRESSIONAL REPORT IN COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC LAW 114-329: AMERICAN INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS ACT , SEC. 103 ( d) (1-3) FISCAL YEAR 2016 This report summarizes fiscal year (FY) 2016 NSF funding to institutions and entities in EPSCoR jurisdictions, as required by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act Sec. 103 (d) (1- 3). Specifically, the report itemizes: (1) a description of the program strategy and objectives (2) a description of the awards made in the previous fiscal year including: (A) the total amount made available, by state, under EPSCoR (B) the total amount of agency funding made available to all institutions and entities within each EPSCoR state (C) the efforts and accomplishments to more fully integrate the EPSCoR states in major agency activities and initiatives (D) the percentage of EPSCoR reviewers from EPSCoR states (E) the number of programs or large collaborator awards involving a partnership of organizations and institutions from EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR states (3) an analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 years. Introduction EPSCoR utilizes three investment strategies in pursuit of its goal to strengthen research capacity and competitiveness in eligible jurisdictions. These investment strategies are: (1) Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards that support physical, human, and cyber infrastructure development; (2) Co-Funding in partnership with National Science Foundation (NSF) directorates and offices that support individual investigators and groups within EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (3) Outreach Activities and Workshops that bring EPSCoR jurisdiction investigators together with program staff from across the Foundation to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering aligned with NSF strategic priorities and with jurisdictional science and technology goals. EPSCoR Strategies and Objectives (Sec. 103(d)(1)) EPSCoR's strategies and objectives in FY 2016 remained the same as those described in the FY 2015 report. Specifically, the mission of EPSCoR is \"to advance excellence in science and engineering research and education in order to achieve sustainable increases in research, education, and training capacity and competitiveness that will enable EPSCoR jurisdictions to have increased engagement in areas supported by the NSF.\" Thus, EPSCoR's goals are: To catalyze the development of research capabilities and the creation of new knowledge that expands jurisdictions' contributions to scientific discovery, innovation, learning, and knowledge -based prosperity. To establish sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education, training, and professional development pathways that advance jurisdiction- identified research areas and workforce development. To broaden direct participation of diverse individuals, institutions, and organizations in the project's science and engineering research and edu cation initiatives. To effect sustainable engagement of project participants and partners, the jurisdiction, the national research community, and the general public through data -sharing, communication, outreach, and dissemination. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 8 To impact research, education, and economic development beyond the project at academic, government, and private sector levels. NSF Funding Made Available, by State, under EPSCoR (Sec. 103(d)(2)(A)) In FY 2016, NSF EPSCoR invested a total of $160.03 million in support of its programmatic activities. Of this, $131.00 million (81.8 percent) was directed to RII, $27.90million (17.4 percent) to co-funding, and $1.13 million (0.7 percent) to outreach activities and workshops. The table below details the investments from EPSCoR resources, and EPSCoR investments in co -funding actions.

The table below details NSF investments in EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR JurisdictionNSF Funding 12.45 WY 15.76 Total $711.69NSF funding made available to all EPSCoR jurisdictions (Dollars in Millions) NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 10 Integration of EPSCoR Jurisdictions in Major Activities and Initiatives of the Foundation (Sec. 103 (d)(2)(C)) All EPSCoR programmatic activities target integration and assimilation of EPSCoR jurisdictions into the research and education programs of the Foundation's disciplinary directorates . RII awards enhance academic research capacity and promote the coordination and integration of recipient jurisdictions into major NSF programmatic activities. Additionally, EPSCoR engages NSF disciplinary program officers (PO) in merit review and post- award evaluations, such as site visits and reverse site visits (RSVs). Site visits and RSVs are intended to provide additional project oversight by allowing jurisdictions to report on the progress of their RII Track- 1projects in relation to their stated goals and the programmatic terms and conditions. Disciplinary POs assist in the identification of reviewers, serve as site visit and RSV panelists, and provide knowledge about the ongoing activities within the directorate that could be leveraged to sustain RII efforts after the performance period of the EPSCoR award. National, regional, and jurisdictional meetings of the EPSCoR community facilitate interactions with NSF leadership to learn about the Foundation's strategic priorities and funding opportunities. Participation by EPSCoR researchers and educators in the merit review process across all disciplinary domains of the Foundation, in Committees of Visitors (COV) activities, in external advisory (Federal Advisory Committee Act) committees, and in disciplinary workshops that shape new activities is also vital to this integration. Outreach to EPSCoR jurisdictions by NSF staff promotes integration of the EPSCoR community into mainstream NSF programs, as does co-funding of awards with disciplinary programs of the Foundation. There is also an effort to promote in- reach, whereby EPSCoR facilitates opportunities for researchers and educators from EPSCoR jurisdictions to meet with NSF staff at the Foundation's headquarters. In these meetings, the EPSCoR participants ar e provided with information of NSF strategic priorities and funding opportunities, as well as meet with disciplinary POs. In FY 2016, EPSCoR staff facilitated approximately 35 in- reach meetings. In FY 2016, EPSCoR staff sought to promote engagement of the EPSCoR community in NSF and other national activities. Examples are : In FY 2016, EPSCoR continued its efforts to better communicate the \"EPSCoR success story\" by continuing its communication workshop, \"Becoming an EPSCoR Champion,\" which targets RII Tr ack- 1 researchers to specifically emphasize successful outcomes of EPSCoR research. T his workshop series helps researchers cultivate communication skills through disciplined, systematic messaging to convey an influential, economically- framed message that e ffectively signals the value of EPSCoR's activities. It seeks to enhance abilities to deliver the jurisdiction's scientific messages effectively, charismatically, and successfully. NSF EPSCoR has continued to encourage the involvement of EPSCoR -supported faculty in NSF committee and review panels across NSF (e.g., COVs, site visits, and merit review panels). EPSCoR continued its RII Track -2: Focused EPSCoR builds interjurisdictional collaborati ve teams of EPSCoR investigators in scientific focus areas consistent with NSF priorities, including cognitive science and neuroscience, clean energy, and food security. In addition, these awards have a particular focus on the development of early career/j unior faculty. Eleven awards were made in FY 2016. EPSCoR Reviewers (Sec. 103(d)(2)(D)) Demographics of all reviewers who evaluated EPSCoR proposals or the program in FY 2016 are as follows: of the 149 reviewers, 24 percent were underrepresented minorities, 47 percent were female, 19 percent were from EPSCoR jurisdictions, 83 percent were new reviewers for the EPSCoR program (most had prior NSF review experience), and 9 percent were new reviewers from EPSCoR jurisdictions. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 11 EPSCoR Collaborations and Partnerships (Sec. 103(d)(2)(E)) All RII awards involve collaborations among scientists and engineers in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, RII awards require i nstitutional collaborations, which are defined as collaborations between researchers at a RII awardee or sub -awardee and those at institutions not receiving any RII funds. In FY 2016, there were 909 institutional collaborations within EPSCoR jurisdictions; 774 institutional collaborations other and non- EPSCoR jurisdictions; and 255 international institutional collaborations with EPSCoR jurisdictions. These efforts highlight the vast network of institutional involvement among EPSCoR jurisdictions and their partners in RII projects. Among the 160 awards co-funded by EPSCoR in FY 2016, 82 involved collaborative research between multiple institutions. Of those 82 collaborative awards, 34 were collaborations between investigators from institutions in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions. An analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 fiscal years (Sec. 103(d)(3)) Eligibility to participate in NSF EPSCoR programmatic activities is based upon the jurisdictions' demonstrated ability to obtain NSF research funds. Currently, a jurisdiction is eligible to participate in EPSCoR programs if its level of NSF research support is equal to or less than 0.75 percent of the total NSF research and related activities budget averaged over the most recent three year period. Given EPSCoR's aim to stimulate research that is fully competitive in NSF's disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs, increases in the ability to capt ure NSF research funds serve as a proxy for gains in research competitiveness. In FY 2016, the 3- year rolling average of NSF research funds for Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah was over the 0.75 percent threshold and these jurisdictions were no longer eligible to compete in new RII competitions. Additionally, Iowa, Tennessee, and Utah exceeded the threshold for three consecutive years and were no longer EPSCoR -eligible for co -funding or outreach in FY 2016. Figure 1 (below) shows the average amount of NSF research funds by cohort for the initial five years (hatched bars) and the most recent five years (solid bars) of their participation in the NSF EPSCoR Program. A cohort is defined as the group of states or jurisdictions that entered the EPSCoR program within a given fiscal year. For example, the 1980 cohort consists of the initial five states that qualified for EPSCoR: Arkansas, Maine, Montana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. For this summary, the 2000+ cohort consists of jurisdictions that entered EPSCoR in FY 2000 or later: Alaska, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Former EPSCoR jurisdictions Iowa, Tennessee, and Utah are excluded because they were no longer EPSCoR - eligible in FY 2016. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 12 Figure 1. Percentage of NSF Research Funding by EPSCoR Cohort Each cohort shows an increase in competitiveness over the periods of participation. For example, the 1980 cohort shows a 90 percent increase in NSF research funding over the past 36 years of EPSCoR activity. The 1985 cohort (Alabama, Kentucky, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Vermont, and Wyoming) demonstrates a 58 percent increase during its 31 years of participation in EPSCoR. The 1987 cohort (Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota) shows a 94 percent increase over the past 29 years, while the 1992 cohort (Kansas and Nebraska) has an 82 percent increase in competitiveness over its 24 years of EPSCoR involvement. Jurisdictions participating in EPSCoR since FY 2000 entered into the program at a higher level of NSF research funding than the previous cohorts. For the 2000 + cohort, there has been a small, yet demonstrable 11 percent increase in research funding.

Additionally, NSF EPSCoR is working with NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability Section to develop a cohesiv e evaluation framework for the program. This evaluation will address the legislative objective of increasing the research competitiveness of jurisdictions receiving EPSCoR funding. The evaluation is informed by the findings and recommendations from the EPS CoR retrospective evaluation completed by the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) in 2012. Part of this effort involves developing an evaluation contract that will (1) develop a flexible framework to explore, define, and measure research competi tiveness in relation to the unique jurisdictional contexts and (2) use evidence of jurisdictional progress toward research competitiveness over time for strategic program improvement.

Including this transfer, BIO's total funding inFY2016 was $743.78 million. FY2018 Request funding forBIOcompared toBIO's initial FY2016 budget is a decrease of $71.67 million or 9.6 percent. BIO Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2016 Actual1FY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 RequestChange Over FY 2016 Actual About BIO BIO has three overarching goals: To support research to advance understanding of the principles and mechanisms governing life; To increase our understanding of complex interactions between living systems and their environments; and To provide real and theoretical bases for original research in other scientific disciplines and for application of science to improve the quality of life. The FY 2018 Budget Request for BIO is $672.11 million. Special emphasis will be placed on research that align s with the comprehensive BIO framework, Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL ) that will address major cha llenges in biology. These include understanding living systems across scales of size, time and place, and the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype in plants, animals, and microbes. Support for early investigators is important to ensur e adequate numbers of researchers as these research problems will require a long-term investment in tackling difficult and complex questions. BIO's top priority is core research across biology. U.S. academic research in the biological sciences depends on NSF funding; 69 percent of academic basic research in non- medical biology is supported by NSF. BIO considers this role essential to the promotion of vibrant and innovative fundamental biological research at U.S. universities and colleges, noting that BIO's programs support the real and theoretical bases for original research in other scientific disciplines as well as downstream applications of potential societal benefit . Broad support for biology is necessary to produce knowledge relevant to national needs in food, health, energy, and environment. Additionally, support for biological research will continu e a stream of economic innovations that contribute to American livelihoods, as demonstrated by progress in areas such as biofuels, biorenewable chemicals, and nanotechnology. BIO increasingly supports projects that address comprehensive questions involving multiple types of data acquisition and levels of analysis. These projects are becoming larger and more collaborative both within the biological sciences and with other fundamental disciplines. NSF is one of the few agencies where support for such integration across disciplines is possible, but achieving effective integration requires new Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO - 2 funding strategies and portfolio realignment within BI O. These strategies are reflected in the FY 2018 Budget Request . FY 2018 priorities for BIO include: Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL) : First introduced in FY 2017, s upport for URoL will continue in FY 2018 emphas izing research areas such as the genotype to phenotype challenge, plant -organismal interactions, and developing biological theory as a framework for the rules of life . Quantitative approaches that integrate the mathematical and physical sciences, computer science, and engineering into advancing basic biological understanding underpinning the study of the rules of life will continue to be encouraged. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) : Construction of NEON is expected to be complete by the spring of 2018 and BIO will assume full responsibility for operations and maintenance (O&M) , including increased funding for oversight. In FY 2018, NEON O&M funding moves f rom EF to DBI in accordance with the shift in program management and oversight that occurred in FY 2017. Funding for early NEON science, including continuing support for the MacroSystems B iology (MSB) program, remains a priority. For more information on NEON, see the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) chapter. Understanding the Brain (UtB) , including the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN ) Initiative : This cross- agency priority will be continued in FY 201 8. BIO funding for UtB, including the BRAIN Initiative, will support investment strategies designed to enable the transformational research, engineering, infrastructure development, and training required to accomplish the overall multi- year goal. Support for neuroscience activities will focus on the Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience (NeuroNex) program . Additional information for UtB is available in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Innovation: In FY 2018, t hrough funding in EF, BIO will continue invest ments in innovation activities with a focus on URoL . These activities will build on the interagency agreement , signed i n FY 2016 by NSF and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that encourage s and support s interaction among NASA and NSF personnel on origin s of life research and the joint Ideas Lab on the Origins of Life held in FY 2016 and the ensuing research funded in FY 2017.

This plan includes requirements for post -panel briefings to discuss proposed awards and declinations as well as analysis of the programs' current portfolio of awards for sci entific and demographic information; submission of annual prior -year activity reports to BIO's Office of the Assistant Director by each division which are then summarized into a directorate- wide report; and annual directorate -level portfolio analysis by th e BIO Portfolio Analysis Working Group. External Program Evaluations and Studies: DEB and IOS, working through the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, awarded a one-year contract in March 2016 to Abt Associates to conduct an external eval uation of the preliminary proposal review mechanism for core programs in the two BIO divisions. The final report was submitted to DEB and IOS in March 2017. The evaluation addressed both program and research community questions about the outcomes of the pr eliminary proposal mechanism on the research portfolio and the quality of merit review. The report is being reviewed internally and DEB and IOS plan to formulate a response that will be shared with the scientific community within CY 2017. Starting in FY 2017, BIO undertook an internal analysis of the programmatic activities of two biological infrastructure programs: Collections in Support of Biological Research and Instrument Development for Biological Research. The outcomes of th is analysis will be used to determine the future directions of these two programs and it is anticipated that a summary of the major conclusions will be released in the fourth quarter of FY 2017. Workshops and Reports: Division of Mol ecular and Cellular Biosciences MCB continued it support of workshops on the topic of reproducibility in biological sciences. In February 2017, NSF 's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS ), Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) , BIO and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) convened a workshop titled : \"Robustness, Reliability, and Reproducib ility in Scientific Research\". The resultant report lays out a strategy to engage the community in developing standards and best practices broadly across science. Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO - 6 A workshop co- funded by MCB, ENG, and DEB titled: \"Gene Drives: A Deliberative Workshop to Develop Frameworks for Research and Governance\" held Feb ruary 2016, addressed the timely and important issue of second generation g enetic engineering technologies being developed with the aim of moving synthetic gene constructs into wild animal populations. This workshop will be important in setting up mechanisms for governance of this powe rful but potentially high risk/ dual use techn ology. MCB supports the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) workshops that bring together computer scientists, computational biologists, and engineers to discuss ways to standardize existing computer languages such as System Biology Markup Language (SMBL) for mathematical modeling; the Biological Pathways Exchange Language (BioPaX) for describing pathways; the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) for visual representations; and the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). Two workshops in CY 2016 focused on broadening participation in MCB science : the \"Youth Bioinformatics Symposium\" in summer 2016, and the \" A Strategic Planning Workshop to Explore Quantitative Biology as a Vehicle for Broadening Participation\" held at S pelman College in March, 2016. These activities both engage a broader community and provide reports that provide guidance to MCB as it plans its strategic investments. Division of Integrative Organismal Systems A workshop titled Genome to Phenome Relationships -Interdisciplinary Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Scien ces\" was held in October 2015. This workshop was jointly supported by IOS, MCB, and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in MPS to identify opportunities where mathematical modeling approaches would enhance our understanding of multi -scale integration and emergent properties of organisms. A working group formed as a result of this workshop developed recommendations that have led IOS and MCB in BIO and DMS in MPS to initiate a joint venture with the Simo ns Foundation in New York, NY. Support for center -scale projects focused on the Mathematics of Complex Biological Systems will begin in FY 2018. In FY 2018 IOS anticipates support of additional workshops centered on URoL that unify the biological sciences at NSF. Topics will include high throughput phenotyping and the development of implantable nano- sensors, and e pigenetic mechanisms underlying robustness and resilience of organisms to environmental change. Division of Environmental Biology A symposium titled: Insect Effects on Ecosystem Services, held September 25 -30, 2016, introduced entomologists to broader perspectives on the variety of roles insects play in the delivery of ecosystem services and informed DEB on broader impacts of research investments in insect ecology. A meeti ng titled: Student Meeting, held June 15- 17, 2016, highlighted the development of new techniques for research, comparison of data collection and analysis techniques between institutions, discussion of ways to integrate this research into classroom settings. Two wo rkshops titled, \" Forming an integrated understanding of function across fungi\" , held in August 2016 and March 2017, brought together biologists studying disparate fungi to develop standards and protocols for comparative studies, especially with respect to genetic sequencing and trait databases. These best practices will enhance data management plans (required as part of full proposals submitted to NSF) from the broader community. In spring 2017, \"A Workshop to Explore the Shifting Landscape of Research on Biological Diversity\" will bring together U.S. scientists for the purpose of understanding the research FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress BIO - 7 implications of the Nagoya Protocol, which calls for sharing of benefits from t he use of genetic resources. In 2017, a workshop \"Addressing Data Management Challenges within Integrative Biodiversity Projects\" will bring together participants from Dimensions of Biodiversity projects to discuss the challenges in making biodiversity da ta more comparable across terrestrial to marine systems, past and present time- scales, cellular to ecosystem levels of biological organization, and diverse geographical regions. Division of Biological Infrastructure A conference titled \"Coordinating Globa l Brain Projects\" , co-sponsored by DBI and the Kavli Foundation, was held in September 2016 at The Rockefeller University , NY. This conference led to reports in several high -profile journals . The information gleaned from this conference and its subsequent reports are shaping how BIO works with the Office of International Science and Engineering ( OISE ) to engage funding agencies from the UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Israel as partners for NSF's NeuroNex program. A workshop titled, \"Optimizing N EON Science\" was held in February 2016 in Boulder, CO to highlight areas of opportunity for community engagement of NEON with the resear ch community. White papers documenting the discussions are in preparation, and workshop participants have already begun effective collaborations and a follow -on activity specifically targeted at early -stage researchers is being scheduled. A workshop titled \"Increasing Participation of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in STEM: a workshop focused on removing barriers to participation\" was held June 1- 2, 2016 in Honolulu, HI to identify barriers to participation in STEM disciplines (specifically bioscienc es and environmental science) among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. A number of barriers to STEM access were identified in the report1 for Native Americans and Pacific Islanders in addition to several recommendations for addressing them. A worksho p titled, \"Pan -REU PI Workshop: Leveraging Excellence Through Collaboration Across REU Programs\" was held April 28 -30, 2016 in Arlington, VA. The purpose was to inform the Research Experiences for Undergraduates ( REU ) program officers through the exchange of best practices in different disciplines. This award was co -funded by all NSF Directorates/Offices offering REU Sites, and each discipline was represented at the meeting. The workshop report2 made several specific recommendations, but emphasized the need for the creation of a pan REU leadership team to strengthen the pan REU community. Committees of Visitors (COV): In FY 2016, BIO held one COV in DBI. The COV convened September 13- 15, 2016, at NSF and reviewed division operations and the programmatic portfolio for the three- year period spanning FY 2013- FY 2015. Overall, the COV considered DBI to be on positive trajectory. The COV commended DBI on the improved structure and processes for manag ing the c enters portfolio and these large and mid -scale investments on behalf of BIO. The COV had recommendations for enhancing future operations of DBI : increasing multi- way communication both within DBI and between DBI and other parts of BIO in order to maximize the research impacts of infrastructure investments made by DBI; leverage the expertise the human resources cluster to strengthen efforts for broadening participation across other programs, c enters and facilities managed by the division ; and make b etter use 1 Hadfield, M.

Research at the molecular and cellular scales provides the basis for understanding normal cell processes and healthy cell function. This understanding enables the developm ent of design rules for engineering molecules and cells that contribute to the discovery and biomanufacturing of new drugs to further disease treatment or production of new commercial chemicals . MCB supports activities in URoL , including basic research to explore origins of life; determine the minimum set of protein and nucleic acid sequences and structures that can sustain life; examine mechanisms of adaptation and homeostasis/robustness of biological systems; identify the rep ertoire of gene expression that determines the relationship between genotype and phenotype; and develop new theoretical concepts that illuminate cellular decision making. A key element of BIO's funding priorities include the recognition that acquisition of data alone is insufficient to provide an understanding of rules of life. Therefore , MCB prioritizes research that utilizes models accompanied by experimental systems in which quantitative measures allow theories to be tested, refined, a nd validated. MCB gives high priority to interdisciplinary research projects at the interfaces between biology and other research Directorates. Synthetic Biology in MCB focuses on elucidating normal cellular function by buil ding simple biological systems. The expectat ion within the division, in partnership with Engineering, is that these forays into design ing and building lay the groundwork for complex engineered systems that have practical applications. Investments in research in plant science at the molecular and cellular scales are part of the MCB strategy to contrib ute to food security research. Important outcomes of research in systems and synthetic biology and molecular biophysics have led to a greater understand ing of photosynthesis , the design of strategies to move nitrogen fixation into photosynthetic organisms (decreasing dependence on fertilizer use), and systems level approaches to understanding drought tolerance in plants. In general, 65 percent of the MCB portfolio is available for new research grants . The remaining 35 percent supports research and education grants made in prior years. Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO - 10 FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represent changes over the FY 2016 Actual. Research Research funding decreases -$11.39 million to a total of $121.37 million. Support for CAREER awards decreases $1.65 million to a total of $14.39 million in FY 2018. Interdisciplinary research that results in connections across research disciplines contributing to URoL remains a priority for MCB. This support will foster foundational research activities that employ interdisciplinary, quantitative, and theory -based approaches to understand the function and evolution of living systems. Funding for small center scale activities with the Division of Physics (PHY) through the Physics Frontiers Program ($2.40 million ), and DMS through a joint public private partnership with the Simons F oundation ($600,000) are hallmarks of these investments in FY 2018. Support will be provided for the URoL emphasis through research at the interface of biology and quantitative and predictive sciences to yield insights into the fundamental molecular and cellular principles of life that provide the foundation for all of biology . Invest ments in synthetic biolog y will be aimed at supporting and developing new technologies through a foundational understanding of basic biology such as the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ( CRISPR) /Cas9 genome editing technology and the use of the tools of synthetic biology to design new kinds of experiments that enable a greater understanding of the rules of life. Efforts to understand how large biopolymer (proteins, DNA, RNA) sequence gi ves rise to its structure, self -assembly into larger macromolecular co mplexes such as ribosomes or chromatin, and how sequence and structure gives rise to function of these macromolecular machines that govern all biological processes in living systems will be continued . MCB will c ontribute to Advanced Manufacturing by suppor ting research on computational design of biological systems from proteins to organisms to microbial communities that can synthesize fuels, chemicals, and materials, the development of tools and standards in synthetic biology as an approach to the rapid dev elopment of biomanufacturing platforms, and the foundational molecular scale research that will produce the next generation of nano -, bio -, and information technologies.

Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 20 APPENDIX A - HIGH -PERFORMANCE COMPUTING PORTFOLIO Petascale Computing $8.33 - $60.00 Innovative HPC 42.82 2016 ActualFY 2017 2018 RequestHigh Performance Computing Funding (Dollars in Millions) NSF has been a leader in the use of High -Performance Computing (HPC) to advance discovery for almost four decades . NSF aims to sustain its leadership in the research, development, and broad deployment of existing as well as new HPC technologies and skills in part through its leadership of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) in partne rship with the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE), and together with the participation of other federal agencies and the private sector . OAC co-leads NSCI with MPS, and represents NSF in its leadership role across the federal govern ment . Key foci include fundamental discoveries to support future generations of advanced computing; research and cyberinfrastructure promoting cohesive platforms and interoperability for large -scale data analytics as well as modeling and simulation; and su pport for a comprehensive advanced computing ecosystem for science and engineering research . These foci include an emphasis on a holistic approach to the Nation's science and engineering computational infrastructure as well as learning and workforce development. The overall NSF HPC strategy and program portfolio receives guidance and input from the Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure (ACCI); NSF cross -directorate Assistant Directors (AD) Council, which includes ADs and Office Heads from the various NSF research directorates and offices; and the cross - directorate working group for NSCI . In 2013, ACI supported the initiation of a two- year National Academies' study to further inform the implementation of its HPC strategy in the 2017 to 2020 timeframe. The National Academies published the final report, Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017- 2020, in 2016. 20 PETASCALE COMPUTING - BLUE WATERS Description A key component of NSF's current HPC investment is its support of a \"leadership -class\" HPC resource called Blue Waters. Blue Waters, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world and the fastest supercomputer deployed on a university campus, is based at the National Center for Supe rcomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign (UIUC) . The Blue Waters system became operational in December 2012, and the archival storage availability came online in March 2013. It is operated by NCSA and includes the Gr eat Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computing (GLCPC) as a partner. Since becoming operational in 2012, Blue Waters has allowed researchers to tackle much larger and more complex research challenges than ever before possible across and within disciplines as diverse as biology, astronomy, engineering, materials science, and the geosciences. Examples of transformational research enabled by Blue Waters include: biophysicist Klaus Schulten and his team at UIUC used experimental data combined with simulations on Blue Waters to discover the precise chemical structure of the hard -shell 20 Budget Request to Congress CISE - 21 capsid encasing the HIV virus (with funding from NIH)21; a public -private collaboration among multiple federal agencies, universities, and companies brought together data, expertise, and the unique capabilities of Blue Waters to create the first -ever publicly -available, high -resolution elevation maps of the Arctic22; and ExxonMobil geoscientists and NCSA recently demonstrated a massive parallel reservoir simulation that ran thousands of times faster than typical oil and gas industry reservoir simulations, in turn allowing faster, more cost -effective, and environmentally- responsible decisions. 23 Blue Waters complements the diverse set of national resources provided through the Innovative HPC program and eXtreme Digital (XD) environment described below . While Innovative HPC supports a portfolio of technically diverse systems capable of supporting hundreds to thousands of researchers over the course of a year, Blue Waters provides resources to focus on a small set of the largest and most computationally intensive scientific advances demanding petascale capabilities. (For more information on Innovative HPC, see the \"Innovativ e HPC Program\" section below.) XD differs as well from Blue Waters in that XD delivers a more diverse set of capabilities generally at smaller scale but to a much larger community . (For more information on XD, see the \"XD Program\" section below.) The broader impacts of Blue Waters include provisioning unique infrastructure for research and education; extensive efforts accelerating education and training in the use of HPC in science and engineering; training in petascale computing techniques; promoting an exchange of information between academia and industry about the applications of petascale computing; and broadening participation in computational science and engineering through NCSA's Girls Engaged in Mathematics and Science (GEMS) program . The GEMS program is designed to encourage middle -school girls to consider mathematics - and science- oriented careers. Current Status Following system testing and acceptance in December 2012, and acceptance of the NCSA archival system in March 2013, the Blue Waters project entered a five- year operations phase . Support for the first six months of operations was provided in the acquisition and deployment award. Support for the remaining operational phase, from FY 2014 through mid -FY 2018, was provided in a separate aw ard to UIUC in FY 2013. The Blue Waters education and outreach projects are ongoing; they target pre -college, undergraduate, graduate, and post -graduate students. For example, a Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering was established as part of the project, creating courses and certificate programs focusing on petascale computing and petascale -enabled science and engineering. The Blue Waters project also has sponsored workshops, conferences, summer schools, and seminars. An annual series o f Petascale Workshops is targeted at the developers of simulation packages and aspiring application developers, and provides scientists and engineers with the knowledge and expertise needed to develop applications for Blue Waters and other petascale comput ers. The project also includes industrial partnership activities . The Industry Partners in Petascale Engagement (IPIPE) program provides industrial partners with a first look at the technological and scientific developments that flow from the petascale program . The Independent Software Vendor Application Scalability Forum promotes collaborations among consortium members, independent software vendors, and the industrial end- user community . In addition, annual extreme -scale workshops are held jointly with the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project . The Blue Waters team also hosts summer workshops and has created and offered courses through the Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering mentioned above . Partnering wit h the Shodor Foundation, a nonprofit national resource for computational science education, 21 https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/204804 22 http://nga.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=cf2fba21df7540fb981f8836f2a97e25 23 www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/exxonmobil_sets_record_on_ncsas_blue_waters_supercomputer Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 22 the Blue Waters project offers undergraduate petascale course materials and internships. Despite the success of the Blue Waters supercomputer, the system is reachi ng its natural obsolescence, and will complete its operational cycle in March 2019, when a no- cost extension for the operations and maintenance award of the system, approved by NSF in FY 2016, ends . With the extension of the operational end date of Blue Waters to 2019, the system will have run for roughly two years longer than the typical lifetime for a system of this type. Among the activities anticipated in FY 2018 is support for a follow -on leadership -class computing resource, succeeding Blue Waters an d with attributes to be determined based on scientific and engineering priorities. Continuation of the program beyond the operational end date of Blue Waters is guided by input from a number of stakeholder groups . These include the ACCI; AD Council ; NSF p rogram staff spanning the Foundation's research directorates and offices; the cross- directorate NSCI working group; and the National Academies' study section mentioned above . Additionally, international activities to accelerate investments in leadership- class computing, particularly in Europe and Asia, are providing additional urgency and importance for this investment strategy to maintain the Nation's global leadership role in science and engineering. Science and engineering research and education activit ies enabled by Blue Waters Blue Waters is enabling investigators across the country to conduct innovative research demanding petascale capabilities. In particular, allocations of time on Blue Waters are awarded to research teams through the NSF Petascale C omputing Resource Allocations (PRAC) program . To date, the PRAC program has received over 448 requests for usage to support research across a wide spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines, and it has made 233 awards to research teams\u2014a 95% over -subscription request rate. The next PRAC call is anticipated in November 2017. The research topics the PRAC program supports include: complex biological behavior in fluctuating environments; electronic properties of strongly correlated systems; properties o f hydrogen and hydrogen- helium mixtures in astrophysically- relevant conditions; electronic and magnetic structures of transition metal compounds; molecular dynamics responsible for the properties of liquid water; and propagation of seismic energy through a detailed structural model of Southern California together with prediction of ground motion and modeling of the response of buildings and other structures . Other allocations address testing hypotheses about the role of cloud processes and ocean mesoscale e ddy mixing; formation of the first galaxies; turbulent stellar hydrodynamics; binary black hole and neutron star systems as sources of gamma ray bursts; and other intense radiation phenomena, contagion, and particle physics. To date, 89 science teams have published over 618 scientific papers based on research conducted using Blue Waters allocations. Furthermore, the project has issued calls for educational allocations directly involving students, including the Blue Waters Undergraduate Student Internship P rogram (20 students in 2016) and Blue Waters Graduate Fellowship Program (10 awards in 2016) . After three years in service, Blue Waters has supported research in 219 U.S. academic institutions, 40 laboratories, institutes, and centers, and 21 industrial or ganizations. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The project is overseen by OAC's program directors and NSF Division of Grants and Agreement (DGA) staff . These NSF staff receive strategic advice from the AD Council . Advice from the NSF Office of General Counsel (OGC) is also sought as necessary. External Structure: During the development and acquisition phase of this project, UIUC oversaw work by a number of sub- awardees, conducted software development, and assisted competitively -selected research groups to prepare to use the Blue Waters system . The primary sub -awardee, Cray, is responsible for maintenance of the hardware, system software, and main program development tools. Other sub-FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 23 awardees worked on extreme -scale parallel algorithm and method development, the engagement of applications groups, scalable performance tools, undergraduate training, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in HPC . During the operational phase, the project team is advised by the Science and Engineering Team Advisory Committee (SETAC) whose composition and roles were reviewed and approved by an external panel in July 2013. This Committee is composed of representatives from research teams with Blue Waters allocations, industry scientists pursui ng petascale applications, and the GLCPC. Risks: The National Science Board (NSB) will receive updates on any major change in risk assessment, which is reviewed annually by an external panel . Risks identified during the operational phase of the project include system security, power costs, and performance/reliability/usability due to large system scale. Reviews: The project was initially selected through a competitive merit review process in 2007, and a subsequent renewal proposal was reviewed and approved in 2013. An external panel of experts, selected by NSF, periodically reviews the progress of the project including project management, risk management, hardware and software performance, usability and reliability, and the provision of advanced user suppo rt to research groups receiving resource allocations on the Blue Waters system . One of the important roles of this external review panel is to analyze the awardee's assessments of intellectual merit and broader impacts based on the use of the system for re search and education . To date, these external reviews have been conducted in February 2008, April 2008, October 2008, April 2009, July 2009, December 2009, April 2010, September 2010, December 2010, February 2011, May 2011, September 2011, March 2012, August 2012, December 2012, July 2013, December 2014, December 2015, and January 2017 . OAC staff provided an update to the NSB in February 2015. Detailed information on the project's progress can be found in the project's publically- available annual reports.24 INNOVATIVE HPC PROGRAM Description Systems funded under the Innovative HPC program provide petascale peak performance . The Innovative HPC program portfolio is intended to be technically diverse, reflecting changing and growing use of computation in both the research and education processes, including through systems capable of supporting hundreds to thousands of researchers (over the course of a year) conducting leading -edge science and engineering . Additionally, the Innovative HPC program portfolio supports, complements, and extends campus and regional research cyberinfrastructures. All Innovative HPC program awards are made in the context of the XD program (described below). There is a direct relationship between the Innovative HPC and XD programs . Seve ral systems are currently serving as allocable resources within XD . Innovative HPC awards ar e generally made as two parts: an acquisition component with associated funding, and an operations and maintenance component with associated funding . Some Innovativ e HPC program awards do not separate these components because of the experimental nature of the systems. When an award is made, funding is provided to the institution, which issues sub- awards to vendors for acquisitions as necessary . Once a system has passed the acceptance process, vendors receive final payment for the system . After the system has been fully tested, it becomes an XD resource, and the institution becomes an XD resource provider . At this point, the award funding may be used for operations and maintenance of the system. Beginning with the FY 2011 Innovative HPC program solicitation, High Performance System Acquisition: Enhancing the Petascale Computing Environment for Science and Engineering, a more sustained approach to the largest HPC services was initiated . This solicitation was based on feedback from the scientific and engineering community, providing a longer time horizon for funding HPC providers in recognition of the 24 https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/annual-report Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 24 value and time required for building and retaining staff skilled in interdisciplinary computational science . Thus, an eight - to 10 -year award horizon is envisioned for a core HPC provider . This timeline begins with an acquisition award, which allows for the possibility of a renewal acquisition award four years after the original award . In addition to the acquisition awards, accompanying operations and maintenance awards are planned. Current Status Machines that have been operational in the Innovative HPC program over the years include Stampede, Keeneland, Kraken, Lonestar, Longhorn, and these, Stampede continues to be supported by NSF. In addition, f our new resources, Comet, Bridges, Jetstream, and Wrangler, began operation in FY 2015 and FY 2016. Wrangler, came online in FY 2015 at the University of Texas at Austin. Wrangler is the most powerful data analysis system allocated in XD, with 10 petabytes (PB) of replicated, secure, high -performance data storage. The system consists of 3,000 embedded processing cores for data analysis; 120 Intel Haswell -based servers for data access and embedded analytics; and a large- scale flash storage tier for analytics, with bandwidth of one terabyte per second (TB/s) and 275 million Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) . Wran gler further provides flexible support for a wide range of software stacks, including Hadoop and relational data . These are integrated with Globus Online services for rapid and reliable data transfer and sharing . Support for ongoing Wrangler operations and maintenance, starting in FY 2015 and continuing through FY 2019, is provided to the University of Texas at Austin at a level of approximately 20 percent of the initial acquisition cost per annum, consistent with the level specified in the FY 2013 Innovati ve HPC program solicitation. Comet also came online in FY 2015 at the University of California, San Diego. It was deployed to support research interests and priorities requiring large, high -throughput workloads as well as the \"long tail of science,\" which encompasses the idea that a large number of modestly -sized, computationally -based research projects still represent a tremendous amount of research and scientific impact . Notably, as a resource responsive to the \"long tail of science,\" Comet is particular ly well- suited for science gateway use. Its heterogeneous configuration supports not only complex simulations, but also advanced analytics and visualization of outputs. Bridges came online in FY 2016 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University . Bridges provides an innovative and groundbreaking HPC and data analytics system integrating advanced memory technologies to empower new communities, bringing desktop convenience to HPC, connecting to campuses, and intuitively integrating data -intensive workflows to increase the scientific output of a large community of scientific and engineering researchers who have not traditionally used HPC resources by lowering the barrier of entry to HPC . Bridges extends HPC's impact to mi nority - serving institutions and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) states, raising the level of computational awareness at four -year colleges, and promoting computational thinking in high - schools. The fourth resource, Jetstream , also came online in FY 2016 at Indiana University . Jetstream is a new type of data analytics and computational resource for the open science and engineering research community, enabling interactive use by researchers to conduct research anytime, anywhere. Jetstream complements the current NSF -funded computational resources portfolio by bringing online a cloud- based system incorporating the best elements of commercial cloud computing resources with some of the best software in existence for solving importa nt scientific problems . Jetstream enables new modes of sharing data and computational analysis, allowing for increased scientific reproducibility and enabling many U.S. scientists and engineers to make new discoveries that are important to understanding the world around us, improving the quality of life of American citizens, and promoting America's competitive standing. FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 25 Bridges and Jetstream, singularly and collectively, significantly broadened the spectrum of system capabilities supported by OAC's Innovat ive HPC program by delivering innovative computational resources to an increasingly diverse community and portfolio of scientific research and education projects, with the goal of including new communities with new and creative approaches and priorities that are different from the more traditional HPC users, and that would benefit from advanced computational capabilities at the national level. The Stampede project at the University of Texas at Austin delivered a new system for allocation of NSF XD cyberinf rastructure services in January 2013, and will continue to operate through September 2017. The resources and accompanying services target science and engineering researchers using both advanced computational methods and emerging data -intensive approaches . The system boosted XD resources to nearly twice their previous capacity, and provided researchers with early access to Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors, which were accepted in August 2013 . An additional technical upgrade to Stampede was awarded in FY 2016, adding 508 updated \"Knights Landing\" processors and an Omni Path highspeed interconnect to the system contributing two- fold value to advance research . This technical upgrade provided significantly increased memory and enhanced performance for r esearchers, along with a production operations platform for researchers to bridge to future many- core computing architectures and computational parallelism through 2021. Consistent with the FY 2011 Innovative HPC program solicitation, High Performance Sys tem Acquisition: Enhancing the Petascale Computing Environment for Science and Engineering, that resulted in the acquisition, development, and deployment of Stampede, in FY 2016 NSF awarded Stampede 2: The Next Generation of Petascale Computing for Science and Engineering to the University of Texas at Austin following a rigorous merit review, enabling the acquisition, development, and deployment of \"Stampede 2\" as a successor resource to Stampede. Stampede 2 will serve as the primary n ational resource (\"workhorse\") for thousands of U.S. academic researchers, complement other national HPC resources, and provide capabilities beyond the reach of campuses and regional resources, including support for multiscale modeling, simulation, and dat a-intensive research . Stampede 2 will be deployed into production operation through three phases: progressive installations of Knights Landing many- core nodes responsive to interests in high computation processing; addition of highly complementary SkyLake processors responsive to data- intensive computing; and final deployment of persistent memory to the previously deployed Skylake processors to significantly enhance overall system performance. Stampede 2 will serve the high -end, open science community through production operations beginning in FY 2017 and continuing through FY 2021. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Innovative HPC Innovative HPC is enabling world- leading transformative advances in science and engineering r esearch, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups . These advances are enabled by providing researchers and educators with usable access to computational resources beyond those typically available on most campuses, together with the interfaces, consulting support, and training necessary to facilitate their use. Through the unifying XD framework and services, the Innovative HPC program enables researchers to manipulate extremely large amounts of digital information from simulation, sensors, and experiments, and adds needed capabilities in remote visualization, an increasingly important analysis tool for modern science and engineering . The complete spectrum of scientific research can leverage Innovative HPC program resources. This includes economics, cosmology and astrophysics, geosciences, climate and weather modeling, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine, earthquake engineering, and mechanical engineering. Outreach and training critical to reducing the barriers to the use of systems supported by the Innovative HPC program by the research and education community will be provided by engaging research universities Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 26 and foundations . The Innovative HPC program incorporate s new computational technologies and new approaches to software and data management, together with the expertise to enable researchers and students to complement theory and experiment with an equal emphasis in computation. Management and Oversight NSF St ructure: OAC's program directors provide direct oversight during both the acquisition and operations and maintenance phases . Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors . The program directors also hold bi -weekly teleconferences with the awardees. External Structure: Each Innovative HPC program award is managed under a cooperative agreement . Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones in order for the spending authoriza tion to be raised. Progress is assessed by annual reviews and the NSF program directors. Each project has a detailed management plan in place. Each cooperative agreement includes the management structure, milestones, spending authorization levels, and rev iew schedule. Risks: Any activity of this nature, and at this scale, comes with a certain element of risk . The review process, conducted prior to award, analyzes the risks as presented in the proposal and identifies any additional risks that should be considered . The funded projects are experimental in nature; therefore, they encompass high -risk, high -reward scenarios. The award process requires that risks be identified and analyzed, and that a mitigation plan be created and followed . One of the activities of the periodic NSF external reviews, conducted by an external panel of experts, is to revisit and assess the risk situation and make recommendations as deemed necessary . Risks that are no longer applicable are retired . New risks may be added, or the degr ee of risk promoted or demoted as necessary, all of which is documented in a risk register . Typically, project risks are substantially reduced subsequent to deployment . Thus, pacing of acquisitions and deployments allows balance in overall portfolio risk f or the Innovative HPC program. Reviews: Semi -annual reviews are typically performed during the acquisition phase . Annual reviews, conducted by an external panel of expert reviewers, are performed during the operational phase of each project . OAC program directors manage the reviews. The reviewers' backgrounds include scientific research, project management, large- scale systems acquisitions and operations, and familiarity with projects funded by NSF as well as other federal agencies. To the extent possible , continuity through this series of reviews is provided by using the same set of reviewers. EXTREME DIGITAL (XD) PROGRAM Description The Extreme Digital (XD) program adds value to the Innovative HPC program by coordinating the HPC resources, providing advanced assistance to the user community, and broadening participation. The vision is to create and sustain an advanced, nationally -distributed, open cyberinfrastructure comprising shared user and management services, supercomputing, storage, analysis, vi sualization systems, data services, and science gateways connected by high -bandwidth networks, integrated by coordinated policies and operations, and supported by computing and technology experts. XD enables and supports leading -edge scientific discovery and promotes science and technology education . The program encourages innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high- end digital services, while ensuring that the infrastru cture continues to deliver high- quality access for the many researchers and educators who use it in their work. XD shared services consist of several interrelated parts: allocation of resources to computational and data research projects; advanced user assistance; training, education, and outreach; architecture and operation of FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 27 an integrated digital services infrastructure; metrics services; and overall coordination . The X D Metrics Service (XMS) is a separate award, while all other services constitute the XSEDE project . These elements are designed and implemented in a way that is clearly tied to the requirements of the science and engineering research community, using a fle xible methodology that permits the architecture to evolve in response to changing community needs and that presents individual users with a common environment regardless of where the resources or researchers are located. Current Status Two awards are curr ently active within the XD program: XSEDE and XMS. The smaller XMS award was made in 2015 to the University at Buffalo - The State University of New York . This award provides metrics services allowing measurement of key operational data for both resources and services. The XSEDE award to UIUC was renewed in September 2016, continuing the prior XSEDE award for another five -year period . There are 18 XSEDE partners engaged via subawards to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (National Institute for Comput ational Sciences), Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center), University of Texas at Austin (Texas Advanced Computing Center), University of California, San Diego (San Diego Supercomputing Center), Universit y of Chicago, Indiana University, Purdue University, Shodor Education Foundation, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Southeastern Universities Research Association, Cornell University, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Georgia Institute of Technolog y, Oklahoma State University, University of Georgia, Oklahoma University, University of Southern California, and University of Arkansas . XSEDE has annual external reviews at NSF, with the first review of the renewed project scheduled to take place in June 2017. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by XD XD services enable transformative advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engi neering to underrepresented groups . This is accomplished by providing researchers and educators with coherent and highly usable access to extreme -scale digital resources beyond those typically available on most campuses, together with the interfaces, consu lting, advanced user support, and training necessary to facilitate their use. XD provides HPC services; enables researchers to manipulate extremely large amounts of digital information from simulations, sensors, and experiments; and adds needed capabiliti es in remote visualization, an increasingly important analysis tool for modern science and engineering. XD's XSEDE project is developing tools and services that not only link users to national facilities, but also enable scientific collaborations of geogr aphically distributed teams . In doing so, it facilitates access to digital resources and experimental testbeds within and across university campuses, as well as government laboratories. The XSEDE project includes outreach and training critical to reducing the barriers to the use of advanced digital systems by the research and education communities . The project incorporates new ideas and technologies to enable researchers and students to move transparently between local and national resources, substantially lowering the barriers to effective use of cyberinfrastructure and promoting enhanced productivity. XD's XMS project develops novel methods and tools to collect data from a diverse set of sources, to store the data, and to provide user interfaces for view ing the data by different stakeholder communities. The immediate users of these methods and tools are the operators and users of NSF's HPC resources. However, the new principles and methods have the potential to reach broad communities in research and education that deal with the collection, storage, analysis, and use of data. Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 28 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: OAC's program directors oversee the XD projects. XSEDE has an external advisory board, a user board, and a service provider forum to ensure that all stakeholders can provide project input. OAC oversight of the XSEDE project includes participation in weekly teleconferences with senior XSEDE personnel and in quarterly project -wide staff meetings. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. External Structure: Each XD award is managed under a cooperative agreement . Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to processing of grant increments . Each project has a detailed management plan in place. Each cooperative agreement includes the management structure, milestones, spending levels over time, and review schedule. Risk: While XD is operational in nature, the virtual organizations of the XSEDE project and the services of all XD projects are innovative and thus bear inherent risks . The projects maintain risk registers that are reviewed periodically by external panels and by the cognizant program directors . Identified risks and planned actions are reporte d to, and reviewed with, the program directors. Reviews: Annual reviews (for XSEDE) and mid- project reviews (for XMS) are conducted by external panels of expert reviewers. OAC program directors manage these reviews. The reviewers' backgrounds include scientific research, project management, operations of HPC centers, and familiarity with projects funded by NSF as well as other federal agencies. To strike a balance between continuity and broad community engagement, approximately half of the annual revie w panel members have served in this role previously while the other half are new members.

In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) to study The Future of Center-Based, Multidisciplinary Engineering Research. This topic arose from discuss ions NAE held with the NRC on the future of NSF's center-based, multidisciplinary engineering resear ch. To help inform the study, the National Academies held a public symposium on Apr il 6, 2016, and published a proceedings.1 The study report2, delivered May 2, 2017, articulates a vision fo r the future of NSF-supported center-scale, multidisciplinary engineering research, which ENG will carefully consider for the path ahead. A study of the feasibility of performing rigorous impact evaluation of the I-Corps Teams program was completed in FY 2014. Based on the feasibility st udy, NSF initiated a rigorous evaluation of the I- Corps Teams program in FY 2016. A report will be available in FY 2018. During FY 2017, ENG engaged in developing an evaluation framework for the directorate that identifies outcomes to be monitored across programs so that individual program evaluation efforts are minimized. A measurement framework with fo ur areas of activity: research, human capital development and partnerships, cente rs and networks, and construction of physical, virtual and cyber infrastructure was developed with participation of repr esentatives from all divisions. It is expected that this framework will be used to develop an outcome monitoring system for all programs using internal Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) data, extern al data sets (patents and bibliometric data), and potentially a common survey. This activity elimin ated the need for indivi dual longitudinal outcome monitoring systems (e.g., for the Emerging Frontie rs in Research and Innovation (EFRI) program). In FY 2016, IIP collected data for the PFI: Acce lerating Innovation Research (AIR) and PFI: Building Innovation Capacity (BIC) programs based on their theories of action and, in FY 2017, ENG finalized 1 A Vision for the Future of Center-Based Multidisci plinary Engineering Research symposium proceedings: www.nap.edu/catalog/23645 /a-vision-for-the-future-of-center-based-mu ltidisciplinary-engineering-research port: www.nap.edu/catalog/24767/a- new-vision-for-center-based- engineering-research FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress ENG - 7 a report for the longitudinal outcomes of the PFI:A IR program to date. A report for the PFI:BIC program is being finalized. Workshops and Reports: With support from ECCS, Boston University organi zed a Smart Cities workshop on December 3-4, 2015, and prepared a report.3 The workshop brought together resea rchers and technical leaders from academia, industry, and municipal government to set a short- and long-term research agenda for emerging issues in Smart and Connected Communities. Such issues span a variety of fields and specialized disciplines such as: transportation, environment, energy, building design and management, urban planning, sensor and actuator networks, social science, economics, software platform design, and data management. The workshop outcomes were inco rporated in the focus of the NSF solicitation, S&CC: and Connected Commun ities (16-610), funded in FY With support from CBET, the Department of Ener gy and others, a National Academies workshop on The Changing Landscape of Hydrocarbon Feedstoc ks for Chemical Production-Implications for Catalysis was held on March 7-8, 2016. The workshop proceedings 4 identified gaps and opportunities in catalysis research in an era of shifting feedst ocks, from crude oil to natural gas, for chemical production. This activity helps U.S. researchers a nd funding agencies understand the most critical areas of science and engineering research to help realize th e potential of the shale g as revolution for the U.S. chemical industry. In FY 2016, EFMA co-funded a three-year study on Grand Challenges in Environmental Engineering by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.5 The study will identify high- priority challenges for environmental engineering an d science for the next several decades. The report will shape the growth of university departments, in spire the next generation of engineers and scientists to address the most pressing global environmenta l challenges, and improve the training of environmental engineers and scientists to better meet these challenges. It will also help inform NSF program directors of emerging areas for research . The first of three planned public workshops associated with the study was held May 4-5, 2017. CMMI supported a three-day workshop on Predictiv e, Theoretical, and Computational Approaches for Additive Manufacturing, hosted by the National Acad emies of Sciences, U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics during October 7-9, 2015. The goal of the workshop was to identify key knowledge gaps in theoretical and comput ational approaches to additive manufacturing from computer science, materials science, and engineeri ng perspectives. The workshop identified key needs for an understanding of material behavior during additive processes, in-situ measurement and real-time analytic methods for process validation and cont rol, multi-scale and multi-physics modeling, and increased leveraging of high power computing for predictive models of process-structure-property- performance relationships in additively pr oduced parts, and the workshop proceedings 6 set out a roadmap for the additive manufacturing community. The activity motivated follow-up workshops on Mechanical Behavior of Additive Manufactured Com ponents, sponsored by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the National Institu te of Standards and Technology (NIST), as well as proposed additive manufacturing benchmark tests performed by researchers at NIST. In FY 2015, EFMA funded the Expl oring Innovation Frontiers Initiativ e (EIFI), a two-year, national public-private effort to shape a nd strengthen future U.S. innova tion and competitiveness led by the Council on Competitiveness.

Research included in the EEC portfolio spans bot h the physical/life sciences and engineering, from nanostructured materials to new devi ce concepts, subsystems, and systems. Applications range across a wide spectrum, such as energy, medicine, telecommunications, nanoelectronics, manufacturing, civil infrastructure, the environment, computer networks, cybersecurity, and others. Also included are formal scholarly studies in the professional formation of engi neers, which can lead to innovations in engineering education and career development. The complex, integrative role of EEC requires a comp rehensive infrastructure of people, equipment, and centers. Fresh, creative approaches to developing the e ngineering workforce are vital, as a lack of properly prepared engineers is a critical barrier to a healthy U.S. economy. EEC invests in faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and K-12 teachers. As nontraditional students\u2014such as part-time, delayed enrollment, veteran, and othe rs\u2014comprise more than 70 percent of the general undergraduate population, EEC is defining unique alternative pa thways for these students, especially veterans, to successfully earn degrees in engineering. The programs in EEC are administratively managed within four categories: (1) Major Centers and Facilities; (2) Engineering Education Research; (3) Engineering Workforce Development; and (4) Broadening Participation in Engineering. Major Ce nters and Facilities is comprised of the signature Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program and the sunsetting Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSECs). They provide the framework for interdisciplinary research and education, development, and technology transfer in partnership with academia , industry, and government. Engineering Education Research advances new productive engineering peda gogy and learning strategies in traditional and non- traditional environments. This category also includes EEC 's participation in the NSF-wide activity, IUSE, which integrates the agency's investments in undergra duate education. Engineer ing Career Development includes programs such as REU and Research Expe riences for Teachers (RET). Broadening Participation in Engineering supports research and activities that enhance opportunities for underrepresented groups by addressing structural inequalities and biases within edu cational and workforce systems. This category also includes EEC's engagement with the NSF INCLUDES in itiative, which integrates the agency's investments to build on and scale up what works in broadening participation programs. In general, 26 percent of the EEC portfolio is compri sed of new research grants. The remaining 74 percent funds continuing grants and cooperativ e agreements made in previous y ears. This high fraction of multi- year commitments is primarily a consequence of cente rs funding, which includes awards made as five-year Directorate for Engineering ENG - 16 cooperative agreements. FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases repres ent change over the FY 2016 Actual. Research Support for the ERC program increases by $1.11 milli on, to a total of $57.50 million. This funding level provides support for 14 existing centers. The ERC program supports basic and translational research of national priorities such as water, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and critical civil infrastructure. The program will also invest in resear ch related to NSCI to enable future HPC systems in the post-Moore's Law era of device and hardware systems. EEC's ERC portfolio includes four Nanosystems ERCs: three whose funding began in FY 2012 and one whose funding began in FY 2015. Education In FY 2018, EEC will pause support (-$3.98 million, to a total of zero) for IUSE/Professional Formation of Engineers: REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (IUSE/PFE:RED), which enables engineering departments to achie ve significant sustainable changes necessary to overcome long-standing issues in th eir undergraduate programs and educate inclusive communities of engineering students prepared to solve 21st century challenges. The program is moving to an every- other-year solicitation cycle. Funding for the REU Sites program is decreased by $2.65 million, to a total of $10.75 million. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects specifically designed for the REU program. REU has been found to be one of the most effective avenues for attracting and retaining students in engineering and for preparing them for careers in this field. REU projects also offer an opportunity to tap the Nation's diverse student talent pool and broaden participation in science and engineering. Funding for RET is increased by $20,000, to a total of $4.25 million. Over the past ten years, the RET in Engineering Sites program has provided K-12 teachers and community college faculty the opportunity to gain research experience in univers ity laboratories. The professional development gained by the participants through this unique experience has enriched th eir performance in the classroom and their guidance of students toward engineering. The increase will support these participants in areas of national need such as sustai nability, energy, manufacturing, robotics, and others. EEC will provide $1.40 million, ro ughly equal to the FY 2016 Ac tual, to support the agency's broadening participation program NSF INCLUDES.

The NSF-wide portfolio for Risk and R esilienc e research will be supported through GEO's PREEVENTS activity at a level of $13.0 million . Overall GEO support for PREEVENTS remains unchanged. ICER support for SEES falls to zero in FY 2018, reflecting the phase -out of this activity. ICER supports a varied portfolio of international collaborative activities. In FY 2018, this will total $6.43 million, and emphasize collaborative research across the Americas and activities sponsored by the Belmont Forum , a group of the world's leading and emerging funding agencies focused on providing international, multi -lateral research opportunities for sust ainability . FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress GEO - 11 Education In FY 2018, the ICER education portfolio is decreased by $ 4.79 million to $11.70 million. ICER supports most of GEO's participation in NSF -wide education programs, many of which are seeing reductions in FY 2018. Infrastructure ICER provide d GEO's contribution to the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure . GEO support for this activity is being phased out in FY 2018 (-$300,000) . In FY 2018, ICER will no longer provide support for operation and maintenance for the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). This temporary support, from FY 2015 - 2017, helped enable OCE to maintain a robust research enterprise while transition ing its' facilities in response to the National Academy of Scie nces' report Sea Change: Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences 3 www.nap.edu/catalog/21655/sea -change-2015-2025 -decadal -survey -of-ocean -sciences Directorate for Geosciences DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES (OCE ) $323,020,000 -$36,810,000 / 2.00 -1.13 -36.1% Centers Funding (total) 5.00 - 5.00 - - STC: Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations 5.00 - 5.00 - - Education 5.30 - 5.30 - - Infrastructure 186.19 - Fleet Ocean Discovery Program (total) Class Vessels - - -3.09 -100.0%Change Over FY ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request OCE supports interdisciplinary research and technology, education, and cutting edge infrastructure that advances our scientific knowledge of the oceans to support the U.S. economy over the long term, provide vital information regarding national and economi c security matters such as sea level rise, ocean storms and influences on weather, and to advance U.S. leadership in ocean science and technology. OCE provides support of basic scientific and technological research to better understand changing ocean circulation and other physical, chemical, and biological parameters. OCE also supports research on the geology of the ocean margins and sub -seafloor to investigate the stability of methane hydrates, natural hazards associated with earthquakes and volcanic erupt ions, microbial life deep below the seafloor, and other fundamental ocean processes of high societal relevance. Ocean education emphasizes undergraduate REU programs and the interdisciplinary nature of ocean sciences and marine technology, and commonly lev erages off research facilities and infrastructure via telepresence to far and distant seas. Since ocean science requires access to the sea, in partnership with the Office of Naval Research and academic institutions, OCE supports research vessels, deep subm ergence capability including submersibles and autonomous vehicles, and technologically advanced sensors and instrumentation. OCE research, technology, and infrastructure benefits society by advancing our understanding of natural hazards, defining the state of the ocean that contributes to understanding of weather, providing the scientific basis to ocean behavior of relevance to fisheries and aquaculture, and overall addresses the central role of the oceans as a national strategic resource, as recognized by numerous reviews by external bodies (e.g., National Academy of Sciences' Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences, 2015- 2025, Sea Change ). In general, 32 percent of the OCE portfolio is available for new research grants in basic science and technological innovati on. The remaining 68 percent supports ongoing awards made in prior years , as well as the major research infrastructure of the Academic Research Fleet, the International Ocean Discovery Program, and the Ocean Observatories Initiative. FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represent changes over the FY 2016 Actual. FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress GEO - 13 Research OCE's budget for disciplinary and interdisciplinary research will decrease by $15.96 million , to a total of $132.25 million , which reflects a strategic re- apportioning to continue to support ocean science research and technology programs as per Sea Change (National Academy of Sciences, 2015) recommendations. In FY 2018, OCE will specifically continue to invest resources into ocean technology v ia OCE's own programs as well as in coordination with other federal agencies. OCE will no longer participate in the Ocean s and Human Health program, which was jointly supported with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Education There is no change in OCE support ($5.30 million) for REU programs and other interdisciplinary education efforts. Infrastructure OCE is decreasing support of ship operations within the Academic Research Fleet by $ 4.99 million, to a level of $77. 8 million, due to the decrease in overall number of vessels, efficiencies gained by technological investment, as well as a fundamental reassessment of the provision of seismic capabilities to the U.S. academic and federal communities. This decrease is consistent wit h the recommendations from Sea Change . Funding is requested for continued support for operations of the drilling vessel, JOIDES Resolution, as part of the U.S. contribution to the IODP. The FY 2018 Request of $48.0 million maintains level funding with no decrease in maintenance and operations per Sea Change . The total support for operations and maintenance of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) will be decreased by $9.98 million from OCE, in addition to a n end to ICER support , resulting in a total OOI support for operations and management in FY 2018 of $31.0 million . These decreases are strategically oriented to be consistent with the recommendations from the NAS's Decadal Survey, Sea Change . Preconstruction for the Regional Cl ass Research Vessels (RCRV) concluded in FY 2016 with costs decreasing to zero in FY 2018. For more information on RCRV, see the MREFC chapter. Directorate for Geosciences GEO - 14 MPS - 1 DIRECTORATE FOR MATHEMATICAL $1,219,430,000 AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES (MPS) -$129,350, 000 / -9.6 % Amount Percent Astronomical Sciences (AST) $246.63 - -10.3% (TBD)FY 2018 RequestChange Over FY 2016 Actual About MPS MPS serves the Nation by supporting fundamental discoveries at the forefront of science. These discoveries form a tapestry of knowledge and innovation that transforms the future. Research in the disciplines supported by MPS has led to advances that are used for a wide variety of applications; examples include laser technology, navigation using the Global Positioning System, materials fundamental to integrated circuits, and algorithms used for advanced cybersecurity. The FY 2018 Budget Request for MPS supports a collection of vigorous disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs that foster discovery and cultivate the technical workforce. The awards funded by MPS provide the foundation of basic research in astronomical sciences (AST), chemistry (CHE), materials research (DMR), mathematical sciences (DMS), and physics (PHY) that explore the frontiers of science. The programs in MPS span the range from individual investigator awards to large, multi -user facilities. The science spans an enormous range as well: from the smallest objects and shortest times ever studied to distances and times that are the size and age of the universe. Individual investigators and small teams receive the majority of awards, but centers, institutes, and multi -user facilities are all integral to MPS -funded research. MPS co ntinues to participate in NSF -wide investments and multi -directorate activities, particularly ones that connect to the fundamental research at the heart of its mission. These multi -directorate activities include growing MPS foundational research for severa l of the Big Ideas that are discussed elsewhere in this document. Programs in the MPS divisions respond to special intellectual opportunities and reflect careful choices in order to provide the greatest return on the research investment. Identifying thes e opportunities involves the community through the MPS Advisory Committee and through groups chartered to identify prospects for revolutionary science in particular areas. National Academies in put is critical for prioritization; two recent examples are New Worlds, New Horizons: A Midterm Assessment (delivered in August 2016) and Frontiers of Materials Research: A Decadal Survey (scheduled for completion in FY 2018). Facilities that enable unique science that would be impossible without the special resources of a shared, multi- user environment are integral to our mission. Some of these facilities are observatories for photons, neutrinos, or gravitational waves. Others provide unique resources such as the largest controlled magnetic fields in the world or beams of rare isotopes. Stewardship of the MPS facilities portfolio and the balance among the different awards programs are critical issues that also engender extensive community Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences MPS - 2 consultation. MPS continues assessing the future of different facili ties and fostering collaborations for those facilities. MPS participates in building the foundation for several of the Big Ideas described previously, in cooperation with many other directorates. In particular, FY 2018 investments will advance the work of two of the Big Ideas. DMR and PHY support investments that are important for defining and developing the direction of the Quantum Leap Big Idea . For example, the DMR funding request includes renewal of the Center for Integrated Quantum Materials, while PH Y emphasizes investments i n Quantum Information Science. Both AST and PHY are building the foundation for the Windows on the Universe Big Idea by continuing to invest in large facilities and research awards that make use of information carried by electromagnetic waves, parti cles, and gravitational waves. More discussion of these investments and foundation -building for other Big Ideas may be found in the division narratives below as well as in the Facilities chapter . MPS provides about 49 percent of the federal funding for basic research at academic institutions in the mathematical and physical sciences.

Funding Profile MPS supports investment in core research, education, and research infrastructure. In FY 2018, the number of research g rant proposals is expected to increas e by over 5 00 as compared to FY 2016. This expected increase reflects a general upward trend in numbers of research proposals received in recent years. Of this total, MPS expects to award about 1,800 research grants. Average annual award size and duration are not expected to materially fluctuate in FY 2018. In FY 2018, MPS will invest $91.60 million fo r centers, accounting for 7.5 percent of the MPS budget. This increase is due to the initiation of two new Science and Technology Centers. Several centers , including Centers for Analysis and Synthesis and the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, have sunset as planned. MPS will continue to support the Materials Centers and the Centers for Chemical Innovation. Operations and m aintenance f unding for MPS- supported user f acilities is 23.9 percent of MPS's FY 2018 Request. Funding is maintained for most facilities in order to keep operational capacity current. Information about specific funding decreases may be found in the d ivision narratives that follow .

The next annual report is expected in March 2018. AST, together with the NASA Astrophysics Division and the High Energy Physics Branch of the DOE Office of Science, commissioned a study (\"Review of Progress Toward the Decadal Surv ey Vision in New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics\"), of the mid -term status of agency responses to the 2010 decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics, through the NRC Space Studies Board. The resulting NRC mid -term review committee rep ort was published in August 2016.2 In FY 2017, the MPS/CHE/Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program will initiate an evaluation of the CCI progra m. Results are expec ted to inform CHE regarding program effectiveness and to establish best practices. Final study results expected in late FY 2018 or early FY 2019. DMR co -sponsored with the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) a NAS Decadal Survey entitled Frontiers of Materials Research . This important study will identify future needs and important emerging research areas of materials research in the context of U.S. and international efforts. 3 A report is anticipated in June 2018 which will in form DMR of future directions. Workshops and Reports: In October 2016, CHE -sponsored a workshop titled \"Measuring the Brain: From the Synapse to Thought\" . The goal was to bring together chemical and neuroscience communities to better understand the intersection of their needs and opportunities. The discussion focused on identifying challenges in brain research f or the next decade and how chemical probes, sensors, and measurements could address challenges in understanding brain functioning. A repo rt is expected in late FY 2017. CHE sponsored two workshops on opportunities for mid-scale investment. The \"Workshop for Mid- Scale Instrumentation in the Chemical Sciences\" was held in September 2016 and identified research areas where scientific progress in chemistry is limited or inhibited by a lack of access to mid -scale instrumentation. The \"Workshop on Mi d-Scale Instrument Development in the Chemical Scien ces\" 1 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/aaac.jsp 2 http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_161177 3 http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/materials -decadal/index.htm Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences MPS - 6 was held in November 2016 and focused on the development of new instrument development capabilities. Reports from both workshops are expected by s ummer 2017. The CHE w orkshop \"Quantum Information and Computa tion for Chemistry\" was held in November 2016, with representatives attending from the chemical community, the NAS , multiple federal agencies, and industries involved in quantum sciences (e.g., Google, Microsoft, and Intel). The workshop summarized recent progress at the interface of quantum information science and chemistry and explored promising research opportunities for chemists in quantum sensing, communication, computers, and computing. A report is expected in late FY 2017. The workshop \"Frami ng the Role of Big Data and Modern Dat a Science in Chemistry\" was held in April 2017 and focused on big data research and the use of modern data science in chemistry. The workshop addressed the needs of the chemical research and data science communities to fully develop sharing, searching, and repurposing, for data mining, machine learning, and data analytics. DMR sponsored several workshops in FY 2016 and FY 2017 focused on advancing the use of data - driven research in the DMREF program 4, grand challenges i n soft condensed matter physics5,6, emerging trends in topological phases of matter research7, challenges for young condensed matter physics investigators8, and new mid -scale tools to advance biomaterials9 and quantum materials10. DMR supported two major topical program reviews in FY 2016; a decadal survey for polymer science11 and a four -year review of emerging fundamental science trends in ceramics12. DMR plans to sponsor several workshops throughout FY 2017 and FY 2018 which will focus on condensed matter science, quantum materials13, mid -scale instrumentation, solid state materials chemistry, electronic and photonic materials, and the application of data -driven science and machine learning to accelerated materials discovery. DMS, BIO/IOS, and BIO/MCB spons ored to Phenome Relationships : Interdisciplinary Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences14 in October 2015. The findings of the workshop recommended the development of a joint initiative to supp ort research centers on the Mathematics of C omplex Biological Systems . In April 2016, DMS and CISE/ CCF sponsored the workshop \"Theoretical Foundations of Data Science (TFoDS): Algorithmic, Mathematical, and Statistical \"15. Findings led to a FY 2017 joint program for the development of small collaborative institutes on Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) by DMS and CISE/CCF. In collaboration with the National Institutes of H ealth (NIH) , DMS supported a Data Science Innovation Lab workshop focused on Interdisciplinary Approaches to Biomedical Data Science in June 2016. The activity brought together researchers in quantitative and biomedical sciences with a goal of developing new research teams to work on problems in biomedical data science. A program solicitation Joint NSF/NIH Initiative on Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Big Data (QuBBD) was issued to encourage proposals for inter - and multi -disciplinary collaborations that focus on innovative and transformati ve approaches to address challenges in this topic area. DMS made an award \"GROW: Strengthening the Mathematical Workforce\" to support two related conferences aimed at addressing gender imbalances within the mathematical sciences. The first of th e 4 www.orau.gov/mgi2016/ 5 https://mrsec.uchicago.edu/events/grand -challenges FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress MPS - 7 conferences was held in October 2016 and the second will be held in October 2017.

These facilities al so enable scientific advances by making archived data products available to researchers. AST also supports the development of advanced technologies and instrumentation and manages the electromagnetic spectrum for scientific use by the entire NSF community. AST supports research to understand the origins and characteristics of planets, stars, and galaxies, as well as the structure that has evolved in the universe since its origin more than 13 billion years ago . The results of this research will lead to a be tter understanding of the cosmos, of the possibility of life existing on planets circling other stars, and of the nature of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that comprise more than 95 percent of the mass- energy of the universe. In general, about 28 percent of the AST portfolio is available for new research. About 61 percent of AST's budget supports the forefront instrumentation and facilities needed for progress at the frontiers of observational astronomy, while almost 20 percent supports the research of individual investigators. Through the MREFC appropriation, AST also oversees the construction of LSST and DKIST . FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represent change over the FY 2016 Actual . FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress MPS - 9 Research CAREER (-$460,000 to a total of $4.17 million): This level continues AST's commitment to early - career investigators and will support about 35 awards. Disciplinary and interdisciplinary research programs ( -$8.68 million to a total of $44.03 million): Support for fundamental research is a major focus . This level will continue support for the As tronomy and Astrophysics R esearch Grants and Solar and Planetary Grants program s but at a lower level. Education Partnerships in Astronomy and Astrophysics Research and Education (PAARE) ( -$500,000 to a total of $1.0 million): Reduced proposal demand in FY 2016 has resulted in a shift in the funding balance between PAARE and other workforce development and early -career programs. Infrastructure ALMA (+$5.83 million to a total of $43.48 million): As ALMA approaches steady state operations, funding includes an increase of the annual contribution t o the ALMA Development Fund and long- term maintenance budget as agreed to by the international partners. Arecibo Observatory ( -$900,000 to a total of $3.90 million): The FY 2016 Actual includes $700,000 in forward funding . The $200,000 balance of the reduction is consistent with the proposed divestment amount appearing in the FY 2017 Arecibo management solicitation . DKIST (+$ 2.50 million to a total of $16.0 million): This supports the continued ramp -up of DKIST operations within NSO to $14.0 million, plus the DKIST cultural mitigation award held steady at $2.0 million. See the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction chapter for more detail. Gemini Observatory (+$ 1.15 million to a total of $21.03 million): This supports a slight increase in operations and the instrument development fund as agreed to by the international Gemini Board. NOAO (-$1.32 million to a total of $20.67 million): This supports operations of NOAO's optical telescope and data science programs. NRAO ( -$8.87 million to a total of $32.86 million): This decrease is due to the removal of the Green Bank Observatory and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) from the NRAO base budget in FY 2017. Funding for GBO and VLBA is captured in the Other Astronomical Facilities line. NSO ( -$4.50 million to a total of $5 .0 million): Of the total change, most ( -$2.50 million to zero) is due to the end of a one -time activity in FY 2016 to make NSO Space Weather infrastructur e more robust, and the rest ( -$2.0 million , to a total of $5.0 million) is a decreas e in NSO base support with the divestment of facilities on Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak and with emphasis shifting to DKIST operations . Other Astronomical Facilities (+$11. 85 million to a total of $11.85 million): This funds operational support for GBO an d VLBA (now operated by the Long Baseline Observatory) , which were moved from the NRAO base budget as noted in the NRAO bullet above. Mid-Scale Innovations Program (MSIP) ( -$15.25 million to a total of $6 .0 million): Of the total change, -$13.25 million results from re-balancing MSIP with core individual investigator programs , but with lower priority given to MSIP while maintaining a minimal level for the program . The $2.0 million balance of the reduction is due to a technical adjustment to recategorize funding for the Dark Energy Survey Data Management within Research Resources below. Research Resources ( -$6.51 million to a total of $3.20 million): This includes a reduction of $250,000 after the final increment of a five -year planning award for the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope that is scheduled to end in FY 2017. Funding for other activities on this line are the Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation (ATI) program , which is minimally m aintained and to be offered in a lternating years, and the Dark Energy Survey Data Management, which remains constant at $2.0 million .

CHE researchers contribute to the production of next generation technologies for sensing, computing, modeling , and communicating at the quantum level by observing, manipulating, and controlling the behavior of particles and energy in nanometer dimensions. The division is also involved in the development of new tools to examine and solve complex chemical problems including the synergistic combination of multiple types of measurements (including remote access and cyber -enabled tools) and the development of de novo instruments. CHE supports curiosity -driven research that leads to increased understanding of molecules and their chemical transformations, that are often manifest in the chemical, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also supports the development of new instrumentation to study and detect molecul es important for sensing, monitoring, understanding, and improving the sustainability of chemical reactions at both the lab bench and commercial scales. In general, 61 percent of the CHE portfolio is available for new research grants and 39 percent is available for continuing grants. FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represent changes over the FY 2016 Actual. Research CAREER grants ( -$2.67 million to a total of $23.99 million) are funded at a rate equal to general unsolicited research grants. This is consistent with the CHE objectives of encouraging broadening participation and education while focusing on the frontiers of the field. This will fund about 90 awards.

The objectives are to inform NSF's future efforts of the ANES, GSS, and PSID that enhance their importance and cost -effectiveness. This is especially critical as these three surveys represent considerab le infrastructure opportunities and costs for the SBE sciences. The NAS standing committee considered the history of the surveys and the kinds of users and uses they have supported. The Committee's report provided insights about opportunities for collaboration and interoperability among the surveys, with foci on i nnovation, data collection and data dissemination. NCSES convened two review activities under the ausp ices of the NAS Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) to conduct a comprehensive review of the Center's approach to measuring the U.S. S&E enterprise. The first, continuing through FY 2017, examines current a pproaches to measuring the S&E workforce and will provide findings and recommendations for impr oving data and data collection methods. NCSES's expectation is that the information included in th is report will provide the details, direction, and guidance necessary to develop a more robust and flex ible framework for measuring the S&E workforce for the next decade and beyond. The second work shop, convened in FY 2016 on innovation activities and innovation measurement, will inform the refi nement and prioritization of NCSES work in innovation planning in FY 2017 and beyond.1 Workshops and Reports: In order to develop a resource for policy makers in their decision-making and for NSF in its strategic planning process, NSF has requested that NAS convene a committee of experts to produce a report that describes the role of social, behavioral, and economic sciences in helping to address national priorities and to inform decisions about investments at N SF. The committee will be comprised of experts from multiple fields of sciences as well as from business and industry. A prepublication version of the report is expected to be released to the public in early su mmer 2017; the final report is to be published in late summer 2017. 1 www.nap.edu/catalog/23640/advanci ng-concepts-and-models -for-measuring-innovation-proceedings-of-a Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences SBE - 6 Committees of Visitors (COV): In 2016 a COV reviewed SES.

S. supporter of fundamental research in the polar regions. In addition, NSF provides interagency leader ship for U.S. activities in polar regions. In the Arctic, NSF helps coordinate research planning as di rected by the Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984. The NSF Director chairs the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee cr eated for this purpose. In the Antarctic, per Presidential Memorandum 6646, NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and by other U.S. agencies. The latter include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Smithsonian Institution, and the Department of Energy. The U.S. Anta rctic Program research activity supported by NSF also supports leadership by the U.S. Department of State in the governance of the continent and Southern Ocean under the aegis of the Antarctic Treaty System. OPP supports investments in core research and educa tion and provides research support and infrastructure, such as permanent stations and temporary field camps in the Antarctic and the Arctic. OPP's FY 2018 Budget Request is influenced by three key priorities: (1) maintaining strong disciplinary programs that provide a base for our investments in cross-disciplin ary system science programs; (2) maintaining U.S. research community activities in polar system scien ce and; (3) supporting critical facilities that enable frontier research in the Earth's polar regions. These priorities reflect opportunities for fundamental scientific discovery uniquely possible in polar regions, as well as studies to investigate the causes and future trajectory of changes now being observed at the poles th at could impact global systems. This work will implement the Foundation's lead-agency role in f acilitating the Nation's investment in polar science, Office of Polar Programs OPP - 2 whereby research supported by OPP will elucidate the cau ses and likely impacts of the interaction of polar regions with the larger planet, thus prov iding a basis for futu re policy decisions. In addition to shared cross-direct orate basic research objectives, OPP investments will be guided by recent sponsored studies to identify priority areas and ensure effective polar research programs: For the Arctic, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee's (IARPC) Arctic Research Plan: FY 2013-2017 ,1 the National Ocean Policy Implementation Strategy2 and the World Meteorological Organization's Year of Polar Prediction Implementation Plan3 inform science investment priorities. Efforts to build an integrated r esearch capacity to address the poten tial opportunities and challenges of Arctic change for the nation's security and economics and well-being of Arctic residents will continue. For the Antarctic, the 2015 NRC report A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research4 inform science investment priorities. Specifically, in 2018, OPP will initiate support of a five-year deep field program to study the Thwaites Glacier Region that was the highest priority in that study. The Thwaites program will be jointly funded, including shared logistics, with the National Research Council of the UK. All funding decreases/increases represen t changes over the FY 2016 Actual. In FY 2018, OPP will reduce research funding by $12. 73 million, to a total of $110.58 million. This will be accomplished by making fewer awards in polar science programs and by reducing OPP's support for science coordination and workshop activities. Support for early-career researchers remains an OP P priority. OPP will support CAREER grants at $1.26 million. Funding for Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) increases by $160,000, to $2.25 million, reflecting the two projects in the Antarc tic and one new project in the Arctic. Education activities across OPP will be supported at a level of $1.35 million, which includes funds for postdoctoral fellows through NRT and continuing commitment to the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. A continued investment of $500,000 will contribute po lar research efforts to th e cross-directorate Risk and Resilience emphasis area through the PREEVENTS program. OPP will phase out SEES funding as that program reaches its planned termination. 1 www.iarpccollaborations.o rg/plan/index.html NSF Budget Request to Congress OPP - 3 Polar Funding for Facilities Amount Percent Facilities (Total) $316.00 - $291.07 -$24.93 -7.9% Arctic -8.00 -18.1% Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and 1.32 - - IceCube Neutrino Observatory15.23 - 3.50 -1.73 -33.1% Seismological Facilities for Advancement of Geosciences and Earthscope (SAGE)1.29 - 1.29 - - U.S. Antarctic Facilities and Logistics 196.53 - 177.85 -18.68 -9.5% AIMS Pre-construction planning 14.50 - Antarctic Logistical Support 67.52 - 71.00 3.48 5.2%OPP Funding for Fac ilities (Dollars Over FY 2016 ActualFY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request Arctic Research Support & Logistics (ARSL) f unding provides support for Arctic researchers, including access to airplanes, helicopters, research vessels including icebreakers, and field camps for approximately 140 projects in remote sites in Alask a, Greenland, Canada, Arctic Scandinavia, Russia, and the Arctic Ocean. Summit Station on the Green land ice cap operates as a year-round international site for a variety of atmospheric and geophysical measurements. ARSL support will be reduced by $8.0 million, to $36.11 million, in concert w ith a reduction in Arctic science awards. OPPs funding for the Geodesy Advancing Geoscien ces and EarthScope (GAGE) and the Seismological Facilities for Advancement of Geoscience and EarthS cope (SAGE) facilities will continue at the same level as FY 2016. IceCube Neutrino Observatory support funding will decrease $1.73 million, to $3.50 million. The funding level in FY 2016 reflected an extensi on of the prior cooperative agreement while a new agreement was competitively awarded. This facility is jointly funded by MPS. U.S. Antarctic Facilities and Logistics funding will be reduced $18.68 million, to $177.85 million, in concert with a reduction of Antarctic science awards. For Antarctica, a primary objective is to conti nue progress on a multi-year commitment toward more efficient and cost-effective science support as reco mmended by the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) report, More and Better Science in Antarctic a through Increased Logistical Effectiveness .5 NSF issued a formal response to this report in March 2013.6 Emphases include safety and health improvements as well as plan ning for renewal of outdated facilities. In particular, investments of $1.80 million will be made to bring the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project to the final design review stage and to prepare for the construction phase. The AIMS program will consolid ate the footprint and core facilities at McMurdo station toward significantly enhanced effici ency and cost-effectiveness of science support .

This request highlights NSF's continuing emphasis on building capacity across the research and education enterprise, including investments in the Established Program to Stimul ate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). These investments are intended to improve the research competitiveness of U.S. states and territories (\"jurisdictions\") by investing in their academic infrastructure in areas of science and engineering that are supported by NSF and are also critical to that jurisdiction's long-range science and technology strategy. The Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) provides organizations with opportunities to acquire and/or develop shared state-of-the-art instrumentation that supports their research and research training goals. Investments in human infrastructure, through programs such as the Graduate Research Fellows hip Program (GRFP) and NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), continue to be a major emphasis for NSF. In FY 2018, there will be an agency-wide effort to encourage and support Converge nce; this effort will focus on building a consensus on the definition of \"convergence,\" generating calls for proposals that integrate convergence with other NSF Big Ideas, and id entifying best mechanisms for reviewing convergent proposals. In addition, NSF will start to ramp up the NSF 2026 program, named in celebration of the Nation's Sestercentennial. NSF 2026 is an NSF Big Idea dedicated to supporting bold, long-term foundational research questions that will lead to major breakthroughs in science and engineering. About IA IA expands the National Science Foundation's capacity for research and innovation through ideation, experimentation, and assessment. IA has five main goals: To strengthen alignment of NSF's activities with its mission; To enhance NSF's ability to solicit, review, award, and manage an evolving portfolio; To develop high-performance analytics and tools that will reveal new insights into the award portfolio and NSF's policies and practices; Integrative Activities IA - 2 To advance research infrastructure that will enab le pioneering research across the United States; To promulgate an inclusive national education a nd research enterprise that supports the development of outstanding researchers. FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represen t changes over the FY 2016 Actual. Evaluation and Assessment Capability (EAC) funding in FY 2018 is $3.0 million. It will focus on co- funding contracts for program evaluations, improve ments in data quality, NSF-wide access to data analytics tools, and activities focused on informing organizational learning and improvement in the performance of NSF programs and day-to-day operations. EPSCoR (-$60.03 million, to a total of $100.0 m illion) funding in FY 2018 will focus on Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 awards, i nvestments in NSF-supported areas of science and engineering that are aligned with science and technol ogy priority areas as identified by the jurisdictions. GRFP invests (-$42.69 million, to a total of $123. 27 million) in the U.S. in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) human capital necessary to ensure the Na tion's leadership in advancing innovations in science and engineering. GRFP selects, recognizes, and financially supports graduate students with demonstrat ed high potential for excellence in STEM and in their chosen careers. Applications are welcome from students in a ll STEM disciplines supported by NSF and in STEM interdisciplinary areas, including STEM education. Fellows have opportunities for international research through Graduate Opportunities Worldwid e (GROW) and federal internships through Graduate Research Internship Pr ogram (GRIP). The program will s upport 1,000 new fellowships with a cost of education allowance of $12,000 and a s tipend of $34,000. IA provides 50 percent of NSF's funding for GRFP, with the remainder provided by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR). For additional information on GRFP, see the discussion on Major Investments in STEM Graduate Education narrative in the NSF-Wide Investments chapter. In FY 2017, the Integrated N SF Support Promoting Interdisci plinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) pilot ended and a new funding mechan ism encompassing elements of INSPIRE was developed; Research Advanced by Interdisciplin ary Research and Engineering (RAISE). The RAISE mechanism supports bold, potentially transformativ e interdisciplinary research that transcends programmatic scope. RAISE guidelines are publishe d in the 2017 NSF Proposal and Award Policy Procedures Guide and the funding mechanism is available to any researcher conducting transformational, interdisciplinary research in fiel ds that NSF supports. Re maining FY 2016 INSPIRE funding will allow co-funding for about 5 RAISE awards at up-to-$1.0-million each in FY 2017. Starting in FY 2018, IA co-funding will be eliminated and each directorate will support bold, potentially transformative interdisciplinary research through the RAISE mechanism, coordinating with other directorates and divisions, as necessary. The MRI program (-$4.55 million, to a total of $75. 0 million) will continue to catalyze new knowledge and discoveries by empowering the Nation's scientists and engineers with state-of-the-art research instrumentation. The MRI program supports inst rument acquisition or development, such as microscopes, spectrometers, cyberinfrastructure, ge nome sequencers, or telescopes. MRI also supports research-intensive learning environments that prom ote the development of a diverse workforce as well as facilitates academic and private sector partnerships. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 3 The goal of NSF INCLUDES (+$0.10 million, to a to tal of $2.0 million) is to develop a talented, innovative, and capable science and engineering workforce that reflects the diversity of our society. If the United States is to remain the world leader w ith respect to innovations and discoveries in STEM, it must identify and develop talent from all sectors of society to become tomorrow's STEM professionals. Providing opportunities and support for members of all communities and sectors across the Nation is both necessary for the Nation's economic welfare a nd as part of NSF's commitment to equity. NSF INCLUDES, which began in FY 2015, w ill be in existence through FY 2025. Planning and Policy Support fundin g in FY 2018 is $4.43 million. This program supports select NSF- wide policy and planning activities, including suppor t for workshops, conferences, and other long-term planning activities for NSF's Big Ideas. It also aggr egates a number of similar activities previously supported elsewhere, including annual agency awards (the Vannevar Bush Award, Public Service Award, Alan T. Waterman Award, and National Me dal of Science), and several summer science internship programs that target STEM student s from underrepresented groups. The FY 2018 Budget Request will also fund NSF collaborations with th e National Academies, including the Government- University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR), 1 and the Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine, and Public Policy (CoSEMPuP).2 Research Investment Communications (RIC) funding in FY 2018 is $3.14 milli on, equal to the FY 2016 Actual. RIC is a leading-edge communications effort that is essential for public awareness and support of science and engineering. RIC creates products and processes through traditional and social media platforms that make NSF's inv estments in science, technology, engineering, education, and mathematics readily available and easily understandable to everyone . In FY 2018, RIC will continue its focus on informing policy makers, the media, an d the general public about the impact of NSF's investments on their daily lives and the Nation's future. The Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (STC) program (-$5.09 million, to a total of $900,000) supports inno vative, potentially transformative, complex research and education projects that require large-scale, long-term awards. STCs engage the Nation's in tellectual talent through partnerships among academia, indus try, national laboratories, and government. These collaborations create synergies that enhance the training of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and educators; and the creation of job opportunities. STCs have im pressive records of research achievements as well as fostering strong partnerships with industry. The reduction in budget reflects the transfer of funding for the newest cohort of four STC awards from IA to the relevant managing directorates. The FY 2018 Request will provide support for post awar d management for the 12 existing centers. The Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) (-$740, 000, to a total of $4.0 million) is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) sponsored by NSF on behalf of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Science and Technology for America's Reinvestmen t: Measuring the Effect of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Science (STAR METRICS) (-$1.0 million, to a total of $0 million) is an interagency pilot activity that represents a new a pproach to developing information on how NSF and other federal Research and Development (R&D) i nvestments affect the innovation ecosystem. Funding is being eliminated as this pilot activity has served its purpose. 1 http://sites.nationalacade mies.org/pga/guirr/index.htm 2 http://sites .nationalacademies.org/ pga/cosepup/index.htm Integrative Activities IA - 4 Program Monitoring and Evaluation EAC was established to provide NSF with enhanced capability to operate from a basis of evidence in program and policy decisions; to more consistently assess the influence of its investments; and to establish a culture of evidence-based planning and policy ma king. EAC has been responsible for establishing mechanisms for NSF-wide leadership and coordinati on in program and portfolio evaluation, providing expert support and resources for data collection, in tegration, and management, and improving NSF-wide evaluation capacity. In FY 2017, EAC staff is evaluating five activities a nd has negotiated nine evaluation/monitoring contracts in collaboration with lead-directorates of the progr ams. Each of these projects is summarized below. Internal Program Evaluations and Studies: Broader Impacts (BI). This study focuses on the natu re of BI evidence in proposals, review panel summaries, and annual reports. Findings from th is ongoing project will inform guidance on how principal investigators, reviewers, and COV members consider broader impacts of the research. Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA).

EPSCoR assists NSF in its statutory function \"to strengthen research and education is science and engineerin g throughout the United States and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.\" EPSCoR seeks to advance excellence in science and engineering research and education to achieve sustai nable increases in research, education, and training capacity and competitiveness that will enable EPSCoR juri sdictions to have increas ed engagement in the science and engineering supported by NSF. EPSCoR uses three strategic investment tools: Resear ch Infrastructure (RII) awards, Co- Funding, and Outreach/Workshops. FY 2018 EPSCoR Summary In general, approximately 15 percent of the Section's portfolio is available for new research grants and 85 percent is available for continuing grants. All funding decreases/increases repres ent change over the FY 2016 Actual. Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) RII (-$36.0 million, to a total of $95.0 million) aw ards support development of physical, human, and cyber-based research infrastructure in EPSCoR jurisdictions with emphasis on collaborations among academic researchers, the private sector, and state and local governments to affect sustainable improvements in research infrastructure. These awards are designed to improve the research competitiveness of jurisdictions by strengthening th eir academic research infrastructure in areas of science and engineering supported by NSF and critical to the particular ju risdiction's science and technology initiatives. RII awards also increase th e participation of underre presented groups in STEM and enable broader regional and topical collabora tions among jurisdictions and facilitate the enhancement of discovery, learning, and econom ic development of EPSCoR jurisdictions. Co-Funding Co-Funding with NSF directorates and offices on meritorious proposals from individual investigators, groups, and centers in EPSCoR jurisdictions that are submitted to the Foundatio n's research and education programs, and to crosscutting initiatives such as clean energy and INFEWS. These proposals are merit reviewed in NSF disciplinary programs and recommended for award, but cannot be funded without the combined, leveraged support of EPSCoR. Integrative Activities IA - 8 Outreach and Workshops The Outreach and Workshops (-$130,000 to a tota l of $1.0 million) component of EPSCoR solicits requests for workshops, conferences, and other community-based activities designed to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering, and to share best practices in strategic planning, diversity, communicati on, and other capacity-building areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR also supports outreach travel that enables NSF staff from all directorates and offices to directly engage and inform the EPSC oR research community about NSF opportunities, priorities, programs, and policies.

This research foundation has guided and shaped EHR's portfolio and priorities for more than 60 years. While the EHR mission remains constant, the context changes in whic h this mission is enacted. Each decade brings new challenges and opportunities. The federal investment in STEM education, and wi thin it the focused investment in STEM education research based at NSF, must anticipate and respond to changes in population demographics and diversity; economic conditions; the nature and practices of sci ence and engineering; and the data- and cyber- infrastructure that is transforming societ y, security, and the nature of research. The progress of science and engineering depends on th e education of discoverers \u2014those who will be the leaders and innovators in science and engineering. These discoverers will become part of the STEM and STEM-related workforce, including public and privat e sector, academic, policy, research, and teaching occupations. The progress of science and engineering al so depends on a public that values and participates in the STEM enterprise through formal and informal e ducation, STEM-related aspects of their work, public participation in scientific research, and civic engagement. The opportunities made possible by federal investments in STEM must be provided effectively to, and draw from, the full and diverse talent pool of the Nation.

FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 3 2018 EHR Summary EHR's investment in FY 2018 employs three themes, or core research areas, to respond to changing population demographics and diversity, changing economic conditions, cha nges in the nature and practices of science and engineering, and changes in the data an d cyberinfrastructure that is transforming society and the nature of research. These three themes guide the design of solicitations and program activities; EHR's investments are also coordinated within these themes.1 As part of broadening participation and institutional capacity , EHR will serve as a central resource for the following: Co-leading, with the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), and the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA), the implem entation of NSF's investment in Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underre presented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES). EHR will help identify promising st rategic goals and objectives that are pivotal for improving the participation of tr aditionally underrepresented groups, promote implementation research to support scaling of effective models, and involve all EHR broadening participation programs as NSF INCLUDES affiliates. An increased focus on STEM education for Native youths primarily through the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP). Co-leading, with the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), the agency priority goal Public Participation in STEM Research, bringing to bear a growing research base about how engagement of non-experts in scientific re search is valuable both for developing interest and learning in science and engineering and increasing scientific output. As part of learning and learning environments , EHR will promote the following: Research on the science of learning as translated into educational environments for STEM. Studies about specific learning issues in the STEM disciplines. The development and study of models for im proving STEM learning environments and their implementation. Research to further the learning of crosscutting an d interdisciplinary topics, such as data science and the science of science communication. Improvement of undergraduate learning opportunities to attract and retain STEM majors, via such emphases as research courses and technological innovations. As part of STEM professional workforce development , EHR will place particular emphasis on specialized professional development and preparation for the following: The STEM teachers of tomorrow, through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). Future cybersecurity expe rts through the CyberCorps \u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SfS) program. NSF involvement in the training component of the National Strategic Computing Initiative. Innovation in STEM graduate education in a va riety of disciplines through the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program's Innovation in Graduate Education track. EHR's core education research investment guides st rategic and impactful STEM education improvement. In addition, EHR will continue to support the de velopment and study of evidence-based and evidence- generating innovations and models fo r improving STEM learning. Investment in EHR core research (ECR) is key to improving and solving enduring challeng es in STEM education in the three thematic areas discussed above that guide EHR's work. Findings are accumulating to inform investment, policy, and 1 NSF Federal Advisory Committee for Education and Human Resources. (2014).

Retrieved from www.nsf.gov/ehr/Pubs/AC_ReEnvi sioning_Report_Sept_2014_01.pdf Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 4 practice in several areas of STEM education. For inst ance, there is a solid evid ence base to support shifts in undergraduate STEM teaching to appr oaches that emphasize active learning.2 Education research about mentoring and providing research e xperiences to undergraduate and gra duate students shows the value of focusing explicitly on studen ts' professional development.3 Research indicates that a critical factor in improving teachers' effectiveness is subject-specific professional development.4 There is evidence that engagement in authentic STEM research experiences both inside and outside of school can promote interest and persistence in STEM, and there is evidence th at course-based research can decrease inequities by expanding research opportunities to more learners from underrepresented groups.5,6 Student pathways to STEM degree completion are complex; improved metrics, indicators, and data collection systems can help institutions better understand their po pulations of learners and path ways, including curricular and co- curricular components, that support success in obtaining a STEM degree.7 The role of NSF, through EHR, within the fede ral government in supporting such research on STEM education is unique. EHR programs fund crucial foundational, design and development, and implementation research that is available to inform large investments at scale made by other agencies, organizations, and the private sector. The EHR research portfolio also supports a coherent suite of investments NSF-wide in undergraduate and gradua te STEM education. That support occurs through strategic linkages with the discip line-specific needs of all NSF directorates and engagement in cross- directorate science and engineering initiatives. In addition, the EHR investments in preK-12 STEM education and informal STEM learning are focused, catalytic contributions that push the frontiers of effective learning and practice in those environments. Such work is foundational as a part of the national STEM education infrastructure. Overall, there are no significant shifts in EHR's priorities between FY 2016 and FY 2018. Rather, EHR will intensify its engagement in fo undational research, broadening particip ation, and advancing science and engineering through strategic collaborations across the NSF disciplines. EHR will participate in the cross-Foundation prioriti es NSF INCLUDES, Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS), and Understa nding the Brain (UtB). For INFEWS and UtB, EHR's emphasis is on innovation in the development of a dive rse, next-generation workforce with the skills and competencies needed in these emerging areas throug h the NRT and Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) programs. STEM a nd education communities funded in EHR programs will be encouraged to engage in the NSF INCL UDES National Network, and EHR-based capacity for measurement and indicators in broadening participati on will be engaged in the development of the NSF INCLUDES Backbone Organization. 2 Freeman, S. et al.

FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 5 EHR's FY 2018 Budget Request reflects a continuing strong commitment to deepening and strengthening the synergies within EHR and between EHR and the other directorates. Recognizing the unique commitment of NSF in the integration of education and the sciences, EHR's funding prioritizes strategic collaborations that address discipline-specific needs in the sciences and engineering and that utilize the significant experience and expertise of the STEM educa tion community to inform and improve the impact of strategic investments. This is reflected in EH R's commitment to the NRT program to align with NSF- wide scientific priorities so that the field can be challenged to devise truly cutting-edge innovations in preparing graduate students to be researchers in thes e evolving areas. It is also evident in our continued leadership in the Improving Undergraduate STEM E ducation (IUSE) activity, SfS, and discipline-specific partnerships. EHR staff continue to provide cross-agency leader ship to the Federal Coordination in STEM Education Task Force (FC-STEM) and the associ ated Interagency Working Groups (IWG). In particular, EHR will provide staff support for the STEM Education Adviso ry Panel created by The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329).

The HBCU-UP program will collaborate with the R&RA di rectorates to encourage HBCU faculty to submit proposals to other directorates and enhance rese arch capacity at HBCUs. The CREST program will encourage institutional collaborations with other fede ral agencies, state governments, national laboratories, private sector research laboratories, and K-12 entities to advance knowledge and education on research that is of significance to the Nation. HRD has administrative and intellectual responsibility fo r EASE, in partnership with the Office of Science and Technology Policy. EASE will continue to suppo rt professional development for K-12 teachers and STEM educators and mentors, as well as the identificati on and recognition of educators who have particular impact on broadening participation. Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 14 FY 2018 Summary All funding decreases/increases represen t changes over the FY 2016 Actual. Learning and Learning Environments In FY 2018, the ADVANCE program's cumulative budget, consisting of EHR funds and other directorate contributions, reduced 67 percent (or -$9.96 million) to $4.90 million. HRD's funding for ADVANCE is $1.53 million (+$50,000). (-$1.0 million to a total of $7.0 million): AGEP will support innovative and sustainable ways to promote inclusion in the STEM academic workforce, and will continue to implement new strategies to work with the NRT program and GRFP focusing on tr ansitions from graduate to postdoctoral training to increase STEM career opportunities. HRD's funding for HBCU-UP is $35.0 million (-$10,000) . This funding will invest in broadening participation research centers, which will enable th e HBCU community to develop a long-term plan for the integration of research and education in the science of broadening participation, and foster knowledge transfer about research and education advances. TCUP will support the design, implementation, and assessment of comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM instruction and research capacity (-$1.01 million to a total of $13.0 million). Broadening Participation and Institutional Capacity in STEM In FY 2018, HRD will continue to provide stra tegic direction and guidance for the broadening participation and institutional capacity component of ECR (-$5.62 million to a total of $7.28 million). Minority serving institutions will be encouraged to explore research topics and workshops that support capacity building at these institutions, with a focus on developing faculty to carry out STEM education research. In FY 2018, ECR funding will also support the IUSE: HSI activity. HRD's funding for NSF INCLUDES will support the development of the NSF INCLUDES Alliances, the Backbone Organization, and additional Design and Developmen t Launch Pilots (+$720,000 to a total of $3.0 million). HRD will play a key role in the development of metrics and approaches for the assessment of NSF INCLUDES and other invest ments in broadening participation. LSAMP (-$5.34 million to a total of $40.67 million). This funding will support an increased focus on STEM research and evaluation to expand knowledge a bout effective strategies for student recruitment, retention, and persistence in STEM programs. Decreased support to LSAMP will reduce funding for Pre-Alliance Planning grants and Bridge to the Baccalaureate Alliances. STEM Professional Workforce CREST will continue to grow the new Postdoctoral Research Fellowship track introduced in FY 2016 which fosters increased collaborations across the centers and builds research capacity at minority serving institutions. HRD's funding for CREST is $24.0 million (-$40,000). EASE (-$1.77 million to a total of $3.82 million): Collaborative efforts among the EASE, Noyce, and DRK-12 programs support the professional developmen t of preK-12 teachers, by piloting models for teacher leadership. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 15 DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUA TE EDUCATION (DUE) $204,390,000 -$27,900,000 / -12.0% Amount Percent Total, DUE $232.29 - and Learning 91.50 -8.52 -8.5% EHR Core Research (ECR): STEM Learning 13.02 - 4.50 -8.52 -65.5% Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) 87.00 - 87.00 - STEM Professional Workforce 132.08 FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request The Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) suppor ts the design, development, and study of innovative STEM learning environments that integrate cutting- edge science and education findings to improve learning for all undergraduates. These investments pr omote changes in teaching practices across the full range of U.S. higher education, from community colleges, through four-year colleges and large comprehensive public institutions, to research univers ities, including flagship state-supported systems. In turn, these changes serve to open multiple career path ways for undergraduates. For example, innovative efforts at community colleges enable students to gain expertise in advanced te chnologies such as additive manufacturing, biotechnology, precision agriculture, nano-optics, or cybersecurity that lead directly to employment in those sectors. At other institu tions STEM majors can pursue alternative teaching certification to be able to enter the K-12 teaching work force in high-need school districts. Overall, improved student learning outcomes for STEM students lead to greater retention and degree attainment, and better preparation to meet STEM-savvy workforce needs and to replenish the pool of future STEM researchers. The FY 2018 Budget Request for DUE is $204.39 million. This budget will allow DUE programs to provide direction for the nationwide movement to transfor m undergraduate STEM education through the creation and study of innovative environments for undergraduate STEM interdisciplinary and disciplinary learning. DUE also continues to be the main source of support across federal agencies for discipline-based educational research, 9 where disciplinary expertise and evidence from the learning sciences are infused into physical and virtual tools, technologies, and othe r learning experiences, and then iteratively improved through research and development to impact STEM l earning at scale. DUE will focus on investments for improving mathematics learning and teaching, particularly in the first two years; improving data science learning; developing socio-emotional and twenty first century skills in conjunction with STEM learning; and developing the next generation of researcher s who will study undergraduate STEM education. To increase the population of diverse, innovative ST EM and STEM-savvy workers, DUE also will focus on improving the preparation of future members of two important sectors of the professional workforce: K- 12 teachers and highly skilled technicians in advanced technology industries. In FY 2018, special attention will be placed on attracting proposals to IUSE: EHR led by investigators from minority-serving community colleges, as well as investigators from two- and four- year institutions with pr ior funding from HBCU-UP and TCUP. DUE funding for IUSE includes support for IUSE: HSI. Across DUE programs, research and 9 National Research Council. (2012).

Learning and Learning Environments ECR: STEM Learning Environments (-$8.52 million to a total of $4.5 million): DUE has leadership for this ECR focus area. The funds will support foun dational research and rela ted development for the improvement of STEM learning environments, incl uding cyberlearning, as well as the use of data science to understand and impr ove learning environments. DUE's funding for IUSE is $87.0 million (level with FY 2016 Actual) to support scaling evidence- based practices; advancing the knowledge base fo r undergraduate research, including course-based research; and developing and identifying indicators, metrics, and assessments to measure readiness for and progress toward widespread use of evidence-ba sed resources in undergraduate STEM instruction. DUE will seek to increase the STEM research and e xperiential learning opportu nities available in NSF- funded large facilities, national laboratories, and cen ters through the S-STEM program in collaboration with the NSF Graduate Research Internship Progr am (GRIP) within GRFP. DUE will work with HRD to align the IUSE: EHR and S-STEM (an H-1B Visa funded program) programs with the LSAMP program to leverage the strengths of all three progr ams for enhancing persistence of students from low- income and underrepresented groups. The two di visions will focus on improving undergraduate learning at HSIs. This alignment will be informed by an HRD- and DUE-funded study by the National Academies on Barriers and Opportunities for 2- year and 4-year STEM Degrees.10 For more information regarding IUSE and NSF's undergraduate framewo rk, see the IUSE narrative in the NSF-Wide Investments chapter.

That law required that a prescribed percentage of funds in the account be made available to NSF for low-in come scholarships; grants for mathematics, engineering, or science enrichment courses; and systemic reform activities. In FY 2005, Public Law 108-447 reauthorized H-1B funding. NSF was provided with 40 percent of the total H-1B receipts collected. Thirty percent of H-1B receipts (75 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are to be used for a low-income scholarship program, Scholar ships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM). Ten percent of receipts (25 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are designated for support of private-public partnerships in K-12 education through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST). Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM). The S-STEM program began in 1999 under P.L. 105-277. At this time, the program was named Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) and supported grants for scholarships to academically-talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuin g associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics. Grantee institutions awarded scholarships of up to $2,500 per year for two years to eligible students. The CSEMS activity continued under the American Competitiveness in the 21 st Century Act (P.L. 106-313) with a prescribed percentage of H-1B receipts (22 percent) which totaled approximately 59.5 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF. P.L. 106-313 also amended P. L. 105-277 by increasing the maximum scholarship duration to four years and the annual stipend to $3,125. Under the Consolidated Appropriatio ns Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447), the prescribed percentage of H-1B receipts available for the low income scholarship pr ogram was increased to 30 percent (approximately 75 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF). Eligibilit y for the scholarships was expanded from the original fields of computer science, engineering, and ma thematics to include \"other technology and science programs designated by the Director.\" The maximum annual scholarship award amount was raised from $3,125 to $10,000. Language also was added allowi ng NSF to use up to 50 percent of funds \"for undergraduate programs for curriculum development, professional and workforce development, and to advance technological education.\" As a result, the program was renamed in 2006 from CSEMS to S-STEM. Low-income Scholarship Program: S-STEM. The S-STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enable academically talented U.S. students demonstrating financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in fi elds of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The program emphasizes the importa nce of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 18 mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. Since its inception, the low-income scholarship program has received over 7,400 proposals from all types of colleges and universities and has made awards to 1,743 projects. In addition to scholarships, projects include a coherent ecosystem of student support activities featuring close involvement of faculty, student mentoring, academic support, curricu lum development, and recognition of the students. Such activities are important in recruiting and reta ining students in high-technology fields through graduation and into employment. In FY 2018, in addi tion to the long-standing scholarship support, all S-STEM projects will contribute to the knowledge base of scholarly research in education by carrying out research on interventions which affect asso ciate or baccalaureate degree attainment for academically talented U.S. students demonstrati ng financial need. Because S-STEM projects report much higher retention and gradua tion rates among their scholarship students than among other STEM majors, it is important to systematically study the r easons for this success so that effective practices can be used at scale. Approximately 85-90 awards ar e anticipated in FY 2018, with an emphasis on increasing involvement of community colleges, especially Hispanic-serving institutions. S-STEM activities in FY 2018 will leverage efforts in the IUSE: EHR and LSAMP programs to enhance persistence of students. S-STEM will be a pa rtner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative. S-STEM programming and research emphasis also will align w ith NRT to understand and enhance development of effective learning environments and pathways for scholarship and traineeship students on the continuum from two-year to four-year to master's to doctoral degrees. Private-Public Partnerships in K-12. The American Competitiveness in the 21 st Century Act (P.L. 106- 313) amended P.L. 105-277 and changed the way petitione r fees were to be expended. P.L. 106-313 directed the remaining 40.5 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF (15 percent of H-1B receipts) toward K-12 activities involving private-public part nerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, and mathematics and science teache r professional development. The ITEST program was developed as a partnership activity in K-12 to increase opportunities for students and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of STEM, including information technology (IT) courses. In FY 2005, P.L. 108-447 reduced the prescribed percentage of H-1B receipts available for private-public partnerships in K-12 to 10 percent (approximately 25 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF). Private-Public Partnerships in K-12: ITEST. The ITEST program invests in K-12 activities that address the ongoing and growing need for STEM prof essionals and information technology workers in the U.S. and seeks solutions to help ensure the br eadth and depth of the U.S. STEM workforce. ITEST funds activities for students and teachers that emphasi ze mathematics, science, and engineering careers, and emphasizes the importance of evaluation and resear ch to understand the impact of such activities. The program supports the devel opment, implementation, testing, and scale-up of models, STEM robotics projects, and research studies to improve the STEM workforce and build a student's capacity to participate in the STEM workforce. The so licitation places emphasis on capturing and establishing a reliable knowledge base about the dispositions towa rd and knowledge about STEM workforce skills in U.S. students. Since its inception, the ITEST program has receive d 4,961 proposals and funded 484 projects that allow students and teachers to work closely with scientis ts, engineers, and other STEM professionals on extended research projects ranging from biotechnolog y to environmental resource management to programming and problem-solving. Projects draw on a wide mix of local resources, including universities, industry, museums, scie nce and technology centers, and school districts in order to identify the characteristics that attract a wide and diver se range of young people to STEM careers, especially FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 19 those students not successful in traditional school setti ngs. In FY 2018, ITEST w ill be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative and will ma ke approximately FY 2016 (Dollars in Millions) 1 P.L. 108-447 directs that 10 percent of the H-1B Petitioner funds go toward K-12 activities involving private-publice partnersh ips in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, and math and science teacher professional development. Explanation of Carryover Within the H-1B no-year account, $74.63 million was carried over into FY 2017.

There is no impact on the FY 2018 Budget Request.MREFC Account Funding, by Project (Dollars in Millions) 1Of the $99.67 million appropriated for LSST in FY 2016, $6.70 million was carried over to FY 2017 and is excluded in the amounts above. This is being held as part of NSF's enhanced oversight of budget contingency. 3In June 2016, the National Science Board (NSB) approved an increase in NEON's Total Project Cost from $433.72 million to $469.30 million. The $35.58 million increase is provided through transfers from the R&RA account to the MREFC account of $20.0 million from FY 2016 funds (completed) and up to $15.58 million from FY 2017 funds (expected). The $20.0 million transferred in FY 2016 was carried over to FY 2017.2Of the $80.64 million appropriated for NEON in FY 2016, $8.40 million was carried over to FY 2017 and is excluded in the amounts above. This is being held as part of NSF's enhanced oversight of budget contingency as well as NSF-held management reserve. Modern and effective research infrast ructure is critical to maintaining U.S. international leadership in science and engineering. The futu re success of entire fields of research depends upon access to new generations of powerful research tools. Increasingl y, these tools are large and complex and have a significant information technology or cyber-infrast ructure component. To be considered for MREFC funding, NSF requires that a project represent an excepti onal opportunity to enable research and education. The project should be transformative in nature, with the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding. The projects included in this budget re quest meet these criteria based on NSF and National Science Board review and approval. In FY 2018, NSF will request $182.80 million to con tinue construction on three of the four on-going projects; the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 2 and the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV). NEON will be completed in spring 2018 with funds already appropriated per the table above. For more in formation on each project, see the individual narratives later in this chapter. Since FY 2009, projects funded through the MREFC account have been subject to NSF's \"no cost overrun\" policy. As a result, NSF processes and procedures mu st assure the development of realistic and well- supported total project cost estimates for major rese arch infrastructure such that approved budgets are sufficient to accomplish the scientific objectives. Th e current policy as published in NSF's Large Facilities Manual (LFM) requires that (1) the total project cost estimate when exiting the preliminary design phase includes adequate contingency to cover foreseeable risk s, (2) any cost increases not covered by contingency be accommodated first by reductions in scope, provided that the actual en acted funding levels have been consistent with the established annual cash flow requireme nts, and (3) if the project is approved to continue and further scope reductions become too detrimental to science, then the first 10 percent of any cost increase must be covered by the sponsoring directorate thro ugh R&RA funding. This final step was required for NEON, as noted in the table above and described in the individual narrative for the project. All projects funded through the MREFC account under go periodic cost, schedule, and risk reviews as required by the LFM and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements. NSF policies and reporting requirements are designed to ensure routin e and reliable tracking of progress (including the use of Earned Value Management), project spending, and use of contingency and that program and recipients each have sufficient oversight and management aut hority (respectively) to meet project objectives. Enhanced NSF Oversight NSF has greatly strengthened its oversight of major fac ility projects in recent years, with a number of those enhancements now codified in the American I nnovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) of 2017. One significant enhancement is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating to the program for obligation to the project based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carryover each year; how ever, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. Enhanced oversight of the construction stage now also includes manda tory incurred cost audits and independent cost estimates, as well as other aud its and reviews based on an annual major facility portfolio risk assessment. These efforts are conducted by NSF and are generally not attributable to a specific project at the time of budget formulation, nor are they part of the total project cost developed and managed by the recipient. To properly support and transparen tly account for these efforts, actual costs and future estimates for \"Enhanced Oversight\" are shown separatel y from each project in the MREFC account table. Initial funding (FY 2017 and FY 20 18) for enhanced oversight activ ities is $500,000 to $1.0 million annually. These activities are supported with funds rec overed from projects completed in previous years.

INOUYE SOLAR TELESCOPE $20,000,000 The FY 2018 Budget Request for NSF's Daniel K. Inou ye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is $20.0 million. This represents the 10th year in an 11-year funding profile, with an estimated total project cost of $344.13 million. Completion of construction atop Haleakala on Ma ui, Hawaii is planned for no later than June 2020. When completed, DKIST will be the world's most powerful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facilities. DKIST will enable the study of magnetic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Determining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity, including flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar activity can affect civil life on Ea rth through phenomena generally described as space weather and may have impact on the terrestrial cl imate. The relevance of DKIST's science drivers was reaffirmed by the National Academy of Scien ces 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey: New Worlds, New Horizons 1 as well as the 2012 Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey: A Science for a Technological Society .2 DKIST will play an important role in enhancing the \"fundamental understanding of space weather and its drivers,\" an objective calle d out in the National Space Weather Strategy and associated National Space Weather Action Plan, both of which were released by the National Science and Technology Council on October 29, 2015. Prior YearsFY 2014 ActualFY 2015 ActualFY 2016 Funds for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (Dollars in Millions) Baseline History Beginning in 2001, NSF provided funds to the Nationa l Solar Observatory (NSO) for an eight-year design and development program for DKIST and its initial co mplement of instruments through the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO). The current design, cost, schedule, and risk were scrutin ized in an NSF-conducted Preliminary Design Review in October-November 2006. The original total project cost to NSF, $297.93 milli on, was set after a Final Design Review (FDR) in May 2009, which determined that the project was fully pr epared to begin construction. The National Science Board (NSB) approved an award for this amount at the NSF Director's discretion, contingent upon completion of compliance with relevant environmental and cultural/historic statutes. In FY 2009, $153.0 million was appropriated to initiate construction. Funding was provi ded through a combination of the MREFC account ($7.0 million) and the American R ecovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) account ($146.0 million). Given the timing of the receipt of budget authority and the complexity of project contracting, the entire $153.0 million was carried over from FY 2009 and obligated in FY 2010. 1 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 2 www.nap.edu/search/? term=13060&x=0&y=0 FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 5 The environmental compliance requirements were comple ted on November 20, 2009, and the NSF Director signed the Record of Decision authorizing constructi on on December 3, 2009. The Hawaii Board on Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) approved the project's a pplication for a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) on December 1, 2010. The Hawaii BLNR appr oved a Habitat Conservation Plan, designed to protect and rehabilitate habitats of the endangered Hawaiian petr el and Hawaiian goose that could potentially be affected by the construction of DKIST . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service completed a formal consultation regarding the e ndangered Hawaiian petrel in 2011. A contested case challenge to the 2010 CDUP issuance delayed site construction until th e BLNR ruled in favor of the DKIST project and issued a new CDUP November 2012. Full access to the site atop Haleakala followed shortly thereafter. Site preparation and excavation began November 30, 2012. The unexpected length of the delay associated with the environmental compliance process led to a reassessment of the project schedule and total project co st in 2012. An external panel of experts reviewed the revised baseline and increased the total project cost by approximately $46.20 million. The NSB also subsequently considered and approved a revised tota l project cost of $344.13 million at their August 2013 meeting.

This eliminates the need to build a new aluminizing chamber for DKIST. Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr is first- light instrument named the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Queens University Belfast (Belfast, Northern Ireland) is leading a consortium of institutions from the United Kingdom that will supply high-speed visi ble cameras to feed the DKIST instruments. Discussions of other possible contributions for sec ond-generation instruments, algorithm development, coordinated observations, and st udent exchange are ongoing. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: Oversight from NSF is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, the Office of Budget, Finan ce, and Award Management (BFA), the Office of General Counsel, and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA the Large Facilities Office (BFA/LFO) provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from the above NSF offices comprise the DKIST integrated project team (IPT), which meets on a quarterly basis to discuss outstanding project issues. External Structure: The construction project is conducted by NSO. NSF funds NSO operations and maintenance (O&M) and DKIST design and construc tion via separate cooperative support agreements (CSAs) beneath an overarching cooperative agreemen t (CA) with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA). The CSA fo r DKIST construction runs through the end of FY 2019. The NSO CA and O&M CSA were renewed fo r a period of ten years through the end of FY 2024. This period covers the DKIST construction phase and the achievement of sustainable operations of the completed facility. The DKIST director is a senior NSO scientist who was a leader in the development of the science case and an expert in the field of solar adaptive optics, a critical $0$10$20$30$40$50 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023DKIST Funding, by Stage(Dollars in Millions) Implementation Operations & MaintenanceFY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 7 technology for the DKIST. The project manager has experience in several NSF-funded large projects including the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillime ter Array and the Expanded Very Large Array. Several councils and working gr oups provide input from the solar and space physics communities. Reviews Management, Cost, and Schedule reviews: DKIST scope , schedule, budget estimate, and risk-adjusted total project cost were scrutinized and validated at the Preliminary Design and Final Design Reviews. Business Systems Review (BSR): NSF conducted a BSR covering AURA, NSO, and the DKIST project December 2015 - March 2016. Findings and recomme ndations from NSF's final report were conveyed to AURA on April 1, 2016, and AURA continues to resolve issues and implement recommendations from the report. Contingency Assessment: BFA/LFO and MPS/AST conducted a detailed assessment of the DKIST budget and schedule contingency, Fe bruary 2016 - July 2016. The assessment found that management of contingency is in compliance with current N SF guidelines and requirements. The remaining project budget and schedule contingency appear to be adequate based on accepted industry standards at an 80 percent confidence level for an on-budget and on-time completion. Findings and recommendations from the final NSF report were conveyed to AURA on August 5, 2016. AURA continues to implement recommendations from the report, while NSF tracks its progress. Earned Value Management (EVM) System Review : BFA/LFO and MPS/AST conducted a review of the DKIST project's EVM system, September 20-22, 2016. The external reviewers verified the project's EVM system and conducted interviews with project management and individual cost account managers (CAMs) to validate the input estimates/data into the system. The evaluation team found that the EVMS has been effectively implemented and is being used to provide reliable project management information. The NSF formally accepted the project 's EVMS in a notification dated Feb. 22, 2017. Software Quality Assurance (SQA ) Assessment: BFA/LFO has engaged a contractor to perform an assessment of the DKIST Project's processes and pro cedures for producing the software systems to be delivered at DKIST first light. The SQA assessment will consist of a document desk review followed by an in-person meeting in June 2017. Independent Risk Assessment (IRA): BFA/LFO has e ngaged a contractor to perform an independent assessment of the project's remain ing risks as DKIST enters the critical integration, testing and commissioning (IT&C) stage of construction. The IRA will consist of a document desk review followed by an in-person meeting in September 2017. Programmatic Review: A comprehensive programma tic review of the DKIST MREFC construction project will be conducted in Q4 of FY 2017. This external programmatic review will focus on the IT&C phase of construction. Project Status The DKIST project continues to make progress on cons truction at the summit of Haleakala on Maui, HI, while remaining in compliance with all local, state, and federal environmental and cultural requirements. The project continues to consult with various st akeholders on a regular basis including the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawaiian Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Aviation Administra tion, the National Park Service, and Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. Construction highlights: The project continues to work on interior fit and finish items for the enclosure (dome) and the support and operations (S&O) building. Work continues on the critical facility thermal sy stems (FTS) despite some staffing challenges. The Coud\u00e9 rotator platform assembly inside the enclos ure is completed. The Coud\u00e9 rotator platform is undergoing site acceptance testing expected to be completed in Q3 of FY 2017. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 8 Assembly of the telescope mount assembly (TMA) continues through FY 2017 into Q2 of FY 2018 (see picture). Fabrication of the DKIST first-light instruments continues through FY 2017. In FY 2018 installation of the TMA will be completed, and commissioning and acceptance testing of the TMA underway. The installation of the telescope structure and mechanical controls will have begun. By the end of FY 2018 the installation of the M1 main mirror will be underway and the alignment of the mirror with the laser metrology system begun. The first of the five first-light instruments, the visible broadband imager (VBI), will be delivered to the site, assembled and will begin initial checkout. Cost and Schedule The original baseline not-to-exceed, risk-adjusted cost was established following FDR. As noted above, a revised project baseline review was held in Octobe r 2012; NSB approved the new baseline in August 2013. Total project cost of $344.13 million is derived from ARRA ($146.0 million) and annual appropriations in the MREFC account ($198.13 million). A Monte Carlo analys is of the risk-adjusted project end date at the time of the project re-baseline indicated June 10, 2020 at an 80 percent Confidence Level (CL) for successful completion. The project is currently on track for a late 2019 end date. Risks Project management control, interface control, and cha nge controls are in place. The project also maintains a risk register that is reviewed and updated on a monthly basis. Technical: The majority of the remaining technical risk is very low as a result of the long design and development phase, with the exception of one first- light instrument: the VTF described above. This instrument is an in-kind contribution from the Germ an Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik (KIS) being designed and developed through an MOU between AURA and KIS, and therefore the fabrication risks for this instrument remain with the German institu te. The VTF recently achieved a technical milestone regarding the precision of the optics. KIS is currently on track to deliver a de-scoped (single etalon) version of the instrument by DKIST first light. The DKIST project and the managing organization, AURA, continue to actively manage the situation. It should be not ed that the cooperative support agreement between the NSF and AURA identifies four facility-class instruments (not including the VTF) to be delivered by the DKIST Project at the end of the MREFC construction ph ase. The Project is currently on track to deliver those four instruments. Environmental and Cultural Compliance: AST, NSF's Office of the General Counsel, and the DKIST project have carefully worked through the applicable statutes, and a cultural m onitor has been retained during construction. All required permits are in place and semi-annual consultati ons with a Native Hawaiian working group continue. The two outstanding legal app eals with the potential to impact project construction were resolved in favor of the DKIST project. On Octo ber 6, 2016 the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled against the appellant in the two cases and upheld both the DKI ST project's conservation district use permit (CDUP) and the University of Hawaii's Haleakala Observato ry Management Plan. These decisions substantially reduce the risks to DKIST construction due to permitting issues. Installation of the saddle secti ons of the DKIST telescope moun t assembly 2017. Credit: P. DKIST. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 9 Environmental Health and Safety: NSO has a well-developed safety program engendered in the DKIST project. The DKIST project has developed a site sa fety plan and conducted a thorough construction readiness review in 2011 and conducts annual safety reviews. DKIST Operations Costs DKIST operations are funded through the Research and Related Activities account (R&RA). (See the NSO narrative in the Facilities chapter for more information. ) In FY 2018, the request of $16.0 million includes $14.0 million for the continuing ramp of DKIST opera tions and $2.0 million for cultural mitigation activities as discussed below. The need for a Remote Operations Building (ROB) f acility located on Maui was identified in the early stages of DKIST development. In FY 2015, the managing organization (AURA) demonstrated to NSF that construction of a dedicated ROB would result in signi ficant savings to the federal government, compared to leasing space over the planned 45-year lifetime of DKIST. Thus, operations costs of DKIST for FY 2018 and beyond have been reduced by $500,000 annually as compared to the FY 2016 NSF Budget Request to Congress. In FY 2019, the estimated steady-state oper ations and maintenance cost will be $16.50 million, exclusive of the $2.0 million for cultural mitigati on activities described below. DKIST will become the flagship telescope for the solar community, rendering some current facilities obsolete. As noted above, cultural mitigation commitments we re made pursuant to terms of DKIST environmental and cultural compliance as described in the final envir onmental impact study and the subsequent Record of Decision and the Programmatic Agreement. These incl ude $2.0 million of R&RA funding annually for 10 years (FY 2011 - FY 2020) for programs on Maui, supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and workfor ce development with an emphasis on Native Hawaiian students. A ten- year award to develop and administer these programs w as made to University of Hawaii, Maui College in September 2011.

Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 10 LARGE SYNOPTIC S URVEY TELESCOPE $57,800,000 The FY 2018 Budget Request the Large Synoptic Surv ey Telescope (LSST) is $57.80 million. This is the fifth year of support for a nine-year project that began in August 2014. The National Science Board approved not-to-exceed total project cost is $473.0 m illion for NSF's contribution to the the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (Dollars in Millions) LSST is located in Chile and, when completed, wi ll be an 8-meter-class wide-field optical telescope designed to carry out surveys of nearly half of th e sky. The initial 10-year su rvey has a cadence enabling repeat observation of each survey field approximately twice weekly. The requirements for LSST were set by considering four key science areas: the physics of dark energy and dark matter. a census of small bodies in the solar system, incl uding potentially hazardous Near Earth Objects. the structure and contents of the Milky Way galaxy. the nature of transient astronomical objects on time scales ranging from seconds to years. By satisfying the requirements defined by these key investigations, the LSST survey will result in a comprehensive data set that will enable hundreds of fu ndamental astrophysical studies by the entire research community on these and other topics. Thus, LSST has th e potential to advance every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to th e large-scale structure of the Universe. Baseline History LSST is a joint NSF/Department of Energy (DOE) project to build an instrument that was ranked the top large ground-based astronomy project by the National Research Council (NRC) 2010 Decadal Survey.3 Prior to NSF's construction award, NSF, DOE, and pr ivate (non-federal) partners invested over $130.0 million. About 70 percent supported design and development, and about 30 percent, from the non-federal funding, supported casting and polishi ng of the innovative combined primary-tertiary mirror (M1M3), initial site preparation, and prototype detector creat ion and evaluation, all of which significantly reduced construction risk. NSF and DOE conducted a series of reviews in 2011 and 2012 to determine the project baseline, including the NSF Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a subse quent cost estimation review. Plans were kept up- to-date to synchronize the DOE and NSF funding profiles as reviews continued, leading to NSF's Final Design Review (FDR) in December 2013. NSF then carried out a detailed cost analysis prior to following through on its approval process and making an award in the last quarter of FY 2014. 3 http://sites.n ationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810 FY 2018 NSF Budget Request Concept & Development $57.13 - - - - - - - - O p e r a t i o n s & M a i n t e n a n c e ---- 1 . 8 0 3 . 7 0 7 . 6 0 1 5 . 7 0 2 6 . 9 Millions) FY 2018 RequestESTIMA TES 1Concept & Development funding and Implementation funding are cumulative of all prior years; Operations & Maintenance funding reflects prior year actual obligations only.Prior Years1FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 Estimate 2 Includes $6.70 million carried forward into FY 2017. LSST Science Plan The site at Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile was selected for LSST because of the excellent sky transparency and image quality (\"seeing\"), dark skies, small fraction of cloudy nights, and the geological characteristics that enable the rapid telescope motions required to carry out th e LSST survey. LSST will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi-color imaging data every night for 10 years, produc ing a long-lived dataset of considerable utility. It will produce the deepest, widest-field sky image ever, and issue alerts for changing and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. Repeated deep im aging of every part of the accessible sky will turn up explosive events such as cataclysmic variable stars, supernovae, and the optical counterparts of X-ray flashes, as well as finding moving objects and better ch aracterizing those already known. Early estimates of LSST's ability to locate Near Earth Objects (NEO ) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHA) have been refined by LSST Project members, as well as by external studies, including an independent Jet Propulsion Laboratory study supported by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. Assuming other existing NEO efforts continue, at the end of LS ST's 10-year prime mission, the catalog should be ~75 $0$15$30$45$60$75$90$105 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023LSST Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Concept & Development Implementation Operations &MaintenanceMajor Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 12 percent complete for NEO (~80 percent for PHA), appr oximately 15 percent more complete than without LSST. LSST data will be widely accessible, and discovery oppor tunities will be available to the K-12 student as well as to the professional astronomer. An innovative citizen science program will involve people of all ages in LSST discoveries. More than half of the cost during operations is for data management, including user-friendly interfaces tailored for the different antic ipated communities. The su rvey strategy makes the same dataset usable for almost all of the astronom y community as well as for educators and the general public. The primary data archive is planned to be located at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in Illinois. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is the primary respons ibility of the LSST program officer in the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) working with staff from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management, which includes the Large Facilities Office, through an integrated project te am (IPT). The NSF program officer works closely with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics, who have oversight responsibility for the LSST camera sub-project. Inter-agenc y coordination is accomplished through weekly meetings of a joint oversight group (JOG) and was formalized through an MOU signed in July 2012. External Structure: The responsible awardee for LSS T construction is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), a non-prof it science management corporation consisting of 42 U.S. institutional members and five internati onal affiliates. AURA works closely with the LSST Corporation (LSSTC), which initiated LSST developmen t and remains responsible for privately raised funding. AURA and LSSTC established the LSST Pr oject Office as an AURA-managed center for construction; this office is overseen by the AURA Management Council for LSST. The LSST project director and the LSST project manager are experience d in large facility cons truction and operation and are appointed by AURA, with the involvement and approval of NSF and DOE. Reviews Technical Reviews: Reviews were conducted throughout the design and development phase, culminating in NSF's FDR in December 2013, with DOE involvement. All major sub-systems undergo regular system-level design reviews organized by the LSST Project Office with external participants. Management, Cost, and Schedule Reviews: Cost, schedule, and risk are also scrutinized by the technical reviews. During construction, NSF and DOE are holding regular joint progress reviews. Major reviews held by both NSF and DOE prior to the MREFC award found the Basis of Estimate documentation to be quite adequate, with small improvements requested. On May 7, 2014, the National Science Board (N SB) issued Resolution NSB-14-24, authorizing NSF management to proceed with the construc tion award, subject to additional cost and management scrutiny. Those reviews were carried out by NSF and allowed the MREFC award to be issued in August 2014. The first annual construction review was schedul ed for August-September 2015 but was deferred until February 2016. The review panel made several recommendations to improve project execution. To get back on schedule, the second progress review happened in August 2016 and was also successful, except that the Data Management (DM) systems were undergoing a major replan and could not be fully evaluated. A follow up inte nsive DM-focused review is being scheduled for July 2017. The next overall progress revi ew is scheduled for September 2017. In conjunction with the first progress review, NSF organized an Earned Value Management (EVM) validation review to consider both the adequacy of the system used for EVM, and the Project staff's ability to use EVM tools and methods. The Project passed with only minor recommendations for small improvements. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 13 In January 2017, DOE and NSF held a joint extern al agency review of the project's plans for commissioning and transition to early operations. After DOE Critical Decision (CD) reviews, DOE issu ed CD-3a approval for long-lead procurements in July 2014, and CD-2 approval, including setting th e not-to-exceed Total Project Cost for the DOE sub- project, on January 7, 2015. CD-3 review in early August 2015 was followed by formal approval for full DOE construction funding on August 27, 2015. Project Status NSF's construction award was issued on August 1, 2014. Since then, the project has worked closely to the planned schedule and cost, with only minor issues c overed from the (risk-based) contingency funds and by the use of internal contractor float and project schedule contingency. During FY 2017, the primary telescope building will be s ubstantially completed, as will dome instal lation. The base facility reconstruction including the LSST Chilean data centers will be well underway, and the calibration telescope will be made ready for installation. NSF- and DOE- supported activiti es remain tightly coordinated, both at the project level and between agency program officers. Cost and Schedule A complete re-estimate of the project occurred prio r to the NSF FDR. The FDR panel found the NSF Total Project Cost (TPC) of $473.0 million to be reasonable and justifiable, assuming the project introduced some additional de-scoping options. NSF carried out some further cost review prior to making the award. NSF policy changed from a probabilistic contingency est imation based on the Project Management Control System (PMCS) to requiring a joint cost and schedule Monte Carlo (MC) method. The project established the new MC method throughout their PMCS and showed that the computed TPC corresponds to a better than 90 percent chance of coming in and within the co st sum of base plus contingency, and before the planned survey start date (base completion date plus schedule contingency). This result was finalized in April 2015 and incorporated into NSF's award instrument. NSF has revised its policy on the use and oversight of management fees. AURA and NSF will carry out fee negotiations each fiscal year, and the total will fit unde r the approved total project cost. Because of these contingency and fee changes, the forward-pr ojected budget profile has been revised. In addition to NSF's contribution, DOE's baseline for the camera has been fixed at $168.0 million. Construction also includes $38.97 million from non-fede ral sources, all of which has been expended. Risks Technical: Much of the technical risk was retired duri ng design and development. Since full construction began, no new major risks have appear ed, and small, realized risks have been mitigated by use of cost and schedule contingency, including float internal to su b-projects. The Data Management construction effort currently is undergoing re-planning, and thus is being carried as a risk. Environmental and Cultural Compliance: Environmental and cultural impact mitigation continues as planned with no unforeseen issues. Site: The possible site risk due to local geological anoma lies, mentioned in previous requests, was realized early during excavation. Since this risk was localiz ed and anticipated, it was successfully handled. Site disruptions from geological events and extreme w eather remain as possible risks with appropriate mitigation plans. Environmental Health and Safety: The LSST project has a full-time head of safety with experience in AURA operations, which has a long positive safety record in Chile. Both the su mmit and base sites have Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 14 on-site safety supervisors employed by LSST to monitor contractor and project activities. All safety plans are fully compliant with applicable standards from U.S., Chilean, and participating institutions, and are updated regularly. External reviews have given the Project high marks for its safety culture. Partnership Risk: The LSST project director and deputy oversee the entire project. A single project manager, agreed to by both NSF and DOE, manages the complete work breakdo wn structure elements. Budgetary management details are clearly set out betw een the project director, the project manager, the project's Change Control Board, the AURA Mana gement Council for LSST, and the agency program officers, grants officers, and financial managers. Future Operations Costs Operation costs will be funded out of the Research and Related Activities account. The current estimate for full operations costs was $36.63 million per year (US$ FY 2013) at the time of FDR. The final full operations costs and the amount required from non-federa l partners will be determined through a review and approval process scheduled to start in mid-2017 wh en the project submits a formal proposal for LSST operations jointly to NSF and DOE. In their joint MOU, NSF and DOE agreed to fund ope rations, increasing agency support and/or revising the operations plans, as appropriate. MPS/AST has been pla nning to provide half of the original amount plus early operations support, with the DOE Office of High Energy Physics providing one quarter. The project team has already established firm agreements to fu nd ~$6.3 million of the estimated $9.0 million annual operating costs allocated for fundin g by non-federal entities, and nego tiations continue with potential partners to find the remaining balance. Should full f unding of the operations budgets not be achieved, the project has also prepared de-scope pl ans that reduce the scope of operati ons but also inevitably affect some of the science deliverables. Although the possibility of insufficient operational funding is not a risk to the project, it is a significant concern for the agencies and the awardee and is being closely watched.

FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 15 THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK $0 No MREFC funds are requested for the National Ecol ogical Observatory Network (NEON) in the FY 2018 Request. Construction funding totals an estimated $469.30 million, which reflects a $35.58 million increase in the Total Project Cost (TPC) in conjunction with the change in the managing organization. The increase in the TPC is being funded via transfers of R esearch and Related Activities (R&RA) funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). Construction is expected to be complete by the spring of 2018. NEON operations and maintenance will be funded through the R&RA account. Prior YearsFY 2012 ActualFY 2013 - 469.30 - - - - 20.00 15.58 - 35.58 1In June 2016, the National Science Board (NSB) approved an increase in NEON's Total Project Cost from $433.72 million to $469.30 million. The $35.58 million increase is provided through transfers from the R&RA account to the MREFC account of $20.0 million from FY 2016 funds (completed) and up to $15.58 mi llion from FY 2017 funds (expected).Appropriated for the National Ecolo gical Observator y Network (Dollars in Millions) NEON consists of geographically distributed field a nd lab infrastructure networked into an integrated research platform for regional to continental scal e ecological research. Cutting-edge sensor networks, instrumentation, experimental infrastructure, natural history archive facilities, and remote sensing will be linked via the internet to computational, analytical , and modeling capabilities to create NEON's integrated infrastructure. Baseline History In 2004, the National Research Council evaluated the original NEON design of loosely confederated observatories and recommended that it be reshaped into a single integrated platform for regional to continental scale ecological research. Congress appropriated initial funding in FY 2007. A Preliminary Design Review was completed in June 2009 and a Final Design Review (FDR) was completed in November 2009. The FDR also included a formal construction baseline review and cost review; an additional baseline review was conducted in April 2011 prior to initiation of construction that confirmed the baseline scope, cost, and schedule. Project planning continued through FY 2011 until construction began in August 2011. NEON will be a collaborative research pl atform of geographi cally distributed infrastructure connected via the latest information technology. By combining in-situ sensing with remote sensing obs ervations, NEON will address pressing environmental questions on regional to continental scales.

In FY 2017, a transfer of up to $15.58 million from the R&RA account to the MREFC account is expected. MREFC Project Plan NEON is the first research platform and the only nati onal experimental facility specifically designed to collect consistent and standardized sensor and biol ogical measurements across 81 sites nationwide; reduced from 106 sites following NSF's decision in FY 2015 to de-scope the project in order to prevent a potential $80.0 million cost overrun. Measurements will enable basic research on complex phenomena driving ecological change and at the scales appropriate for st udying many grand challenge questions in ecology. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 17 NEON allows researchers to expand the scale of thei r research to understand continental-scale dynamics affecting ecosystems. A NEON cyberinfrastructure gateway provides resources to support formal and informal public education and provide opportunities for citizens to participate in scientific investigations. NEON data is open-access via web portals and available as soon as possibl e, once basic quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied. Private organizati ons including the Heinz Center, National Geographic Society, Nature Serve, and the Ecological Society of America are assisting Battell e Memorial Institute, Inc. to broaden the impact of NEON science and education to the next generation of scientists and educators. The 2009 United States Global Change Research Program assessments 4 indicate that U.S. ecosystems will experience abrupt and unpredictable changes from a su ite of human-driven processes in the near future. NEON enables research on the impacts of climate and la nd use change, water use, and invasive species on the Nation's living ecosystems at temporal and spatia l scales that are relevant to human well-being. NEON's unique statistically-determined, continental- scale design, with data products, data management, and standardization supports research on the dynami cs of complex coupled systems needed for modeling and understanding rates of change on regional and continental scales. No other standalone system - federal or private - can provide the scientifically validated suite of data measurements that NEON will provide. The scientific techniques, sensor data, and basic research knowledge gained through NEON will inform federal resource management decisions necessitated by climate and land use change, water use, and invasive species. They will contribute to societal be nefits as identified by the 2 014 U.S. National Plan for Civil Earth Observations5 and the international Group on Earth Observations 2005 Framework Document.6 The science that NEON supports is not bound by national boundaries, with regard to environmental change, invasive species, and the ecological processes they af fect. The repurposing of NEON data and information and establishing interoperability among all earth observa tions is important to enable the research on continental to global scales. Domestic and intern ational memorandums of understanding focus on meeting NEON's Strategic Plan and the U.S. Na tional Plan for Civil Earth Observations2 both of which call for strengthening international collaboration in earth ob servations, and to improve data access, management, and interoperability. Formal agreements have b een signed with the European Union, including the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) Ecosystem Thematic Center, Infrastructure for Analysis and Experimentation on Ecosystems (AnaEE), Czech Cl imate Change Research Center (CzechGlobe), and Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Networ k (TERN). Areas of coordination include planning, design, construction, deployment, environmental assessment, data mana gement, geospatial data exchange, cyberinfrastructure, research, and modeling. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The NEON program is managed by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) within BIO. Managing the NEON program in DBI helps foster its associations with other BIO facilities and infrastructure investments and its connections to broader biological and interdisciplinary science activities.

The cognizant program officers for construction and operations coordinate the direct oversight of NEON construction, operations and maintenance, and science utilization. An NSF Inte grated Project Team (IPT) chaired by the NEON program officers, with representatives from the O ffice of Budget, Finance, and Award Management which includes the Large Facility Office, the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, the Office of the Director , and program representatives from other NSF large facilities, helps ensure coordinated agency oversight to the project. The Office of the General Counsel provides ongoing technical advice on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) complian ce and NSF environmental policy and also has representation on the IPT. External Structure: NEON, Inc., the company prev iously managing the NEON project, was notified in December 2015 of NSF's intent to transfer res ponsibility for construction and initial operations to a new management entity. In 2016, NSF used an expe dited process to select a new managing entity for the NEON construction and initial observatory opera tions. As of June 2016, the NEON project is now fully managed by Battelle Memorial Institute, In c. (Battelle), a non-profit, membership-governed corporation with extensive experience managing la rge research projects, government contracts, and related activities. Reviews Technical reviews: The NEON Observatory Design Re view (including site sel ection and deployment design) was successfully completed in February 2009. Environmental review: The NEPA environmental assessment was co mpleted in November 2009. NSF signed a \"Finding of No Significant Impact\" in December 2009; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurred with this finding, as well as with NSF's compliance with the Endangered Species Act. In July 2011, the NSF Record of Decision was signed. NSF conducted a Readiness Review to assess Battell e's competence to assume management of the NEON project in June of 2016. Construction, Cost, and Schedule reviews: A third Baseline Review was held in August 20 14 to evaluate re-planned schedule and cost. NEON, Inc. was notified in May 2015 of non- compliance with terms and conditions of the cooperative support agreement, NSF's concerns over increasing schedule slippage, required delivery of a new estimate to complete the project, and NSF's intent to conduct strategic assistive site visits. In June 2015 the NEON, Inc. estimate to complete included a projected cost overrun of $80.0 million above the approved budget. A baseline Re-S cope Review was held in July 2015 to assess reductions in scope to bring th e costs within the approved budge t in accordance with NSF's \"No Cost Overrun\" policy. In July 2015, NSF directed NEON, Inc. to reduce the project scope and deliver revised project documents, construction schedule, and cost proposal to reflect the scope reduction. A revised proposal was submitted December 2015 whic h indicated the potential for an additional $19 million cost overrun and further schedule slip l eading NSF to make its decision to transfer management responsibility. An independent cost estimate (ICE) was obtained by NSF to support its internal cost analysis and award to the new managing organization. In June 2016 NSF conducted a site visit in orde r to review Battelle's readiness to assume full responsibility for the remaining construction a nd initial operations of the NEON Observatory. A Construction and Transition to Operati ons Review will be conducted in 2017. National Science Board (NSB) Review: The NSB revi ewed and authorized NEON construction in May 2010 and authorized initial NEON Operations and Maintenance (O&M) in February 2013. In FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 19 September 2015, it established an ad hoc Task Fo rce on NEON Performance and Plans to review and monitor NSF's oversight of the project. In 2016, after review of a new construction cost proposal (including the ICE), Battelle's successful management of the project to-date, and the remaining project risks, the NSB authorized an in crease in the total project cost from $433.72 million to $469.30 million. Management, Business, and Operations Reviews: NSF conducted a Business Systems Review and issued a final report in November 2011. An Operations Review of the project's operating pl an and costs for the first three years of operations was held in January 2012. Beginning in May 2015, NSF has conducted a series of site visits to work with NEON, Inc., on improving business systems including reporting capabilities, cost sufficiency and estimation, and supply chain issues including procurement and contracting. Delays in construction have imp acted rollout of operations by one year. With the transition to Battelle, an extension of the initial operations award is anticipated to allow the project to stabilize. A focused, external review of annual operations costs is planned for March 2017. A pre-award cost review prior to full observatory opera tions funding is expected in FY 2018. Annual Operations Reviews will conti nue once construction is complete. Project Status Eighty-five percent of the Observatory research capab ilities have been achieved with one hundred percent capability planned to be completed by the spring of 2018. This includes construction for the remaining terrestrial locations, aquatic sites, and airborne observation platforms (AOP). In FY 2017, MREFC funds will s upport completion of the NEON cyberinfrastructure hardware and software deployments for various sites as well as doma in facilities acceptance. Th is includes completion of the management system for assets, configuration, inve ntory, and data algorithms and related data release via NEON's web portal. Scope Management and De-scoping: Delays in permitting of selected sites, cyberinfrastructure development, and procurements signa led the potential for significant construction cost overruns. Estimates received in June 2015 prompted NSF to assemble le aders from the science comm unity to assess possible scoping strategies for maintaining the project with th e approved budget in accordance with NSF's no cost overrun policy. A major objective of the meeting was to ensure the delivered Obse rvatory would still enable the transformative regional to continental science as framed in the original NEON Science Strategy. This decision to de-scope was confirmed by the NSF/BI O Advisory Committee. De-scoping decisions were finalized and implemented in late July 2015. For FY 2017, $65.0 million was requested from the R&RA account to support initial operations and maintenance. This represents the final increment from the original three-year O&M award as well as a partial increment for a proposed two-year extension wh ile future costs are evaluated by NSF. The additional two years in O&M will allow time for a more comple te understanding of the science capabilities and costs proposed, identification of management efficiencies under Battelle, and to prepare for a re-competition for a longer term award. This includes management a nd technical support, seasonal biological sampling, analytical and archival costs, and domain fac ilities cost. Funds will also support the calibration and validation laboratories and headquarters functions, such as maintenance of the data center, Observatory monitoring, quality assurance and control, and O&M of the AOP. In FY 2018, NSF will explore options for O&M of the full NEON Observatory after construction. As noted above, NSF expects to extend the initial operations awar d that began in FY 2014 for 24 months to allow Battelle time to identify project efficiencies, minimize costs, and maximize science delivery. Final costs for observatory O&M will be determined on the basi s of these management efforts and analyses. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 20 Cost and Schedule The original projected length of the construction stag e was six fiscal years, with six-months of schedule contingency included. Project performance under NEON, Inc., was running well behind the original plan. Under Battelle's management, the planned project end date has shifted back to mid-FY 2018 and the TPC has been re-established as describ ed above. Roughly 80 percent of the approved project funds for construction have been spent, with Observatory cap ability at approximately 85 percent complete. Focused management by Battelle and oversight by NSF is now required to remain within budget and on schedule. Risks Technical : While the bulk of NEON's infrastructure and instrumentation will be \"commercial off-the- shelf,\" NEON's scientific and networking design requi red certain technological innovations for a small number of components. Consequently, BIO has pr ovided R&RA funds for advanced research and development activities in the areas of sensors, cyberin frastructure, and remote sensing technology. These development activities are progressing and risks to sch edule are being monitored. Technical risk is considered low at this point in construction. The re maining technical hurdle is deployment of the cyber- infrastructure architecture for full integration of the NEON observatory sites and mobile platforms for delivery of data to the science community. Deployment : Environmental assessment and permitting conti nues to have a potential impact on schedule. Risk mitigation strategies include the direct contr acting of the environmental assessments by NSF, the hiring of experienced, national firms by Battelle for engineering and permitting, and the identification of alternative sites if primary sites still hold significant risk. The selection of alternative sites for other high- risk sites is nearing completion and environmental compliance activities are actively underway. Management : Management risk has been partially mitig ated by NSF based on the decision to replace NEON, Inc. with Battelle. The transition to new mana gement is an inherently risky proposition but was necessary in this case. Battelle con tinues to work closely with NSF oversight personnel to clearly communicate process, standards, timelines, costs, and expectations. Future Operations Costs NEON is the first research observatory that will main tain and operate in-situ instrumentation and conduct biological sampling in 20 domains (81 locations) including three airborne observatories, a central operating facility, and a cyberinfrastructure center. Field support will be provided to monitor the sensors, and receive, process, and archive data from all measurement system s. NEON operations include significant labor costs due to the manual processes still required for biological sampling and data collection in some fields. NEON is reliant on sensors and cyberinfrastructure that ha ve a defined lifecycle, so operations costs include scheduled replacement and refreshing of sensor, inst rumentation, and cyberinfrastructure technology. Operations activities and associated costs will ramp up as sites are commissioned. Battelle is accelerating the transition of infrastructure to operations whenever possible to appropriately ma nage construction costs. A three-year initial award for O&M began September 2014 to allow NEON, Inc. to explore opportunities for schedule and cost efficiencies and provide a basi s for funding the full Observatory operations during out-years. The delay in construction has extended th is activity from FY 2016 through early FY 2018. An extension of the initial operating peri od through FY 2019 is now planned under Battelle to allow the project to stabilize. For FY 2018, O&M costs are capped at $ 65.0 million for planning purposes with final costs to be determined after Battelle's assessment of management efforts and analyses. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 21 REGIONAL CLASS RE SEARCH VESSELS $105,000,000 The FY 2018 Request for the Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) project is $105.0 million. This represents the second year in a three-year funding prof ile, with an estimated total project cost of $255.50 million. FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 $44.50 $255.50 table does not reflect final action on FY 2017 appropriations, which were enacted too late to be incorporated in this document. P.L. 115-31 provided funding for an additionalRCRV which impacts f unding requirements for FY 2017, FY 2019, FY 2020, and the total project cost. There is no impact on the FY 2018 Budget Request.Appropriated and Requested MREFC Funds for the Regional Class Research Vessel Pro ject1 (Dollars in Millions) The RCRV project will fund construction of two ships to meet anticipated ocean science requirements for the U.S East Coast, West Coast, and Gulf of Mexico. The 2015 National Academies of Science report, Sea Change: 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences7, described eight high-priority science questions, all of which will be supported by RCRV in U.S. coastal waters: 1. What are the rates, mechanisms, impacts, and geographic variability of sea level change? 2. How are the coastal and estuarine o cean and their ecosystems influenced by the global hydrologic cycle, land use, and upwelling from the deep ocean? 3. How have ocean biogeochemical and physical pr ocesses contributed to today's climate and its variability, and how will this system change over the next century? 4. What is the role of biodiversity in the resilience of marine ecosystems and how will it be affected by natural and anthropogenic changes? 5. How different will marine food webs be at mid-century? In the next 100 years? 6. What are the processes that control the fo rmation and evolution of ocean basins? 7. How can risk be better characterized and the ab ility to forecast geohazards like mega-earthquakes, tsunamis, undersea landslides, and vol canic eruptions be improved? 8. What is the geophysical, chemical, and biological character of the subseafloor environment and how does it affect global elemental cycles and unders tanding of the origin and evolution of life? Baseline History The RCRV project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF).8 In 2001, a report from the Federal Oceanogra phic Facilities Committee documented the need for up to three Regional Class vessels. In 2004, NSF and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) entered into an interagency agreement that resulted in two candidate designs fo r Regional Class ships. In 2007, the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report identified the need for up to three NSF-built Regional Class vessels to meet future science demand. In 2009, another National Academie s of Science report, Science at Sea, described the desirable characteristics of a m odern Regional Class vessel. These characteristics and other science community factors were considered by th e review panel when the preferred NAVSEA design was later down-selected. In 2012, NSF issued a so licitation for the refreshed design and potential 7 The National Academies of Science.

Input from external review panels, the University-Nati onal Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and the NAS Sea Change report were received during the period 2013 to 2015 which informed the final decision to pursue construction of two RCRVs. In 2015 the Nationa l Science Board authorized inclusion of funds to initiate construction of two RCRVs in future budget re quests at the NSF Director's discretion. The Final Design Review was conducted in December 2016 and th e panel recommended to NSF that the project be advanced to the construction stage.

OCE provid es overall interdisciplinary science community guidance and oversight, while the administrative lo cation of the RCRV project in the Integrative Programs Section promotes science facilities support expertise and coordination. Within NSF, RCRV project oversight is managed by a dedicated pr ogram officer with support from a secondary program officer who has experience with other OCE faciliti es. Cross-foundation coordination is provided by an integrated project team (IPT). The IPT includes st aff from the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA), the Large Facility Office (BFA/LFO), the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (BFA/DACS), the Division of Institution and Award Support (BFA/DIAS), the Office of the Director (OD), the Office of the General Council (OGC), the Office of the Assistant Director for Geosciences (OAD/GEO), and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs (OLPA). External Structure: The RCRV project is funde d through a cooperative agreement with Oregon State University (OSU) to manage the design refresh (Conceptual, Preliminary, and Final Designs), construction, testing and trials, and eventual opera tion of the first RCRV for the scientific community. The principal investigator (PI) for the award is the project manager (PM), who reports directly to the OSU Dean of the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmo spheric Sciences. The PM interacts directly with NSF and manages the RCRV administrative staff. The project scientist (PS) is a co-Principal Investigator (PI) on the award. The PM manages th e core RCRV team including the risk manager, earned value management and schedule specialist, co ntracting officer, and OS U shipyard representative (SR). The SR in turn manages the naval archit ect and engineering contract and oversees the OSU shipyard staff, and marine science technical a dvisors. The RCRV Science Oversight Committee (SOC) with regional representation, multid isciplinary expertise, and inde pendent science representatives conducting research in mission areas supported by st akeholder federal agencies (e.g., NSF, Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) will be active through all project phases. The SOC provides guidance to the OSU RCRV project team through the PM and/or the NSF program officer. Reviews Proposal Review: In 2012, NSF issued Solicitation 12-558, Construction of Regional Class Research Vessels, to select a lead institution for constructi on of up to three RCRVs, with the option to operate one of the ships. An NSF external review panel w as convened to evaluate three proposals, and Oregon State University (OSU) was selected. Interim Design Review (IDR): Although an Interi m Design Review (IDR) was not required by NSF, OSU hosted an IDR on July 23-25, 2 013, in Corvallis, OR. NSF program staff assessed the OSU project team performance and concluded the IDR followed cl osely the NSF requirements, and used the R/V Sikuliaq example, as appropriate, to craft the RCRV Proj ect Execution Plan (PEP). Both the design and the PEP were well-developed at this pre-Concep tual Design Review phase; particularly the organizational structure, work breakdown structur e (WBS), risk management, and configuration and contingency management. Conceptual Design Review (CDR): CDR was conducte d December 3-5, 2013, at NSF Headquarters in Arlington, VA. The NSF program staff concurred with the panel's conclusion that the Project Execution Plan and Technical Design Package met, and in some cases exceeded, the requirements of the Conceptual Design Phase. Preliminary Design Review (PDR): PDR was conducte d August 5-7, 2014, at NSF Headquarters. The panel found that the Project Execution Plan and the technical design package were both well-developed for the PDR phase and recommended that the pr oject proceed to the Final Design Phase. Post-PDR Reconciliation: Following PDR, in respon se to the panel recommendations and NSF program staff direction, OSU incorporated modifications to the design and revised their estimated program costs and schedule accordingly. The NSB was presented with the post-PDR Project baseline as the basis for Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 24 their authorization to request funding fo r two RCRVs in future budget requests. Acquisition Strategy Review: A review of all aspect s of the shipyard selection process was held in February 2016, at NSF. NSF directed OSU to make minor revisions to the Request for Proposals (RFP) based on the review. Interim Design Review (IDR): A s econd IDR was held in May 2016. Although not required, the value of the previous IDR for improvement to the tec hnical package and the Project Execution Plan was sufficient that another IDR to prepare for FDR was warranted. The review was hosted by the RCRV Project Team in Corvallis, OR, and attended by NSF program staff as well as the RCRV SOC. The SOC provided minor technical improvements to the RCRV, which were incorporated into the RFP package. Final Design Review (FDR): The FDR was held in December 2016 to ensure th at anticipated project costs remained realistic and that no unforeseen events had arisen prior to the start of construction during FY 2017. Several members of the PDR panel also pa rticipated in the FDR. Like CDR and PDR, FDR was conducted in compliance with NSF's Large Facilities Manual. The FDR Panel recommended to NSF that the project be advanced to the Construction Stage. Project Status As stated above, OSU was selected as the lead institution. A cooperative agreement (CA) was awarded to encompass the entire project, including tests and trials. The project was divided into four distinct phases; each to be funded through separate cooperative suppor t agreements (CSA), with award of each phase contingent upon successful completion of the prior phase. These phases are: Phase I: Project Refresh (Years one to three) Phase II: Shipyard Selection (Year four) Phase III: Construction (Years five to nine) Phase IV: Transition to Operations (Years eight to ten) The project will complete Phase II in CY 2017, during which bids for construction of RCRVs are being solicited and evaluated from U.S. shipyards. Total f unding to OSU for RCRV through FY 2017 is expected to be $11.39 million in R&RA funds and $106.0 million in MREFC funds. Cost and Schedule The projected length of the project is 10 fiscal years, including a six-month schedule contingency. Funding for the construction of two ships over three fiscal ye ars would support a shipyard contract structure that stipulates an initial ship, plus the option for a second ship. This approach preserves funding flexibility while maximizing shipyard efficiency by potentially having both ships under construction concurrently, but at different stages. One significant enhancement to the management of c ontingency is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and onl y allocating to the program, for obligatio n to the project, based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carry over each year, however, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. Risks Bid Risk: OSU provided a bottom-up cost estimate for two vessel construction using various escalation rates. No additional \"buffers\" or \"reserve\" are added to the bottom-up estimates. Hull construction uncertainty is addressed by the risk register, and a ssociated contingency per NSF policy on contingency estimating and use. There is a risk that shipyards may respond to the RFP with bids that exceed the estimation. The base estimates from OSU were valid ated by expert panel review as well as through comparison with an independent cost estimate commissioned by NSF. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 25 Technical: The desired low ship self-noise levels may not be initially achieved. Contingency funds are included if a secondary noise mitigation strategy is requi red to meet the ship specifications. Sonar sensors, science load handling systems, and other vessel sub-sy stems may also not perform as required. Contingency funds are included to ensure performance capabilities are met, given that many warranties are not likely to be performance-based or be otherwis e limited contractually with the shipyard. The ship may be unable to meet the low exhaust gas emissions requirements fo r the budgeted amount, in wh ich case contingency funds are included to meet emergent regulatory requiremen ts on stack emissions. A selected shipyard may fail during the construction phase, in which case contingenc y is included to facilitate transfer to another shipyard. A science prioritized, time-phased de-scoping plan is in place (per NSF policy) to minimize the impact to science capabilities in the case contingency f unds are insufficient to cover realized risks. Future Operations Costs Annual ship operations costs are we ll understood after several decades of experience with vessels of all types in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). OSU understands how to estimate future costs given their experience operating vessels similar to RCRV, such as R/V Wecoma and R/V Oceanus . OSU included an estimate the first year of operations beginni ng in 2021 using reasonable assumptions for escalations through 2020. They also assumed a robust but reasonable operating schedule of 200 days per year. OSU estimates RCRV will cost $6.10 million to operate in its first year, resulting in a rate of $30,441 per day, including technician support. This is comparable to the operation of current similar vessels after applying the appropriate cost escalation factors. NSF supports a pproximately 70 percent of the utilization of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, which suggests RCRV is likel y to cost NSF approxima tely $4.30 million in FY 2022, which is the first year the lead ship trans itions into full operations in the ARF. NSF intends to issue a solicitation for an operator of the second RCRV after construction funds are appropriated and will make an award after a competition is held. The second sh ip would transition to full operations in the ARF in FY 2023. Artist's rendition of the RCRV as constructed. Credit: The Glosten Associates Inc.

NSF's S trategic Plan for 2014- 2018,1 includes Organizational Excellence as an NSF core value. The plan defines Organizational Excellence as \"investing the resources entrusted to us optimally and efficiently, and realizing the full potential of our people in managing a capable , motivated , inclusive , and positive work environment \"and directly links it to the strategic goal of Excel as a Federal Scien ce Agency . The portfolio of activities included in Organizational Excellence addresses the agency's operations and administrative functions, which underpin NSF's programmatic activities . The se activities are critical to the accomplishment of the agency's other two strategic goals, Transform the Frontiers of Science and Engineering , and Stimulat e Innovation and Address Societ al Needs through Research and Education. An overview of the various activities that are included in the Organizational Excellence portfolio is included in this summary . Also included in this discussion is information on the E -Government initiatives to which the agency contributes. The two table s on the following page s show first the Organizational Excellence portfolio by appropriation, and second the portfolio by its major components Human Capital, Travel, Information Technology (IT), Administrative Support, NSF Headquarters Relocation, and support for the National Science Board (NSB) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) along with their funding sources , as several are funded through more than one appropriation. Underlying the FY 2018 Budget Request is NSF's ongoing commitment to increase agency efficiency while constraining administrative costs ; which is consistent with the Administration's commitment to manage programs and deliver critical services more effectively, devote a greater percentage of t axpayer dollars to mission achievement, and to be more effective and efficient in supporting program outcomes . NSF has made significant progress toward reducing certain administrative costs by identifying and implementing efficiencies, prioritizing work, e liminating or scaling back the scope of some activities, and by exploring new ways of getting the job done. Examples include investments in business intelligence and other tools that reduce the cost of contract support , and reduced costs associated with maintenance and support of the NSF website due to retirement of dated infrastructure and the conversion of content to modern platforms . Annually NSF conducts strategic r eviews of the objectives in the Strategic Plan in response to the requirement of the GPR A Modernization Act. In FY 2016, two strategic r eviews identified opportunities for action or improvement closely aligned with the Organizational Excellence portfolio of activities. The strategic r eviews focused on the following Strategic O bjective s: (1) Build an increasingly diverse, engaged, and high performing workforce by fostering excellence in recruitment, training, leadership, and management of human capital , and (2) Use effective methods and innovative solutions to achieve excellence in accomplishi ng the agency's in Sc ience, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future - National Science Foundati on Strat egic Plan for 2014 -2018.

Office of Inspector General OIG - 2 Anticipated Obligation: FY 2017 Quarter 4 OIG Responsibilities In February 1989, the National Science Board established OIG pursuant to the Inspector G eneral Act Amendments of 1988. The statute confers on OIG the responsibility and authority to: Conduct a nd supervise audits of NSF programs and operations, including organizations that receive NSF funding; Conduct investigations concerning NSF programs and operations, including organizations that receive NSF funding; Evaluate allegations of research misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, involving individuals who participate in NSF -funded activities; Provide leadership, coordination, and policy recommendations for: Promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of NSF programs and operations, and Preventing and detecting fraud and abuse in NSF programs and operations; and Keep both agency management and Congress fully and currently informed about problems, recommended corrective actions, and progress being made in improving the management and conduct of NSF programs, to include the issuance of a Semiannual Report to Congress. OIG performs audits of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements funded by NSF's programs; and audits and reviews of both internal agency programs and external organizations that receive NSF funding to ensure that financial, administrative, and programmatic activities are conducted economically, effectively, and in compliance with a gency and federal requirements. OIG oversees the audi t of NSF's annual financial statements, which are required for all NSF accounts and activities by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. Audit work mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) is also performed annually . OIG also audits the systems used by NSF to pre pare the financial statements. In addition, the office performs multi- disciplin ary reviews \u2014involving auditors, attorneys, management analysts, investigators, sci entists, and others as needed \u2014of financial, management, and program operations to identify broader problems and highlight best practices. OIG investigates possible wrongdoing by organizations and individuals who seek or receive NSF funds such as those who submit proposals to, receive awards from, conduct business with, or perform work for NSF. Allegations of research misconduct by NSF recipients are also investigated . OIG assesses the validity and seriousness of all the allegations it receives to determine whether or not to pursue l egal or administrative action. When appropriate, the office refers the results of these investigations to the Department of Justice or oth er authorities for criminal prosecution, civil litigation, or resolution via settlement agreements and institutional compliance plans. OIG refers some cases to NSF for administrative resolution and when indicated will recommend modifications to agency poli cies and procedures to ensure the integ rity of NSF's business systems. OIG works closely with institutions on their internal research misconduct investigations and regularly engages in activities aimed at preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse; and at raising the awareness of funded researchers, institutional administrators, and agency employees about OIG's role and NSF's rules and expectations. Because diverse skills, training, and experience are necessary to oversee NSF's many programs, the OI G staff includes scientists, attorneys, certified public accountants, criminal investigators, management analysts, evaluators, and information technology specialists. The subjects of investigations, audits, and other reviews are also varied and may include : an individual grant recipient or institution; a broad program FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress OIG - 3 or functional area of NSF; or a project involving multiple disciplines or entities. In addition, the OIG utilizes contractors to perform work when it is cost effective, or when it lacks the ne cessary expertise in -house, as in the case of the annual audit of the agency's financial statements and annual review of its compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 ( FISMA ).

NSF's portfolio of grants and cooperative agreements increases in complexity each year, and requires the majority of OIG's audit and investigative resources. However, we project that rising personnel and contract costs will limit spending on audit contracts, training, technology , and preventive activities. At the beginning of FY 201 7, five professional staff were added to program areas where workload imbal ances are of greatest concern. As our current workforce ages, new hires are critical to revitalizing our workforce and are carefully vetted not just for technical skills but also for their readiness to assume future management responsibilities. Currently, approximately 24 percent of our staff (mostly managers) are eligible to retire. Between FY 201 3 and FY 2016, OIG has sustained an increase in its average cost per FTE of about 18 percent , as personnel costs and ben efits have increased, and professionals such as lawyers, investigators and CPA s replace administrative staff. We believe that being able to maintain a workforce of at least 68 -70 FTEs is necessary to effectively perform our mission . OIG has streamlined i ts administrative unit, electing to allocate as many FTEs as possible for audits and investigations. Investments in equipment and technology upgrades (e.g., expansion of our data analytics capability for Audits and Investigations) will continue to be pursued as funds allow. Funding for preventive activities, such as educating researchers at regional conferences about rules and requirements associated with federal grants, as well as other outreach efforts to stakeholders, will be curtailed to fund more urgent programmatic priorities . Office of Inspector General OIG - 4 Office of Audits (OA). The Office of Audit conducts audits and reviews of NSF's finances and operations that are either mandat ed by statute or discretionary. Audit w ork required by statute has grown in recent years from auditing NSF's financial statements and compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), to reviewing compliance with new legislation, such as the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), and the Digital Acco untability and Transparency Act (DATA Act). These new audit responsibilities will require additional staff hours and funding for contractors than had previously been the case. In FY 2017, we estimate that the cost of the Financial Statements and FISMA contract will amount to approximately $1.10 million, up from $940,000 in FY 2015. The increased costs for the OIG's mandatory work has reduce d the capacity of OA to perform discretionary audits , which target high -risk pr ograms and institutions . The universe of potential discretionary audits is large, consisting of about 42,000 active awards worth $28.0 billion . Historically, the OA audit plan includes about 40 discretionary audits. Much of our discretionary audit work recently has focused on NSF 's construction and mana gement of its large facilities. Since 2010, OIG has issued 28 reports containing more than 80 recommendations to improve NSF's use and management of cooperative agreements for the construction and operation of its high-dollar, high-risk research facilities. NSF has adopted new policies and procedures to strengthen its monitoring of large facilities as a direct result of these reports. NSF frequently funds the development of large -scale, multiuser scientific facilities through federal assistance awards under cooperative agreements (CAs). As of February 2016, NSF supports a broad array of 28 major research facilities, which individually cost between $100.0 million and $500.0 million each to construct. As of January 2017, NSF had 459 active cooperative agreements totaling nearly $8 .0 billion. Twenty -two of these agreements are valued at over $50 .0 million each and add up cumulativ ely to more than $4.40 billion. Recent OIG audits and reviews of NSF's oversight of four of these facilities identified several control issues which the Foundation has begun to address . This initiative will help strengthen the Foundation's ability to ensure grant and procurement funds are not wasted by improper expenditures and mismanagement. Strong co ntrols, as well as increased oversight by additional OIG staff, will help ensure NSF obtains critical assets and services necessary to meet its missions in a declining budget environment. For example, construction is ongoing for the $469.0 million National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a continental -scale observation system for examining ecological change over time . Beginning in 2011, auditors identified serious flaws in NEON's proposed construction budget and issued three inadequacy memos along with an adverse o pinion on the proposed budget. Within the proposal, OIG found $154.0 million in questioned and unsupported costs (approximately 36 percent of the total budget). Our concerns about NEON's finances were validated in June 2015 when NEON management informed NSF that the project was facing a potentia l cost overrun of $80.0 million. Similar issues surfaced during OIG's review of proposed costs for the $467.70 million Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In a given year , NSF spends significantly more on operating its facilities tha n it does on constructing them. NSF requested over $193.0 million for fiscal year 2017 to pay for four large facility construction projects. In contrast, NSF's operation and maintenance request for its existing large facilities for the same time period was over $1 .0 billion . We have recently initiated a review focusing on the risk of commingling con struction and operations funds. Ensuring that strong controls exist over the use of such funds is vital , as use of operations funds for construction work can hide cost overruns and deplete funding ne eded for the operations phase. OIG will also monitor the actions NSF takes in response to requirements in the American Inn ovation and Competitiveness Act, which mandate s a number of important controls to be applied in the development of NSF's large facilities projects. FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress OIG - 5 OIG audits have also led NSF to pay more attention to the amounts i t pays scientists, engineers, and educators who come to NSF under Intergovernmental Pe rsonnel Act (IPA) assignments. Individuals on IPA appointments remain employ ees of their home institutions. As a result, pay and benefits for IPAs are set by their home institutions and are not subject to limitations on federal pay and benefits. Audits is sued in 201 3 and 2016 found that the Foundation's use of IPAs comes at increasing cost. In 2015, NSF paid nearly $8.90 million for 27 executive -level IPAs, compared to $6.5 0 million for 21 executive level IPAs in 2012. IPA salaries can also significantly exceed the salaries of the highest paid federal employees. In 2015 the highest executive -level IPA salary was more than $440,000, up 45 percent from $301,247 in 2012. In 2015, the salaries for all but two executive level IPAs were more than the highest salary of any federal employee at NSF. Our audits recommended that NSF evaluate ways to reduce IPA costs and NSF has begun to take action . Office of Investigations (OI ). OI investigations cover the entire spectrum of investigative functions, and is comprised of three units . The Research Integrity/Admin Investigations (RIA) division is primarily responsible for investigating allegations of Research Misconduct (RM) and personnel misconduct within NSF. Our Program Integrity (PI) division is primarily responsible for investigating allegations of civil and criminal wrongdoing. The Investigative Legal (IL) division works with both RIA and PI in the successful accomplishment of investigations, liaison activities, and outreach to both the government and science communities . The work of OIG's Office of Investigations (OI) serves as an important deterrent to grant fraud and research misconduct and consistently contributes much more than its cost to the government's bottom line. Between FY 2009 and FY 2016, OI recovere d almost $35.0 million for the government. In FY 2016 alone, our 21 staff investigators recovered $8,926,748, an average of $425,083 per investigator , approximately three times their average salaries. OI's workload has increased in recent years due primarily to growth in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) cases. In particular, OIG has successfully partnered with NSF program managers to improve the identification of the nature and extent of fraudule nt conduct on the part of grant recipients under the SBIR/STTR program. Our proactive efforts generated over 175 SBIR/STTR -related cases, while the number of awards has increased from 599 to 715 (an increase of almost 20 percent ) over three years. Despit e its relatively small size, OI's activities consistently benefit agencies beyond NSF. Among other things, its staff has produced and annually updates a digest of successfull y prosecuted grant fraud cases. This has been used by civil and criminal Assistant United States Attorneys across the country to facilitate prosecutions of individuals who have defrauded grant -funding agencies and/or the SBIR/STTR set aside programs. In FY 2016, OI hosted its fifth Suspension and Debarment (S&D) Workshop. These free e vents (which are now co- sponsored by the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Council) have trained hundreds of individuals from OIGs, Suspension and Debarment Offices, Offices of General Counsel and United States Attorney 's Offices. As a result of these w orkshops, several agencies that were not previously using suspensions or debarments to protect federal funds have begun to do so, and agencies that were using these critical tools have strengthened their practices and identified more robust ways to protect federal funds. Also in FY 2016, OI sponsored its second SBIR workshop. Like the S&D workshops, this free event helped investigators, DOJ attorneys, and program personnel identify new and improved ways to f ight fraud in the SBIR program. As a result of t hese workshops and OI's leadership role in this area, many agencies Office of Inspector General OIG - 6 (including the Department of Health and Human Services OIG and the Air Force) have created new programs to fight fraud in the SBIR program or enhanced existing ones. OIG Support Functions. Most o ffice-wide support functions fall under the executive leadership of an Assistant Inspector General (who also serves as OIG's Legal Counsel) and are functionally encompassed within two operating units \u2014an immediate office and a management division. Immediate office functions comprise those that have historically worked together, but which were formerly aligned under the direct supervision of the Inspector General \u2014legal, legislative/congressional, and external affairs (including public/media cont acts). The staff also actively supports government -wide projects in which NSF OIG has taken a leadership role, such as increasing the use and effectiveness of suspension and debarment remedies to protect taxpayer funds. Besides providing comprehensive legal advice, counsel, and critical analysis to the IG and all OIG divisions , the legal activity also administers financial disclosure requirements for OIG staff; performs certain functions related to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act; represents the office in external forums ; and also enables the office to engage in proactive efforts (such as training and routine reviews) to help OIG staff recognize and deal with legal concerns as early as possible. OIG' s management/administrative arm is responsible for performing strategic planning/budgeting, procurement, human resources, and administrative support and is currently comprised of just three staff. Organizational alignment of the two units under a single executive subordinate to the IG has s aved money and afforded some synergistic benefits to the organization . To assure that there are adequate resources available for our core mission of audits and investigations, support functions across the OIG have been streamlined to the maximum extent pra ctical. Information Technology. Spending on hardware, software, and IT services is expected to remain at a reduced level through FY 2018. OIG plans to reduce its costs for computers and printers by lengthening their replacement cycle, phasing out the use of desktop printers and rel ying more on network printers. Preventive initiatives. To optimize limited budget resources OIG has already reduced many of its initiatives aimed at fulfilling its core mission to prevent fraud , waste, and abuse. These include our efforts to address the issues underlying grant fraud, research misconduct, and SBIR program fraud. In the past, our staff has played a key role in educating the agency's stakeholders on matters related to grant fraud and research misconduct. OIG's proactive efforts help to assure the integrity of federally -funded research by promoting effective oversight of NSF -funded activities at the institutional level. Robust interaction between OIG and the research community not only helps to promote research integrity and financial accountability, but also provides our investigators and auditors with valuable insights into the needs and concerns of th e institutions and researchers.

The vessels in the ARF range in size, endurance, and capabilities, enabl ing NSF and other federally and state -funded scientists to conduct ocean science and technology research with a diverse f leet capable of operating in coastal and open ocean waters. Funding for ARF includes investments in ship operations; shipboard scientific support equipment; oceanographic instrumentation and technical services; and submersible support. Funding levels reported here reflect i nvestments in the Directorate for Geosciences (G EO) by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE). In addition to operations, OCE has undertaken selected construction projects based on inter -agency planning and coordination as discussed in the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report 1 published in May 2013.

Scientists contribute to advances in many areas including climate variability, marine ecosystems, fisheries, and ocean - related natural hazards , such as tsunamis, through use of these facilities. Participating graduate and undergraduate students interact with scientists and marine technicians, enabling them to gain first -hand exposure to ocean science field research. Increasingly, technological innovations allow research conduct ed at sea to be transmitted via satellite back to the classroom, broadening the educational impact of the vessels. ARF is supported through an interagency partnership, principally with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The operating costs for the f leet are divided proportionally among the vessel users based on usage; in CY 2016 NSF support ed approximately 64 percent of the total , which includes the Ocean Observatories Initiative's use of the fleet . NSF coordinates with ship -operating and ship- user academic institutions both directly and throu gh the University -National Oceanographic Laboratory System ( UNOLS ) organizational structure . Support for scientists using the f leet is provided by NSF and other federal and state agencies. Within NSF, 1 www.nopp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/federal_oceanographic_fleet_status_report.pdf FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 5 science is funded through competitive peer -reviewed propos als, most typically funded within OCE and through selected programs in the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR), the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS), the Office of Polar Programs (OPP ), and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). App roximately 25 percent of OCE proposals request ship time. Not reflected in this number is the science that utilizes samples or data collected on prior cruises, scientists piggy -backing on scheduled cruises to accomplish additional science, international sc ientists sailing with the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, and science funded by other agencies. The FY 2018 funding level will support approximately 1,675 ship operating days , which reflects the entry of R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Sally Ride , the two new vessels delivered by ONR in 2016, into the fleet. Fleet Operations/Management and Oversight Oversight: NSF provides oversight to the Academic Research Fleet through cooperative agreements with each ship -operating institution and through a separate cooperative agreement with the UNOLS Office. NSF is the cognizant agency for ship day -rate negotiati ons for ARF, regardless of owner. In addition, NSF oversees the fleet through Business Systems Reviews, site visits, ship inspections, and participation at the UNOLS Council and various Committee meetings by NSF program directors. Several program directors within OCE at NSF, at NOAA, and at ONR are involved in the activities and oversight of the Academic Research Fleet. After an in -depth review of the application of rate structures on ARF ship- related activities, NSF and ONR are in the process of transit ioning the accounting of Fleet activities into a Specialized Service Facility in accordance with OMB's Uniform Guidance for Federal Awards 2 CFR 200.468. Management: Management of an institution's ship- operating facilities varies with the scale of the operation, but the core responsibility typically resides with the Director of the Institution, the Marine Superintendent (for all aspects of the facility), and the ship's Captain (for at -sea operations). For larger multi- ship- operating institutions, a Chief o f Marine Technicians, schedulers, and finance administrators may also be involved in facility management. Reviews: Based on projected science requirements identified in recent reports and workshops, a fleet of vessels supporting ocean science and technolog ical research will be needed far into the future. Documents supporting this need include the National Ocean Policy2 and the Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force3 of July 19, 2010. Two applicable reports by the National Research Council (NRC) include Science at Sea: Meeting Future Oceanographic Goals with a Robust Academic Research Fleet4 published in 2009, and Critical Infrastructure for Ocean Research and Societal Needs in 20305 published in 2011. In coordination with UNOLS and the other federal agencies that invest in ocean research, the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG - FI) published a Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report6 in May 2013, reviewing the status and describing plans for modernizing the F ederal O ceanographic Fleet, which includes both the Academic Research Fleet and the s urvey ships . This report was updated in March of 2016 (http://www.nopp.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/federal_fleet_status_report_final_03.2016.pdf ). In January 2015, the National Academy of Sciences Report Sea Change 2015- 2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences7 identified the U.S. Academic Research Fleet as having \"the strongest match between current infrastructure and the decadal science priorities\" an d emphasized the overall importance of 2 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/national_ocean_policy_implementation_plan.pdf Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 6 ships in all of the NAS -identified ocean science and technology priorities. Ship operations and technical services proposals undergo external review by peers every five years. Detailed annual reports describing activi ties accomplished are provided by the operating institutions and budgets are negotiated yearly since they are dependent on the number of days the ships will be at sea in support of NSF -funded research programs. A B usiness S ystem s Review of one Academic Research Fleet operating institution was conducted in 2016. Fleet Modernization Oversight : The NSF coordinator for fleet modernization activities is the P rogram Director for Ship and Submersible Support , within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) in OCE, with additional IPS staff providing project management assistance as required . Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV): In March 2012, NSF leadership approved the request to advance the RCRV to the Conceptual Design Review (CDR) phase as a candidate Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project. On February 1, 2013, NSF made an award to Oregon State University (OSU) as the lead institution for advancement to CDR. Funds for CDR were provided from the Research and Related Activities (R &RA) account. In December 2013, OSU successfully completed all CDR requirements in accordance with NSF's Large Facilities Manual.8 Approval for advancement to the Preliminary Design Phase was provided in March 2014. The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was held in August 2014. The PDR Panel recommended the project be approved to advance to the Final Design Phase. Initial funds to initiate construction were requested in FY 2017, contingent on continued satisfactory progress by the awardee, the project's consi stency with overall NSF goals and strategic direction, and the availability of funds. Personnel from the NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, as well as ONR, continue to participate in the review of the RCRV design and project management. In addi tion, NSF is an active participant in the IWG -FI Ship Subcommittee, which developed the 2016 update to the 2013 Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report . The RCRV would address requirements across government agencies for research vessels in support of oce an science research as discussed in the Fleet Status Report Update of 2016. Decisions on proceeding to further development stages will be based upon NSF, National Science Board (NSB), and interagency reviews. For additional information on RCRV please refer to the MREFC chapter. R/V Sikuliaq , formerly the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) : The R/V Sikulia q represents NSF's first major contribution to fleet renewal in over twenty years. Construction of the Sikuliaq was funded through the MREFC account, partially with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds. The project is led by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) with engineering support from design through construction provided by UAF's naval architect, The Glosten Associates, Inc. Shipyard construction began in early 2011 and the vessel was successfully launched in October 2012. Delivery of the Sikuliaq to UAF took place in June 2014. This was followed by a period of final outfitting, science trials, and transit to the first science o perational area. Initial science operations began in late 2014. Sikuliaq successfully completed ice trials in the Bering Sea and three science cruises in the Arctic Ocean. All final MREFC project activities were closed out under budget by March 31, 2016. Research in the Arctic is needed on topics ranging from natural resources, climate change, ocean circulation, ecosystem studies, and fisheries research, to natural hazards, and cultural anthropology. The Sikuliaq provides a sophisticated and significantly larger platform for scientists, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, to participate in complex multidisciplinary research activities and enables the training of the next generation of scientists with the latest equipment and technology. The Sikuliaq greatly expands research and technology capabilities in the Arctic, providing up to 270- 300 science days at sea annually. The ice- strengthened hull allows the vessel to operate in seasonal ice up to one 8 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15089/nsf15089.pdf FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 7 meter thick and an anti -roll tank permits it to operate effectively in the open waters of the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and North Atlantic. Other Ongoing Activities Major overhaul and upgrade to the submersible Human Occupied Vehicle ALVIN was complete d in FY 2013. The ALVIN Upgrade project was scoped in two phases. Phase I was the integration of a new titanium 6,500- meter -capable personnel sphere with existing ALVIN vehicle components. Phase I completion provide d a maximum depth capability of 4,500 meters, the limit of the legacy ALVIN components retained during Phase I. Phase II would provide upgrades to permit operations to a depth of 6,500 meters, but there has been no implicit or explicit commitment to proceed with Phase II at this time. Sea trials for operation of the Phase I vehicle in Nov ember 2013 supported certification for operations to 3,800 meters, and approximately 100 dives in support of science were made in 2014. Further sea trials to support certification to 4,500 meters were successfully completed in January 2015. ALVIN continues to support science missions with approximately 100 dives per year. Renewal/Re -competition/Termination Ships supported by NSF are operated by academic institutions, each having a cooperative agreement with NSF. All ship cooperative agreements were renew ed in FY 2012 using the NSB -approved criteria and review by an external panel , with upcoming renewals planned for FY 2018. Awardees are subject to additional oversight measures, including quarterly safety and financial reporting, the use of NSF Business System Reviews ( BSR), and site inspections . In 2013, NSF retired R/V Cape Hatteras , operated by a consortium of Duke University and the University of North Carolina from its homeport at the Duke University Marine Laboratory. In 2014, NSF retired R/V Point Sur, operated by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories , San Jose State University. For R/V Sikuliaq , a re -compete clause in ten years (2024) was included in the initial cooperative agreement for operations. This clause will be added to all renewals of NSF owned vessels. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 8 ARECIBO OBSERVATORY $7,720,000 -$1,180,000 - 13.3% Amount Percent RequestChange over FY 2016 The Arecibo Observatory (Arecibo) is a center for multidisciplinary research and education with world - class observational facilities. The observatory's pri ncipal facility is one of the world's largest single- dish radio/radar telescopes , a 305- meter diameter reflector located near the town of Arecibo in western Puerto Rico on 120 acres of U.S. Government -owned land. Arecibo is currently operated and managed by SRI International and subrecipients Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) under a cooperative agreement with NSF that initially ran from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2016, and was extended by 18 months t o March 31, 2018. The observatory serves over 350 users annually with a wide range of research and observing instrumentation in passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and space and atmospheric sciences. A peer -review telescope allocation committee provides merit- based telescope time to users. The committee is common to the three fields, but specific subject matter experts from outside the observatory are consulted for reviews. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for use of Arec ibo, although some Arecibo users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of the facility . Currently, Arecibo i s staffed at approximately 120 f ull-time equivalent (FTE) employees, of which about 100 are funde d by NSF. The remaining FTEs are supported by a grant from NASA, by the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center, and by other funding sources. Staff include approximately 20 scientists who, along with engineers, technicians, and operators , are available to h elp visiting investigators with observing programs. In addition, there are management, administrative, and clerical positions, as well as maintenance staff, and several postdoctoral scholars and students $1.50 cooperative agreement, initially scheduled toend inFY 2016, has been extended through 31 March 2018.Total Obligations for the Arecibo Observatory (Dollars in Millions) FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 RequestESTIMATES1 Arecibo is jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) and the NSF Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) . Planned AST support through FY 2018 is based on the 2006 AST Senior Review recommendations, an external review of the AST portfolio conducted in 2012, and guidance from a third- party cost review of AST facilities. In 2012, the AST Portfolio Review Committee recommended \"continued AST involvement in Arecibo...be FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 9 re-evaluated later in the decade in light of the science opportunities and budget forecasts at that time.\"9 The New Worlds, New Horizons: Midterm Assessment (Aug ust 15, 2016) reinforced this, with Recommendation 3.1 noting: \"The NSF should proceed with divestment from ground- based facilities that have a lower scientific impact....\"10 The Geospace Section (GS) Portfolio Review Committee was charged by the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences to review the most promising Geospace science strategies and critical capabilities and to reconcile these with the science goals described by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics. The GS is associated with AGS and its portfolio includes grant programs in upper -atmospheric sciences, space science and space weather. This GS portfolio review was carried out using the assumption of an inflation -adjusted, flat budget for GS over the next decade to FY 2026. The GS Portfolio Review Committee recommendations include the reduction of annual AGS Arecibo Observatory funding from $4.10 million to $1.1 0 million by 2020. GEO commissioned a review from a second panel assembled by the National Academy of Science that assessed the process by which the GS Portfolio Review Committee reached their findings and recommendations . The panel published the results of this review in early 2017 and, for Arecibo, reiterated the recommendations GS Portfolio Review Committee . Because of these potential changes, NSF is currently preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate proposed operational changes at Arecibo due to funding const raints, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NSF is also completing its compliance obligations with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A draft version of the EIS (Draft EIS) was release d on October 28, 2016. 11 In the Draft EIS , NSF evaluated the anticipated environmental impacts stemming from implementation of several proposed alternatives, including: ( 1) No - Action Alternative; ( 2) Alternative 1 - Collaboration with interested parties for continued science -focused operations at Arecibo Observatory (identified in the Draft EIS as the Agency Preferred Alternative); (3) Alternative 2 - Collaboration with interested parties for continued education- focused operations at Arecibo Observ atory; (4) Alternative 3 - Mothballing of facilities (suspension of operations in a manner such that operations could resume efficiently at some future date); (5) Alternative 4 - Partial deconstruction and site restoration; and (6) Alternative 5 - Full deconstruction and site restoration. Following the 45- day public comment period that ended on December 12, 2016, NSF is prepar ing a Final EIS. Concurrent with the EIS process, NSF is working with consulting parties under Section 106 of the NHPA to find ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse effects on nationally significant historic properties at A recibo as a result of implementation of any of the proposed alternatives. Likewise, NSF is working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to evaluate the anticipated impacts from implementation of the proposed alternatives on threatened/endangered species and their habitats. NSF issued a solicitation on January 25, 2017 requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecib o for five years, but at reduced funding. After the conclusion of NSF's compliance with federal statutes for the EIS, and review of responses to the solicitation, NSF will pr epare a Record of Decision documenting its chosen co urse of action with regard to Arecibo Observatory . Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : Arecibo leverages NSF support with funding from other federal and non- federal sources. Since FY 2010, the NASA Near Earth Object Observation Program has committed $2.0 million annually to Arecibo in support of the planetary radar program; this increased to $3.60 million 9 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp 10 www.nap.edu/read/23560/chapter/1 11 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/env_impact_reviews/arecibo/arecibo_drafteis.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 10 for FY 2013, with more observing time allocated to the NASA program. NASA support is expected to continue at approximately $3.60 million in FY 2018. Education and Public Outreach (EPO) : Arecibo hosts a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site, and Ph.D. students receive training through the use of the facility. Over 350 students have participated in REU programs at Arecibo. In collaboration with the Nation al Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), Arecibo holds a summer school on single -dish radio astronomy techniques. Arecibo also sponsors a major outreach program in Puerto Rico via the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center as well as summer workshops for K -12 teachers. This center attracts more than 80,000 visitors each year; over 1.4 million people have visited since its opening in 1997. Approximately 25 percent of these visitors are K-12 students. Exhibits at the visitor center were updated, and physical renovations to the visitor center building were completed in FY 2016. These improvements were funded by the Angel Ramos Foundation and the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System, and were formally approved by the NSF. With funds received from the Puerto Rico Department of Education, Arecibo has hosted numerous teacher workshops and has trained approximately 500 teachers . This program integrates formal activities at the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center into the STEM curriculum in Puerto Rico. Arecibo also hosts several meetings each year within a wide variety of scientific disciplines . Operations and Maintenance : Arecibo administers observing time to the astronomy and aeronomy communities via competiti ve observing proposals, and conducts educational and public outreach programs at all levels. Observing hours among science programs are based on the quality of the observing proposals. The telescope is currently oversubscribed, counting ongoing astronomy s urveys, new astronomy projects, solar system observations, and atmospheric sciences programs. About 75 percent of astronomy users conduct their observing remotely via networked control software, while radar observations typically employ on-site users. Man agement and Oversight AST, $3.90 million: AST funding will maintain basic operations costs and science programs in passive radio astronomy. As recommended by the 2006 AST Senior Review, AST funding for Arecibo has been gradually reduced. The reduction will continue in FY18. AGS, $3.82 million: AGS funding will support basic operations costs and science programs in aeronomy and space physics, including space weather. NSF Structure: Ongoing oversight is provided by the lead NSF program officer in AST, in clo se cooperation with a program officer in AGS, and in consultation with community representatives. The program officers make use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to N SF by SRI. They also attend SRI governance committee meetings, as appropriate. To address issues that arise, program officers work closely with other NSF offices. This includes the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Of fice, both within the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management; and the Office of General Counsel. The AST and AGS program officers conduct periodic site visits and frequent, An image of the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico.

External Structure: Management is via a cooperat ive agreement with SRI and its sub -awardees, USRA and UMET. The awardees provide management and oversight through their own advisory and visiting committees, including an Arecibo Observatory Users Committee, a Scientific Management Advisory Committee, a Co uncil of Puerto Rican Chancellors and Stakeholders, and an Executive Governing Committee. The principal investigator of the operations award resides at SRI headquarters in Menlo Park, CA, but makes frequent site visits to Puerto Rico. The principal on- site management staff include the Arecibo site director, resident at the telescope site, a deputy director in the areas of Radio Astronomy and Planetary Radar, and a deputy director for Education and Public Outreach. Reviews: A proposal review for the manage ment and operations of Arecibo occurred 2010, resulting in an award to SRI (see above) from October 2011 to September 2016, extended by 18 months to March 31, 2018. AST and AGS jointly conduct annual external reviews of Arecibo program plans; the most rece nt such review was held in January 2017. Renewal/Competition/Termination The current cooperative agreement with SRI for the management of Arecibo was awarded on October 1, 2011, when SRI succeeded the previous managing organization, Cornell University. This followed a competitive process for a new five- year cooperative agreement, consistent with National Science Board policy. This agreement was in effect through September 30, 2016, and was extended through March 31, 2018. As discussed previously, the direc tion beyond that time will be determined after carrying out the EIS process and evaluating the responses to the solicitation for management and operations beyond March 31, 2018. As can be seen in the obligations table above, outyear funding estimates are r educed from recent levels and are consistent with the NSF funding profile provided in the FY 2017 management competition solicitation.

I t uses synchrotron light given off by charged particles, both electrons and positrons, as they circulate in a ring at nearly th e speed of light. CHESS p rovides capabilities for X -ray research in physics, chemistry, biology, materials , engineering, and environmental sciences. Emphasis areas include soft matter and thin film studies, solution scattering, nanomaterials, high- pressure science, structural biol ogy, time- resolved studies of materials, and X-ray studies of structural materials. Stewardship and oversight of CHESS is provided through the NSF Division of Materials Research within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS/DMR), as well as the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Engineering (ENG). With support from the state of New York, CHESS is currently upgrading the source ring to a high energy hard X -ray synchrotron source. In FY 2017, NSF conducted a review of the science case for the proposed new X -ray source, nam ed CHESS -U, and determined that this upgrade would not provide a sufficiently unique facility to justify continued stewardship of the source by NSF . This led to the decision to continue funding CHESS operatio ns until March 31, 2019 with a plan to accept a t ransition proposal in FY 2019. This proposal would establish a partnership model whereby NSF would consider investing in the most unique experimental components but no longer support full operation of the s ource.

The primary function of CHESS staff is to maintain and operate the facility and to assist users. Users number about 850 annually and perform a broad array of research including: computationally -enabled scattering studies of complex materials; an analysis of the structure of designer solids including the impact of processing; enabling the engineering of materials through time -resolved synchrotron radiation studies, x- ray imaging, and spectroscopic studies ; studying structural materials under operating conditions; and the analyses of macromolecules and bi ochemist ry. The latter topic is done in collaboration with NIH. An annual users meeting and several workshops help disseminate results from the facility. CHESS supports users from academia, industry, and national laboratories. CHESS has developed a FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 13 dynamic testing station for structural materials through collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research. CHESS collaborates with Department of Energy ( DOE ) - supported synchrotron facilities such as the Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source. X-ray detectors developed at CHESS are now in use at 3rd and 4th generation X -ray sources around the world, including the world's first hard X -ray laser, DOE 's Linear Coherent Light Source. CHESS- developed undulat ors, that cost an order of magnitude less than current technology, are being installed at CHESS. The undulators will increase X -ray flux by an order of magnitude and enable CHESS to pursue time-resolved and high resolution imaging experiments not previousl y possible. The Cornell undulators , and other innovations such as high flux X -ray optics , are impacting synchrotron science worldwide. CHESS researchers also developed a new Kolsky bar apparatus to study the impact on structure of high strain rates using in-situ diffraction from metals undergoing shock -wave induced strain. This unique capability uses the high flux of CHESS in combination with a new high speed pixel array detector. Understanding high impact deformation is particularly important to the automotive and aerospace industries. CHESS supports and enhances Ph.D. level graduate education, postdoctoral research, and research experiences for undergraduates and for K -12 students and science teachers. The CHESS education and outreach program annually impacts over 6,000 people of all ages, including over 1,300 visitors touring the Cornell facilities. Each year, about 60 Ph.D. degrees are granted as a result of CHESS research. CHESS is a key training ground for X -ray and accelerator scientists, with CHES S graduates being hired to staff other X-ray facilities in the U.S. and around the world. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: CHESS is supported by MPS, BIO, and ENG through a cooperative agreement with Cornell University . A MPS/DMR program director is the primary contact with the facility and leads an internal NSF team of program directors. NIH provides additional support for CHESS operations through the Macromolecular Diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) award . A Joint O versight Group (JOG) was established to better coordinate the CHESS and MacCHESS awards. The JOG serves as a vehicle to keep interested parties informed and includes program directors in MPS, BIO, and ENG at NSF, as well as NIH program directors. External structure: The Cornell Laboratory of Accelerator -baSed Sciences and Education (CLASSE), which falls under Cornell's Vice Provost for Research, administers CHESS . The principal investigator serves as the CHESS Director and reports to the Director of CLASSE. The CHESS Director receives guidance primarily from the CHESS executive committee, from an external policy and advisory board , the CHESS diversity committee, and the users' executive committ ee. Reviews: NSF provides oversight by monitoring annual plans and reports including user metrics, as well as by conducting monthly phone conferences with the director. NSF uses annual site visit reviews to assess the user program, in -house research, long- term plans to contribute significant research developments both nationally and internationally, a s well as the operations, maintenance, and facility development. Annual reviews also assess the status of education , training and outreach ; operations and management efficiency, and diversity plans. In addition to a panel of experts composed of members from the research community, representatives from NIH attend these site visits. Recent and upcoming reviews include: Review of s cience case for state funded upg rade of CHESS (CHESS- U), October 26- 28, 2016. Program Director site visit, Octo ber 2017 . Review of Transition Proposal , March 2018. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 14 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The end date of the current CHESS award is March 2019. In FY 2017, NSF conducted a review focused on the science case for the state- supported on- going upgrade of CHESS. The outcome led to NSF's decision to transition from a stewardship role of CHESS to one focused on partnership to enable the best science. Initial plans were to accept a transition proposal in FY 2019. The current plan is for the transition to begin in FY 2018, or one year early. At the FY 2018 Request level, support will total $16.0 million with DMR providing $8.0 million and BIO and ENG providing $4.0 million each. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 15 GEMINI OBSERVATORY $21,030,000 +$1,150,000 / 5.8% Amount Percent 2018 RequestChange over FY 2016 The Gemini Observatory consists of twin optical/infrared 8 -meter telescopes, one each in the northern and southern hemispheres. Gemini North sits atop Ma una Kea, Hawaii at an elevation of 4,200 meters, while Gemini South is located on the 2,700- meter summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. This siting of the two telescopes provides complete coverage of the sky and complements observations from space- based observato ries. Both telescopes offer superb image quality and employ sophisticated adaptive optics technology to compensate for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Among the fundamental issues being investigated by today's astronomers are the age and r ate of expansion of the universe, the origin of the dark energy that drives cosmic acceleration, the nature of non -luminous matter, the processes that give rise to the formation and evolving structures of galaxies, and the formation of stars and their planetary systems. The current generation of large optical/infrared telescopes is central to these studies, owing to their unsurpassed sensitivity and exquisite spatial resolution. Technological advances incorporated into the design of the Gemini telescopes op timize their imaging capabilities and infrared performance as well as their ability to rapidly reconfigure the attached instrumentation in response to changing atmospheric conditions. The national research agencies that currently form the Gemini internat ional partnership include: NSF, the Canadian Argentinean de Ciencia, gaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica (CONICYT). The five agencies are signatories to the Gemini International Agreement which covers all activities related to Gemini. The current Agreement covers the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2021. The Gemini observatory helps educate astronomy and engineering students through undergraduate internship programs in both Hawaii and Chile. Gemini also provides an engaging focal point for public outreach and student training in all of the partner countrie s. Gemini -sponsored activities attract students and teachers at all levels of elementary through high school education; the unique Gemini -led Journey Through the Universe program in Hilo, Hawaii (now in its 13 th year) and its sister activity, Viaje al Univ erso in La Serena, Chile, bring astronomy into the classroom through a week- long annual event that involves dozens of astronomers from Gemini as well as from many of the other astronomical facilities at each location. Gemini staff members also provide guidance and support to the 'Imiloa Astronomy Center, a public facility in Hilo that seeks to advance the integration of science and indigenous culture through education. Laser guide star systems, which greatly improve the ability to correct for atmospheric b lurring, are available at both facilities. The advanced multi- conjugate adaptive optics system on Gemini South continues to lead the world, providing near -infrared images that exceed the quality available from orbiting observatories, and which cover a fiel d-of-view on the sky that is wider than any competing system. Over the next 12 months Gemini will be upgrading the lasers at both observatories to more powerful and more reliable devices. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 16 The observatory is actively developing new imagers and spectrometers. The state -of-the-art Gemini Planet Imager, GPI, is now in regular use for directly imaging planets orbiting nearby stars; a new spectrograph, the Gemini High -resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST), a workhorse instrument for studying a vast array of ast ronomical objects, is nearing completion; and a contract has just been signed for a new 8- beam optical/infrared spectrograph, OCTOCAM, that will be used to characterize exotic transient phenomena discovered with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) i n the 2020s. This latest instrument selection directly responds to the need for a n LSST follow -up instrument, as recommended in the 2012 NSF/Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) Portfolio Review report Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportuni ties and Challenges (discussed further below), in the 2015 National Academies report Optimizing the U.S. Ground- Based Optical and Infrared System, and in the 2016 KAVLI Futures Symposium report Maximizing Science in the Era of LSST: A Community Based Study of Needed US OIR Capabilities. As noted earlier, the international partnership that operates Gemini currently consists of the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, with the U.S. as the majority partner. Construction of the telescopes and their instrumentation involved a large number of industrial entities in these and other countries, with areas of specialization that included large and complex optical systems, engineering, electronics, electro- mechanical systems, and computing. Continued development in these technological areas is reflected in the instrumentation and facilities renewal activities that are incorporated into the overall budget. The U.S. share of Gemini Observatory observing time is open to proposals by any researcher in the U.S. astronomical community, with peer -review allocation committees providing merit- based telescope time. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for the use of Gemini. However, U.S. users are often supported through separate NSF research awards to pursue scientific programs that require the use of the observatory.

The current cooperative agreement ends in December 2022.Total Obligations for the Gemini Observatory (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request In 2010, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted its sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics12, the NRC committee recommended that NSF should complete a senior review before the mid -decade to determine which, if any, facilities AST \"should cease to support in order to release funds for: (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments, and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities\". In response to this recommendation, AST in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) conducted a community- based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee (PRC) report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges13 released in August 2012, and included recommendations about all of the major AST telescope facilities. The PR C report ranked Gemini Observatory as a critical component of our nation's future astronomical research resources and recommended that the U.S. retain a majority share in the international partnership for at least the next several years. However, given the constraints that were considered, the Committee recommended that the maximum U.S. contribution to Gemini operations in 2017 and beyond should be $17.0 million per year. Given the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and Australia from the Gemini partnership ( see below) , the NRC recommended that the U.S. increase its partner share in Gemini ; therefore the FY 2018 Budget Request is higher than the amount recommended by the PRC. The FY 2018 Request includes the full U.S. contribution to baseline operations at the level agreed to by the participants in the Gemini International Agreement ($19.12 million in FY 2018), with an additional contribution of $1.91 million to the Gemini Instrument Development Fund (equivalent to 10 percent o f the operations contribution). F unding levels through FY 2021 have been agreed to by the current Gemini participants and are specified in a Gemini Board resolution from May 2015; the U.S. contributions provided for the out -years reflect a 3 percent increase per year for the period 2016 -2021. No commitment has yet been made for FY 2022 and beyond, by any of the Gemini participants, though the FY 2022 figures denote a continuation of the 3 percent annual increase extended to the end of the current cooperative agreement. Management and Ove rsight External Structure: The observatory is governed by the Gemini Board, which was established by the Gemini International Agreement signed by the participating agencies. NSF serves as the e xecutive agency for the partnership, carrying out the project on their behalf. The U.S. holds six of the 13 seats on the Gemini Board, and NSF appoints the five non- NSF members. The Board includes the director of the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) in order to facilitate increased cooperation betwe en NOAO and Gemini and to provide an improved voice for the general U.S. astronomical community. The Gemini Observatory is currently managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) on behalf of the partnership through a cooperative agreement with NSF. AURA conducts its own management reviews through standing oversight committees. NSF Structure: NSF has one seat on the Gemini Board, currently occupied by the AST program officer 12 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 13 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 18 responsible for Gemini programmatic oversight. An additional NSF staff member serves as the executive secretary to the board. The program officer monitors operations and development activities at the observatory, nominates U.S. scientists to Gemini advisory committees, conducts reviews on behalf of th e partnership, participates in various Gemini Board sponsored sub- committees, and approves funding actions, reports, and contracts. The program officer is also the current chair of the Gemini Finance Committee, a subcommittee of the Gemini Board that monit ors and assesses the observatory's budget and provides guidance to the Gemini Board. Reviews: NSF conducts periodic reviews of the management and operation of the observatory, and of AURA's financial systems, often in collaboration with the Gemini Board. NSF has conducted Business System Reviews (BSRs) of the observatory and AURA's centralized administr ative services in 2009 and 2013. In April 2017, NSF conducted a Gemini Accounting System Audit, and plans to conduct a new BSR in 2018. Renewal/Competition /Termination The United Kingdom withdrew from the Gemini partnership at the end of 2012 which required the observatory to adjust to an approximate 24 percent reduction in budget. More recently, Australia, a 6.3 percent partner in 2015, moved to a more limi ted participation on a year -to-year basis. South Korea has a similar arrangement (year -to-year) through the end of 2017, however, discussions with South Korea are currently underway regarding full partnership. The next participant assessment point is sched uled for 2018, at which time partners will establish their levels of participation in the Gemini Observatory beyond December 2021. The recently expired (end of 2016) NSF cooperative agreement for managing the Gemini Observatory included a plan to negotiat e the transition to the new operations model under the reduced budget described above. Reductions in project scope included a decreased instrument complement on each telescope, cost savings from a shift to remote telescope operations from the sea level bas e facilities in Hawaii and Chile, a redesign of the data archive, and a tighter focus on serving the partner user communities at the expense of internal scientific research activities. These and other transition projects have now been successfully complete d. Prior to the completion of the above transition program, recompetition of the management and operation of Gemini was conducted in 2014- 2015. Proposals were solicited in August 2014 and received in February 2015. Face -to-face meetings between NSF and t he proposing organizations in July 2015 supplemented an extensive review of these proposals by a panel of experts in April 2015. The National Science Board approved NSF's selection of AURA as the managing organization for the observatory in February 2016, under a new cooperative agreement that covers the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 19 GEODESY ADVANCING GEOSCIENCES AND EARTHSCOPE $12,220,000 -$960,000 -7.3%Geodesy Advancing 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 over FY 2016 Actual Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope (GAGE) comprise s a distributed, multi -user, national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern geodetic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences with a focus on studies of Eart h's surface deformation at many scales with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. GAGE facilities support fundamental research and discovery on continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of m agmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading. GAGE is managed and operated for NSF by UNAVCO, a consortium of 113 U.S. universities and non- profit institutions with research and teaching programs in geophysics and geodesy and 105 associate members from foreign institutions. GAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the geodetic component of the EarthScope facility and related geodetic facilities previous managed by UNAVCO. The FY 2018 Budget Request will allow GAGE to continue providi ng service to the community consistent with that in previous years. FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 $12.22 $12.22 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in September 2018.Total Obligations for GAGE (Dollars in Millions) FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 RequestESTIMATES1 The ability to determine position with respect to a well-constrained terrestrial reference frame using space geodetic techniques has, over the last three decades, improved to submillimeter capability. Space geodesy applications are extremely broad and expanding to include important societal research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather. Applications of geodetic techniques to understanding the complex interplay between climate dynamics , continental ice sheet and mountain glacier dynamics, crustal isostatic adjustments , and sea level change is of foremost relevance to current global issues confronting humanity. To serve the research needs o f the broad Earth science community, GAGE is organized under three primary service a reas and two special e mphasis a reas: Geodetic Infrastructure The EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) includes more than 1,100 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations (approximately 650 of which transmit data in real -time with subsecond latency) distributed across the U.S., and concentrated on the active plate boundaries in the western contiguous U.S. and southern Alaska. Data recovery for the PBO GPS net work typically exceeds 90 percent. PBO also includes 75 borehole strainmeters and 78 borehole seismometers Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 20 deployed along the San Andreas Fault and above the Cascadia subduction zone and volcanic arc. Tiltmeters (25) and pore pressure sensors (23) are also collocated with the other borehole instruments. Global GPS Arrays outside of the PBO footprint are supported by GAGE in partnership with investigators. More than 900 continuous GPS observations from around the world are now maintained, monitored, and dat a compiled into the GAGE data system. GAGE supports 59 of the over 250 GPS sites in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -supported Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) array that supports satellite orbit and clock corrections and t he refinement of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). GAGE is also supporting the development of data distribution systems for a Caribbean region GPS and meteorological sensor network (COCONet) of more than 100 stations that support tectonic, volcano, tropical storm, and sea level change investigations. Community GPS receiver and geodetic technology pool includes a pool of over 690 GPS receivers, ancillary equipment, and six terrestrial laser scanners, which can be used by investigators fo r short - and long- term deployments on qualified research projects. Polar Networks supports GAGE's polar GPS networks in Antarctica (ANET) and Greenland (GNET) and development of specialized GPS monumentation, power, and telemetry solutions for use in harsh environments. GAGE also provides portable campaign deployment geodetic instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the polar regions. Investigator Project Support includes project management, field engineering, and technical support services to plan and execute GPS surveys and permanent station installations. GAGE also maintains a staff focused on geodetic technology equipment testing services to evaluate new geodetic technologies and improve performance for science applications. Geod etic Data Services Geodetic Data Services manages an archive of over 233 terabytes of data from GPS, laser scanning, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and borehole geophysical instruments from all GAGE components including EarthScope PBO, global continuous G PS networks, and campaign GPS observations; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. The archi ve of SAR imagery maintained and distributed by GAGE to support interferometric SAR imagery of continuous surface deformation at scales of 100 km to 1,000 km is complementary to discrete GPS measurement of displacement. As the U.S. currently has no civilian spaceborne SAR sensor, UNAVCO, as the manager of GAGE, brokers for cost -effective community access to the SAR imagery acquired by foreign SAR satellite systems. Education and Community Engagement The GAGE Education and Community Outreach (ECE) program enables audiences beyond geodesists to access and use geodetic data and research for educational purposes, including technical short courses, student internships, web- based materials, and programs for strengthening workforce development and improving diver sity in the geosciences. Special Emphasis Areas Community Activities include scientific and technical workshops that bring together the international seismic community and publications designed to communicate GAGE activities and results to the community. External Affairs maintains outreach efforts to policymakers and planning for coordination with the international geodesy community. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 21 Beside its role in providing the observational data essential for basic Earth science research, GAGE also plays a signifi cant role providing geodetic infrastructure support to NASA investigators and the international community through activities in maintaining a subset of the Global GNSS Network (GGN); which supports the refinement of the ITRF and corrections to satellite or bits and clocks, all contributing to the capability for millimeter -level geodetic positioning, subtle observations of Earth's time -varying gravity field, and detection of millimeter -level changes in sea level. Commercial surveyors and engineering firms do wnload GAGE facility real -time GPS data daily to support precision positioning. The economic impact of this service to the commercial sector has not been quantified, but is likely substantial. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences ( EAR ) in the Directorate for Geosciences, through its Instrumentation & Facilities program (IF), provides general oversight of GAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of GAGE program s and projects with other NSF -supported facilities and projects , and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of UNAVCO in managing and operating GAGE. The Integrated Activities section head and division director in EAR provide other internal oversight. External Structure: GAGE is managed and operated by UNAVCO, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 113 U.S. universit ies and non- profit organizations with r esearch and teaching programs that rely on geodetic technologies for Earth Science research. Each voting m ember institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the UNAVCO Board of D irectors, seven of which are drawn from member institutions, and two directors -at-large. The b oard members, who serve two -year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with GAGE management and operation, through consultation with UNAVCO staff a nd GAGE advisory committees (one for each major GAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of UNAVCO to a renewable two -year term. The president is responsible for UNAVCO op erations, all of which are managed through the UNAVCO Corporate Headquarters in Boulder, C olorado. Reviews: All major ongoing geoscience facilities routinely undergo reviews of their management , in addition to peer review of proposals for new or continued support. The formal NSF merit review of the five-year proposal for the GAGE facility took place in 2012 and 2013 and was also the most recent review of UNAVCO. Although the ad hoc reviewers and two independent review panels had a number of specific recommendations at the working level for GAGE, overall the review found that GAGE was a critical facility for U.S. and international e arth sciences. Furthermore, the reviewers found that UNAVCO is a well -managed and effective organization that has, through its commitment to the collection and open dissemination of the highest quality geodetic data, transformed the discipline of geodesy an d its geoscience applications. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The initial cooperative agreement for GAGE began October 1, 2013, and will expire September 30, 2018. In FY 2016, in keeping with the phased integration and recompetition plan presented to and concurred with by the National Science Board in December 2009, NSF solicited proposals to manage and operate one or more components of a new facility to support the Earth sciences research and education community. These components are currently supported by GAGE and the related Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience and EarthScope (SAGE). The new distributed, multi -user, national facility would support the development, deployment, management, and operational support of modern geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instrumentation and provide ser vices to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences. NSF is currently reviewing proposals received in response to this facility solicitation. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 22 ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY $7,000,000 world' s first high-energy neutrino observatory, located deep within the ice cap under the U.S. Amundsen- Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. With the discovery in 2013 of the first neutrinos from beyond our solar system, the Observatory has demonstrated that it represents a new window on the universe, providing unique data on the engines that power active galactic nuclei, the origin of high-energy cosmic rays, the nature of gamma ray bursts, the activities surrou nding supermassive black holes, and other violent and energetic astrophysical processes. Approximately one cubic kilometer of ice is instrumented with photomultiplier (PM) tubes to detect neutrino- induced, charged reaction products produced when a high-energy neutrino interacts in the ice within or near the cubic kilometer fiducial volume. The energy and arrival direction of high-energy neutrinos ranging in energy from 100 GeV to 10 PeV (1 GeV is 109 electron Volts [eV]; eV; and are derived from the IceCube data stream. The IceCube Collaboration has recently focused on studies of neutrino events with a deposited energy of 1 TeV and above. The deposited energy here is the calculated energy that is released within the detector fiducial volume representing an energy level of the incoming neutrino. These high-energy neutrinos can be produced either by the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere, the so-called atmospheric neutrinos, or near distant astrophysical accelerators like black holes and neutron stars, the so-called cosmic neutrinos. Astrophysical neutrinos remain the dominant component above 10 TeV. The number of these cosmic neutrinos (100 TeV - 10 PeV) detected by IceCube has already exceeded 50. The Observatory includes a Deep Core Array (DCA) with tightly spaced digital optical modules to detect lower energy neutrinos (down to about 10 GeV), thus opening the door to studies of neutrino oscillation measurements and studies of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) below 250 GeV. The DCA closes the energy gap between the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the Super -Kamiokande detector in Japan, and allows effective observations of high-energy neutrinos entering from the sky of the southern hemisphere. The IceCube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of natural Antarctic ice into a particle detector. The sensors keep watch for momentary flashes of blue light made by subatomic particles called muons; some are produced in collisions of neutrinos with atomic nuclei inside or near the detector. Since completion in 2010, the IceCube detector has been taking data in its final configuration with an uptime of well over 99 percent. IceCube detects one neutrino every 6 minutes in a background of 2700 cosmic ray muons per second. To handle the high data rates, initial analysis of the data is performed by a cluster of computers housed in a two- story building placed on t op of the array. The filtered data is sent over geostationary satellites to the IceCube Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. Credit: USAP Photo Library, Sven Lidstrom (sic), NSF.

The science collaboration is much broader, currently consisting of 23 U.S. institutions and 24 institutions in eleven other countries (Belgium, Germany, Sweden , Australia, Canada, Denmark , Japan, Korea , New Zealand, Switzerland , and the United Kingdom). NSF's foreign partners contribute a pro rata share of operations and maintenance costs based on the number of PhD-level researchers involved. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: Oversight of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the joint responsibility of the Geosciences Directorate's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate's Division of Physics (PHY). Support for operations and maintenance, research and education, and outreach are shared by OPP and PHY, as well as other organizations and international partners. NSF provides over sight through regular site visits by NSF managers and external reviewers. External Structure: The UW management structure for IceCube includes leadership by the project's principal investigator supported by the director of operations and two associate directors (one for science and instrumentation and one for education and outreach). A collaboration spokesperson is selected from the senior international scientific leaders for a two-year term, with an option to be renewed once for at most four consecutive years. At lower levels, project management includes international collaboration representatives, as well as participation by staff at collaborating U.S. institutions. UW has in place an external Scientific Advisory Committee and a Software and Computing Advisory Panel that meet annually and provide written advice to the project. UW leadership, including the Chancellor, provides additional awardee -level oversight. Oper ations Costs Full operations and maintenance in support of scientific research began in FY 2011. The associated costs are and will continue to be shared by the partner funding agencies - U.S. (NSF) and non-U.S. - proportional to the number of PhD researche rs involved (currently about 55:45). The current NSF award for operations and maintenance constitutes the bulk of the U.S. contribution to general operation of the facility. In addition, work in support of facility operations is performed by students, postdocs, and senior researchers who are participating in research on the data produced by the Observatory. NSF support for U.S. institutions working on more refined and specific data analyses, data interpretation (theory support), and instrumentation upgrad es is provided through the Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account in response to merit -reviewed proposals (approximately $4.0 million annually provided jointly by GEO and MPS). The general operations of South Pole Station, reported in the Polar Facilities and Logistics narrative, also contribute to supporting IceCube. The cost of IceCube operations shown in the table herein includes only those that are project -specific and incremental to general South Pole Station operations. The expected operational lifespan of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is 25 years, beginning in FY 2011. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 24 Education and Outreach IceCube provides a vehicle for helping to achieve national and NSF education and outreach goals. Specific outcomes include the education and training of future leaders in astrophysics, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates; K-12 teacher scientific and professional development, including development of new inquiry- based learning materials and use of the South Pole environment to convey the excitement of astrophysics and science generally to K-12 students; increased opportunity for involvement of stude nts in international collaborations; increased diversity in science through partnerships with minority serving institutions; and enhanced public understanding of science through broadcast media and museum exhibits (such as the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois ) based on IceCube science and the South Pole environment. NSF supports evaluation and measurement -based education and outreach programs under separate grants to universities and other organizations that are selected following standard NSF merit review. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSF re-competed the IceCube operations and maintenance award in FY 2016. The new award was issued on April 1, 2016 for 60 months. Actual obligations for FY 2016 are higher than original estimates due to the extension of the previous cooperative agreement to allow time for the 2016 competition.

The umbrella IODP F orum provides a venue for all IODP entities to exchange ideas and views on the scientific progress of the program . In the current IODP, each drillship is governed by independent f acility boards, each of which is unique and optimized for their respective drilling platform. In the case of the JOIDES Resolution Facility Boa rd (JRFB), two advisory panels review proposals and provide science and safety advice. A U.S. scientist leads the JFRB, with other members from the scientific community, funding agencies, and the facility operator. The other IODP platforms utilize the JRFB advisory panels for drilling proposal review. IODP participants include the United States, Japan, ECORD (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Korea , India, Australia, and New Zealand, with all participants except Japan pr oviding financial contributions to JOIDES Resolution operations. Japan provides program support through substantial investment in Chikyu operations, with U.S. and Japanese scientists enjoying reciprocal rights on each drilling vessel, and through curation of JOIDES Resolution core samples at Japan's Kochi Core Center. Over 3,700 scientists from 52 nations have participated on O cean Drilling Program, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, and International Ocean Discovery Program expeditions since 1985, including approximately 1,600 U.S. scientists from over 150 universities, government agencies, and industrial research laboratories. Samp les and data have b een distributed to well over 1,000 additional U.S. scientists. Scientists from these groups propose and participate in IODP cruises, are members of the program's advisory panels and groups, and supply data for planning expeditions and interpretation of drilling results. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) manages IODP operations of the JOIDES Resolution and the IODP Science Support Office under the NSF Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) . NSF's ODP is located within the Integrative Programs Section, with 1.5 program officers dedicated to its oversight. One of the program officers has responsibility for two cooperative agreements supporting JOIDES Resolution operations and the IODP Support Office, while the other oversees the cooperative agreement for the IODP U.S. Sci ence Support Program (USSSP). External Structure: NSF provides the JOIDES Resolution as the light IODP drillship through a cooperative agreement with Texas A&M University. MEXT provides the Chikyu as the heavy IODP drillship through the Japan Agency for Ma rine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), while the British Geological Survey manages ECORD drilling contributions through single -use Mission -Specific Platforms. Each entity providing an IODP drilling platform is responsible for sample and data storage, publications, and other science costs associated with the respective platform operations. IODP JOIDES Resolution operations are determined by the JRFB, utilizing advice and recommendations provided by the Science Evaluation Panel (SEP) and the Environment al Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP). Representation on the panels is determined by contribution level to JOIDES Resolution operations and exchange with other facility boards. NSF is a member of the JRFB. Reviews: Performance of the JOIDES Resolution facility is reviewed yearly by an NSF panel , in consultation with the JRFB. Substantive review of management performance regarding JOIDES Resolution operations occur red in the third year of the cooperative agreement (FY 2017) to guide FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 27 potential renewal or re-competition decisions. Review of scientific progress in broader thematic areas is conducted under the authority of the IODP Forum. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2013, to facilitate support for drilling proposal review, advisory panel meeting logistics, and other integrative activities for scientists participating in IODP activities (e.g. websites), the IODP Science Support Office was selected at the University of California, San Diego through a competitive process for a five-year (FY 2014- FY 2018) cooperative agreement. In FY 2014, through a competitive process, Texas A&M University was selected to be the JOIDES Resolution operator under a five -year (FY 2015- FY 2019) cooperative agreement. This cooperative agreement contain s language encoura ging the awardee to facilitate novel partnerships involving support of JOIDES Resolution operations between the U.S. scientific drilling community and commercial industry, thereby providing new intellectual opportunities and potential reduction in overall facility cost. In FY 2015, to facilitate support for U.S. scientists participating on IODP platforms (i.e., salary and travel support) and for U.S. IODP education and outreach efforts, a new cooperative agreement was awarded, after competitive selection, to the Lamont -Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for operation of the U.S. Science Support Program for a five -year period (FY 2015- FY 2019). Major Multi -User Research Facilities 28 LARGE HADRON COLLIDER ( LHC ), an international instrument at the CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, is the most powerful particle accelerator ever constructed. It produces the highest energy particle bea ms ever created, making it the premier facility in the world for research in elementary particle physics. LHC consist s of a superconducting par ticle accelerator, approximately 16.5 miles in circumference, providing two counter -rotating proton beams with a design energy of 7 TeV (1TeV=1012 electron vo lts) per beam. It can also provide colliding beams of heavy ions, such as lead. During 2011 and 2012 (\"Run 1\"), LHC operated at 4 TeV per beam as a result of a limitation in the electrical connections between th e superconducting magnets. After the connections were upgraded during a nearly two -year shutdown, Run 2 began in mid- 2015 and will continue through the end of 2018 at 6.5 TeV per beam, exploring a new energy region not accessible during Run 1. Four large particle detectors collect the data delivered by the LHC. They characterize the reaction products from high-energy proton- proton and heavy ion beam collisions. These are analyzed to investigate the fundamental properties of matter. More than for ty international funding agencies provide support for scientists to participate in experiments at the LHC. C ERN is responsible for meeting overall LHC project goals and coordinating international participation. The U.S., through a partnership between the D epartment of Energy (DOE) and NSF, made major contributions to the construction and operation of t wo of the largest particle detectors, a Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS) and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) , while NSF additionally supports a small number of researchers who participate in the LHC -b detector. LHC data have resulted in major scientific discoveries. Foremost of these was the July 4, 2012, announcement by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations of the discovery of a particle having properties consisten t with the long -sought Higgs boson, a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics. Its existence was a prediction of the theoretical framework describing the origin of the masses of ele mentary particles. The experimental confirmation of this theor y was recognized by the award of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics to Francois Englert and Peter Higgs. Another important discovery was announced on July 14, 2015, when the LHC -b experiment reported the discovery of a class of particles known as pentaquarks, a new way to aggregate quarks (the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter) in a way never before observed. On June 28, 2016 the same collaboration reported the observation of tetraquark states, another novel aggregation of quarks into four -quark e lementary particles. The resumed program of operation, which began in 2015, is expected to significantly enhance the chances of more groundbreaking discoveries at the LHC. For example, the LHC program includes search es for particles predicted by a powerf ul theoretical framework known as supersymmetry, which may provide clues as to how the known forces - weak, strong, electromagnetic, and gravitational - evolved from different aspects of the same \"unified\" force in the early universe.

The U.S. LHC collaboration continues to be a leader in the development and exploitation of distributed computing. The LHC grid and the Tier 2 computing centers funded by NSF enable U.S. universities to access LHC data and computing resources and thus train students in both state of the art science and computational techniques. The distributed co mputing tools and techniques developed for the LHC are expected to have broad application throughout the scientific and engineering communities. The May 2014 report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) recommended to DOE and NSF that the highest priority strategic goal for the U.S. particle physics research program, within a global context, should be continued support for involvement in the LHC program. Within the scope of supported activities, they recommended a further planned upgrad e of the accelerator to very high luminosity (nearly ten times the luminosity of initial operation). The high -luminosity upgrade will commence operation in mid-2026, and will facilitate precision measurements that may reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. This will necessitate significant enhancements to the detectors in order to exploit this scientific opportunity. NSF is now working with the ATLAS and CMS detector collaborations to plan for this possibility. If approved, construction and fabricati on activities would begin in FY 2020 in order to be ready for installation activities scheduled for 2024. Through the participation of young investigators, graduate students, undergraduates, and minority -serving institutions in this international project , LHC serves the goal of helping to produce a diverse, globally - oriented workforce of scientists and engineers. Innovative education and outreach activities allow high school teachers and students to participate in this project . Management and Oversight NSF Structure: A program director in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Physics is responsible for day -to-day project oversight. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support provides financial and administrative suppo rt. An Integrated Project Team, consisting of representatives from the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, other experienced program officers, the Large Facilities Office, and other areas of the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management, contribute to the planning activities that may lead to a major construction upgrade. External Structure: U.S. program management occurs through a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), created by NSF and DOE. The JOG has the responsibility to see that the U.S. LHC p rogram is effectively managed and executed to meet commitments made under the LHC i nternational agreement and its protocols. NSF operations support is provided through cooperative agreements with Princeton University for US -CMS and with Stony Brook Universi ty for US -ATLAS. Reviews: There is one major management/technical review each year with a panel of external, international experts , a follow -up review six months later, as well as bi-weekly telephone reviews by NSF/DOE program directors to monitor progres s. NSF and DOE conduct separate and joint external reviews of the detector upgrade activities so that each agency is fully cognizant of the activities of the other partner. The most recent major joint management/technical review was held in January 2017 . Two J OG review meetings per year monitor overall program management. The most recent JOG was held in April 2017. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 30 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Because of the planned incremental program of enhancements to the accelerator, along with parallel upgrades to the detectors, t he LHC project is expected to be scientifically productive for at least 15 to 20 more years. Through an internal competition process among the research community, the ATLAS collaboration selected Stony Brook University to lead NSF -funded operations, while Princeton University was re- selected to continue to lead CMS operation. The U.S. ATLAS and CMS collaborations submitte d renewal proposals that were successfully reviewed and approved. The new awards took effect in early 2017.

FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 31 LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL -WAVE $39,430,000 OBSERVATORY $0 / 0.0% - $39.43 - - Laser Interferometer Observatory 2016 2018 RequestChange over FY Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that cataclysmic processes involving extremely dense objects in the universe, such as the collision and merger of two black holes, will produce gravitational radiation. On Sept. 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational -Wave Observatory (LIGO) directly observed gravitational radiation from a black -hole merger, verifying this 100- year-old prediction. This is an achievement of historic importance for fundamental physics, astrophysics, and astronomy, as i t opens an entirely new observational window on the universe. This achievement was announced to the world in a series of international press conferences on February 11, 2016. LIGO announced detection of a second black -hole merger on June 15, 2016. Its second observing run, now underway, holds the possibility of further detections. LIGO, the most sensitive gravitational -wave detector ever built, comprises two main facilities, one in Livingston Parish, LA and one in Hanford, WA. At each facility, an L -shaped vacuum chamber, with two 4-km long arms joined at right angles, houses an optical interferometer. The interferometers are used to measure minute relative changes in the distances between the vertex of the L and mirrors at the ends of the arms that are cau sed by a passing gravitational wave. A passing gravitational wave causes the distance along one arm to lengthen while the other arm shrinks during one half cycle of the wave, and then the first arm shrinks while the other arm lengthens during the second ha lf cycle. The predicted distortion of space caused by a gravitational wave from a likely source is on the order of one part in 1021, meaning that the expected amplitude of the length change over the 4- km length is only about 1/1000th the diameter of a proton. LIGO's 4 -km length was chosen to make the expected signal as large as possible within terrestrial and financial constraints. (Longer arms would result in a bigger signal, but would entail larger construction costs.) Looking for coincident signals from both interferometers increases LIGO's ability to discriminate a gravitational wave signal from local sources of noise that can mimic the signal. Components for a third interferometer, initially intended for installation at Hanford as a further tool to discriminate candidate signals from random noise, have been set aside in response to a proposed initiative from the Government of India to establish a gravitational wave observatory there. If realized, this third interferometer would greatly enhance LIGO's ab ility to locate gravitational wave sources on the sky, facilitating follow -up investigations using optical and radio telescopes. The prospect of obtaining complementary gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from the same source is extremely exciti ng, as it may significantly increase our understanding of supernovae and neutron stars. Such scientific prospects help motivate the NSF Big Idea Windows on the Universe. The Advanced LIGO upgrade , funded through the MREFC account, resulted in the design, fabrication, and installation of improved apparatus that is expected to increase LIGO's sensitivity 10-fold over a multi -year tune-up period.

LIGO's operating budget supported the initial commissioning of this apparatus . Following completion of installation of the Advanced LIGO apparatus in March 2015, LIGO scientists and engineers were able to achieve about four times LIGO's initial sensitivity by September 2015 in order to make the historic first detection of gravitational waves. Since then, after further commissioning, LIGO has been able to ach ieve more than a six-fold increase in sensitivity. LIGO is now in the midst of a nine -month long observing run that will search for more gravitational waves through the end of August 2017. The operations budget also supports basic infrastructure maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data obtained from the interferometers, and maintenance of computational resources for data storage and analysis. Operations funding also enables strategic research and development in instrument science that is expected t o lead to longer -term enhancements to operational performance. A small part of the operations budget supports education and outreach activities. The LIGO Science Education Center (LIGO SEC), located on the Livingston Observatory site, hosts 50 hands -on inquiry- based learning exhibits and reaches over 15,000 students, teachers and members of the public each year. Its activities benefit from a partnership with Southern University Baton Rouge (SUBR), the San Francisco Exploratorium, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and other collaborating educational entities. Trained docents from SUBR assist participants and serve as collegiate- age role models for young visitors. LIGO SEC programs are supported both through LIGO's operations cooperative agreement and t hrough grants to SUBR and BRAF. The LIGO Hanford Observatory also promotes a highly successful program of outreach to K -12 students and the general public in that region. LIGO created a number of connections to industry in order to achieve the demanding technical performance requirements needed to detect gravitational waves. Innovations across a diverse range of technologies have led to new techniques with broad applications (for example, preparation of stainless steel for ultra- high vacuum application, a daptive laser beam shaping , and precision dielectric optical coatings). O ther cases have resulted in patents and commercial products (in -vacuum electrical connectors, high power electro- optic modulators). The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an open collaboration that organizes the major international groups doing research supportive of LIGO, has more than 80 collaborating institutions in 15 countries with more than 900 participating scientists. The LSC plays a major role in many aspects of the LIGO effort. These include establishing priorities for scientific operation, data analysis and validation of scientific results, and contributing to instrumental improvements at the LIGO facilities, as well as fostering education and public outreach programs. NS F supports LSC activities at $7.0 to $8.0 million per year, which is provided through regular disciplinary program funds. NSF continually assesses the appropriate level of financial support by monitoring actual expenditures contained in quarterly activity -based financial reports from LIGO and through annual external reviews of operation. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 33 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is coordinated internally by the LIGO program director in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Physics (MPS/PHY). The program director consults regularly with representatives from the NSF Large Facilities Office, the MPS Facilities Coordinator, and the NSF Office of Grants and Agreements. External Structure: LIGO is managed by the Cal ifornia Institute of Technology under a cooperative agreement. The management plan specifies significant involvement by the user community, represented by the LSC, and collaboration with the other major gravitational -wave detector activities in Asia, Europe, and Australia. External peer -review committees organized by NSF help provide oversight through annual reviews. Recent Reviews: Reviews of observatory operation are held annually. Special purpose reviews using external expert panels have also been held as needed, examining topics such as long -term storage of the interferometer components set aside for possible deployment to India, LIGO computing plans, and LIGO ultra -high vacuum system needs. The last annual review was held in June 2016. A vacuum review is planned for May 2017 and an operations review in June 2017. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination: LIGO began operating under a five -year cooperative agreement in early FY 2009, which ran concurrently with AdvLIGO MREFC project. Following approval by the National Science Board in August 2013, the cooperative agreement was renewed at the beginning of FY 2014 for five additional years, overlapping the conclusion of AdvLIGO construction and the start of commissioning and scientific operation. NSF conducted a detailed consideration of whether or not to recompete the management of LIGO and determined that it would be in the best interest of U.S. science and engineering to renew the LIGO operating award at the end of FY 2018. Accordingly, NSF has requested the a wardee submit a renewal proposal for review early in FY 2018. The projected lifetime of the LIGO facility was originally 20 years. Infrastructure refurbishments recently accomplished or planned during the current award will extend the facility life by an additional 15 to 20 years, to beyond 2030. Installation of the green ( .

NHMFL develops and operates high magnetic field facilities that scientists an d engineers use for research in condensed matter and material physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, energy, and the environment. It is the world's premier high magnetic field laborator y with a comprehensive collection of high- performing magnet systems and extensive support services . The facilities are available to all qualified scientists and engineers through a peer -review ed proposal process. Users number about 1,500 per year, including faculty and staff at the three host institutions. The lab oratory is an internationally recognized leader in magnet design, development, and construction , including the development of new superconducting materials . Many unique magnet systems were designed, developed, and built by the Magnet Science and Technology (MS&T) Division of NHMFL . Since 2012, the laboratory has held the world's record for the highest nondestructive, pulsed magnetic field at 100.75 Tesla. The 45 Tesla hybrid magnet currently provides the highest steady -state magnetic fields in the world for user access; this world record has been held for more than a decade. Recently, NHMFL 's new 36 Tesla Series- Connected Hybrid (SCH) magnet has reached its performance specification of 1 ppm stabili ty and homogeneity , enabling the world's first resonance ( NMR ) spectrum at 1.5 GHz . The previous record was set at 1.0 GHz . These magnets enable scientists to gain new insights into the electronic structures of novel materials such as grap hene, topological insulators, and high temperature superconductors. MS&T works with industry and other international magnet laboratories on a v ariety of technology projects. These include design and construction of high field magnets, component development , coil fabrication, cryogenics, system integration , and testing. A $15.0 million award funded through the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Division of Chemistry (MPS/CHE) enabled the purchase of a 21 Tesla magnet for the constructio n of a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT -ICR) spectrometer. The FT-ICR instrument opened for user operations in October 2015. This 21 Tesla FT -ICR is unprecedented in sensitivity and selectivity , capable of analyzing chemical samples of great complexity, such as biological fluids , biofuels , and raw and weathered petroleum. Th e system impact s a broad array of research areas, such as chemistry, molecular biology, and earth science. NHMFL is seeking funding renew al in FY 2018. The renewal propos al will allow the facility to continue operations, focus on transformational next generation magnet technology development, and further strengthen user support, education, training, and in- house research. The FY 2018 Budget Request is consistent with the v ery positive external revie w of the renewal proposal. Pending a recommendation to, and approval by, the National Science Board, NSF expects to fund the next cooperative agreement in FY 2018.

NSF is reviewing a renewal proposal for FY 2018.Total Obligations for NHMFL (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request A potential impact of continued inv estment is the successful construction of a high field all -superconducting magnet that would make high magnetic fields attainable at lower operating costs than the current technology. This would open the door for many laboratories across the Nation to have access to high magnetic fields and could be transformational in many research areas, particularly when combined with other probes such as X -rays, neutrons, or terahertz radiation. A major scientific impact of NHMFL for the coming years is expected to come from research on quantum materials conducted by users using the record- setting magnets at NHMFL, building on the recent achievements at NHMFL, such as the observation of Hofstadter's butterfly and fractionally quantized states in graphene; and quantum osc illations from surface states of topological insulators. Another example of a potential breakthrough is in new imaging techniques for studying the brain. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional MRI have been based on imaging proton spin density and intrinsic tissue relaxation rates. With higher magnetic field strengths, NHMFL is pushing to use other nuclei, which may result in new insights into mapping the brain and neuroscience. NHMFL collaborates with more than 60 private sector compan ies as well as national laboratories. These include those supported by the Department of Energy (DOE), such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which hosts the Spallation Neutron Source, and Argonne National Laboratory, which hosts the Advanced Photon Source . International collaboration is strong; NHMFL delivered and commissioned a 26 Tesla series connected hybrid resistive/superconducting magnet to the Helmholtz -Zentrum Berlin (HZB), where it will be used for neutron scattering experiments. Collaborations al so exist with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, and national magnet labs in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and China. NHMFL provides a unique interdisciplinary learning environment. The Center for Integrating Research and Learning (CIRL) at NHMFL conducts education and outreach activities, which include a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, summer programs for teachers, a summer camp for middle school girls, and activities to raise the scienti fic awareness of the general public. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NHMFL is supported by the MPS Division of Materials Research (MPS/DMR), with the DMR program director as the primary contact for most of the laboratory. The MPS Division of Chemi stry (MPS/CHE) supports the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT -ICR) Laboratory, which is overseen by a CHE program director. External Structure: A consortium of FSU, UF, and LANL operates NHMFL under a cooperative agreement. FSU, as the agreement signatory, is responsible for administrative and financial oversight and for ensuring that lab operations are consistent with the cooperative agreement. The principal investigator , the NHMFL director , reports to the FSU Vice President for Researc h. Four senior faculty members are co -principal investigators. The NHMFL director receives guidance primarily from NHMFL executive committee, NHMFL science council , and NHMFL diversity committee and recommendations from an external advisory committee and t he users' executive committee. NSF initiated a community study through the National Research Council on opportunities in high Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 36 magnetic field research. The 2013 report High Magnetic Field Science and Its Application in the United States14 was presented to t he National Science Board (NSB) in May 2014.

NNCI comprises 16 independent awards to universities around the N ation as user f acility sites in nanotechnology. The NNCI sites provide the Nation's researchers in academia, small and large companies, and government with open access to leading -edge fabrication and characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise within all disci plines of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology , thus helping to catalyze new discoveries in science and engineering and to stimulate technological innovation. The NNCI represents a new model in which NSF selects and manages each university site i n the network rather than a single lead institution with collaborating partners as in the previous NNIN, thereby providing more flexibility in awardee selection and management, and more agility in addressing emerging user facility needs in nanoscale resear ch and education. A Coordinating Office at Georgia Technological University was selected in FY 2016 through externally reviewed proposals from among the awarded sites to enhance the impact of NNCI as a national infrastructure network of user facility sit es. The Director of the Coordinating Office is a key individual for developing management strategies and operational plans in concert with the Site Directors of the individual user facilities, and serves as a principal contact person with NSF. The individual NNCI sites have autonomy in their operation and management , but are required to act in concert with the Coordinating Office. The Coordinating Office is establishing a comprehensive web portal ( www.NNCI.net ) to ensure close linkage among the individual f acility websites to present a unified face to the user community of overall tools, instruments, and capabilities. It is harmonizing capabilities for modeling and simulation across sites and interaction with NanoHUB of the NSF -supported Network for Computat ional Nanotechnology (NCN). It is coordinating and disseminating best practices for national -level education and outreach programs, as well as instruction across sites in social and ethical implications of nanotechnology. It is establishing uniform methods for assessment and quantifiable metrics of site performance and impact. It is also engaging all sites in a planning process to explore emerging areas of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology that can lead to new research opportunities and future growth of the external user base . The broad scope of NNCI sites includes materials, structures, devices, and systems in areas of physics, chemistry, materials sciences, mechanical systems, geosciences, geophysical, geochemical, environmental sciences, bio logy, life sciences, and synthetics biology. Also included are: fabrication in soft matter, including biological interfaces; biomedicine; electronics; optics; magnetics; molecular synthesis and molecular scale devices; and manufacturing concepts. Modeling and simulation, social and ethical implications of nanotechnology, and education and outreach are additional areas. The individual award sites are intended to support a rich user base with broad accessibility and affordable user fee structure. NSF funds leverage those of universit ies and other resources to grow the numbers of external users, including users from companies and academia. NNCI s ites embrace a culture of open access to researchers for any research project of merit, with protection of intellectual property, and mechanisms for encouraging non- traditional users from diverse disciplines. They also have an organizational structure that facilitates coordination of complex process steps and tools for integrated tasks and acceptance of experimental risks associated with Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 38 non-standard processes and materials. Nanotechnology facilities provide unique opportunities to infuse innovative educa tion with research at the frontiers of the field. NNCI sites are providing focused strategies for integrating pioneering science and engineering with education, including plans for assessing effectiveness and spreading promising practices. NNCI s ites havin g particular expertise in the social and ethical implications of nanotechnology have integrated study and dissemination of those aspects into their proposals that can leverage their user community base, which relate to the capabilities of their respective user facilities. During their first full year of operation, from October 2015 through September 2016, NNCI sites have served a total of 10,675 unique users who performed a significant part of their experimental work using NNCI facilities. Of these, 2,5 61 (24 percent ) were external users: 1,151 external academic , $15.46 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only.

The Executive Committee meets monthly via teleconference/WebEx and annually in person at the NNCI Conference. The Executive Committee and Coordinating Office are advised by an External Advisory Board comprised of members representing industry, acade mia, government, education and outreach, SEI, computation and non- traditional disciplines in nanoscience and nanoengineering. S everal subcommittees of the Executive Committee have been formed to address high-level issues related to the NNCI network, such a s new equipment and research opportunities, workforce development, diversity, and building the user base . An annual NNCI Conference organized by the NNCI CO will be held at different network sites to highlight the research supported by the NNCI facilities and to provide a venue to share best practices. Reviews: Reviews are being conducted through annual reverse site reviews at NSF; on -site reviews, particularly for the larger funded sites, may be held. A Business Systems Review will be held once within the five-year period of the award. The awardees will submit comprehensive annual project reports to NSF in advance of each annual review. The annual project reports will contain a program plan and budget for the next year's funding increment. Each annual revie w of a site will focus on the quality of performance and management under the cooperative agreement. Data collection will be consistent with NSF policies for information collection. Renewal/Competition/Termination The initial NNCI award is for five year s and may be renewed once for an additional five years, subject to external merit review.

FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 39 ONAL SUPERCONDUCTING CYCLOTRON LABORATORY RequestChange over The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (N SCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) is a university -based national user facility. With two linked superconducting cyclotrons, K500 and K1200, it is the leading rare isotope research facility in the U.S. and is a world leader in nuclear physics with the unique capability of producing radioactive beams at energies relevant to nuclear astrophysics. Funding for NSCL also supports the research program of the MSU nuclear science faculty . NSCL scientists employ a range of tools for conducting advanced research in fundamental nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, and accelerator physics. Applications of research conducted at NSCL benefit society in numerous areas, including studies o n the effects of io nizing radiation on DNA, tests of detectors to be used in space missions, development of data acquisition systems and software, a nd homeland security. The K500 was the first cyclotron to use superconducting magnets, and the K1200 is the highest -energy continuous beam accelerator in the wo rld. Through the Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF), heavy ions are accelerated by the K500 and then injected into the K1200, enabling the production of rare unstable isotopes at much higher intensities. The laboratory has commissioned an MSU -funded reaccele rator facility (ReA3) that enables experiments at very low energies\u2014a domain of particular interest to nuclear astrophysics. NSCL is the only facility in the world to provide radioactive beams in this energy regime. Nearly one third of recently proposed ex periments will use the ReA3. The mix of experiments is determined by beam use proposals. An external program advisory committee selects the best proposals at a typical success rate of about 50 percent , with constraints on beam availability. The science out put of NSCL is driven by these experiments, with most running five to fifteen days. Scientists at NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research . They make and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on E arth and perform experimental research using beams of unstable isotopes to extend our knowledge of new types of nuclei, many of which are important to an understanding of stellar processes. Research activities include a broad program in nuclear astrophysics studies, the studies of nuclei far from stability using radioactive ion beams, and studies of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, research is carried out in accelerator physics. NSCL supports and enhances doctorate graduate education and post -doctoral research experiences . About 10 percent of all doctorates granted in nuclear physics in the U .S. are based on research at NSCL.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). NEES was established by NSF as a distributed, multi- user, national research infrastructure for earthquake engineering research through support of a facility construction phase during 2000- 2004, followed by support of an operations phase for research, innovation, and education activities from October 2004 through September 2014. NEES was supported by NSF during FY 2010-2014 through a cooperative agreement with Purdue University. The NEES infrastructure included 14 earthquake engineering experimental facilities and an integrative cyberinfrastructure. During FY 2015, NSF's cooperativ e agreement with Purdue University was extended to continue support for cyberinfr astructure operations during the NSF open competition to establish NHERI via program solicitation s NSF 14 -605 and NSF 15- 598. NHERI is a distributed, multi -user, national research facility that provide s the natural hazards engineering research community with access to research infrastructure (earthquake and wind engi neering experimental facilities; post-disaster, rapid response research (RAPID) facility; cyberinfrastructure; computational modeling and simulation tools; and research data), coupled with education and community outreach activities. Building upon NEES, NHERI enable s new discovery and knowledge through enhanced capacity to test and derive more comprehensive, complete, and accurate models of how constructed civil infrastructure responds to earth quake and wind loading. This will enable the design of new methodologies, modeling techniques, and technologies for earthquake, windstorm , and multi -hazard risk reduction. Research conducted using NHERI supports two federal interagency programs: the Nation al Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program . During FY 2015 and FY 2016, NHERI was established by NSF through eleven cooperative agreements: Network Coordination Office (NCO) at Purdue University, Cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the University of Texas at Austin, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter) at the University of California, Berkeley, Twelve -Fan Wall of Wind at Florida International University, Large -Scale, Multi -Directional, Hybrid Simulation Testing Capabilities at Lehigh University, Large Wave Flume and Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University, Geotechnical Centrifuges at the University of California, Davis, Large, High -Performance Outdoor Shake Table at the University of California, San Diego, Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, Wind Load and Dynamic Flow Simulators, and Pressure Loading Actuators at the University of Florida, Large, Mobile Dynamic Shakers for Field Testing at the University of Texas at Austin, and RAPID Facility at the University of Washington.

Renewal/Competition/Termination In FY 2010, NSF supported two studies to assess the need for earthquake engineering experimental and cyberinfrastructure facilities beyond 2014, as described in the D ear Colleague Letter NSF 10 -071.15 One study, a workshop h eld by the National Research Council on the Grand Challenges in Earthquake Engineering Research, was completed in FY 2011; and the second study was completed in FY 2012. These studies provided input to NSF for the determination of support for future earthquake engineering research infrastructure beyond FY 2014. The plan to support a smaller successor NEES (NEES2) during FY 2015- FY 2019 was presented to the National Science Board at their July 2012 meeting and described in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 12 -107. 16 The plan would result in a lower annual operations budget , reflected in the $8.0 million reduction from FY 2014 in the FY 2015 Budget Request, from $20.0 million to $12.0 million, and allow additional investments to be made in ea rthquake engineering re search. In 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NSF jointly supported a workshop that led to a roadmap report for measurement science research and development for windstorm and coastal inundation impact reduction, which was published in January 2014.17 In February 2013, NSF released solicitation NSF 13 -537 to compete and operate NEES2 for FY 2015- FY 2019. Based on the merit review of proposals submitted under NSF 13- 537, NSF made no award. Based on the above studies and report, NSF established the plan for NHERI in FY 2014. This led to the release of solicitations NSF 14 -605 and NSF 15- 598 to establish NHERI through two competitions. NHERI operations awards are supported for a five -year period. T he NCO, working with the natural hazar ds engineering research and education community, is developing the NHERI Science Plan.

In FY 2016, OOI transitioned from the M REFC construction effort to the management and operation phase and is now referred t o as the OOI Program. OOI is a networked ocean -focused research observatory with arrays of instrumented buoys, profilers, gliders , and autonomous vehicles within different open -ocean and coastal regions, as well as a cabled array of instrumented platform s and profilers on or above the seafloor over the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. This networked system of instrum ents, platforms, and arrays enables researchers to examine complex, interlinked physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes operating throughout the coastal regions and to investigate a spectrum of phenomena and processes including episodic, short -lived events (meteorological, tectonic, volcanic, geological, geophysical, and ecological), and more subtle, long -term changes and emergent phenomena in ocean systems (circulation patterns, climate change, ocean acidity, geophysical events, and ecosystem trends). The OOI facility provide s the public, educators, students , and researchers with: (1) OOI long- term time series data sets (raw data and metadata are processed via convent ional algorithms and quality control methods); (2) an in- situ ocean laboratory capability to allow OOI users to submit proposals for development and application of new technologies by connecting their instruments or concepts to the OOI network ; and (3) OOI tools that will support undergraduate classroom applications of the OOI, as well as public outreach through informal education. The OOI delivers all data/ metadata and education tools to the public via the internet at www.oceanobservatories.org . The overarching scientific themes of the OOI span six multi -disciplinary domains, and each theme incorporates a multitude of research questions. Ocean -Atmosphere Exchange . Quantifying the air -sea exchange of energy and mass, especially during high winds, is critical to providing estimates of energy and gas exchange between the surface and deep ocean, and improving the predictive capability of storm forecasting and climate- change models. Climate Variability, Ocean Circulation, and Ecosystems . As both a reservoir and distributor of heat and carbon dioxide, the ocean modifies climate, and is also affected by it. Understanding how climate variability will affect ocean circulation, weather patterns, the ocean's biochemical environment, and marine ecosystems is a compelling driver for multidisciplinary observations. Turbulent Mixing and Biophysical Interactions . Mixing occurs over a broad range of scales and plays a majo r role in transferring energy, materials, and organisms throughout the global ocean. Mixing has a profound influence on primary productivity, plankton community structure, biogeochemical processes (e.g., carbon sequestration) in the surface and the deep oc ean, and the transport of material to the deep ocean. Coastal Ocean Dynamics and Ecosystems. Understanding the spatial and temporal complexity of the coastal ocean is a long -standing challenge. Quantifying the interactions between atmospheric and terrestr ial forcing, and coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes, is critical to elucidating Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 46 the role of coastal margins in the global carbon cycle, and developing strategies f or managing coastal resources. Fluid -Rock Interactions and the Subseafloor Biosphere . The oceanic crust contains the largest aquifer on Earth. Thermal circulation and reactivity of seawater -derived fluids modifies the mineralogy of oceanic crust and sediments, leads to the formation of hydrothermal vents that support unique micr o- and macro -biological communities, and concentrates methane to form massive methane gas and methane hydrate reservoirs. The role that transient events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures) play in these fluid -rock interactions and i n the dynamics of benthic and sub- seafloor microbial communities remain largely unknown. Plate -Scale, Ocean Geodynamics . Lithospheric movements and interactions at plate boundaries at or beneath the seafloor are responsible for short -term events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. These tectonically active regions are also host to the densest hydrothermal and biological activity in the ocean basins. The degree to which active plate boundaries influence the ocean from a physical, chemical , and biological perspe ctive are largely unexplored. Current Status The OOI infrastructure is operating, transmitting ocean data to storage, and incrementally delivering processed datasets and data products via the website. Refurbishment and redeployment s of the moorings, instruments, and platforms are planned and being executed. Data quality management is maturing and the OOI Science Team is conducting outreach to the science community on the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) methods and procedur es being used. The OOI Management & Operation (M &O) budget for FY 2016 was $ 54.98 million. The planned FY 2018 budget is $31.0 million. The scope of OOI activities at this funding level will be determined through the ongoing re -competition for a new manag ement and operations award as described below in the Renewal/Recompetition/Termination section. The solicitation requests submission of proposals which include the costs for all parts, labor, equipment , ship time , and cyberinfrastructure to manage, operate, and maintain the OOI. Planned OOI Program adjustments include suspension of all Global Array operations and streamlined cyberinfrastructure and management oversight. Deployed Coastal OOI instruments are visited and replaced twice per year.

The University of Washington operates the OOI Cabled Array. Oregon State University operates the Coastal Endurance Arra y. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution operates the Pioneer Coastal Array as well as the Global Arrays at the four OOI Global sites. Rutgers University manages the OOI data as well as the cyberinfrastructure and Education and Public Outreach. Raytheon Cor poration provides project management support, systems engineering, and software services f or the OOI cyberinfrastructure. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) manages OOI op erations located within the Integrative Progra ms Section . The oversight includes the FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 47 review of observatory metrics and data quality management, as well as integration of the OOI with any new science or infrastructure proposals. External Structure: The OOI Program has a Science Oversight Committee (SOC) which provides input and guidance internally to Ocean Leadership for OOI infrastructure planning and management. In FY 2017, NSF established the nine member \"Ocean Observatories Initiative Facility Bo ard' (OOIFB) to provide input and guidance regarding the management and operation of the OOI. The OOIFB is independent of the SOC. Reviews: In December 2016, NSF conducted a review of the OOI Cyberinfrastructure component. NSF is considering a management and operations review in calendar year 2017 before the award end date of December 31, 2017. Operations Costs Management and operations in support of scientific research began in FY 2013 with the deployment of the first OOI instruments. The associated costs have been and will continue to be supported by OCE, with temporary support from the GEO's Division of Integrative and Collaborative Education and Research (ICER) from FY 2015- FY 2017 (now completed). Support for research utilizing observatory data will be through the standard NSF proposal submission process to existing science programs in OCE, however , because the data is freely available over the internet , researchers around the world will have access to the unique data sets OOI is produc ing regardless of the source of their support. Education and Outreach The OOI website and infrastructure provides an education portal to enable undergraduate level tools for education. The internal OOI Science Oversight Committee actively conducts outreach activities regarding the ocean science datasets to researchers, public and education users. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The OOI management and operation cooperative a greement with C OL ends December 31, 2017.

Recent developments in seismic sensor design, and the acquisition, transmission, and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging of the interior. To serve the research needs of the broad e arth science community, SAGE is organized under three primary service areas and two special emphasis areas: Instrumentation Services The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) consists of over 150 permanently -installed broadband digital seismic stations, most of which have real -time data access. GSN is operated in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Portable Seismology (PS) includes a pool of over 5,200 portable seismometers that are made available to the earth science research community for a wide range of principal investigat or-driven experiments largely funded through the NSF merit review process. Polar Support Services (PSS) supports the development of specialized seismic equipment for use in harsh environments and provides instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the polar regions. The Transportable Array (TA) is a continental -scale seismic observatory designed to provide a foundation for multi -scale integrated studies of continental lithosphere and deep Earth structure. Over 1,700 TA stations operated across the lower 48 states and southern Ontario and Quebec, Canada, FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 53 between 2004 and 2015; TA is now being deployed to Alaska and western Canada. The Magnetotelluric (MT) component exploits the natural variations in Earth's magnetic and electric fields to provide information on the dist ribution and composition of fluids in Earth's crust and upper mantle, which gives constraints on Earth's structure that are complementary to those resulting from seismology. Instrumentation Services- Coordinated Activities include efforts to develop the ne xt generation of seismic instrumentation for large -scale scientific experiments; global -scale geophysical networks; and training courses to distribute best practices to partners worldwide. Data Services SAGE Data Services (DS) manages an archive of over 4 30 terabytes of seismic, magnetotelluric, and other data from all SAGE components, the EarthScope program, and numerous affiliated networks; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. In the last quarter of FY 2016, more than 17,000 unique users downloaded over 130 TB of data from the SAGE archive. Education and Public Outreach The SAGE Education a nd Public Outreach (EPO) program enables audiences beyond seismologists to access and use seismological data and research, including student internships, and programs for under - resourced educational institutions. Special Emphasis Areas Community Activitie s include scientific and technical workshops that bring together the international seismic community and publications designed to communicate SAGE activities and results to the community. International Development Seismology (IDS) leverages the core SAGE service areas to provide capacity building and training for earthquake hazard mitigation in developing countries, through technical assistance and research collaborations with scientists at U.S. academic institutions. Besides its role in providing the obs ervational data essential for basic earth science research, SAGE also provides real-time seismic data to the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for global earthquake, volcano, and tsunami monitoring; international seismic m onitoring of compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; and bringing seismology to students and the public through the activities of its EPO program. SAGE is heavily involved in partnership activities, many international in nature. Installation and operation of the GSN has put IRIS in contact with scientists , as well as government and non -government al organizations , from around the world. Many international GSN stations are designated as the official stations for nuclear test ban monitoring in their host countries. SAGE also provides multi -use resources for other government agencies that have responsibilities for development of a nuclear test ban monitoring capability and for monitoring global seismicity. For these purposes, agencies in partnership with NSF have provided substantial support for accelerated development of the GSN, shared operat ion and maintenance of the GSN , and accelerated development of the PS instrument pool . The EarthScope, Geophysics, GeoPRISMS, and Tectonics Programs in the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR); the GeoPRISMS and Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs in the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE); and the Geology and Geophysics Program and the Glaciology Program in the Antarctic Research Section of OPP provide most of the funds, totaling approximately $15.0 million annually , for NSF -Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 54 sponsored research making use of SAGE. Funds permit deployment of portable seismic instruments and use of data managed by DS to solve major Earth science problems. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences ( EAR ) in the Directorate for Geosciences, through its Instrumentation & Facilities program (IF), provides general oversi ght of SAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of SAGE programs and projects with other NSF -supported facilities , and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of IRIS in managing and operating SAGE. External Structure: SAGE is managed and operated by IRIS, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 124 U.S. universit ies and non -profit organizations with research and teaching programs in seismolog y. Each voting m ember institution of the Consortium appoints a m ember representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the IRIS Board of Directors. The Board members, who serve three- year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with SAGE management and operation, through consultation with IRIS staff and SAGE advisory co mmittees (one for each major SAGE component and additional ad hoc working gro ups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of IRIS to a renewable two - year term. The president is responsible for IRIS operations, all of which are managed through the IRIS Corporate Office located in Washington, DC. Reviews: All major ongoing geoscience facilities routinely undergo reviews of their management , in addition to peer review of proposals for new or continued support. The formal NSF me rit review of the five-year proposal for the SAGE facility took place in 2012 and 2013 and was also the most recent review of IRIS. Although the ad hoc reviewers and two independent review panels had a number of specific recommendations at the working level for SAGE, overall the review found that SAGE was a critical facility for U.S. and international E arth sciences. Furthermore, the reviewers found that IRIS is a well -managed and effective organization that has, through its commitment to the collection and open dissemination of the highest quality seismological data, transformed the discipline of seismology. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Funding for the current cooperative agreement for SAGE began in FY 2014 and ends in FY 2018. In FY 2016, in keeping with the phased integration and recompetition plan presented to and concurred with by the National Science Board in December 2009, NSF solicited proposals to manage and operate one or more components of a new facility to support the Earth sciences resear ch and education community. These components are currently supported by SAGE and the related Geodesy Advancing Geoscience and EarthScope (GAGE). The new distributed, multi -user, national facility would support the development, deployment, management, and operational support of modern geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instrumentation and provide services to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences. NSF is currently reviewing proposals received in response to this facility solicitation.

In FY 2016, NCAR received approximately $41.7 million in support from other federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and $21.6 million from non- federal sources. Major Investments in FY 2018: In FY 2018, investments at NCAR will focus on fundamental research aimed at improving our ability to predict atmospheric, chemical, and space weather hazards, and increasing our understanding of the variability in the Earth's climate system at regional and global scales. In all of these areas, NCAR scientists will work with their university colleagues to further understand the fundamental processes that control the Earth's climate and weather systems. This will include research thrusts in areas such as the role of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, better understanding of the structure and nature of hurricanes and other severe weather events, and the impacts of the Sun on space weather and weather on Earth . The FY 2018 decrease will require reassessment and refocusing of prioritie s for support by NSF and NCAR. Aircraft Support : NCAR operates two NSF Hercules and a Gulfstream -V (the 'G -V'), both of which are highly modified and equipped with specialized instrumentation, to enable the support of research activities designed to provide new insights into atmospheric chemical processes, the dynamics and coupling of the atmosphere's layers, and interactions between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. The two aircraft will support several community -originated projects d eemed by peer review to be of exceptional scientific merit. Computational Infrastructure : NCAR operates a petascale supercomputing facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming (the NCAR -Wyoming Supercomputing Center), that supports high -end community modeling programs i n atmospheric, solar, and other Earth Systems processes. These include the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Weather Research and Forecasting Models (WRF), which use mathematical formulas to simulate and better understand the chemical and physical processes that drive Earth's climate and weather system. NCAR leads the development of these community models and supports many thousands of users in the U.S. and worldwide. NCAR also maintains extensive data archives, providing access to a vast collection of observational, experimental, and modeling data, together with sophisticated analysis and visualization facilities, and training and support for users of all levels. Othe r Facility Support : In addition to the C -130 and G -V aircraft, NCAR provides support for a number of other atmospheric and solar observing platforms through its Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) and High Altitude Observatory (HAO) , including a large , deploy able, dual -wavelength Doppler radar, upper atmosphere observing capabilities, an advanced coronagraph, and other experimental systems. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 57 Research and Education Support : As an internationally recognized center of excellence, NCAR operates scientific research programs that include the following areas: studies of large -scale atmospheric and ocean dynamics that contribute to an understanding of the past and present Earth System pr ocesses; global and regional atmospheric chemistry, including atmospheric connections to geochemical and biogeochemical cycles; the variable nature of the sun and the physics of the corona and their interaction with the Earth's magnetic field; the physic s of clouds, thunderstorms, precipitation formation, and their interactions and effects on l ocal and regional weather; and examination of human society's impact on atmospheric composition, weather, and climate, and response to global environmental change. Research collaborations with university colleagues are integral to NCAR's success as an institution, and NCAR serves as a focus and meeting point for the broader atmospheric and related sciences community. NCAR also maintains extensive partnerships and collaborations with the private sector through directed research and technology transfer. This work focuses on developing information and analysis platforms tailored to the specific needs of stakeholders in a variety of sectors, including energy, aviation, and agriculture. Educational activities include the SOARS (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) program that integrates research, education, and mentoring to bridge the undergraduate -to-graduate transition and to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related sciences. NCAR further supports the scientific community by providing fellowships, internships, workshops, and colloquia for students and visiting scientists, and disseminates knowledge of the geosciences. Professional training courses, innovative and award -winning science education websites, as well as t he directed activities of NCAR's edu catio n and outreach programs, are further examples of how NSF's goal of integrating research and education is attained through NCAR activities. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS), provide oversight of NCAR and the cooperative agreement under which UCAR manages NCAR. The cooperative agreement encourages interactions between NCAR scientists and AGS staff and ensures close coordination be tween AGS and NCAR management. The agreement contains requirements for AGS's oversight of the NCAR program and UCAR management activities that affect NCAR. UCAR submit s for AGS approval an annual program plan for NCAR that details how resources will be use d, and an annual report on the previous year's scientific accomplishments and achievements. UCAR also reports annually to NSF on its activities as NCAR's manager. Annual strategic planning between AGS, UCAR, and NCAR ensure s that scientific and facility pr iorities align with those of NSF. External Structure: UCAR works in partnership with NSF and the university community to ensure effective implementation of the NCAR strategic mission to the benefit of the atmospheric and geospace research community. In addition, other federal agencies (such as NOA, NASA, DOD, DOE and the FAA), state authorities, and the private sector support research collaboration wherever it enhances NCAR's NSF -supported research goals or facilities missions.

As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by NSF, the primary purpose of NOAO is to serve as the U.S. national center for ground- based optical and infrared (OIR) astronomy to coordinate , integrate , and operate observational, technical, and data- oriented capabilities available throughout the U.S. OIR system of federal and non- federal assets. NOAO's mission is to enable discovery in ground -based OIR astronomy. In pursuit of this mission, NOAO facilitates access for all qualified professional researchers to state -of-the-art observational capabilities and databases in OIR astronomy. NOAO enables the U.S. research community to pursue a broad range of modern astrophysical challenges from small bodies within the Solar System, to the most distant galaxies in the early universe, to indirect observations of dark energy and dark matter. NOAO is the gateway for the U.S. astronomical community to the Gemini Observatory through the U.S. National Gemini Office (US - NGO). NOAO coordinates community access to telescopes throughout the U.S. OIR system, and it facilitates connecting the scientific user to data archives by developing and maintaining data management capabilities. NOAO integrates community planning for future facilities and instrumentation projects under a national organization. In partnership with the community and NSF, NOAO works with colleges and universities to train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and promotes accomplishments to strengthen education and public awareness of the astronomic al sciences. NOAO facilities, telescopes, and data systems, are open to all qualified astronomers regardless of institutional affiliation. They serve nearly 1,200 U.S. and foreign scientists annually. Doctoral dissertation students and non- thesis graduate students from U.S. institutions use NOAO facilities for research projects. In FY 2016, NOAO employed 300 personnel in Arizona and Chile, including 45 support scientists and 10 postdoctoral fellows. The Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS/AST) conducted a community- based review of its portfolio in 2011- 2012. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee (PRC) report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges 20, was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all of the major AST telescope facilities. The recommendations from the PRC report included divesting NSF support from three nighttime OIR telescopes located on Kitt Peak: The 4- meter Mayall telescope, the 2.1- meter telescope, and the 3.5- meter WIYN telescope, which is owned and operated by a consortium of University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, and NOAO. NOAO's share of the WIYN telescope time for public access is 40 percent. 20www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 60 The PRC recommendations were implemented as of October 1, 2015. The 2.1 -meter telescope is now operated by the California Institute of Technology for a research program on cosmic transient phenomena. Starting in FY 2016, the NOAO base operations and maintenance budget excluded NSF funding for the Mayall and WIYN telescopes. Any subsequent NSF support for these telescopes is recorded as special projects with supplemental funding to NOAO.

The current cooperative agreements ends in September 2020. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : The managing organization for NOAO is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), which is comprised of 42 U.S. member institutions and five international affiliate members. A key NOAO partnership is ongoing with the Department of Energy (DO E) to conduct a survey of the southern sky to investigate the nature of dark energy. The five -year Dark Energy Survey began operation in August 2013 on the CTIO 4 -meter Blanco telescope. NOAO is a partner in the 4.1 -meter SOAR (Southern Astrophysical Resea rch) telescope at CTIO. SOAR partners include the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Michigan State University; and the Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia, e Inoviao do Brasil. A large number of U.S. universities support their own astronomical fac ilities at KPNO and CTIO with reimbursed services provided by NOAO. Development of new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques is done in partnership with universities and with industry through subawards to aerospace, optical fabrication, and information technology companies. NOAO leverages NSF support with funding from other federal agencies and non- federal sources. NOAO typically receives approximately $10.0 million each year for reimbursed services from partnerships and tenant observatory supp ort, from the Kitt Peak Visitors Center, and from grants from other federal agencies. Education and Public Outreach: NOAO supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. Over 200 U.S. and foreign graduate students observe on NOAO telescopes yearly and a significant fraction of the observations contribute to Ph.D. dissertations. The observatories introduce undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environments for basic astronomical research and related technologies through NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduate Students (REU) program. NOAO has a diverse education program, visitor centers, and a web -based information portal at www.noao.edu. NOAO Base O&M: $18.57 million, $960,000 $9.02 million, $410,000 above the FY 2016 Actual: This covers the headquarters, offices, laboratories, and workshops in Tucson, Arizona.

All facilities on the mountain are accounted as tenants. Special Projects (WIYN and Mayall): $2.10 million, $2.28 Actual WIYN telescope: $1.0 million, no change from the FY 2016 Actual: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified the WIYN telescope as the preferred platform for an extreme precision Doppler spectrometer as a facility instrument for exoplanet follow up research. This instrument is the key component of a NASA -NSF partnership in Exoplanet Observational Research (NN -EXPLORE), which began in FY 2015 using existing instrumentation on WIYN. A Memorandum of Agreement between the agencies for NN -EXPLORE was signed in FY 2015, and a Joint Oversight Group was formed early in FY 2016. Mayall Telescope: $1.10 million, $2.28 million below the FY 2016 Actual: The decrease from FY 2016 anticipates an increase in DOE support for the telescope. In FY 2015, DOE identified the Mayall telescope as the preferred platform for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to carry out a dark energy science survey sponsored by DOE, starting in FY 2019. DESI passed the DOE Critical Decision 3 (Approve Start of Construction) mileston e in FY 2016. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: An NSF program officer in AST provides continuing oversight, including consultation with an NSF program review panel of external reviewers that meets once a year. The program officer reviews detailed annual program plans, annual long range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted by NOAO. The NSF program officer also attends AURA governance committee meetings. Governance committees are formed from the national astro nomical community and provide additional avenues for input of community priorities and concerns. The AST program officer works closely with other offices at NSF, particularly the Office of General Counsel, and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: AURA is the managing organization for NOAO. The NOAO director reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the NSF c ooperative agreement that began in FY 2016. AURA receives management advice from an observatory council composed of members of its scientific and management communities. NOAO uses a Users Committee, comprised of community scientists, to advise the NOAO dir ector on all aspects of user experiences at the Observatory. Reviews: In addition to reviews held mid- way through all cooperative agreements, NSF conducts both periodic and ad hoc external reviews of AURA management. A comprehensive review of the managing organization's performance will be carried out in FY 2019, the fourth year of the five -year cooperative agreement. Renewal/Competition/Termination The last competition for management and operation of NOAO was completed with the issuance of a new cooperat ive agreement with AURA starting October 1, 2015 and ending September 30, 2020.

Operating synergistically with optical, infrared, and x- ray telescopes, NRAO facilities enable discovery over a remarkably broad range of key problems in modern astrophysics that reach from within our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the universe. Using NRAO observing capabilities and data archives, scientists: carry out precision cosmological measurements; test fundamental physics; probe deep int o the earliest, most intense, and optically obscured phases of planet, star, galaxy, and black hole formation; reveal the cool gas from which stars form; provide essential tools for studying magnetic fields and high- energy cosmic phenomena; and seek to det ect gravitational waves. As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, NRAO operates the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico and is also the North American implementing organi zation for the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These ground- based observing facilities for radio astronomy are available to any qualified researcher, regardless of affiliation or nationality, on the basis of scientific, m erit-reviewed proposals. NRAO facilities annually serve over 2,500 users worldwide; moreover, growing demand for ALMA has resulted in the most proposals ever received for an astronomical facility in response to a single proposal call. NSF does not provide individual investigator awards targeted specifically for use of NRAO facilities, but many users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of NRAO facilities. Including the ALMA operations staff located at NRAO, staff in FY 2018 will consist of 296 full -time equivalent positions (FTEs) in the operations and maintenance components: 105 in telescope operations, 60 in science support and research, 36 in development programs, 51 in computing and data management, 25 in administrative services, and 19 in education and public outreach. These numbers exclude staff at the partitioned GBT and VLBA telescopes which will be managed and operate d separately from NRAO as well as 94 staff in the NRAO common cost pool which provides services to multiple observatories. In addition, the NRAO managing ALMA is in science operations following the completion of construction in 2015.

The current cooperative agreement ends in FY 2026. The FY 2018 Budget Request for NRAO is below the FY 2016 Actual due to the partitioning of the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) from NRAO, and because o f funding carried over from the previous award which ended in FY 2016. GBO and VLBA are presented in the \"Other Astronomical Facilities\" narrative in the Facilities chapter of this document. Due to the favorable exchange rate and fuel prices in Chile, the FY 2016 Actual for ALMA Operations was below the FY 2016 Budget Request and the FY 2018 Budget Request is below the estimate for steady state funding. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : NRAO supplements AST support with funding provided by other NSF sources, other federal agencies, and non- federal sources. In FY 2016, NRAO received approximately $2.25 million from non- AST sources at NSF, $1.70 million from other federal agencies, and $4.52 million from U.S. universities, foreign scientific and technic al institutes, and other non -federal and industrial sources. The development of new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques is conducted in partnership with relevant industries through competitive sub- awards to various large and small aerospace companies, radio antenna manufacturing firms, and specialized electronics and computer hardware and software companies. Telescope operations, $11.19 million : This encompasses support for direct telescope and array operations of the VLA including maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and telescope management.

Education and Public Outreach, $660,000: NRAO supports a comprehensive outreach program that makes information about radio astronomy available to the public.21 With over 150 students involved per year, NRAO facilities are used by graduate students carrying out dissertation research and work experience programs and by undergraduate students participating in the Research Experiences for U ndergraduates (REU) program. NRAO also supports a visitor and education center and conducts active educational and public outreach programs. The VLA visitor center attracts over 20,000 public visitors each year. ALMA Operations, $43.48 million : In FY 2015, NRAO completed construction of the international ALMA Observatory, funded through the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account. Early operations funding for ALMA began in FY 2005 and ramps up to steady state operations in FY 2 018. Operations funding supports a share of observatory operations in Chile, a technical development program, and the North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC). NRAO created the NAASC in 2006 to provide technical and scientific support for, and easy acces s by, the broad astronomical community that uses ALMA. The NAASC also organizes summer schools, workshops, and courses in techniques of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, a dedicated AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and assessment for NRAO and ALMA by making use of detailed annual program plans, long -range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to NSF. The AST program officer participates in the international ALMA Board and attends AUI/NRAO governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, AST works closely with other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI. AUI manages the observatory through its own community- based oversight and users committees. The NRAO director reports to the president of AUI. Oversight of the international ALMA project is vested in the ALMA Board, which includes a member from NSF; coordination and management of the merged international efforts are the responsibility of the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) whose staff includes an ALMA director. An international ALMA review committee advises the ALMA Board. Reviews: NSF conducts annual reviews of the NRAO Program Operating Plan and strategic planning documents, ALMA operations, and the AUI Management Report. A Business Systems Review was conducted in FY 2012. Renewal/Competition/Termination Following a solicitation issued in FY 2014 (NSF 14 -568), management and operation of NRAO, including ALMA, was competed and the National Science Board authorized a cooperative agreement with AUI for the period October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2026. 21 https://public.nrao.edu/ FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 65 NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY $19,000,000 -$2,000,000 / - 9.5% Amount Percent $21.00 - $19.00 (TBD)FY 2018 RequestChange over FY 2016 Actual The FY 2018 Budget Request for the National Solar Observatory (NSO) is $19.0 million. This is a $2.0 million ( -9.5 percent) decrease from the FY 2016 Actual. FY 2018 marks the continuation of a five -year funding ramp that will bring the NSO budget to a level commensurate with requirements to operate the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST ). This profile will fund the development of the DKIST science operations and data cent er concepts in preparation for full DKIST operations expected to begin in late 2019- early 2020. As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), NSO currently operates facilities in New Mexico and Arizona as well as a coordinated worldwide network of six telescopes specifically designed to study solar oscillations . NSO also provides leadership to the solar community through management of the construction of DKIST. (See the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) chapter for more information.) NSO makes the world's largest collection of optical and infrared solar telescopes and auxiliary instrumentation available to qualified scientists to observe the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. NSO provides routine and de tailed, synoptic solar data used by individual researchers and other government agencies through the NSO Digital Library. NSO data are also made available to the user community via the Virtual Solar Observatory. NSO telescopes are open to all astronomers regardless of institutional affiliation based on peer - reviewed observing proposals. In FY 2016, 32 unique observing programs from 25 U.S. and 7 foreign institutions were carried out using NSO facilities. This is a reduction from previous years as NSO ramps down its involvement in Sacramento Peak and McMath -Pierce. Students were part of 13 percent of these programs, which included three Ph.D. thesis projects. Nearly 21 terabytes of NSO synoptic data were downloaded from the NSO Digital Library. NSO employed approximately 120 staff members in FY 2016, including 65 FTEs employed on the DKIST construction project funded via the MREFC account as mentioned above. In 2010, the National Research Council (NRC) conducted it s sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 22 the NRC committee recommended that \"NSF -Astronomy 22 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 The first simultaneous mid -infrared ima ges at 5.2 m (left) and 8 .2 m (right) of a solar flare.

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 66 should complete its next senior review before the mid -decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF -AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the Division of Astronomical Sciences within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS/AST) conducted a community -based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee (PRC) report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges, 23 was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all of the major AST telescope facilities. Prior to receiving the PRC report, NSF had instructed NSO to begin divestment of the facilities on Kitt Peak, including the McMath- Pierce solar telescope and the Vacuum Tower (no longer in use), thereby accelerating the already -planned divestment by a few years. The PRC endorsed this decision. The PRC recommended continued operation of the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at Sacramento Peak through 2017 and a 50 percent reduction in funding of the NSO integrated synoptic program (NISP) . The status of the divestment of NSO operated facilities is as follows: McMath -Pierce solar telescope, Kitt Peak, AZ : A university -based consortium previously expressed interest in continuing operations of the McMath- Pierce at a reduced level ; however, this consortium has not materialized. NSO is in the final year of the ramp down of its participation in McMath- Pierce from $200,000 in FY 2014 to $0. 0 by the end of FY 2017. NSF completed a divestment options study of NSO facilities on Kitt Peak and anticipates beginning the environmental impa ct statement (EIS) process in FY 2017. On March 31, 2017, NSO/AURA issued a request for proposals from parties interested in taking over operation of McMath- Pierce for scientific and educational purposes. Applicants submitted letters of intent by the May 1, 2017 deadline. Sacramento Peak Observatory, Sunspot, NM : This facility includes the D ST and associated infrastructure including office space, laboratory space, dining facilities, and housing. Funding for full operations of Sacramento Peak ramps down to t he end of FY 2017 at which time NSO will cease operating the facility. A proposal from New Mexico State University (NMSU) to transition operations of the facility from NSO to an NMSU -led consortium was funded in FY 2016. NSF completed a divestment options study of NSO facilities on Sacramento Peak in Q3 of FY 2016. In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), NSF began preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in Q4 of FY 2016. The EIS is expected to be completed in FY 2018. NSO Integrated Synoptic Program : NISP consists of the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and the Synoptic Optical Long- term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS). GONG now has a component of its operations funding provided through a 5- year (FY 2016 - FY 2020) interagency agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This NOAA funding supports the use of GONG and its data products for operational space weather forecasting (see Partnerships section below). 23 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 $3.92 $4.04 18.08 19.13 GONG Refurbishment 2.50 - - - - - - - Total, NSO See theMREFC chapter for more information on DKIST.1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in September 2024.Total Obligations for NSO (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2016 ActualFY 2017 (TBD)FY 2018 Request Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : The managing organization for NSO is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), which comprises 42 U.S. member institutions and five international affiliate members. NSO p artners include NOAA, NASA, and industrial entities. Other funding entities include universities and institutes, which collaborate with NSO on solar instrumentation development and on the design and development of DKIST. Industry sub -awardees in aerospace, optical fabrication, and information technology develop new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques. Due to the increasing national and international awareness of the impacts of space weather on critical infrastructure and society in general, the impo rtance of operational space weather forecasting has become apparent to U.S. policy makers. This was highlighted by the October 29, 2015 rollout of the National Space Weather Strategy 24 and the associated National Space Weather Action Plan.25 Space weather fo recasting requires both accurate models of the heliospheric environment and precise observational data inputs to those models. NSO's GONG program provides operational data products on a routine basis that are used as inputs to predictive space weather models from the U.S. Air Force and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The FY 2016 support for NSO included a one -time $2.50 million investment in GONG to increase its robustness for future space weather predictions. NSO is in the process of upgrading the GONG facility with this funding. Also in FY 2016, NSF and NOAA signed an interagency agreement whereby NOAA is providing approximately $800,000 per year in funding support for GONG operations. NSO Base Operations, $4.73 million, $2.02 million be low the FY 2016 Actual : NSO Base Operations includes the offices at NSO's Boulder, CO headquarters and the world- wide NSO Integrated Synoptic Program consisting of the GONG array and the SOLIS (Synoptic Optical Long- term Investigations of the Sun) telescope. By the end of FY 2017, NSO expects to be disengaged from operations at Sacramento Peak Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico and from the McMath- Pierce and Vacuum Tower facilities based on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The funding profile for NSO Base Operations has been ramping down in anticipation of the divestment of these redundant facilities by the end of 2017. Beginning in FY 2019, NSO Base Operations will fund NSO Directorate activities and operations of the synoptic program at a steady -state level of about $ 4.0 million ($2.0 million each) per year. DKIST Operations, $14.0 million, $2.5 million above the FY 2016 Actual : Support for DKIST operations is through the Research and Related Activities account (R&RA), while DKIST construction support is through the MREFC account. (S ee the MREFC chapter for more information on construction.) The FY 2018 Budget Request for DKIST Operations represents the fourth year of a five -year funding ramp that will bring the NSO budget to a level commensurate with requirements to operate DKIST.

Education and Public Outreach, $270,000, $20,000 above the F Y 2016 Actual : NSO supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. NSO introduces undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environme nts for basic astronomical research and related technologies through NSF's separately funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. NSO has diverse education programs, including teacher training and curriculum development, visitor centers, and a web portal at www.nso.edu. In preparation for the total solar eclipse in August 2017, and with the imminent arrival of DKIST, NSO significantly increased its efforts in education, public outreach, and broadening participation by establishing an Off ice of Education and Outreach (OEO). In FY 2016, NSO hired a new office head and recently filled a second EPO position, based in Maui, focused on DKIST. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: An NSF program officer in AST provides continuing oversight, i ncluding consultation with an annual NSF program review panel. The program officer makes use of detailed annual program plans, annual long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted by NSO as well as attending AURA Solar Observatory Council meetings. The latter committee is formed from the national solar physics community and provides a window into community priorities and concerns. The AST program officer works closely with other offices at NSF, particularly the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, the Office of General Counsel, and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: AURA is the managing organization for NSO. The NSO director reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the current NSF cooperative agreement. AURA receives management advice from its Solar Observatory Council, composed of members of its scientific and management communities. NSO uses visiting and users committees for the purposes of self - evaluation and prioritization. The visiting committee, composed of nationally prominent individuals in science, management, and broadening participation, reviews for AURA all aspects of the management and operations of NSO. The users committee, composed of scientists with considerable experience with the observatory, reviews for the NSO director all aspects of NSO that affect user experiences at the observatory. Reviews: In addition to reviews held mid -way through all cooperative agreements, NSF conducts periodic and ad hoc reviews, as needed, by external committees. In February 2017, NSF held a review of NSO's Annual Progress Report and Program Plan (APRPP). From December 2015 through March 2016, NSF conducted a Business Systems Review (BSR) covering AURA and NSO. Findings and recommendations from the final NSF report were conveyed to AURA on April 1, 2016, and AURA continues to resolve issues and implement recomm endations from the report. NSO also participated in reviews of the DKIST project in FY 2016 including: a contingency assessment (Feb. - July 2016) and an Earned Value Management System validation review (Sept. 2016), both of which are described in the DKIS T narrative in the MREFC chapter. Renewal/Competition/Termination On August 14, 2014, the National Science Board (NSB) authorized a renewed cooperative agreement with AURA for management and operation of NSO for a period of 10 years from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2024. Because of additional time required to implement the new agreement, the previous cooperative agreement was extended through May 31, 2015. The renewed cooperative agreement between NSF and AURA was put into place June 1, 2015. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 69 OTHER ASTRONOMICAL FACILITIES $11,850,000 +$11,850,000 / NA% Amount Percent - - $11.85 $11.85 N/A Other Astronomomical Facilities (Dollars in Millions) 1 Beginning in October 2016, funding for these facilities as stand-alone entities is provided separately from National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).Change over FY 2016 ActualFY FY 2017, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) operated major radio telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, i ncluding the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and at 10 telescope array sites spanning the U.S. from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii, together constituting the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Beginning in FY 2017, GBO and the VLBA were separated fr om NRAO. GBO now operates the GBT, and the newly formed Long Baseline Observatory (LBO) operates the VLBA. Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), remains the managing organization for GBO and LBO through a cooperative agreement with NSF. This narrative prese nts the combined FY 2018 Budget Request for GBO and LBO. In 2010, the National Research Council conducted its sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 26 the NRC committee recommended that \"NSF -Astronomy should complete its next senior review before the mid -decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF - AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1 ) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST ) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) conducted a community -based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges, 27 was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all of the major AST telescope facilities. In 2012, the Portfolio Review Committee recommended, under constrained budgets, divestment of the GBT and VLBA from AST funding because of a less compelling mapping than other facilities onto the science questions of the 2010 decadal survey. As announced in a Dear Colleague Letter, NSF 13- 074,28 NSF partitioned GBT and VLBA from the competition for NRAO management and operations, which increased flexibility for explor ing cost -efficient operational models and sustainable partnerships for GBO (comprising GBT and the Green Bank site and facilities) and VLBA. Existing partnerships are described below, and additional partner discussions with governmental and non- governmenta l entities are ongoing. In FY 2016, an engineering firm produced feasibility reports for divestment alternatives of both GBO and VLBA; those reports include baseline structural and environmental surveys of GBO and VLBA. In FY 2017, NSF began a formal envir onmental review of GBO to develop an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) considering future alternatives for GBO, and the EIS process is expected to conclude in FY 2018. In FY 2016, AST received a proposal from AUI, to continue management and operation of GBO and LBO in FY 2017 and FY 2018, separate from the management and operation of NRAO. Previously, the 26 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 27 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp 28 http://nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13074/nsf13074.jsp Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 70 obligations for GBO and VLBA were heavily matrixed and not separable from the overall obligation for NRAO. Hence, GBO and VLBA, which were previously included in the NRAO narrative , were first presented as stand -alone entities in the FY 2017 Budget Request. The table below does not separate funding for GBO and LBO, and the detailed breakdown between the two depends on anticipated and achieved partnersh ips. Notional funding beyond FY 2018 is shown as flat, although it is expected that the out -year numbers will change significantly as partnerships evolve. FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 FY $11.85 $11.85 $11.85 $11.85Total Obligations for Other Astronomical Facilities (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES2FY 2018 Request 2Outyear funding estimates entities isprovided separately from National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) funding. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : In FY 2018, GBO and LBO are expected to receive approximately $8.60 million from other sources, roughly half from non- federal partners and half from other federal sources. Thus, the FY 2018 Budget Request represents about 58 percent of the total budget for GBO and LBO. Many of these partnerships involve guaranteed allocations of observing time on the GBT or VLBA. In FY 2016, GBO began a 10- year partnership with Breakthrough Listen and also had funding partnerships with West Virginia University and the North American Nanohertz Observat ory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) consortium that are expected to continue through FY 2018. (The NANOGrav funding comes from the NSF award to the NANOGrav Physics Frontier Center.) In addition, the GBO partnership with the RadioAstron space mission is continuing in FY 2017, and other partner discussions are ongoing. In FY 2017, NSF and LBO established an agreement with the U.S. Naval Observatory to provide observing time and data in exchange for substantial support of LBO/VLBA operations. Education a nd Public Outreach : The Green Bank Science Center at GBO currently supports nearly 50,000 visitors per year and carries out dedicated programs for professional educators and school groups. GBO and LBO Operations and Maintenance, $11.85 million : This encompasses support for direct telescope operations at GBO and LBO, including maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and telescope management, as well as funds allocated for Education and Public Outreach. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consulta tion with community representatives, a dedicated AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and assessment for GBO and LBO by making use of detailed annual program plans, technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to NSF. The A ST program officer attends AUI governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, AST works closely with other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division o f Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and the Large Facilities Office in the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management. External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI. AUI manages the observatories through its own communi ty-based oversight and users committees. The GBO and LBO directors report directly to the AUI Vice President for Radio Astronomy. Reviews: NSF reviewed the proposal for FY 2017 and FY 2018 funding and conducts annual reviews of the Program Operating Plan and reports. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 71 Renewal/Competition/Termination GBO and LBO are currently supported through a cooperative agreement, which ends on September 30, 2018. A six- month transition award in FY 2016 provided for implementation costs of separating GBO and LBO from NR AO (see the NRAO narrative for more details), and the FY 2018 funding provides for GBO and LBO as stand -alone entities. Management of GBO and LBO after FY 2018 will be based on the further development of collaboration opportunities and the EIS process ment ioned above.

Through CEMMSS -funded research, materials with unique properties and functionality are being discovered and developed more reliably and efficiently through the integration of theory, simulation, data analytics, and experiments . Further, using advanced manufacturing strategies, new materials are being fashioned into objects, structures, and systems embedded with computational intelligence, thereby transforming static systems, pro cesses, and edifices into adaptive, pervasive smart systems. Ultimately, CEMMSS is leading to fundamental scientific advances in intelligent, autonomous physical systems that can operate successfully and collaboratively in dynamic, uncertain, and unanticipated environments . The smart systems of tomorrow and the materials from which they will be composed will vastly exceed those of today in terms of adaptability, autonomy, functionality, efficiency, reliability, safety, usability, recoverability, and recyclability . The systems will collaborate with humans and with one another . These advances have the potential to accelerate scientific discoveries to address key national and societal challenges critical to U.S . security and competitiveness . CEMMSS is a six -year investment area, spanning FY 2013 -FY 2018. While the NSF -wide CEMMSS investment will conclude at the end of FY 2018, collaborative research activities pursued under CEMMSS are expected to continue . CEMMSS comprises a research portfolio and enable s new multidisciplinary research communities in the following three grand challenge areas: Breakthrough M aterials investments accelerate the discovery and development of materials required for meeting societal needs and finding paths for sustainable and sc alable manufacturing technologies ; Advanced Manufacturing investments advance knowledge for production of novel products through processes that depend up on the coordination of information, computation, automation, networking, or other e merging scientific capabilities; and Smart Systems investments drive next -generation robotics and cyber -physical systems, with enhanced adaptability, functionality, reliability, safet y, and usability in dynamic and unanticipated environments. By the end of CEMMSS, there will be evidence of an integrated and thriving ecosystem of cyber -enabled systems composed of advanced material s; improved interdisciplinary education; and research infrastructure used by CEMMSS scientists and engineers. Goals The following three goals have been established to realize significant advances in the aforementioned grand challenge areas: Goal 1 : Science and Engineering CEMMSS is establishing a scientific basis, a codified knowledge base, and shared principles for leveraging advanced materials, and designing, manufacturing, and deploying cyber -enabled smart systems. Goal 2 : Education, Workforce Development, and Community- Building CEMMSS investments are leading to the education of a cadre of high -caliber disciplinary and interdisciplinary researchers, and the development of a vibrant and capable workforce to ensure a pipeline of talent and a growing community in these critical areas. Cyber- enabled M aterials, Manufacturing, and Smart Systems NSF-Wide Investments - 4 Goal 3: Research Infrastructure CEMMSS is developing the critical research infrastructure that can be used to discover, test, refine, and validate the advanced materials, along with the design , manufacturing , and development methods that enable the deployment of smart systems. FY 2018 Investments Goal 1: Science and Engineering Advanced M anufacturing : NSF will continue to invest in Scalable Nanomanufacturing and Cellular Biomanufacturing, leveraging tools from engineering and biology (including synthetic biology), as well as in cyber -manufacturing systems. Breakthrough Materials : NSF will focus on strengthening existing projects by supporting the development of intra- and inter -project connections . Supplements to existing awards will be used to identify synergies within the research community and to accelerate pathway s for transiti oning innovative materials to practice . Smart Systems: NSF will refine the Cyber -Physical Systems (CPS) and National Robotics Initiative (NRI) program solicitations to include emphas es on autonomous, intelligent systems . Additionally, NSF will examine the social, behavioral, and economic research issues associated with the design , manufacturing, and deployment of Smart Systems . Goal 2: Education, Workforce Development, and Community Building NSF will continue to support and facilitate partnerships with other f ederal agencies, industry , professional societies, and other stakeholders to build a robust research portfolio, accelerate the transition of research to practice, and hone educational and workforce development opportunities. Partnerships have proven valuable in facilitating a diverse, use- inspired CEMMSS research portfolio, for example, the CPS program, which comprises five federal agencies in addition to NSF; industry partners facilitating the Transition to Practice award option; and a recent National Academies' study on the future of CPS education. Goal 3: Research Infrastructure Development NSF will support data, software , and physical infrastructure necessary for CEMMSS. Specifically, for Breakthrough Materials, NSF will continue investments in the two Materials Innovation Platforms focused on two- dimensional materials. For Smart Systems , NSF will emphasize engaging the relevant community to identify infrastructure requirements and incentives for community adoption and use of such infrastructure.

With world population projected to increase to nine billion (U .S. population reaching 400 million) by 2050 and urban populations expected to double, there are expected to be major increases in demand for these resources. The Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) investment area enables interagency cooperation on one of the most pressing problems of the millenniumunderstanding interactions across the FEW nexus, how it is likely to affect our world, and how we can proactively plan for its consequences. Food, energy, and water systems interconnect and are interdependent in many ways. Water is required for the production of energy hydropower, cooling of electric power plants, energy production, etc . Energy is needed for wastewater treatment, desalination, pumping groundwater, and for transport of water. Water and energy are critical for agriculture and food production. Biofuels consume water and, in so me instances, result in reducti ons in the production of food. In addition, different land use practices, increased urbanization, and climate variability have major impacts on all three . These multifaceted interactions are impacted on the one hand by fundam ental laws governing various physical, chemical, and biological processes, and on the other hand by the social, behavioral, and economic decisions made by individuals , organizations , and governments. Given the increased demand on these resources, societies can no longer sustain optimal operation for one system (i.e., food, energy, or water system), we must plan our interaction within the FEW system of systems so that no system fails even if it means that all systems operate sub - optimally. The food, energy , and water nexus creates a grand research challenge: to understand how the se complex, coupled processes and systems function now and in the future. T here is also a crit ical need for research to enable new te chnologies that will enhance the productivity of the system and subsystems, maximize efficient overall usage of FEW resources, and define new means for socially and technologically adapting to future variability and demands. Investigations of this complex system will produce discoveries that cannot emer ge from research on food or energy or water sy stems alone; the interactions among these components and the context(s) of the problem(s) they pose at the FEW nexus will produce new knowledge and technologies. NSF support of basic research in the science and engineering disciplines is needed to understand the interdependent and interconnected FEW systems and could lead to an integrated model useful not only for scientific understanding, but also informed decisi on-making. INFEWS investments began in FY 2016 and are planned to continue through FY 2020. The overarching goal is to improve understanding of the interdependencies of the FEW systems, within a disciplinary and interdisciplinary context. Examples include: Improve understanding of FEW systems embedded in differing social contexts and the societal vulnerabilities of these systems with respect to short and long timescale events (e.g., weather, power outages, resource distribution, population pressures, and l and-use changes). Advance scientific and engineering understanding to : Improve systems models covering a range of environments , technologies, policies, individual and organizational behaviors, and relative weighting of FEW stresses/needs across the scope of the human, built, and natural environments ; Enable discoveries that lead to technological innovations incorporating sustainability, safety, security, efficiency, and affor dability, while addressing relevant social, economic, and cultural factors ; systems or models that promote efficient use of resources, as well as conversion and/or reuse of waste materials; Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems NSF-Wide Investments - 6 Inform technologies and policies that improve food security and agricultural practices that better maintain ecosystem services; Strengthen pa rtnerships with projects at the state and local levels that will test research results in real-world systems; and Encourag e the results of modelling as well as technological and social solutions to be widely available to agencies, industries, and the publ ic through computing interfaces that encourage interaction, contribution of additional data , and local application . Goals Goal 1 : Significantly advance our understanding of the food- energy -water system through quantitative and computational modeling, including support for advanced cyberinfrastructure; Goal 2: Develop real -time, cyber -enabled interfaces that improve understanding of the behavior of FEW systems and increase decision support capability ; Goal 3: Enable research that will lead to innovative solutions to critical FEW system problems ; and Goal 4: Grow the scientific workforce capable of studying and managing the FEW system , through education and other professional development opportunities. FY 2018 Investments In FY 2018, solicitations will e mphasize : computational FEW system modeling ($11.95 million), innovative system solutions ($7.45 million) , and contributing activities ($5.0 million) . Projects are significantly advancing scientific and engineering understanding and modeling of the comple x FEW system and water -energy, food -energy, and food- water subsystems, as well as their interdependencies under multiple conditions. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, projects integrate expertise from agricultural, computational, ecol ogical, economic, e nergy, engineering, hydrological, mathematical, and social areas to en able technol ogical innovations that improve security and affordability. In FY 2018, fundamental scientific and engineering research will focus on systems models that cover a range of climates and organizational behaviors across built and natural environments. Emphasis will be placed on new design concepts a nd technologies that promote efficient use of resources and improve food security and agricultural practices that better maintain ecosystem services. Contributions will also be made to relevant graduate education experiences and to advanced phenotyping and microbiome technologies that have potential to translate into improved agricultural productivi ty and efficient us e of resources such as land, water, nitrogen, and phosphorous.

The I -Corps program provides immersive, experiential entrepreneurial education to scientists and engineers by supporting I -Corps Teams and building a National Innovation Network (NIN) composed of I-Corps Nodes and I-Corps Sites that work cooperatively to build, utilize, and sustain the national innovation ecosystem. I -Corps Nodes support innovation research and education , and enhance the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. The interconnected N odes of this network are diverse in research areas, resources, tools, programs, capabilities and geographic locations ; the network has the flexi bility to grow and reconfigure as needs evolve. The I - Corps Sites catalyze local teams to explore the transition of their technology concepts into the marketplace. The Sites also offer infrastructure, resources and networking opportunities that serve the teams, while develop ing the local innovation ecosystem . These components al l contribute to enhancing and enlarging the national network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. Goals NSF established the I -Corps program in FY 2011 to cultivat e a national innovation ecosystem that builds upon fundamental research advances and accelerates the translation of scientific research towards the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. The goals of the I -Corps program are to: Capitalize on NSF's investment in fundamental research; Offer academic researchers an opportunity to learn firsthand about technology -based innovation and entrepreneurship, and to help fulfill the promise of their discoveries; Foster national col laborations of academic researchers with peers conducting research commercialization, industrial mentors , startup investors, and entrepreneurial educators; and Prepare students for real -world experience through curricular enhancements, and provide them wit h opportunities to learn about and participate in the process of transforming scientific and engineering discoveries to meet societal needs. FY 2018 Investments I-Corps Team awards support NSF -funded researchers who are interested in transitioning their research out of the lab. I -Corps Teams are given access to immersive experiential entrepreneurial education together with additional support in the form of mentoring and funding to help determine the readiness to commercialize technology resulting from NS F-funded projects. Upon completion of the I -Corps curriculum, the Teams are expected to demonstrate: (1) a clear go/no go decision regarding viability of the business model tested during I -Corps ; (2) substantial first -hand evidence for or against product -market fit , with a pithy definition of the customer segments and corresponding value propositions ; and ( 3) a narrative of a compelling technology demonstration for potential partners. As of April 2017, 954 Teams have undertaken the curriculum. Approximately 45 percent of these Teams have started their own companies, and three of these companies have been acquired. Many of these companies have also received Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funds from various federal agencies, as well as investments from the private sector. The Nodes provide training to I -Corps Teams; establish regional activities to cultivate the growth of innovation ecosystems; develop tools and resources that benefit the entire I -Corps program within a two - to three -year timeframe; and identify and pursue longer -term (five -plus years) research and development NSF Innovation Corps NSF-Wide Investments - 8 projects. I -Corps Sites are funded at academic institutions that have existi ng innovation or entrepreneurial units, to enable and support teams to transition their ideas and technologies into the marketplace. The I - Corps Nodes and Sites have created a national startup incubator called the National Innovation Network (NIN), which provides academic researchers with ever -evolving resources for academic spin -outs. Specific investments The I -Corps NIN leverag es existing entrepreneurial and innovation capacities in universities and tap s into federal, state, and regional resources ; it offers significant potential to reach out to a large number of budding and existing innovators and entrepreneurs. In FY 2018, NSF will continue to scale-up the I - Corps program by increasing the numbers of I -Corps Nodes nationwide to reach a steady state of ten nodes .

These infrastructure services include tra nsportation (road, rail, air), energy (electricity, gas, oil, renewable), water, communications and networks (wireless and wired, including the internet), banking and finance, and many other components. The increased penetration and use of modern technolog ies have improved our Nation's productivity and quality of life. These technologies are now becoming deeply embedded into our society via wireless and wired networks, smart phones , and other edge devices, embedded systems, sensors, and social networks. As a result, the availability of real -time information about the state of these complex cyber -physical infrastructure systems is truly unprecedented. Our increasing dependence on infrastructure services has increased the impact of risks that may cause these systems to fail. Risk severity can be understood as the product of the probability of an event and the magnitude of the event's consequences. These risks arise from at least two distinct sources: (a) extreme natural events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, s torms, earthquakes, and space weather and (b) man -made events such as terrorist attacks and human errors. There are indications that extreme weather events may become more frequent in the future, which highlights the importance of quantifying the potential impacts. Through the Risk and Resilience investment area, NSF aims to improve predictability and risk assessment and to increase resilience that will reduce the impact of extreme events on our lives, society, and the economy. NSF is uniquely positioned to support such advancements, as they require multidisciplinary expertise in science, engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and education. The Risk and Resilience investment began in FY 2016 and is planned to continue through FY 2019. Anticipated broad outcomes at the end of this initiative include: A comprehensive and integrated risk and resilience knowledge base useful for informed decision- making and risk mitigation ; New, synthesized approaches that will improve resilience, interoperations, p erformance, and readiness in Interdependent Critical Infrastructure s (ICIs) , and; Advanced understanding of the organizational, social, psychological, legal, political, and economic obstacles to improving ICIs, the strategies for overcoming these obstacles and the role of these advances in the context of increasingly smart and connected communities . Goals Goal 1: Advance knowledge of risk assessment and predictability through support for improvements in our ability to understand, model, and predict extreme events and natural hazards. This goal is supported by a focused research effort, Prediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS), that will help us to better understand and mitigate the risks posed to the U.S. by natural hazards. Goal 2: Support the creation of tools and technologies for increased resilience, including novel engineered systems solutions for resilient infrastructures, particularly those that leverage the growing infusion of cyber -physical -social components into the infrastructures. This goal is supported by the Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) program . Risk and Resilience NSF-Wide Investments - 10 FY 2018 Investments In FY 2018, PREEVENTS, at $17.75 million, and CRISP , at $12.90 million , will continue, as will some contributing activities, at $500,000. In the PREEVENTS program, awards have focused on earthquakes, sinkholes, volcanic activity, plate boundaries, t sunamis and tropical cyclones. Workshops have fostered community expansion on relevant but underdeveloped disciplinary and cro ss-disciplinary problems . Research Coordination Networks (RCNs) supported in FY 2017 have enabled grou ps of investigators to share information and ideas ; coordinate research activities; foster synthesis and new collaborations; develop communi ty standards; and advance science and education through communication and sharing of ideas across disciplinary, orga nizational, geographic , and international boundaries. These new networks are increasing understanding of current risk and resilience issues and knowledge gaps, thus informing FY 2018 solicitations. Going forward, emphasis will be placed on synthesis of r esults and identifying areas for needed research and improving dissemination of information to end- users. CRISP projects supported new research on topics that included interdependent energy and water systems, decision making in emergency healthcare respon se systems, and resilience of financial infrastructures in response to extreme events. CRISP projects planned for FY 2017 will catalyze collaborations among researchers across the domains of engineering, computer and computational science, and the social/ behavioral/economic sciences. These awards will create theoretical frameworks and multi - disciplinary models of ICIs , including in the context of smart and connected communities to inform future investments. In FY 2018, the CRISP program will promote researc h on ICI systems and processes and educate the next generation of scientists and engineers be able to improve the resilience of our infrastructures in the face of changing and increasing risks. T he projects supported will make ICI services more effective, efficient, dependable, adaptable, resilient, safe, and secure, taking into account the human systems in which they are embedded. In addition, $500,000 for contributing activities includes two interagency activities, one with the Department of Energy on the modern power grid and the other with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) developing algorithms for analyzing large datasets.

Society's overwhelming reliance on this complex cyberspace has, however, exposed its fragility and vulnerabilities as corporations, agencies, national infrastructure , and individ uals have been victims of cyber -attacks. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing not only challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system but also vulnerabilities that arise from human behaviors and choices . Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject can lead to fundament ally new ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems; protect existing and future infrastructure ; and motivate and educate individuals about cybersecurity. This requires expertise across computer science; engineering; statistics ; mathematics ; the social, behavioral , and economics science s; and education, as well as the transition of new concepts and technologies into practice. Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (S aTC) is a seven -year investment area, spanning FY 2014 -FY 2020 . However, NSF's emphasis on cybersecurity research is expected to continue beyond FY 2020 because it constitutes an enduring challenge for science and engineering research and education that must evolve constantly to address new threats. Outcomes from SaTC will include development of an organized, cohesive scientific foundation for the body of knowledge that informs the field of cybersecurity and privacy; improved understanding of the root causes of current threats; development of foundational countermeasures, including approaches that leverage designed -in security, moving target defense, tailored trustworthy spaces, and cyber -economic and behavioral incent ives; and the establishment of recommendations for new instructional materials, degree programs, and educational pathways . In particular, foundational research in SaTC will lead to a research community pursuing a broad and deep multidisciplinary research portfolio spanning cybersecurity and privacy, whose results underlie methods for secure critical infrastructure. Ultimately, through SaTC, NSF expects to produce an innovation ecosystem that ensures new and existing technologies are secure from attack and u sers' information is protected from violations of privacy despite the new attack surfaces these technologies present . Similarly, the creation of a workforce and citizenry with an understanding of cybersecurity and privacy issues is an anticipated impact of NSF's support of activities related to the education and training of cybersecurity researchers and professionals. Goals Goal 1: Foundational Research Develop the scientific theory, methodologies, and tools necessary to the development of trustworthy and usably secure systems and appropriate privacy safeguards. Goal 2: Accelerating Transition to Practice Transition successful basic research results and commercial innovations into early adoption and use, allowing NSF cyberinfrastructure to serve as a premi er proving ground and state -of-the-art environment for advancing cybersecurity solutions and moving them into technical and organizational practice. Goal 3 : Education and Preparation of Cybersecurity Researchers and Professionals Increase the number of qua lified students entering the fields of information assurance and cybersecurity, and enhance the capacity of higher education to produce professionals in these fields to meet the needs of our increasingly technological society . This includes NSF's investment in the CyberCorps \u00ae: Scholarship for Service (Sf S) program, which supports cybersecurity education and workforce development. Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace NSF-Wide Investments - 12 FY 2018 Investments Goal 1: Foundational Research Refine the SaTC program solicitation in FY 2018, including a request for Frontier projects , which are center -scale, multi -disciplinary, multi- organizational projects that provide high -level visibility to grand challenge research areas in cybersecurity. Fund innovative projects that advance the science of cybersecurity and privacy, as well as security for big data analytics, cloud computing, and cyber -physical systems. NSF will also support cutting -edge cybersecurity and privacy topics, including redefining cyber forensics, data science for security, privacy -aware big data manag ement and mining, ethics for trustworthy cyberspace, theory and science for obfuscation, and information- oriented security. Build upon existing partnerships with other f ederal agencies, industry, and international organizations to more effectively achieve the long -term goals related to SaTC . Pursue efforts to grow the cybersecurity research community to include more researchers who cross the boundaries between computer science ; engineering ; statistics ; mathematics; and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Goal 2: Accelerating Transition to Practice (TTP) Focus on transitioning to practice the research results that are ready for experimental deployment, early adoption, commercial innovation, or implementation in cyberinfrastructure through support of TTP projects. Support at least one experimental testbed to enable cybersecurity researchers to experiment in realistic environments. Goal 3: Education and Preparation of Cybersecurity Researchers and Professionals Support research and development in cybersecurity education to encourage and test innovative approaches for the preparation of cybersecurity professionals in formal and informal settings. This effort will include support for the development and assessment of learning modules and approaches fo r cybersecurity education that can be incorporated into existing computer science instruction ; quantitative and scientific literacy curricula; and science and engineering programs for undergraduate and graduate students (e.g. SfS) who will need basic under standings of cybersecurity relevant to their domains .

In FY 2013, the multi -agency Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative w as announced, with NSF as one of the lead participating agencies. Congress reaffirmed its support for NSF's continued investments in the BRAIN Initiative as part of the recent American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (PL 114- 329)1. Through several new programs and numerous core programs across the d irectorates, NSF will continue to support catalytic innovation in neuroscience as well as large- scale dissemination efforts to establish a national research infrastructure that will accelerate our understanding of brain function. There remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive understanding of the general principles underlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain's structural organization and dynamic act ivities, how brain, behavior, and environment interact , and how the brain can recover from lost functionality. The critical challenge to this comprehensive understanding is to integrate research and innovation across multiple scales of space and time, from molecular, physical (e.g., biophysical and biochemical), physiological, and genetic to cognitive and behavioral . The ultimate goal of such research is establish ment of integrative, quantitative, formal, computational, and predictive theories of brain stru cture , activity, and function. NSF is uniquely positioned to address this challenge and continue advancing research on understanding the brain by bringing together a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines to reveal the fundamental principles underlying brain structure and function. Since FY 2014, the UtB activity has consolidated NSF's ongoing activities in cognitive science, neurosci ence and the BRAIN Initiative. NSF has been instrumental in supporting transformative breakthroughs in brain r esearch and related technologies , such as optogenetics, the CLARITY brain preservation technique, and the first Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved artificial retina , which all began with NSF support. The co -mingling of NSF's d isciplinary and interdisciplinary fields is expected to foster new and convergent approaches to transform understanding of brain, cognition, behavior , and education approaches , through the development of new technologies , theories , and fundamental research . The UtB activity will continue through FY 2020. Goals The overall goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity and function of the brain in action and in context. This multi -year goal is being pursued across four ongoing priority areas: 1. Develop innovative neurotechnologies, new tools, experimental approaches, theories, and models to monitor and analyze brain activity and integrate neuroscience information across scales and scientific disciplines. 2. Identify the fundamental relationships among neura l architecture, activity, cognition, and behavior. 3. Transform our understanding of how the brain responds and adapts to changing environments and recovers from lost functionality. 4. Train a new generation of scientists, engineers, and educators for a transdisciplinary, globally competitive workforce in neuroscience and neuroengineering. FY 2018 Investments In FY 2018, NSF total investment in the UtB activity is $134.46 million. Within this amount, $70.52 million will support activities related to the BRAIN Initiative. NSF will maintain the UtB focus by continuing to 1 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (PL 114-329), SEC. 117.

Usin g existing mechanisms including targeted solicitations, workshops, Dear Colleague Letters (DCLs), Research Coordination Networks, and special mechanisms such as EAGERs and Ideas Labs, NSF will continue to bring together the relevant scientific co mmunities in biology, chemistry, behavior, cognition, computational and information science, education, engineering, physics, psychology, mathematics, and statistics to identify scientific priorities and needed research infrastructure, establish cross -disciplinary standards, integrate data and methods, and catalyze the development of conceptual and theoretical frameworks. As part of the BRAIN Initiative, NSF will continue to run three distinct programs : 1. Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS): a cross -directorate, cross -agency (both NSF and the National Institutes of Health), and multinational (Germany, France, and Israel) program that funds projects with the goal of providing a powerful modality for larger -scale interaction and collab orative discovery; 2. Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF -NCS): a program that supports research and innovation to enable large -scale aggregation, sharing, and open science driven by integrative neural and cognitive dis covery; and 3. Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience (NeuroNex) : a program that supports \"Neurotechnology Hubs\" and \"Theory Teams\" to develop and disseminate the newest technologies and theories, respectively, to neuroscience researchers most able to cap italize on them for advancing our understanding of brain function. Through these three programs and numerous other disciplinary and special programs across the directorates, NSF is implementing a phased approach for establishing a national research infrastructure for neuroscience . This is described in NSF's DCL \"National Brain Observatory: A Phased Approach for Developing a National Research Infrastructure for Neuroscience\" ( NSF 16 $172.75 - $134.46 BRAIN $76.53 - $70.52Understanding the Brain in Millions)Funding by Directorate 2 NSF.

By improving the quality and effectiveness of the education of undergraduates in all STEM fields, these investments enable NSF to lead progress nationally toward a diverse and innovative workforce and a STEM -literate public . As the National Science Board (NSB) has observed: \"The 'STEM workforce' is extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness. \" Furthermore, the NSB writes, \" Assessing, enabling, and strengthening wor kforce pathways is essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness .3\" Through the IUSE framework , which began in FY 2015 , NSF coordinates its investments in undergraduates and undergraduate STEM education to enhance coherence and impact and to use shared metrics and evaluation approaches where appropriate. These investment s address both general trends and specific disciplinary needs . Examples of general trends include the use of active learning ap proaches in undergraduate instruction,4 the increase of undergraduate research courses, and attention to undergraduate degree completion. Examples of disciplinary imperatives include the need to recruit more women and minorities into majors in computer sci ence, the importance of ensuring high- quality learning outcomes in introductory mathematics courses, the re -envisioning of introductory courses in the biological sciences in light of new research findings and theories, and the data science preparation of u ndergraduates in virtually all STEM disciplines. Moreover, new interdisciplinary challenges demand attention as automation and behavioral science \u2014augmented by big data \u2014revolutionize the workplace, the nature of work, and research practices. Key reports an d documents5,6 contain persuasive arguments that a high -quality undergraduate experience is vital to preparing a diverse professional STEM workforce equipped to lead innovation, to growing a larger pool of STEM -savvy workers capable of employing STEM skill s in business and industry, and to ensuring a STEM -literate public ready to support and benefit from the progress of science .

Improving Undergraduate STEM Education NSF-Wide Investments - 16 Goals NSF undergraduate investments map to one or more of the three IUSE goals: Improve STEM learning and learning environments . Improve the knowledge base for defining, identifying, and implementing innovative undergraduate STEM instruction (in all NSF -supported disciplines) that leads to improved student learning and fosters widespr ead use of evidence -based resources and pedagogies in undergraduate STEM education. Broaden participation and institutional capacity for STEM learning . Increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students recruited and retained in STEM fields and ca reer pathways by implementing evidence -based successful strategies to broaden participation and by growing that evidence base. Build the STEM workforce for tomorrow . Improve the preparation of undergraduate students so that they can succeed as productive m embers of the future STEM and STEM- capable workforce, regardless of career path, and be engaged as members of a STEM -literate society. Approach Six principles inform decision- making about strategic investments to achieve the three IUSE goals. Federal investment in undergraduate STEM education is critical to the development of the Nation's scientific workforce, and NSF has a leading role in this area. NSF investments in undergraduate education will be focused, strategic investments centered on addressin g the greatest challenges in U.S. undergraduate STEM education. The IUSE portfolio represents coordination among all NSF directorates, while respecting distinct disciplinary opportunities, challenges, and needs. IUSE is informed by input from multiple sour ces, including STEM disciplines and education research. Development and future growth of the IUSE portfolio will be based on demonstrated impact and effectiveness of NSF investments. The IUSE framework will eventually accommodate all NSF investments in und ergraduate education and will be aligned with agreed -upon, corresponding directorate goals.7 Investment Framework The IUSE framework uses findings from research and evaluation on STEM learning and education to address challenges common across undergraduat e STEM education, as well as within specific disciplines . NSF IUSE core investments also serve as test beds for continued building of evidence for improvement of undergraduate STEM education across a diversity of i nstitutional types . NSF IUSE- affiliated programs are positioned to connect to and benefit from the core activities . The framework draws upon a knowledge base accumulated from decades of research, development, and best practices in STEM undergraduate education. 8,9,10,11 New and ongoing investments within the IUSE portfolio will integrate theories and findings from education research , with attention to the needs and directions of frontier science and engineering research . This will generate n ew knowledge about learning , teaching, and implementation a nd how to improve the undergraduate preparation of a diverse STEM workforce. 7 All undergraduate programs have now been mapped to the framework and placed into two categories: 1) the IUSE core programs that were developed over the FY 2014- 16 period as part of the agency -wide initiative, and 2) affiliate programs that are aligned with the framework, both informing and being informed by the work across both program categories. All are connected by their commitment to the IUSE principles. 8 National Research Council. (2012).

Catalyze departmental and institutional transformation: This funding support s design and implementation of models for systemic improvement . Scholarship programs : Direct support to students to encourage entry and retention in STEM fields . Disciplinary research experiences for students : This funding engage s students in research . FY 2018 Investments A total of $ 96.5 million for IUSE is requested in FY 2018. The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) will explore allocating a portion of the IUSE: EHR budget to establish an IUSE Collaborative Opportunities Fund (ICOF). The fund will be used to incentivize cross- directorate collaboration to identify thematic areas of emphasis that target pressing challenges in undergraduate ST EM education either in specific disciplinary domains or in interdisciplinary areas of convergent research. Once such themes are identified, cross- directorate teams of program staff will issue calls for proposals under the IUSE: EHR umbrella program with al l aspects of proposal processing and decision- making managed by the cross- directorate teams and with funding from participating directorates. The ICOF mechanism will be available to use in all three pooled IUSE goals as appropriate. In FY 2018, $15.0 million is included for IUSE: Hispanic Serving Institutions (IUSE: HSI) , with funding provided through the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Division of Human Resource Development. The primary goals of the IUSE: HSI activity are to promote research on engaged student learning at HSIs, to incentivize institutional and community transformation, and to promote fundamental research about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, including research that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. These activities will address the N ation's need to make the STEM workforce more inclusive. Goal 1: Improve STEM learning and learning environments EHR will continue to develop i ndicators, metric s, and assessments to measure readiness for and progress toward widespread use of evidence -based resources in undergraduate STEM instruction. Program staff will seek to leverage any prior efforts f or gathering data on indicators as a part of IU SE monitoring and evaluation and will use findings to shape future cross -directorate collaborations that enlarge the core IUSE investment activities. In EHR , applied research aimed at enabling improvements in undergraduate education at scale will continue to be a priority . Existing core IUSE investments, e.g. Research Coordination Networks : Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN: UBE), will present opportunities to make further progress on particular challenges facing the undergraduate enterprise in those domains. Them es associated with the NSF Big Ideas will present opportunities to leverage the ICOF approach, particularly with respect to interdisciplinary efforts. 12 Op. cit., National Research Council .

Leadership of the NSF directorates, with input from a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU ) Coordinating Committee, will seek to build on prior discuss ions and expand the STEM research and experiential learning opportunities available to undergraduate students in NSF -funded large faci lities, national laboratories, and centers . The IUSE: GEOPATHS program will seek to expand its efforts to create a broader and more inclusive pathway into careers in the geosciences via research experiences for undergraduates featuring active involvement in field campaigns and at high- level facilities, such as ships, airplanes, and data centers, with employer input about needed skills . Here there is an opportunity to leverage current activities supported by the ATE program. Projects in the IUSE: EHR portfo lio will be encouraged to establish collaborations with the growing cohort of NSF INCLUDES ( Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science ) Design and Development Launch Pilots and the NSF INCLUDES Alliances as they are awarded, to amplify each other's impact. CISE will explore issuing a DCL or solicitation focused on knowledge generation and implementation of new strategies for undergraduate education in computer science, particularly in the face of growing enrollments and interest in computing as well as the growing support for curricular approaches that acknowledge the intersection of computer science and other disciplines, collectively referred to as \"CS+X,\" where \"X\" is a placeholde r for other disciplines .

It aims to develop a talented, innovative, and capable science and engineering workforce that reflects the diversity of our society. If the United States is to remain the world leader with respect to innovations and discoveries in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), it must identify and develop talent from all sectors of our society to become tomorrow's STEM professionals. Indeed, providing opportunities and support for members of all communities and sectors across the Nation is both necessary for the Nation's economic welfare and necessary as part of NSF's commitment to equity. NSF INCLUDES began in FY 2015 and is expected to run until FY 2025. The NSF INCLUDES program rests on principles of social innovation and the role of networks and organizational partnerships in enabling sustainable and scalable changes in systems and is bas ed on the approach of collective impact. 13 Some key tenets in the design of NSF INCLUDES include the following: Strategies that rely on alliances and networks that include community- based organizations, local education policy makers, foundations, not -for-profit organizations, and industry (not all of which have STEM as their primary focus); measurable outcomes; a commitment to making change at scale; Ongoing implementation research and evaluation to inform mid -course adjustments; On-ramps designed to involve other networks, alliances, and science and engineering organizations; and A national network supported by a backbone organization. Goals The long- term strategy of NSF INCLUDES is to fund new research, models, and partnerships that lead to measurable progress at the national level and to scale effective approaches to diversity and inclusion in STEM. This will be achieved, in part, by increasing coherence and leveraging synergies across the NSF portfolio. The multi -year goals and abbreviated objectives are: Goal 1 : Synthesize and build the research base for broadening participation in STEM and foster the spread and adaptation of proven effective practices. Goal 2 : Support the identification and development of a set of shared goals and objectives developed by stakeholders, including those from specific STEM disciplines. Goal 3 : Support local/regional, discipline -specific, and crosscutting multi -stakeholder partnerships and networks (INCLUDES Alliances) as well as an NSF INCLUDES National Network.14 FY 2018 Investments Funding levels in FY 2018 are expected to increase 6.1 percent over the FY 2016 Actuals to fund the NSF INCLUDES Alliances and support the development and expansion of the INCLUDES National Network and the continuation of on- ramping activities.

Today, emerging fields of S&E increasingly demand efforts across institutions, discip lines, and national boundaries and rest on the use of sophisticated data infrastructure, instruments, and networks of researchers. The growth of computationally intensive and data - enabled science is dramatically chang ing the knowledge and experience requir ed of researchers and other STEM professionals across fields. Thus, the preparation of graduate students in STEM must continue to evolve to provide a supply of scientists and engineers who not only meet the needs of the STEM enterprise but who also have th e knowledge, skills, and preparation to advance it and lead innovation in academia, the private sector, and government. Investing in discoverers \u2014that is, building through inclusive processes a diverse and talented next - generation of STEM research leaders and professionals across sectors \u2014is an important NSF investment focus. A major portion of NSF's overall investment in graduate education and graduate students supports research assistants funded through research grants. Goal The goal of NSF's investments in STEM graduate education and STEM graduate students is to prepare a diverse workforce with advanced research training that is equipped to transform the frontiers of S&E and to prepare professionals, through various levels and approaches to graduate education, to participate and innovate in STEM intensive careers in ongoing and emerging areas. NSF's graduate STEM investments will do the following : Support training in areas of national S&E priorities. Catalyze development of i nnovative models for graduate education with potential for scalability. Build the research knowledge base to inform improvements in graduate education. Promote professional development of graduate students for both academic and non- academic careers. Appro ach NSF's two major agency -wide programs in graduate education are th e Graduate Research Fellowship program (GRF) and the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program. The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) has administrative leadership respons ibility for both programs. Management of these programs is guided by NSF-wide working groups. Both programs contain design elements recommended in major national reports 15 as ways to better prepare graduates for a broad range of careers. GRF has identified and supported future outstanding basic STEM researchers since 1952. The program also provides opportunities for graduate students to gain research experience international ly and in federal agencies. GRF provides rich data that will be used for monitoring c areer outcomes longitudinally and will contribute to improving the understanding of STEM professional workforce development . There are several other programs at NSF that focus on the development of sectors of the STEM workforce, 15 American Chemical Society Presidential Commission (2012).

For example, the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (S fS) program, led by EHR, addresses government's need for a cybersecurity workforce as authorized by Public Law Number: 113- 274, establishing the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. In addition to scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students , the program supports the expansion of existing educational opportunities and resources in cybersecurity throug h research on the teaching and learning of cybersecurity. Collaborators include the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Personnel Management . The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (Noyce) provides fellowship support to members of the master teacher cohort at the graduate level and funds innovation and development in STEM teacher education approaches. In addition to GRF, NRT, SfS, and Noyce , the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation's Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP -BD) track, and NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM) support the successful entry and transition of underrepresented and underserved populations into STEM graduate education and into the STEM workforce. Taken together, this broad suite of programs contributes substantially to the NSF investment in graduate education of the STEM research and education workforce of the future. In FY 2018, NSF directorates will be engaged in considering how to extend the range of professional development opportunities for graduate students in the various disciplines served by NSF and are undertaking several pilot activities. EHR is pursuing collaborations with other directorates to establish additional partnerships with industry for internship opportunities to give graduate students the prof essional development needed to pursue successful career s in STEM and STEM -related occupations. The Division of Graduate Education ( DGE ) component of EHR's core research program will also emphasize research on the development of the STEM workforce . Invest ment Framework Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRF) The goal of GRF is to help build the U.S. STEM human capital necessary to ensure the Nation's leadership in advancing innovations in S&E . GRF selects, recognizes, and financially supports graduate s tudents with demonstrated high potential for excellence in STEM and in their chosen career s. Applications are welcome from students in all STEM disciplines supported by NSF and in STEM interdisciplinary areas , including STEM education . Fellows have opportunities for international research through Graduate Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) and federal internships through Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP). GRF noteworthy activities are as follows: Program innovation has focused on professional development initiatives such as GROW and GRIP. The plans for evaluating GROW started in FY 2017, and the plans for evaluating GRIP will begin in FY 2018. The pilot survey and initial data collection for longitudinal monitoring of career outcomes of GRF recipient s began in the first quarter of FY 2016. This activity is conducted in partnership among the EHR Evaluation Team, the NSF Evaluation and Assessment Capability, and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. This team will develop and pilot a GRF survey instrument and process that may be used as an ongoing longitudinal monitoring system to assess program outcomes. EHR will conduct outreach to undergraduate institutions and encourage undergraduates to apply to GRF. In FY 2018, the agency will continue initiatives begun in FY 2014 to enhance the capacity of minority -serving institutions to increase the number of students who successfully compete for GRF awards. The GRF and LSAMP programs have designed outreach activities to L SAMP institutions with significant cohorts of STEM students who are enrolled in or preparing for graduate training . DGE will pilot activities in FY 201 8 that promote professional development opportunities , preparing graduate students for careers in industr y. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 23 In 2018, GRF will continue to partner with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to provide outreach to students and faculty in EPSCoR jurisdictions , with a special focus on minority -serving institutions located in EPSCoR j urisdictions.

NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) The goals of NRT are to support highly effective training of STEM graduate students in interdisciplinary research areas of national priority as well as to create and promote new, in novative, effective, and scalable models for STEM graduate student training. The NRT program is distinguished from prior traineeship programs by its emphasis on training for multiple career pathways, rotating priority research themes, inclusion of both m asters and doctoral students, a broader definition of trainees, and greater budgetary and programmatic flexibility. NRT funds proposals to test, develop, and implement innovative and effective STEM graduate education models, to promote interdisciplinary an d broad professional training of graduate students, and to foster fundamental research advances in support of national priorities. NRT thus provides a mechanism for developing a knowledge base about the implementation and impact of innovative graduate trai neeship programs and graduate education policies. In FY 2015, the scope of the NRT program was expanded to add the Innovation in Graduate Education (IGE) Track. The IGE track is dedicated to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentia lly transformative approaches to graduate education, both disciplinary and interdisciplinary, to generate the knowledge required for their customization, implementation, and broader adoption. In FY 2018, the funding for IGE is $4.0 million. In FY 2018, NRT will support new STEM graduate education pilots and models in order to transform current practices in graduate education. Additionally, the NRT traineeship track will continue to solicit proposals in the NSF -wide priority research areas. In vestigator -initiated interdisciplinary -themed proposals outside the priority research themes will continue to be accepted.

CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SfS) The S fS program addresses cybersecurity education and workforce development through scholarships and building institutional capacity. The Scholarship Track provides funding to institutions for awarding scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in cybersecurity. The goal of the Capacity Track is to increase the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to effectively produce cybersecurity professionals. Of the total S fS budget, approximately half supports graduate program activities. In ret urn for their scholarships, tuition, fees, health insurance, travel, and book allowances, recipients work after graduation for a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization in a position related to cybersecurity for a period equal to the lengt h of the scholarship. FY 2018 activities will include increasing the number of Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites focused on cybersecurity emphasizing experience for first - and second- year undergraduate students, especially veterans, and perhaps ultimately enabling more students to enter cybersecurity fields at the graduate level .

Louis Stokes Alliance s for Minority Participation -Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP -BD) The LSAMP program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the number of students successfully completing high- quality degree programs in STEM disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experienc es in support of groups historically under - represented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 25 Established LSAMP alliances are eligible to apply for Brid ge to the Doctorate support. LSAMP -BD funding allows institutions to provide stipend support ($32,000 per year) along with cost of education allowance to the institution for tuition, health insurance, and other normal fees up to $10,500 per year for up to two years of post -baccalaureate study. A plan for formally connecting a significant number of newly matriculated LSAMP students, including master 's degree graduates, to doctoral degree programs is expected. LSAMP - BD projects are encouraged to partner with other NSF -funded programs, such as Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), NSF research centers, NRT, or AGEP. In FY 2018, LSAMP- BD will continue to collaborate with GRF on effective approaches to increase the diversity of the GRF applicant pool. NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S- STEM) The S -STEM program was established by NSF in accordance with the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277) as modified by P.L. 106- 313 and P.L. 108-447 in 2004. The Act reflects the national need to increase substantially the number of American scientists and engineers. In addition to the long -standing scholarship support, S -STEM projects contribute to the knowledge base of research in education by carrying out research on factors such as recruitment and retention of STEM students. S -STEM is funded through H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account receipts. The S -STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholars hips to encourage and enable academically talented U.S. students demonstrating financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in STEM fields. The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workfor ce. S -STEM provides individual scholarships of up to $10,000 per year, depending on financial need. See the H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Fees section in the EHR chapter for more information. Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) The Noyce program seeks to encourage talented STEM majors and professionals to become K -12 mathematics and science teachers. Through the Noyce NSF Teaching Fellowship track , funding is provided to support STEM professionals who enroll as NSF Teaching fellows i n master 's degree programs leading to teacher certification or licensing to teach a STEM discipline in an elementary or secondary school by providing academic courses, professional development, and salary supplements while they are fulfilling a four-year t eaching commitment in a high -need school district. The Noyce NSF Master Teaching Fellowship track provides support to experienced and exemplary K -12 STEM teachers, who are certified/licensed teachers that either possess a master's degree or have a bachelor 's degree and are enrolled in a master's degree program in their field . These fellows participate in mentoring and professional development activities to become highly effective master teachers and teacher leaders and are provided salary supplements while they fulfill a five -year teaching commitment in high -need school districts.

Description of Major Changes Centers for Analysis an d Synthesis - BIO The F Y 2018 Request of $6.0 million, $12.60 million below the FY 2016 Actual, will fund the National Socio -Environmental Synthesis Center (SESync) . This center underwent external review in FY 2016 and was granted a five- year renewal award that started in FY 2016 and will continue through FY 2020. SESync uses synthetic approaches and provides computational support and training to enable interdisciplina ry research teams, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, to advance the frontiers of scientific understanding of environmental complexity, and to address pressing societal challenges. The ten -year center awards for CyVerse (formerly the Plant Scien ce Cyberinfrastructure Collaborative, or iPlant) and the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) are sunsetting as planned in FY 2017. Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) - MPS The CCI p rogram explores major, long- term research challenges, producing transformative research that leads to innovation and attracts broad scientific and public interest. Centers often partner with industry, government laboratories, and international organizations to address energy production and storage, sustainable production of commercial chemicals such as polymers and nanomaterials, and complex single- molecule measurements at unprecedented time and spatial resolution. The CCI p rogram makes awards at two levels: smaller Phase I (three- year awards) for center development, and larger Phase II for full centers (five- year awards with the potential for renewal for up to a total of ten years). Phase I awards are considered part of CHE's core research program investments as they fall under FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 27 the fundi ng threshold for formal NSF center awards. In FY 2018, the CCI program ( -$6.50 million to a total of $21.60 million) is expected to fund six Phase II Centers (two centers have sunset since FY 2016). These six Phase II CCIs will be supported at a reduced le vel relative to the standard center award of $4.0 million per year. NASA is expected to provide co- funding support through an ongoing interagency agreement. In FY 2018, CCI Solar - An NSF Center for Innovation in Solar Fuels will sunset as expected. The Chemistry at the Space- Time Limit (CaSTL) Center will be in its 5th year and under consideration for renewal. The other five centers will continue in Phase II status. An external program evaluation for the CCI program is expected to begin in FY 2018 and be completed by FY 2019. Engineering Research Centers (ERC) - ENG NSF's ERCs enable innovation, bridging the energy and intellectual curiosity of university research focused on discovery with real -world engineered systems and technology opportunities throug h partnerships with industry. These centers also are successful in educating a technology -enabled workforce with hands -on real-world experience. ERCs can be funded for up to ten years if they clear a fifth -year renewal review. This midpoint review will determine if they are: structured effectively to meet program goals ; delivering effectively; making an impact; and tackling challenging tasks to warrant further support. The ERC program periodically commissions program -level evaluations by external evaluator s to determine the effectiveness of ERC graduates in industry, the benefits of ERC membership to industry and others. In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) , in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) , to study The Future of Center -Based, Multidis ciplinary Engineering Research. This topic a rose from discussions NAE held with the NRC on the future of NSF 's center -based, multidisciplinary engineering research. The pr oject includes a study to articulate a vision for the future of NSF-supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research . A report is expected to be delivered at the end of April 2017. At the FY 2018 Request level, 1 4 ERCs will be funded at $ 57.50 million ( +$1.11 million to a total of $57.50 million ). The program requires an increased investment to support planned growth of the Class of 2015 and Class of 2017 ERCs. Funding and numbers of c enters include four Nanoscale ERCs, three from the class of FY 2012 and one from the class of FY 2015. Materia ls Centers - MPS Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC ) advance materials research and provide students with an interdisciplinary education. These centers address fundamental grand challenge research problems of intellectual and strategic importance of a complexity requiring collaboration among several disciplines. As evidenced in the number of patents and start -up companies generated, MRSECs advance U.S. competitiveness and innovation and are key in the development of new technologies. The MRSEC program continues to support the Materials Research Facilities Network (MRFN), which links the instrumentation and subject matter expertise of MRSECs to the larger materials community as well as enco urages MRSEC -to-MRSEC collaborations. The MRSEC program also continues to support the interaction of MRSEC Education Coordinators with the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources/Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (EHR/DRL) to formulate methodologies for standardizing outreach and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program assessment and evaluation. The MRSECs, through a center -wide activity, support over 230 REU students each year. Finally, MRSECs interac t with minority serving institutions through the Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program. Currently, there are 12 active PREM awards at NSF, all of which NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 28 are connected to MRSECs. MRSECs are encouraged to develop initiatives and/o r educational programs to broaden participation. The FY 2018 Request (-$540,000 to a total of $55.0 million) represents a very small reduction in the program and will support approximately 20 MRSECs . MRSEC competitions are held every three years. Twelve centers were awarded as the result of the la st competi tion in FY 2014. In the next MRSEC competition in FY 2017, nine current centers are expected to re -compete along with about 80 new applicants. Awards are typically $1.60 million to $3.60 million per yea r, depending on the number of interdisciplinary research groups in a center. Science and Technology Centers : Integrative Partnerships (STC ) - multi -directorate The Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (STC) program advances interdisciplinary discovery and innovation in science and engineering through the integration of cutting -edge research, excellence in education, targeted knowledge transfer, and the development of a diverse workforce. The STC portfolio reflects NSF -support ed disciplines. Examples of investments include: understanding the brain; engineering of biological systems ; energy -efficient electronics; new ways of handling the extraction, manipulation, and exchange of information; new nano- atomic scale imaging modalit ies, and new materials for optical and electronic applications. STCs engage the Nation's intellectual talent and collaborate with partners in academia, industry, national laboratories, and government. STCs strengthen the caliber of the Nation's science, te chnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through intellectually challenging research experiences for students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators and advance public scientific understanding through partnerships with K -12 and informal education communities. The FY 2018 Request of $60.90 million ( +$15.82 million to a total of $45.08 million) will support twelve STCs and the administrative costs ($900,000) associated with management and oversight of the program. All are continuing awards from the FY 2010, FY 2013, and FY 2016 cohorts. Awards are for five years, with possible renewal for an additional five years, or 10 years total. Award sizes are typically $4.0 million to $5.0 million per year.

Funding for CAREER is provided by BIO, the Directorates for Computer and Information Science Engineering (CISE), Engineering (ENG), GEO, MPS, and SBE. Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) INSPIRE was established to address some of the most complex and pressing scientific problems that lie at the intersections of traditional disciplines and to advance the NSF's strategic goal to Transform the Frontiers of Science and Engineering. In FY 2016, NSF determined that dedicated funding is not necessary to encourage the kinds of projects supported through INSPIRE. In FY 2017, a new funding mechanism encompassing elements of INSPIRE was developed, Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Research and Engineering (RAISE). In FY 2018, Office of Integrative Activi ties co-funding is eliminated and each directorate will support bold, potentially transformative interdisciplinary research through the RAISE mechanism, coordinating with other directorates as appropriate. Long -Term Ecological Research (LTER) The FY 2018 Request provides $29.42 million for LTER; this is $1.20 million below the FY 2016 Actual. LTER supports fundamental ecological research that requires data collection over long time periods and often at large spatial scales. This program supports a loosely coordinated network of 28 field sites that focus on: (1) understanding ecological phenomena that occur over long temporal and broad spatial scales; (2) creating a legacy of well -designed, long- term ecological experiments; (3) conducting major syntheses and theoretical efforts; and (4) providing information to identify and to address environmental challenges. LTER projects represent a diversity of habitats in continental North America, the Caribbean, Pacific Ocean, Arctic, and the Antarctic; including coral reefs, arid grasslands, estuaries, lakes, prairies, forests, alpine and Arctic tundra, urban areas, and agroecosystems. The support for LTER in FY 2018 will be used to sustain site-specific research activities examining ecological and evolutionary change in populations and communities that have been studied for over 30 years, and conducting syntheses of long -term data using contemporary modeling methods. Funding for LTER is provided by BIO, GEO, and SBE. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) infrastructure will be co -located at eight LTER sites. NEON is a continental -scale infrastructure facility providing standardized physical and data resources to researchers and educators. LTER is a network of long -term research projects aimed at understand ing Selected Crosscutting Programs NSF-Wide Investments - 32 ecological processes in a wide range of ecosystems. Ongoing research at LTER sites may take advantage of data generated using NEON infrastructure. In addition, the co- location of NEON infrastructure at LTER sites will stimulate new research that builds on the long history of LTER research by enhancing the ability to extend site -based knowledge to regional and continental scales. For more information on NEON, see the NEON narrative in the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction chapter. Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) In FY 2018, $74.71 million in funding is requested for the REU Sites and Supplements program, a decrease of $23.01 million below the FY 2016 Actual .

NSF 's global change -related programs support the research and related activities to advance fundamental understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and human systems and the interactions among them. NSF's existing programs encourage interdisciplinary approaches to studying Earth system processes and the consequences of change, including how humans respond to changing environments and the impacts on ecosystems and the essential services they provide. The Foundation's programs promote the development and enhancement of models to improve understanding of integrated Earth system processes and to advance predictive cap ability. NSF supports fundamental research on the processes used by organizations and decision makers to identify and evaluate policies for mitigation, adaptation, and other responses to the challenge of a changing and variable environment , as well as the antecedents of and consequences for human behavior . Long- term, continuous, and consistent observational records are essential for testing hypotheses quantitatively and are thus a cornerstone of global change research. NSF supports a variety of research observing networks that complement, and are dependent on, the climate monitoring systems maintained by its federal partners . FY 201 8 Areas of Emphasis NSF funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program ( USGCRP ) in the FY 2018 Request is $264.13 million . NSF's investments will continue to support research that contributes to the USGCRP Goal Areas to 1) Advance Science and 2) Inform Decisions. In FY 2018, NSF will continue to engage with other USGCRP agencies on priorities f rom intra-seasonal to centennia l predictability, predictions, and projections; water cycle research; understanding the impacts of global change on the Arctic region and effects on global climate; and fundamental research on actionable science. In addition, NSF will further seek the grea ter integration of social- science research, methodologies , and insights into understanding and supporting responses to global change, improving computing capacity, and maintaining needed observational capabilities over time. The major USGCRP foci for NSF i nclude: Goal 1: Advance scientific knowledge of the integrated natural and human components of the Earth system Earth System Understanding: Improving our knowledge of Earth's past and present climate variability and change through Multidisciplinary Earth and Human System Understanding \u2014NSF participates in the Earth System Understanding objective through activities to document and understand long- term climate cycles across the globe, as well as to better understand the natural variability of climate and the processes responsible for global changes using a range of paleoclimate and instrumental data and modeling approaches . NSF also supports activities to improve our understanding of the frequency and intensity of FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 43 extreme climate events, particularly wet and d ry extremes of the water cycle, their causes, and how those may be manifested in the future. Upgrading and expanding critical environmental observing systems are vital to these efforts. NSF also supports Earth System Understanding through activities spanning a broad range of disciplines and topics that seek to better understand the physical, geological, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system and their interactions. Examples of major foci include fundamental research on all aspects of the carbon cycle, the water cycle, atmospheric composition and greenhouse gas processes, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and ocean and atmospheric circulations that both drive and respond to climate and global change. Human drivers of change incl ude urbanization, population growth, and economic and technological development over a range of temporal scales. NSF has a strong commitment to fostering new interdisciplinary research approaches that allow exploration of the interdependencies across these areas . Integrated Observations and Integrated Modeling: Improving our capability to model and predict future conditions and impacts \u2014NSF contributes to the Integrated Observations and Modeling objectives through its advance d capabilities to observe the p hysical, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system over multiple space and time scales. Facilities such as the Academic Research Fleet and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) assist the Nation in gaining a fundamental sc ientific understanding of the Earth as well as monitor important variations and trends that allow the research community to examine major feedback processes between the climate and natural and human systems. Since there is increasingly deep interplay among observations and modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales, a h igh priority will be given to developing more complete representations - models of coupled interactive atmospheric chemistry, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, and middle atmospheric processes. NSF will continue to devote significant resources to advancing climate modeling capabilities from global and centennial to regional and decadal scales. In addition, NSF is encouraging the development of ecosystem and water models at regional scales, as well as models that integrate human system components such as risk, vulnerability, and decision -making. Goal 2. Inform Decisions: Provide the scientific basis to inform and enable timely decisions on adaptation and mitigati on Inform Adaptation and Mitigation: Assessing the Nation's vulnerability to current and anticipated impacts of global change through the Science of Adaptation and Science to Information Adaptation Decisions \u2014A key focus of the USGCRP is devel oping better m eans of assessing and responding to the impacts of global change as well as the vulnerability and resilience of both human and natural systems to those changes, particularly in highly sensitive regions such as the Arctic. NSF supports the Inform Adaptation and Mitigation objectives through research contributing to s cience of a daptation and s cience to inform adaptation decisions . NSF will support fundamental research regarding the science of adaptation, defined as the adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects. This research ranges fro m developing the theoretical framework for evaluating adaptation options (and avoiding unintended consequences of adaptation choices) to risk assessment and decision making. NSF will continue interdisciplinary research (including human factors) in water su stainability, resiliency, biodiversity, ocean acidification, and vulnerable areas, particularly in the rapidly changing Arctic.

Information about NSF's performance can also be found on the NSF site i n the FY 2016 Annual Performance Report (APR), and the Performance and Financial Highlights Report.1 The FY 2018 Budget Request highlights NSF's priorities for crosscutting investments and organizational efficiencies. NSF's FY 2018 APP underscores the agency's overall priorities through continued strategic monitoring of key program, infrastructure, and management investments. Together with NSF's longstanding performance goal to make timely award decisions, these performance goals provide the foundation of NSF's annual performance assessments. The FY 2018 APP also includes newer goals that focus on improving the quality of the reviews written by outside reviewers and fostering an inclusive culture within the agency. Strategic Plan and Strategic Objective s Investing in Science, Engineering, and Education for the Nation's Future: NSF Strategic Plan for 2014 - 2018 1 lays out two strategic goals that embody the dual nature of NSF's mission to advance the progress of science while benefitting the n ation : Trans form the Frontiers of Science and Engineering, and Stimulate Innovation and Address Societal Needs through Research and Education. A third goal, Excel as a Federal Science Agency, directs NSF to hold itself accountable for achieving excellence in carrying out its mission . This goal structure enables NSF to link its investments to longer -term outcomes. NSF is in the process of developing a new Strategic Plan to begin in FY 2018. 1 www.nsf.gov/about/performance Performance - 4 FY 2016 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE PROGRESS UPDATES In FY 2016, the National Science Foundation conducted Strategic Reviews (SRs) of the seven Strategic Objectives in its 2014- 2018 Strategic Plan, in response to the requirement of the GPRA Modernization Act 2010 Section 1116(f). This table summarizes the analyses performed and the outcomes to date of each SR. The table also provides NSF's determination as to whether performance towards an Objective is making noteworthy progress, should pursue focused improvement , or neither . Strategic Objective and Ranking Summary of Strategic Review Analysis Strategic Review Outcomes Strategic Goal 1 Objective 1 Invest in fundamental research to ensure significant continuing advances across NSF science, engineering, and education. Not Ranked Focus area: The Science of Broadening participation. The Strategic Review investigated NSF's investment in the science of broadening participation (SBP), defined as fundamental social science and education research to identify and understand the factors that foster or hinder participation, retention, and success of members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. SBP can help NSF enhance its investment in programs and activities that focus on building the capacity of the scientific workforce. The SR identified the following action as follow -up: \"Investigate efficient and effective means for synthesizing the results of SBP research, disseminating that knowledge, and utilizing it to improve the effectiveness of research and education programs.\" Discussions on how to implement this recommendation began in FY 2016. Strategic Goal 1 Objective 2 Integrate education and research to produce a diverse STEM workforce with cutting -edge capabilities. Ranked as Noteworthy Progress Focus area: Graduate Education. The Strategic Review examined how NSF can improve measurement of its investments in graduate education in light of current trends in the diversity of career pathways of STEM graduate students. The SR identified two follow -up actions: Change the term for graduate students supporte d on grants from \"research assistant\" to \"research trainee\" as a mechanism to reinforce strateg ic and educational objectives. Encourage NCSES to consider whether to revise the NSF/NIH Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering to collect data on masters versus doctoral students separately. A suggestion to consider the impacts of the first recommendation was added to the Strategic Framework for Investments in Graduate Education , FY 2016- FY 2020. The second recommendation was completed in FY 2016. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 5 Strategic Goal 1 Objective 3 Provide world- class research infrastructure to enable major scientific advances. Ranked as a Focus Area for Improvement Strategic Goal 3 Objective 1 Build an increasingly diverse, engaged, and high-performing workforce by fostering excellence in recruitment, training, leadership, and management in human capital. Not Ranked Strategic Goal 3 Objective 2 Use effective methods and innovative solutions to achieve excellence in accomplishing the agency's mission. Not Ranked Focus area: Human Resources and Business Practices in the Oversight of Facilities. The combined Strategic Review of three of NSF's Objectives focused on human resource and business practices pertaining to the NSF staff responsible for oversight of major facilities. The SR identified a number of follow -up actions. Work to implement all of them began in FY 2016: The Large Facilities Working Group will identify a minimum set of competencies needed by NSF staff responsible for the oversight of major facilities . Directorates will ensure Position Descriptions and Individual Development Plans (IDPs) are up to date when staff are assigned to a given facilit y. The Large Facilities P rogram Officer (PO) Forum will incorporate opportunities for facilities programs to present lessons learned or best practices that work within NSF culture . The Large Facilities Offi ce will explore options for improving informal knowledge transfer across organizational units. NSF should seek opportunities to partner with other agencies (e.g. take NASA, DOE courses) and consider developing NSF - specific training where c ost- effective. LearnNSF should be modified to better capture informal learning activities . Strategic Goal 2 Objective 1 Strengthen the links between foundational research and societal needs through investments and partnerships. Not Ranked Objective 2 Build the capacity of the Nation to address societal challenges using a suite of formal, informal, and broadly available STEM educational mechanisms. Not Ranked Focus area: The Broader Impacts (BI) criterion of NSF's merit review process. The combined Strategic Review inves tigated the broader impacts (BI) criterion of NSF's merit review process (the other criterion is intellectual merit). Defined as, \"the potential for the proposed activity to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes ,\" the BI criterion is the mechanism through which the merit review process communicates the importance of societal benefit to its potential awardees. The SR recommended that NSF \"Provide standard training on BI to program directors, panel reviewers, and COVs.\" This recommendation is being implemented. A video orientation to the review process, including a segment explaining the BI criterion, was developed in FY 2016 and is available to all program officers and panelists. The BI segment is also available to COVs. Performance - 6 FY 2018 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN NSF's FY 2018 Annual Performance Plan reflects NSF's priorities as identified through its planning and budget process. The table below provides a summary of NSF's performance goals for FY 2018. The remaining pages of this section provide a detailed description of each goal along with the proposed target measures, milestones, or deliverables. Performance Goal Lead Organization Goal Statement 1 Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track BFA Ensure that key FY 2018 NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. 2 Ensure that Infrastructure Investments are on Track BFA Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. 3 Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions OIRM Use evidence- based reviews to guide management investments. 4 Make Timely Award Decisions OIA/OD and BFA Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding in a timely manner. 5 Improve Review Quality OIA/OD Improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. 6 Foster a Culture of Inclusion ODI/OD Foster a culture of inclusion through change management efforts resulting in change leadership and accountability. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 7 Goal 1: Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track Goal Statement Ensure that key FY 2018 NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 1. Monitor the progress of the following NSF -wide investments using a common set of milestones and indicators: NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, Risk and Resilience, and UtB. 2. Review the results with senior leaders quarterly in data -driven performance reviews. Description Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in the NSF - Wide Investments chapter of its Budget Request to Congress. Although the overall impact of these investments will not be realized for many years, tracking near-term indicators of implementation and progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections. Key investments will be strategically monitored using a set of common metrics. These may include: Contextual indicators, such as the investment's funding level. Input indicators, such as date of release of solicitation, number of proposals received, numbers of reviews conducted. Output indicators, such as number of awards, average and total amounts awarded, and funding rate. Medium -term output and outcome indicators that gauge whether funded projects are on track. Activity -specific outcome indicators, e.g., those relating to programmatic long term goals. Progress will be assessed quar terly and discussed at quarterly review meetings with leadership. Trend Information This has been a goal since FY 2014. The list of monitored programs is subject to change each year based on investment priorities for a particular year. Lead Organization/s Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management FY 2018 Annual Performance Plan Performance - 8 Goal 2: Ensure that Infrastructure Investments are on Track Goal Statement Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Construction Project Monitoring: For all Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction ( MREFC) projects under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. Description NSF monitors the performance of projects funded by the MREFC account by monitoring cost and schedule, a standard measure of performa nce for construction projects. Projects that are under 10 percent complete are not considered eligible for this goal because Earned Value Management ( EVM ) data are statistically le ss meaningful in early stages. The final Q4 EVM results are used to determine whether NSF has met this goal. Trend Information Lead Organization/s Large Facilities Office, Office of Budget, Finance, and Award 83% 2018FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 9 Goal 3: Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions Goal Statement Use evidence -based reviews to guide management investments. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable PortfolioStat: 1. NSF's information technology governance boards will evaluate and prioritize proposed investments for FY 2019. 2. NSF's information technology governance boards will maintain a \"green status\" with investments o n the Federal IT Dashboard for cost and schedule attributes (within 10 percent of target) associated with major IT investments. HRStat: NSF will develop metrics and targets to monitor the progress of three initiatives relating to NSF's new Strategic Plan, new OPM or Administration initiatives, and/or NSF's Headquarters relocation. Description This goal captures NSF's commitment to two government -wide accountability processes, PortfolioStat and HRStat, which aim to ensure that decisions regarding res ource investments are made through formal processes using evidence that involve decision makers from across the agency. Data regarding business need, cost, and risk -analysis will be provided. This data -driven approach to decision making promotes transparency and accountability. As directed in OMB M -12-10, \"Implementing PortfolioStat\", NSF has employed this tool to assess the maturity of its IT portfolio management process, make decisions on eliminating duplication, augment current capital planning and investment control processes, and move to shared solutions in order to maximize the return on IT investments across the portfolio. NSF will build upon its experience with HRStat, incorporate lessons learned from the development of its human capital dashboard, and continue to update and refine its evidence- based review process, as it establishes indicators and methods to measure human capital management initiatives aligned with the goals set out in the NSF Strategic Plan. Trend Information Monitoring the IT investment portfolio and the implementation of HR Stat has been a performance goal since FY 2014. Lead Organization/s Offices of the Chief Information Officer and the Chief Human Capital Officer, Office of Information and Resource Management FY 2018 Annual Performance Plan Performance - 10 Goal 4: Make Timely Award Decisions Goal Statement Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 182 days, or six months of deadline, target, or receipt date, whichever is later. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 75 percent. Description Time -to-decision or \"dwell time\" is the amount of time that passes between receipt of a proposal and notification to the principal investigat or about the funding decision. An important issue raised in customer satisfaction surveys is the time it takes NSF to process proposals. Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding process, but too short a time period may weaken the merit review process by forcing premature decisions . The optimal dwell time depends on a number of factors including the complexity of the proposed activity, the need for co- review by more than one panel, the need for site review, infrastructure requirements of the proposed activity, and the potential size of the award. Large, complex proposals require more time under review to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested wisely. Trend Information NSF has tracked six month dwell time as a per formance goal for over a decade and has consistently met a t arget of 70 percent. In FY 2015, the six month target was increased to 75 percent. Lead Organization/s Office of Integrative Activities, Office of the Director Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management 2012- 2018FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 11 Goal 5: Improve Review Quality Goal Statement Improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable By September 30, 2018, 1. 50 NSF programs will have held orientation sessions that include \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 5000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. Description This goal addresses feedback from a 2015 survey of people submitting proposals to NSF and those who review proposals. Survey respondents identified the quality of reviews as an important factor in improving their proposals and fostering science (see chart below). This goal also follows -through on analysis and input from other NSF planning activities: first, a strategic review in FY 2015 recommended that NSF use what was learned from the survey to inform a new performance goal aimed at improving customer ser vice; second, Committees of Visitors (COVs), program officers, and principal investigators have frequently noted that the quality of individual written reviews were variable. In the survey, proposers were asked \"which of the following factors will have t he most significant effect in fostering science?\" The following chart shows the percentage of responses for each factor from 22,714 respondents. The centerpiece of this goal is a pilot program, initiated in December 2016, to improve the quality of wri tten reviews of NSF proposals. The pilot program encourages NSF programs to use early reviewer orientation via webinar to provide reviewers with information on how to write more effective reviews, along with instructions on conflicts of interest and other specific information about the program or solicitation. The webinar helps reviewers understand the review criteria and gives them an opportunity to ask questions they may have about the application of those criteria. The intention is to make written review s more useful to both principal investigators and NSF program staff. Outputs from the pilot program that NSF will track in FY 2018 include the number of NSF programs that adopt the webinar orientation sessions and the number of reviewers who have t 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% and responsiveness to, proposals by NSF staffQuality of feedback to PIs in the form of reviewers' comments and panel summariesQuality of PI conversations with, and written comments from, program officersQuality of information available during proposal submissionQuality of the review process from the perspective of a reviewerFY 2018 Annual Performance Plan Performance - 12 Trend Information This is a new performance goal in FY 2018. Proposer surveys conducted in 2007 and 2015 informed this pilot. The chart below shows the average proposer perceptions of feedback receiv ed on NSF proposals. In FY 2019 NSF antic ipates tracking the impact of the pilot program by surveying proposers again to learn whether the perceived quality of reviews increases. Note that the anticipated survey will take upwards of a year to field and analyze following the pilot program.

Indicator and Target Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable 1. By September 30, 2018, ODI will conduct the new IQ process with four organizational units. 2. Improve the four NSF organizational units' New IQ Self -Survey Scores by five percent above established baseline. Description Fostering inclusive work environments and realizing the full potential of the workforce's diversity requires agencies to employ effective management practices. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs, developed the New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) in FY 2013 to drive inclusive intelligence in the federal workplace. Inclusive intelligence is the intentional, deliberate, an d proactive acts that increase work group intelligence by ensuring people feel they belong and are uniquely valued. The New IQ consists of 20 questions identified through a rigorous factor analysis trial of the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) ques tions with the highest correlation to inclusive environments. The questions are grouped into five habits of inclusion, F.O.C.S.E (Fair, Open, Cooperative, Supportive, Empowering). OPM's Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) developed a process to supplement use of the New IQ. The process uses a set of change management tools that equip agencies with instruments and practices necessary to support diversity and inclusion more fully. The 90- day process is designed to help leaders strengthen their workplace teams to their fullest potential by leveraging unique experiences, perspectives, and viewpoints of all members of the team. A self -survey is conducted at the beginning of the ninety -day process to establish a baseline and then again at the end of the proce ss. The expected outcome of the process is that the leaders will improve the employee engagement levels of their employees, resulting in an increase in the overall New IQ scores and corresponding FEVS scores over time. The New IQ Contagious Change Framew ork begins with training a small number of people in a set of behaviors, with the expectation that when spread throughout the organization these behaviors will result in sustainable change. NSF has realized slippage in the FEVS inclusion- related results ov er several years and recognizes that having a workforce comprised of a mix of permanent and temporary rotator staff requires specific targeted efforts to ensure that behaviors are learned, practiced, and developed into habits of inclusiveness. In addition, NSF's workforce is challenged on another inclusion front with the administrative and scientific staffs' feelings about uniqueness and belongingness. NSF anticipates that implementing the New IQ process in several of NSF's organizational units will initiate a set of behavior changes that can become contagious habits of inclusion throughout the Foundation. Goal 6 : Foster a Culture of Inclusion FY 2018 Annual Performance Plan Performance - 14 Description, continued NSF ODI will implement the New IQ process in an organizational component in six steps: 1) Meet with the leadership team, prov ide an overview of the New IQ process, and set up their New IQ survey; 2) Meet with leadership team, review respective New IQ scores, identify implementation dates and identify potential change agents; 3) Conduct change agent training with 10 to 20 selected participants; 4) Conduct 4 hour New IQ workshop for the organization's participants; 5) Conduct regular checkups over 6 weeks with workshop participants; and 6) Conduct 90 minute action planning se minar to review participant action plan and make modifications to ensure success. Trend Information NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversi ty and inclusion since FY 2011. Focusing spec ifically on inclusion represented a new direction for this goal in FY 2016 to reflect the priorities of current leaders at NSF and those of the federal and private sectors in general. Lead Organization/s Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Office of the Director Performance - 15 FY 2016 MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE PROGRESS REPORT This section provides NSF's progress report highlighting the significant actions taken in FY 2016 on the management challenges identified by NSF's Inspector General at the beginning of that fiscal year. Establis hing Accountability over Large Cooperative Agreements Lead Official: Branch Chief, Cooperative Support Branch , Division of Acquisitions and Cooperative Support , Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA) NSF Management Overview The Office of Inspector General (OIG) challenge relates to NSF's oversight of large facilities construction awards. The Foundation currently utilizes end- to-end oversight policies and procedures to ensure adequate stewardship over federal funds for both construction and operations. These activities are carried out starting with the day -to-day oversight of the Science and Engineering Directorates and the Office of Budget Finance and Award Management (BFA) and extend through the decisional and governing responsibilities of the Office of the Director (O/D) and the National Science Board (NSB). The Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction (MREFC) Panel provides additional oversight of the design stage, which includes readiness for advancement and estab lishing the performance baseline for construction. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office (LFO) develops policies and procedures related to large facilities, provides assistance to the program offices, and assures that policies, procedures, and good pract ices are being followed. Other BFA assurance units include the Cooperative Support Branch within the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS/CSB) and the Division of Institution and Award Support's Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Branch (D IAS/CAAR) which supports cost analysis, award and post - award monitoring. NSF has been continuously enhancing its pre -award and post -award oversight of large facilities cooperative agreements since June 2014. These enhancements are documented in the latest revision of the Large Facilities Manual (LFM) and internal Standard Operating Guidance (SOG). The December 2015 report of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) supported NSF's use of cooperative agreements. However, the report also noted that NSF should equally emphasize increased internal management of the business practices critical to the enhanced oversight and project success in order to bring them into equal balance with the science and technical aspects of the project. NSF agrees with the spirit of all of the NAPA recommendations and plans to accommodate them in some form. One key step forward is that in March 2016, NSF completed the process for selecting a new managing organization for the NEON project, Battelle Memorial Institut e. The turnaround of the NEON project reflects NSF's quick action to restore confidence in the oversight of the project and to ensure sound financial and technical oversight in bringing the construction portion of the project to completion. Challenge 1 Establish accountability for the billions of federal funds in NSF's large cooperative agreements at the pre - and post -award stages and throughout the lifecycle of projects, and validate that the strengthened policies are implemented and working. Progress m ade in FY 2016 Implemented NAPA Recommendation 6.5: Hiring of two additional full -time equivalent (FTE) staff in LFO and making the LFO Head, a voting member on the MREFC Panel. Formed a Business and Operations Advisory Committee (BOAC) subcommittee on NA PA implementation. Specifically, the subcommittee is charged with providing options for appropriate agency -wide oversight for the NSF O/D by among other things, addressing two NAPA recommendations (Recommendations 6.2 and 6.4) dealing with: 1) the need for the NSF Director to have access to independent advice to serve as a sounding board for objective insight on large research FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 16 projects; and 2) a potential re- scoping of the role, duties, and membership of the MREFC Panel to include status update reviews of p rojects in the development and construction phases focusing on cost, schedule, and performance. Conducted a workshop with NSB to clarify roles and responsibilities with regard to large facilities oversight to address NAPA Recommendation 6.1 & 6.6: Clarifyi ng oversight roles and use of annual NSF Facilities Plan, respectively. Implemented v1.0 of the NSB Facilities Portal as possible replacement to NSF Facilities Plan. Developed a certification, training, and core competency implementation plan for NSF staff engaged in large facilities oversight as part of the FY 2016 NSF Strategic Objective Review to address NAPA Recommendation 6.7: Project Management skill requirements. Drafted the joint LFO -DACS/CSB narrative for internal controls testing of enhanced polic ies and procedures related to large facilities oversight. Implemented appropriate/applicable enhanced oversight mechanisms currently used for construction awards on operational awards. Conducted Earned Value Management System (EVMS) verification/validation of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project. Future Implementation Milestones Develop and implement new SOG for conducting NSF EVMS verification/validation reviews. Develop new SOG on stage -gate and construction reviews t o address NAPA Recommendation 6.3: Financial and project management expertise on panels. Develop new SOG on training, certification, and core competencies for NSF staff engaged in large facilities oversight. Complete EVMS verification/validation on Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) and Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) projects. Work with BFA's Division of Financial Management (DFM) under the Process Improvement Plan for the FY 2015 financial statement audit to test and evaluate new narrative and supporting procedures in accordance with OMB Circular, No A -123, \"Management's Responsibility for Internal Control.\" Challenge 2 Ensure that costs proposed for and incurred under its large facility projects, such as LSST and NEON, are fair and reasonable, and that the agency's cost surveillance practices are sufficient to identify: unallowable or unreasonable expenditures, funds spent for awards other than those for which they were provided, or potential cost overruns. Progress made in FY 2016 Implemented NAPA Recommendation 3.1: Exceptions to Cost Analysis (revisions to BFA SOG 2016-4). Implemented NAPA Recommendation 4.1: Retain control over a portion of budget contingency (BFA SOG 2016- 2). Implemented NAPA Recommendation 4.2: Require Recipien t use of U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) cost estimating and scheduling guides (LFM Section 4.2). Conducted detailed analysis on use of management fee to address NAPA Recommendation 4.3: Elimination of management fee. Implemented contract mechanisms to support independent cost estimate reviews (per GAO) for construction and operations.

Develop and implement new SOG for selection of appropriate independent cost estimate review in accordance with the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 18 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Improper Payments Lead Official: Division Director, Division of Financial Management , BFA NSF Management Overview In June 2015, the NSF OIG issued an audit report that found NSF non- compliant with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) for FY 2014. The OIG specified that NSF did not address all of the required OMB Circular A -123 Appendix C improper payment risk factors and that the quantitative portions of the risk assessment did not maintain statisti cal validity. The OIG recommended that NSF conduct a statistically valid sampling process in order to estimate an improper payments rate. NSF did not believe it was non -compliant with IPERA for FY 2014; nor did NSF agree to conduct additional IPERA statist ical sampling. However, NSF did consider the results of the OIG report carefully and performed additional IPERA risk assessment work in FY 2015. Additionally, NSF conducted a series of meetings with the OIG and OMB in order to reach consensus with the OIG on NSF's efforts to insure compliance with IPERA. Challenge Develop an internal control process that provides reasonable assurance that payments are proper at the time they are made; and develop a sound process for assessing the agency's risk of improper payments. Progress made in FY 2016 Completed a process improvement plan, during October 2015, in response to the OIG IPERA audit report. Completed a qualitative improper payments risk assessment in December 2015 covering FY 2015. Received OIG -issued inspection report in May 2016, based on its review of the FY 2015 risk assessment, concluding that NSF is compliant with IPERA reporting requirements for FY 2015. Considered all areas for improvement in NSF's IPERA risk assessment process that had been identified in the OIG inspection report. Completed and submitted a CAP in July 2016 to address the audit findings from the OIG report. In August 2016, the OIG reviewed the CAP and found it responsive to their recommendations. All recommendations were resolved . Completed a policy and procedure document in September 2016 for future IPERA risk assessments (pursuant to the CAP). Future Implementation Milestones Complete future IPERA risk assessments on a three- year cycle and report results in FY 2018. Consider a ward financial monitoring testing results as an input for the qualitative IPERA risk assessment. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 19 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Information & IT Resources Lead Official: Division Director, Division of Information Systems, Office of Information and Resource Management (OIRM) NSF Management Overview NSF is aware that the security posture of its information systems is of critical importance to NSF's ability to carry out its mission. The IT security program is evaluated yearly by an ind ependent organization in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). NSF has been proactive in reviewing security controls and identifying areas to strengthen the program, including incorporation of information gained and lessons learned from the FISMA report. NSF ranks seventh out of the 24 CFO Act agencies in cybersecurity assessment scores in the most recent annual FISMA report to Congress. Challenge Allocate appropriate resources to correct IT security weaknesses, particularly relating to the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) and provide increased assurances of adequate protection; and develop and implement a robust information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) program that protects agency information and IT resources agains t increasing numbers of IT security threats. Progress made in FY 2016 US Antarctic Program (USAP) USAP continued to allocate appropriate resources to the IT security program to address information security weaknesses identified in the annual FISMA review. USAP improved the analysis of system scans to ensure configuration compliance and reviewed processes to ensure proper background investigations on all new hires. NSF's Division of Polar Programs established a phased approach to address an improved conti nuity of operations capability. Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) Initiated implementation of the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Phase 1. NSF will be the first federal agency to complete implementation of the CDM Phase 1 in Qu arter 1 FY 2017. Future Implementation Milestones USAP: Continue to address identified IT security weaknesses through program funding. ISCM: Utilize CDM Phase 1 products and services (focusing on tools implementation) to improve its automated continuous monitoring capability. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 20 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Transparency & Accountability Lead: Office of the Director NSF Management Overview NSF is well -positioned to successfully implement the Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act. The DATA Act is a government -wide initiative led by OMB and the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) to standardize and publish the federal government's wide variety of reports and data compilations related to spending: financial management, payments, budget actions, procurement, and assistance. NSF senior agency officials were aware of the Act even prior to its enactment in April 2014. When the legislation passed, NSF moved immediately to leverage its resources to prepare for implementation. In October 2014, NSF designated a senior official in its Office of the Director (O/D) to serve as the agency's DATA Act Senior Accountable Official (SAO). The SAO identified subject matter experts in BFA and the Office of Information and Resource Management (OIRM) for implementation support and the group formed an internal governance structure that included an executive -level steering committee, a DATA Act Working Group (DAWG) and a DATA Act Project Management Office (PMO). Additionally, NSF engaged its OIG to facilitate collaboration around stewardship and in recognition of the OIG requirement to publish a DATA Act readiness review by November 2016, and OIG staff have regularly attended DAWG meetings. Government -wide, NSF staff have represented the agency in connection with DATA Act -related activities, including the Financial Assistance Committee for E -government (FACE); the Data Standards Working Group, a volunteer subgroup of the FACE charged with performing analyses and making recommendations on issues of government -wide data standardization; the Procurement Committee for E -government; and numerous additional DATA Act -related workshops, meetings and small -group strategy sessions with OMB, Treasury, and other CFO Act agencies. These collaborations have been key to NSF's DATA Act implementation success. NSF's DATA Act implementation has adhered to applicable DATA Act guidance issued by OMB and Treasury. In particular, implementation at NSF is guided by the government -wide DATA Act Implementation Playbook Ve rsion 2.0 that tracks the 8- Step Implementation Approach with implementation status reported via the associated OMB/Treasury Dashboard. NSF uses a phased iterative approach to update current processes for reporting procurement and financial assistance info rmation to USASpending.gov using the Award Submission Portal (ASP), and has instituted new processes to produce and upload required account -level budget, spending, and award information. NSF leverages government - wide solutions and resources that are made available for implementation. NSF is actively taking steps to mitigate risks or challenges and is employing multiple approaches to ensure on time compliance. No major system changes have been identified in order for NSF to meet the deadline. Going forward, to ensure adequate resources are available for a successful and on time implementation, the DAWG will continue to foster strong internal, executive -level and government -wide communication. NSF will also continue to communicate its challenges and needs to OMB and Treasury. Challenge Foster greater transparency over NSF spending through successful implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) to make the necessary NSF system and process changes. Progress made in FY 2016 Performed inventory of agency data and associated business processes. Participated in government -wide effort to implement OMB Circular A -11 DATA Act requirements and successfully submitted NSF A -11 test files to the OMB MAX system. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 21 Participated in \"sandbox\" testing to test Treasury's DATA Act Broker, the tool it developed to check validity of federal agencies' uploaded files and provides ability for agencies to certify their data. Revised future state of NSF's daily, bi -monthly and quarterly reporting based on the Broker specifications and final technical guidance DATA Act Information Model Version 1.0 (DAIMS v1.0) released April 29, 2016. Submitted to OMB/Treasury NSF's update to the agency's August 28, 2015 DATA Act Implementation Plan to show progress to date, incorporated additional guidance provided by OMB/Treasury, and provided revised cost and timeline estimates. Also submitted implementation plan updates to other governmental entities, e.g. Congress, OIG. Implemented data extract changes in iTRAK, NSF 's financial accounting system, as well as in NSF business applications. Developed a back -up approach to meeting DATA Act deadline to mitigate the risk of Oracle patches not being delivered in enough time for testing and implementation. Participated in DAT A Act Broker beta testing. Future Implementation Milestones Generate and test Award Submission Portal (ASP) data file per Treasury's new specifications. Comply with ASP submission requirements to USASpending.gov. Make changes to eJacket and iTRAK to acco mmodate the change in budget object class from 410100 (Personnel Mobility Program) to 118500 (IPA Salary and Fringe Benefits). Implement Oracle patch for award attributes (first of five anticipated patches) and modify award system interfaces with iTRAK to populate the following attributes: Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID), Parent Award Identifier (PAID), Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN), and Unique Record Identifier (URI). Upload financial assistance and procurement files to populate the a ward attributes in iTRAK. Implement remaining Oracle patches and generate the files that will be required to submit to the Broker for subsequent public reporting of financial data [these files are: file A (Appropriations Account Data), B (Object Class and Program Activity Data) and C (Award Financial Data)]. Generate files A, B, and C using the implemented Oracle patches. Perform Broker testing by uploading agency generated files A, B, and C. Perform Broker testing by extracting data for files D1 (Award and Awardee Attributes for Procurement), D2 (Award and Awardee Attributes for Financial Assistance), E (Additional Awardee Attributes), and F (Sub -award Attributes). Perform Broker testing in order to validate files A through F to facilitate certification of NSF's data. Implement the back -up approach, as needed, to generate files A, B, C, and reconciliation reports to mitigate the risk of not having the Oracle patches ready for the DATA Act compliance by May 2017. Achieve compliance with May 2017 DATA Act impl ementation deadline. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 22 Management of NSF's Business Operations: Government Records Lead Official: Division Director, Division of Administrative Services , OIRM NSF Management Overview In 2012, OMB and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued a directive, OMB Memorandum (M) 12- 18, \"Managing Government Records,\" consistent with a 2011 Presidential Memorandum, requiring federal agencies to reform the policies and prac tices for the management of records and provide a framework for the management of electronic records. GAO subsequently issued Report 15- 339, dated May 14, 2015, titled, \"Information Management: Additional Actions Are Needed to Meet Requirements of the Managing Government Records Directive.\" NSF formulated a CAP in response to the GAO report and is on schedule to meet all the planned actions enumerated in the CAP. Challenge Respond to GAO's recommendations related to NSF's records management policies and practices, and comply with the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) 2012 directive to take specific reform actions by appointed dates. Progress made in FY 2016 Submitted a CAP in November 2015 in response to the GAO Report 15 -339, \"Inform ation Management: Additional Actions Are Needed to Meet Requirements of the Managing Government Records Directive.\" Deployed the eRecords Awards Archival System in February 2016 for the documentation and management of permanent electronic grant records. Be cause grant records are one of the most critical types of agency records, this activity will constitute a significant component of NSF's plan for achieving full compliance with OMB M- 12-18. Future Implementation Milestones Formalize plans to manage other types of electronic records and make progress towards identifying the necessary revisions to current records management policy, technology requirements, and potential solutions. Ensure execution of the comprehensive plan and implementation strategy managing permanent records electronically. Formalize NSF plans to implement the Capstone approach, a government -wide approach for managing permanent and temporary e -mail records in an electronic format. OIRM will identify any necessary revisions to current records management policy; assess technology requirements and potential solutions; and develop the implementation strategy that will ensure NSF meets the December 31, 2016 deadline FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 23 Management of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Program Lead O fficial: Deputy Division Director, Division of Human Resource Management , OIRM NSF Management Overview NSF provides the opportunity for scientists, engineers, and educators to rotate into the Foundation as temporary Program Directors, advisors, and leaders. Rotators bring fresh perspectives from across the country and across all fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation, helping influence new directions for research in science, engineering, and education, including emerging interdisciplinary fields. Because NSF supports fundamental research at the frontiers of science and engineering, NSF relies on the synergy of federal employees and temporary staff for a constant infusion of new knowledge into the broad understanding of science, and a continuously improving structure of systematic and rigorous merit review. In April 2016, NSF Director France A. C\u00f3rdova announced the establishment of a Steering Committee for Policy and Oversight of the IPA Program (IPA Steering Committee). The Steering Committee serves as the primary body for considering policy on NSF's use of IPAs and oversees common approaches to budgeting and implementation of the IPA program. Challenge 1 Examine the costs associated with NSF's rotator programs to ensure that federal funds entrusted to the agency are being spent effectively and efficiently. Progress made in FY 2016 Established IPA Steering Committee (detailed description set forth under Challenge 2). Submitted Steering Committee reports to Director C\u00f3rdova in August 2016, which, among other things: Summarized the Steering Committee's analysis of costs related to salaries, benefits (including relocation benefits), and individual research and development (IR/D) travel and benchmarking with other federal science agencies; Recommended the development of an integrated agency -wide workforce framework to ensure that NSF main tains the optimal balance of federal employees and IPAs; Identified strategic cost saving areas requiring additional stakeholder consultation, including institutional cost sharing; and Identified strategic cost saving areas that could be examined concurren tly with the development of an agency -wide framework. Documented plans for the IPA Steering Committee to serve as the lead to carry out NSF's commitment to review the overall IPA program and associated costs and benefits every four years and assess the impacts of actions taken to reduce IPA costs. This review and assessment is part of NSF's corrective action plan that responds to the OIG's Cost of IPAs audit. Future Implementation Milestones Complete, via IPA Steering Committee task groups, a plan to establish an agency- wide workforce framework and recommendations for the potential use of new or additional hiring authorities in support of that framework. Ensure IR/D guidance (planned for implementation in FY 2017) supports the goal of combining IR/D with telework, where appropriate, to maximize the use of travel funds. Implement approved changes to NSF's policies for the reimbursement of IPA costs identified in OMB M-12-18. Challenge 2 Establish and maintain strong oversight of NSF's Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) program in order to provide continuity for programmatic leadership despite frequent turnover in executive positions, to FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 24 manage potential conflicts of interest in funding decisions, to promote transparency in funding decisions, and to ensure that IPAs and other rotators comply with federal laws after they leave NSF. Progress made in FY 2016 Established IPA Steering Committee with specific responsibilities to include championing the effective use of IPAs and the importance of addressing m anagement risks; reviewing policies concerning IPA assignees, policies impacting IPA assignees, and policies where the use of IPAs may impact the implementation of those policies; reviewing data on IPAs to inform the Committee's oversight duties; coordinat ing the development of an NSF -wide budget for the IPA program; and providing guidance on methods for managing to the overall budget while ensuring a diverse, high quality cadre of IPAs. As of September 30, 2016, the IPA Steering Committee met nine times a nd submitted one initial and two revised reports on managing IPA costs and developing an integrated workforce framework to Director C\u00f3rdova. The IPA Steering Committee developed strategic principles for management of the IPA program: community engagement, partnership, creativity, transparency, accountability, intentional balance in the workforce structure, and commitment to ongoing improvement. Continued identification and management of conflicts of interest related to IPAs: Communicate standards of conduct \u2014IPAs are subject to the same ethics rules as everyone else who works at NSF: Standards of conduct are communicated in the IPA agreement. New employees, including IPAs, attend new employee orientation and are briefed on the ethical obligations of Federal service. IPAs file a financial disclosure report: all financial disclosure report filers, including IPAs, receive annual Conflict of Interest (COI) training. After filing a financial disclosure report, filers including IPAs receive a written reminder of th e COI rules. Track conflicts - Each COI official tracks conflicts in writing or through eJacket. Ensure continued compliance with Federal laws after leaving NSF: Employees, including IPAs, who are at or above the GS -12 salary level or equivalent, are required to attend a COI exit briefing by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) Ethics Team explaining the post -employment ethics rules. Former employees, including former IPAs, are encouraged to contact the Ethics Team even after they leave. Developed and piloted a one -day course, \"Oversight of Merit Review for Division Leaders,\" to provide NSF Division Leaders, including IPAs, mission- critical information on their role in providing oversight of the NSF Merit Review process. Topics include: Overview of the Proposal & Award Process, Key Roles and Responsibilities in Merit Review, Role of Division Leadership in Ensuring Fairness of Review, How Program Officers Make Recommendations, The Review Analysis, and Understanding Recommendation Logistics and Award Abstr acts. Future Implementation Milestones The IPA Steering Committee will: Review and update core policies relating to IPAs, as found in the NSF Personnel Manual, as needed; Establish a framework for and review data on IPAs for oversight of management of t he program; Coordinate the development of an NSF -wide budget for the IPA program as part of the annual budget cycle; and Ensure that periodic data is provided to the directorates and offices on the completion of mandatory training and status of performance plans and appraisals. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 25 Moving NSF Headquarters to a New Building Lead Official: Senior Relocation Project Officer, OIRM NSF Management Overview NSF is well -positioned to begin occupying its new location in Alexandria, Virginia by August 2017. The NSF R elocation Office (NRO) is leading this effort and is charged with ensuring a successful outcome to NSF's expiring lease effort through the delivery of a next -generation NSF headquarters facility. NRO's mission is accomplished through input of the entire NS F staff through Directorate liaisons, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Union- Local 3403, the agency Relocation Executive Advisory Group (REAG), the General Services Administration (GSA) and other stakeholders to the project. Through demonstrated leadership and disciplined project management, NRO has made significant progress in key areas to ensure project success and to mitigate risks relating to scheduling delays, union negotiations and records management. NRO has also taken concrete steps to align the project's budget with its estimated cost. The groundbreaking for the new NSF Headquarters was January 2014, construction on the interior space began in April 2016 and work will finish by August 2017. The new building will prominently reflect NSF's role nationally and internationally in the science and engineering community. Challenge 1 Mitigate the risk of continued project delays associated with a revised relocation schedule that includes little slack time and two phases of union negotiations that still need to be completed. Progress made in FY 2016 Working with GSA, settled the owner's delay claim from $60 million down to $14.5 million and reset the project schedule. Finalized all design documents in accordance with the revised project schedule and without delay. Along with GSA, awarded a $70 million contract for tenant improvement construction. Brought on a full -time, professional project scheduler who developed an Integrated Project Schedule that identifies the project's critical path, assigns responsibility, and forms the basis for tracking progress. Ensured all procurements were awarded in accordance with the Integrated Project Schedule, including information technology, furniture, security, and audio- visual contracts. Managed FY 2016 relocation- related procurement activities; ensured that t he FY 2016 and FY 2017 procurement and budget schedules supported and aligned with the projected relocation timeline. Added two project managers with office relocation experience to the NRO team. Hired a professional cost estimating and construction qualit y management firm to prepare detailed costs estimates for major submittals and requested change orders. Completed Phase 2 negotiations with AFGE Local 3403 without negatively impacting the project schedule. Started employee workspace selections in accordan ce with the Phase 2 union agreement and Integrated Project Schedule. Briefed senior leadership on value -engineering options, and drove decisions that control costs and provide a functional headquarters that helps NSF meet its mission. Future Implementatio n Milestones Further develop the Integrated Project Schedule and continue to meet regularly with OIRM leadership to manage the project, monitor progress, mitigate risks, and allocate resources. Maintain bi- weekly procurement meetings with DACS to ensure al l procurements are made without negatively impacting the project schedule. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 26 Complete the third phase of negotiations with AFGE Local 3403 without delaying the project schedule. Finalize employee workspace selections and order all furniture, fixtures, and equipment according to the project schedule. Challenge 2 Plan for and manage the logistics of the actual move to the new headquarters building, including addressing the lack of a detailed master schedule, having to negotiate with the union on furniture and space issues, fewer opportunities for design review, less storage space, lack of a records schedule for destruction of documents and lack of a responsible project person with direct access to the Director. Progress made in FY 2016 Determined the strateg y to move employees into the new building in accordance with the project schedule. Communicated plan with senior leadership, AFGE, and directorates. Engaged OIRM essential senior staff to centralize relocation planning and identify potential move - related cost -impacts. Determined phasing for the move based on current and new building constraints and other major move assumptions associated with IT, furniture, elevator, dock availability, etc. Hired two full -time contractors to gather and analyze key data imp acting the move plan, as well as develop two relocation sequence options for leadership's consideration. Announced to NSF staff the move sequence to Alexandria. Future Implementation Milestones Key activities leading up to August 2017 relocation: Develop detailed relocation plan. Determine furniture for reuse and associated migration plan. Develop furniture, fixtures and equipment decommissioning strategy. Develop welcome guide/employee orientation requirements. Establish new building protocols and policie s. Establish move communication program for end users. Develop migration plan for division equipment. Decommission existing facilities. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 27 Management of the U.S. Antarctic Program Lead Official: Division Director, Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Polar Programs NSF Management Overview Through the Division of Polar Programs (PLR) in the Directorate for Geosciences, NSF funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP), which supports United States' research and national policy goals in the Antarc tic. Given the remote location, extreme environment, and the short period of time during which the continent is accessible, significant challenges exist for ensuring the availability of necessary logistics, operations, and science support. There are also u nique and internationally -linked environmental, health, and safety issues present at the remote location. In exercising its management responsibilities, NSF relies on internal staff with the requisite expertise as well as a network of contracted support an d federal agency partners. Periodically, the program is reviewed by external panels of experts. Challenge 1 Establish and maintain a world- class scientific research program in Antarctica's remote and harsh environment. Progress made in FY 2016 Continued progress on the 2012 Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) recommendations, including investment in prioritized lifecycle acquisitions and infrastructure upgrades. Addressed major infrastructure upgrades recommended by the BRP report for McMurdo Station through continue d design efforts: Continued designs of Core Facility and Utilities packages in preparation for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project MREFC Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Initiated design efforts using NSF Research and Related Activities ( R&RA) funds for upgrades to McMurdo lodging, Vehicle Equipment/Operations Center, Information Technology & Communications (IT&C) Primary Operations Center, and Palmer Pier replacement. Future Implementation Milestones Complete necessar y planning/design efforts for individual Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) components. Complete designs for Palmer Pier, lodging, and IT&C Primary Operations Center. Prepare for AIMS External Panel Review. Complete planning/design for the Ross Island Earth Station (RIES). Challenge 2 Control the cost of the USAP and ensure adequate oversight of payments to the USAP contractor. Progress made in FY 2016 Continued to review and approve and/or adjust, as warranted, invoices to the USAP contractor. Prior to approval, invoice review is done by staff whose primary responsibility is review and resolution of invoiced amounts with the contracting officer and contracting officer's representative, a documented process initiated in FY 2013. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to monitor invoices from the USAP contractor in accordance with established procedures. Challenge 3 Ensure the overall health and safety of all USAP participants. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 28 Progress made in FY 2016 Pharmacy System : Insti tuted internal controls to address OIG concerns related to potential drug allergies and interactions and provided assistance in getting information on prescribed drugs. A pharmacy technician was deployed to McMurdo Station during the 2015/16 operating seas on to review the current state of the pharmacy and its management. The pharmacy system was revitalized and repairs were made to the database that is currently in use. Law Enforcement : Achieved full compliance of NSF's law enforcement program with all U.S. Marshals Service requirements for certification and training, and recommendations for law enforcement tools made by the Service. Breathalyzer Unit Calibration : Procured breathalyzer units that do not require calibration. These units provide redundancy for the existing breathalyzer inventory. Future Implementation Milestones Code of Conduct : Finalize a process for receiving and reviewing Code of Conduct violations. Pharmacy System : Identify a suitable system responsive to NSF's contractor's proposal to procure a new pharmacy system. Law Enforcement : Plan for a 2016/17 site visit to Antarctica, resources and schedules permitting. PLR has had internal conversations with OGC and will reach out to law enforcement organization contacts shortly. Post -site visit, expect to identify any desired changes and target implementation for the following season. Breathalyzer Testing Requirements : Continue to explore the advisability and feasibility of the OIG - recommended requirement for breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants. Consultations with the Department of Justice on policy and legal concerns are planned for FY 2016/17. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 29 Improving Grant Administration Lead Official: Deputy Division Dir ector, Division of Institution and Award Support , BFA NSF Management Overview As of June 30, 2016, the NSF award portfolio consisted of 42,206 active awards, representing $28.2 billion in obligated funds to 2,873 unique awardees. NSF accountability effort s span six award stages (proposal submission, merit review, pre -award financial review, post -award monitoring, award closeout, and audit follow -up) to ensure financial capability and accomplishment, non- financial administrative and programmatic compliance, and research performance. The foundation of NSF's accountability efforts is its suite of policy and procedural documents that incorporate federal regulations, legislative mandates, and Agency -specific requirements; the translation of policies and procedures into business rules that are enforced through NSF's information technology systems; and a risk -based approach to financial and administrative monitoring. Baseline monitoring activities, which are conducted on most awards through standard, recurring, and automated processes, focus on post -award administration and financial transactions in order to identify exceptions and potential issues that may require further scrutiny through advanced monitoring. The baseline monitoring efforts of DFM can reveal potential financial anomalies, in accurate expenditure reporting, or evidence of a possible misunderstanding of, or non- compliance with, federal cash management requirements and/or NSF guidelines. During FY 2016, NSF and the OIG agreed to expand the scope of their formal dialogue across activities that now span external audit resolution, large facilities, contracts, financial statement audit issues, as well as internal and performance audits. NSF continues to expand and upgrade mechanisms for communicating policies, procedures, and busine ss practices within this dynamic environment to its staff and external stakeholder communities. In FY 2017, NSF will restructure its Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Branch into two separate organizations (pre -award, post -award) to strengthen effectivene ss of grants oversight to meet the growing need for deeper subject matter expertise, improved resource utilization, and strategic planning. Challenge 1 Implement controls over spending of grant funds that ensure transparency and accountability without creating undue administrative impacts on awardees and federal program officers. Progress made in FY 2016 Coordinated inter -agency development and clearance of Research Terms & Conditions, which implement the Uniform Guidance issued by OMB . This effort creates greater consistency in the administration of Federal research awards and reduces awardee administrative burden by having one standardized set of terms and conditions to comply with, instead of disparate sets from each research agency. This also allows th e Federal research agencies to manage awards in a similar fashion. Expanded integration of NSF's new financial and awardee payment process systems to further data transparency and decision -making, as well as to provide real -time cash transaction and funds control capabilities. Implemented baseline award monitoring of financial transactions to assess allowable costs associated with grant payments, utilizing statistically -based testing and NSF Risk Assessment results as stratification criteria to ensure cove rage across the grant portfolio. This process improved transparency and accountability by enabling DFM to use a statistically based sample size that resulted in requiring fewer test samples, which subsequently reduced the burden on those grantees who must provide documentation to support the payments being tested. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 30 Initiated the development of a new baseline monitoring activity for financial transactions to review grants with high unliquidated balances and short remaining grant periods, which will be used to develop new baseline monitoring metrics. Converted Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I grants (with start dates as of July 1, 2016) and SBIR Phase II grants (with start dates as of August 1, 2016) to the Award Cash Management Service (ACM$) to minimize manual processing and leverage ACM$ funds control capabilities, which will allow for improved transactional accuracy due to automating the process and for quicker, more expeditious processing of SBIR drawdowns for grantees . Implemented use of the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System to ensure transparency and accountability of performance in federal assistance awards. Continued to strengthen working relationships among NSF program officers, NSF grants and oversight officials, and the NSF OIG to address significant issues related to allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of funds expended in the conduct of research. Future Implementation Milestones Refine, as necessary, and conduct FY 2017 baseline award monitoring of financial transactions across NSF's grant portfolio; explore feasibility of strengthening integration of baseline and advanced monitoring activities; initiate baseline monitoring review of grants with little or no financial activity. Continue to implement legislative requirements: (1) standardization and publishing of reports and data on federal spending under the DATA Act and (2) reporting NSF information on undispersed balances in grant awards expired more than two years under the Grant Over sight and New Efficiency (GONE) Act. Challenge 2 Due to federal streamlining of written guidance for administering grants, ensure provision of consistent guidance that does not contradict previous responses or written policies. Progress made in FY 2016 Ensured continued alignment of advanced monitoring efforts with OMB Uniform Guidance (UG), as well as that of external websites, fact sheets, and other information provided to NSF awardees. Provided training to NSF program staff on major revisions to the P roposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG), Proposal & Award Manual (PAM), and NSF grant conditions. To reach a broader audience, training was provided both in- person as well as with an increased virtual presence. Increased in -person training and outreach at conferences and workshops sponsored by research administration professional societies allowing for more effective, real -time interaction with the community; and continued virtual training opportunities such as the webcast of the NSF Grant Confe rence, which allowed for on- demand viewing of sessions covering proposal preparation, merit review, award management, the CAREER program, as well as updates to NSF policies and procedures. Expanded automated Proposal Compliance Validation (PCV) checks by e nsuring that proposals submitted to NSF comply with requirements specified in the FY 2016 Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (Chapter II.C.2 of the GPG). The new system enhancements check the following requirements and may trigger either an error or warning message depending on the funding opportunity type: Proposals must be received by 5 p.m. submitter's local time on the established deadline date. Biographical Sketch(es) and Current and Pending Support files are required for each Senior Personn el associated with a proposal. Biographical Sketch(es) can only be uploaded as a file, must not exceed two pages, and can no longer be entered as text. The goal of automated compliance checking is to reduce the administrative burden on the research community and NSF staff while ensuring fair and consistent treatment of submitted proposals. So far, FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 31 95% of proposals submitted via FastLane have been checked by PCV and submitted successfully to NSF in FY 2016. (Note: Special Post Docs, Award Supplements, and P I-Transfers are not included in PCV at this time.) Future Implementation Milestones Continue to review internal guidance and procedures, and more aggressively use advanced monitoring and other outreach opportunities for NSF awardees to emphasize the impor tance of aligning their policies and procedures with the UG. Consolidate the external -facing PAPPG from a two -volume document comprising the Grant Proposal Guide and the Award Administration Guide into one concise document covering all NSF policies and procedures from pre -award through post -award and closeout. Consolidate the internal -facing PAM to provide NSF staff links to the PAPPG and OMB Uniform Guidance , providing access to a single, definitive source for federal policies and procedures. Continue to brief the research community and NSF staff on upcoming changes to NSF policy documents via in- person and virtual settings to maximize opportunities for dialogue and clarification, as well as on -demand reference information. Continue to expand use of PCV to ensure fair and consistent application of business rules while decreasing administrative burden on researchers, research administrators, and NSF staff. Continue multi -year project to upgrade NSF's Awards System, further enhancing the Agency's ability to enforce business rules consistently while streamlining internal processes. Challenge 3 Due to OMB Uniform Guidance changes raising the Single Audit threshold from $500,000 to $750,000, take additional steps to oversee awardees that fall below the threshol d. Progress made in FY 2016 Rather than diverting resources to address efforts deemed of lower risk to the federal government, continued to use an internal analysis of risk across the NSF portfolio as a basis for focusing advanced monitoring on awardees r eceiving between $2 million and $15 million in NSF funds. Additionally, prior to implementing the Uniform Guidance, OMB and the Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR), in which NSF played an instrumental role, assessed that increasing the single- audit threshold by $250,000 (i.e., additional expenditures from any federal source) still allowed coverage of more than 99 percent of federal dollars awarded to more than 87 percent of federal grant recipients. Continued to fully implement the Uniform Guida nce and to review, as applicable, all records that awardees are required to maintain for review by federal agencies, pass- through entities, and the Government Accounting Office throughout a broad array of pre - and post -award oversight efforts, especially advanced and baseline award monitoring activities. Future Implementation Milestones Assess and, as needed, refine criteria (i.e., award -specific, institutional, prior monitoring activities and results, award administration and program feedback) used in the annual NSF Risk Assessment in order to identify those awardees managing the highest risk portfolio, and targeting those institutions for advanced monitoring activities. Challenge 4 Due to OMB Uniform Guidance changes to documentation requirements for lab or effort reporting, reinforce with awardees the need to design and implement controls to reduce the risk of improper charges to awards and to provide a means to ensure the controls are achieving their objective. FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 32 Progress made in FY 2016 Compared Uniform Guidance with prior OMB guidance, noting three major changes related to labor effort reporting: (1) removed examples of acceptable methods for charging and documenting labor effort to federal awards; (2) removed \"suitable means of verification\" language; and (3) emphasized development and adherence to strong internal controls by awardees. While awardees may use budget data to estimate reasonable approximation of the activity actually performed, their systems of internal controls must include processes to review interim, estimated charges. NSF believes the Uniform Guidance requirements are essentially identical to those cited under the previous \"Planned Confirmation Methodology.\" Conti nued efforts to ensure that awardees comply with federal labor effort reporting requirements through feedback mechanisms resulting from oversight activities such as pre- award reviews, audit resolution, baseline and advanced monitoring, and post -award adjus tment reviews. Future Implementation Milestones Modify written internal guidance for performance of NSF oversight activities regarding policies and procedures for labor effort charges by award recipients (i.e., update Standing Operating Guidance to fully align with the Uniform Guidance ). Refine, as necessary, and implement FY 2017 baseline award monitoring for the entire grant portfolio. Challenge 5 Due to Uniform Guidance changes in the audit resolution process, offset the 30- day shortened timeframe for NSF by establishing a new accelerated process for identifying and tracking reports requiring resolution. Progress made in FY 2016 Analyzed 1,799 audit reports resolved between FY 2009 and FY 2016, noting that the large majority of reports were resolved in a timely manner. NSF does not foresee that the U niform Guidance change poses a significant challenge to compliance with timeliness of resolution. Augmented Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution (CAAR) staff by two Cost Analysts to mitigate effects of workload in other priority areas, to aid in timely resol ution of complex OIG audits. Modified the audit resolution module within CAAR's Monitoring and Tracking Database to track audit reports based on the date of their acceptance by the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) to set requisite six-month audit resoluti on target dates. Future Implementation Milestones Accept OIG transfer of responsibility for, and develop procedures for, identifying and tracking single - audit reports submitted to the FAC requiring NSF resolution thus reducing the number of days between FAC acceptance and completed resolution. Continue to assess the effects of recent changes in policies/practices that have potential for impacting timeliness of audit resolution, including assumption of FAC drawdown responsibilities, increase of single -audit thresholds to $750,000 in federal expenditures, risk management, and potential opportunities for process streamlining. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 33 Encouraging the Ethical Conduct of Research Lead: Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences NSF Management Overview The responsible and ethical conduct of research is critical to ensure excellence, as well as public trus t, in science and engineering. In accordance with Section 7009 of the America COMPETES Act (ACA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a71862o-1) and recognizing the importance of ethical conduct of research, NSF requires that each institution submitting a proposal certify, under penalty of perjury, that it has a plan to provide appropriate training and oversight in the ethical conduct of research to all undergraduates , graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who will be support ed by NSF to conduct research. The plan must be available for review upon request and to ensure compliance, NSF includes, as a term and condition of its awards, that institutions are resp onsible for verifying that undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF to conduct research have received training in the responsible and ethical conduct of research. NSF's implementation of the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirement recognizes the breadth of research disciplines the Foundation funds, as well as the diversity of the educational levels of the individual researchers the agency supports, to ensure that the training will be effecti ve and ap propriately tailored. Specific training needs may vary depending on specific circumstances of research or the specific needs of students intending to pursue careers in basic or applied science after completin g their education. Accordingly, it is the respon sibility of each institution to determine both the content and the delivery method for the training that will meet the institution's specific needs. Furthermore, each institution must decide if development of content or pedagogical method is required, or i f appropriate content and training can be provided from some existing sources or capabilities, and take appropriate actio n to implement their decisions. NSF has taken concrete steps to enhance the awareness of ethical conduct of research issues by NSF sta ff, as well as the U.S. and international scientific research and education communities, by supporting the development of tools and resources to enhance the ability of research institutions to cultivate cultures of academic and research integrity. Most not ably, the Online Ethics Center (OEC) provides resources, including an Ethics Education Library that institutions can use to deliver effective training that is tailored to meet the needs of their particula r project. NSF's program: Cultivating Cultures for E thical STEM (CCE STEM) invests in innovative approaches to enhance research into ethical conduct of research issues that can build the capacity of institutions to develop appropriate ethical conduct of research plans as requir ed by the America COMPETES Act . NSF is committed to heighten the U.S. and international STEM community's awareness of these resources. Challenge Provide more oversight on institutional implementation of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirements and provide meaningful guidance regarding RCR training. Progress made in FY 2016 Continued to support research that provides answers to questions about creating responsible research communities. Continued to share state -of-the-art understanding of what approaches are most effective in outreach opportunities with NSF staff, and with U.S. and international scientific rese arch and education communities. Identified and developed funding mechanisms to support reproducible and reliable science. Funded a major relaunch of the Online Ethics C enter (OEC) website in February 2016, representing a significant expansion of resources and site functionality to include all of the sciences NSF supports. OEC is an NSF -funded initiative to serve those who promote learning and advance understanding of responsible research and practi ce in engineering and science. It provides online resources to engineers, FY 2016 Management Challenge Progress Report Performance - 34 scientists, faculty, and students to understand and address ethically significant issues that arise in scientific and engineering practice and from the developments of science and engineering. Funded the workshop, \"Enhancing Robust and Generalizable Experimental Behavioral Science\" at Arizona State University. The goal of the workshop is to conduct a systematic analysis of disincentives undermining dive rsity and incentive structures supporting convenience and inertia over good science practices. An action plan will be developed for addressing and ameliorating these issues through more specific guidance for researchers. Hosted an RCR workshop at NSF in April 2016 for NSF program officers and other community members. The workshop highlighted the impact of NSF's policy on RCR training, along with best practices. Experts from federal agencies, the National Academies of Science, and universities discussed graduate and post -doc training, RCR challenges, RCR strategies, and RCR successes. Future Implementation Milestones Continue to support and share research that provides answers to questions about creating responsible research communities, robust and reliable science, and best practices for ethical STEM. Outcomes of the Arizona State University workshop will include structured guidance for addressing the well -documented sampling bias that will contribute to broadening the sampling protocols for experimental beh avioral science research. CCE -STEM program activities include funding a workshop on \"Qualitative Research Ethics in the Big - Data\"; an institutional transformation grant at the Georgia Institute of Technology titled, \"The Role of Service Learning and Community Engagement on the Ethical Development of STEM Students and Campus Culture\"; and five grants covering research projects in ethical maturity, ethical practice and responsible conduct of research in STEM. Issue an NSF Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) emphasizi ng the importance of the responsible and ethical conduct of research, and highlighting the availability of NSF -funded tools and resources on which institutions can rely in developing their required RCR plans. The DCL will also showcase NSF -funded research and workshops in this area. Performance - 35 LOWER -PRIORITY PROGRAMS NSF's FY 2018 Request follows a thorough examination of programs and investments across NSF to determine where the potential exists for more innovative investments . This Budget Request includes nine proposed terminations, consisting of activities that have either achieved their goals or of activities that will be realigned to better serve the agency's mission. The total reduction is largely being redeployed into ongoing programs . Program Terminations Catalyzing New International Collaborations (CNIC) (-$190,000) supports the participation of U.S.- based researchers and students in activities intended to catalyze new international research collaborations. In FY 2018, the CNIC program will sunset because it achieved its stated goal. Lessons learned from CNIC will be incorporated in the revised International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) solicitation to support larger numbers of principal investigators and build collaborations at the disciplinary program level. International Research Fellowship Program (IRFP) (-$2.32 million) introduced scientists and engineers in the early stages of their careers to international collaborative rese arch opportunities, thereby furthering their research capacity and global perspective and forging long- term relationships with scientists, technologists, and engineers abroad. In FY 2018, the program will sunset because it achieved its objective. Lessons l earned from IRFP will be incorporated into future program solicitations that support U.S. scientists, engineers, and students engaged in international research and education activities in all NSF - supported disciplines. NSF Headquarters Relocation (-$38.87 million) f unds will be greatly reduced, as the move will be substantially complete by the end of FY 2017. NSF is anticipated to complete the move of its headquarters to the new building in Alexandria, VA by October 1, 2017. A small budget remains in FY 2018 for items such as decommissioning of the current headquarters buildings and unanticipated changes required at the new headquarters. Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) (no change) was a jointly supported initiative between the Department o f Energy and NSF that supported short courses at the advanced graduate, post - doctoral, and junior faculty levels. PASI was paused in FY 2014, and will sunset in FY 2018, as assessments of the program indicate that it has reached its stated goals. Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) (-$50,000) fostered and strengthened interaction among scientists, engineers and educators around the globe, based on the knowledge that excellence in STEM research and education exists in many parts of the world and that scientific advances can be accelerated by scientists and engineers working together across international borders. The program achieved its stated goal and will sunset in FY 2018. Lessons learned from SAVI will be incorporated into future OISE program solic itations. Science and Technology for America's Recovery: Measuring the Effect of Research on Innovation, Competiveness, and Science (STAR METRICS) (-$1.0 million) sought to provide a common empirical data and analytic infrastructure for recipients of federal research and development (R&D) funding to facilitate the sharing of data, interpretation of results, and to understand how federal funding for R&D affect the innovation ecosystem. As of January 1, 2016, STAR METRICS halted the federal collection of institution data and subsequent production of reports that help document the value of the federal government's investments in research and development . Because data collection has ended, the pilot activity has been completed. Lower Priority Programs Performance - 36 Sunsetting NSF- wide Investments Returning to Core Programs Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science, Engineering, and Education (CIF21) (-$181.67 million) is a multi -directorate NSF -wide priority area that was established in FY 2011 to foster the necessary research, educat ion, and infrastructure activities that would enable the achievement of a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure, leveraging existing data, software, and high -performance computing programs. Led by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) within the Dir ectorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), CIF21 was a partnership among the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), CISE, Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical S ciences (MPS), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). Following the scheduled sunsetting of CIF21 in FY 2017, NSF will transition some existing CIF21 activities as it continues to develop a focused set of activities in alignment with the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI). In addition, the rich topic of data, encompassing data science, data management, data policy, community building, and workforce development, will also remain a strategic focus for NSF through the Harnessing the D ata Revolution Big Idea, which will span research, education, and research infrastructure. Research at the Interface of Biological, Mathematical and Physical Sciences (BioMaPS) ( -$35.07 million) has sought to discover fundamental new knowledge at the inte rsections of the biological, mathematical and physical sciences, and engineering in order to enable innovation in national priorities such as clean energy, climate science, advanced manufacturing, and understanding the brain, which are essential to the Nat ion's prosperity, economic competitiveness, and quality of life. BioMaPS began in FY 2011 as a partnership between BIO and MPS. The program was expanded in FY 2012 with additional participation from ENG. The program is being eliminated as it has achieved i ts goal, leading to a culture change within NSF with cross -directorate collaboration in these fields having become standard practice. In FY 2018, only remaining continuing grant increments will be supported. Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) (-$103.63 million) was a coordinated effort to support research spanning a wide range of scientific domains that began in FY 2010. Multiple perspectives and areas of expertise were supported to increase the understanding of integrated systems of human society and the natural world and to lead the development of solutions to sustainability challenges. SEES was a multi -directorate program that included contributions from BIO, CISE, EHR, ENG, GEO, MPS, the Office of Integrative Activities (IA), the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and SBE. Although FY 2017 concludes funding for the portfolio of SEES activities, NSF will continue investing in the research necessary for a sustainable human future, via other programs an d mechanisms, such as hazards- related research projects under NSF's Risk and Resilience investment area, research through INFEWS, and other NSF core programs. Performance - 37 OTHER INFORMATION Management Reviews Each quarter, NSF senior leadership reviews progress towards all performance goals of the agency in a data-driven review meeting led by the Chief Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer . The quarterly p rogress of the Agency P riority G oals (APGs) and performanc e goals are reviewed . Alignment of Human Capital Efforts with Organizational Performance In order to drive individual and organizational performance , NSF requires that the performance plans of all employees, executives, and the general workforce contain individual goals aligned with the agency 's mission and strategic goals. NSF provides training and makes tools and templates available for all supervisors and employees on linking performance plans to agency mission, as well as providing assistance and trai ning on the policies, processes, requirements, and timeframes for the development of performance plans and appraisals. NSF also directly aligns its strategic human capital and accountability efforts to the agency goals identified in the NSF Strategic Pla n. Agency performance goals currently outline specific human capital goals, and NSF uses HRStat as the agency reporting mechanism to articulate the nexus between NSF's strategic goals/objectives, including agency performance goals, and human capital initia tives at the agency . Senior leaders are briefed quarterly regarding the status of agency performance goals and the human capital initiatives aligned to those goals. Strategies and Collaborations No one standard strategy is used across NSF for achievement of goals . Goal leaders at NSF choose strategies tailored to their stakeholders' needs and their institutional capabilities . NSF goals often involve testing the impacts of new activities or new approaches to existing activities, so feedback mechanisms are built in . Use of analysis, evidence, and evaluation findings is also at the discretion of each individual goal leader, as is the decision to collaborate with other agencies or external entities or to invest in contract support for their activities. Perform ance at NSF is reviewed quarterly by NSF's Performance Improvement Officer, who reports on goal progress to NSF senior management . Advisory Committees and Committees of Visitors Each directorate and office has an external advisory committee that typicall y meets twice a year to review and provide advice on program management, discuss current issues, and review and provide advice on the impact of policies, programs, and activities in the disciplines and fields encompassed by the directorate or office . In ad dition to directorate and office advisory committees, NSF has several committees that provide advice and recommendation on specific topics: astronomy and astrophysics; environmental research and education; equal opportunities in science and engineering; di rection, development, and enhancements of innovations; polar programs; advanced cyberinfrastructure; international and integrative activities; the agency's merit review processes; and business and operations. Committees of Visitors (COVs) are subcommittees of NSF directorate advisory committees. COV reviews provide NSF with external expert judgments in two areas: (1) assessments of the quality and integrity of program operations and program -level technical and managerial matters pertaining to proposal deci sions; and (2) comments on how the outputs and outcomes generated by awardees have contributed to the attainment of NSF's mission and strategic outcome goals. COV reviews are conducted at regular intervals of approximately three years for programs and offi ces that recommend or award grants, cooperative agreements, and/or contracts and whose main focus is the conduct or support of NSF research and education in science and engineering . Approximately one -third of NSF's divisions are assessed each year. Other Information Performance - 38 A COV typically consists of up to 20 external experts, selected to ensure independence, programmatic coverage, and geographic balance. COV members come from academia, industry, government, and the public sector . They meet for two or three days to review and assess program priorities, program management, and award accomplishments or outcomes . Each COV prepares a report and the division or program that is being reviewed must prepare a response to the COV recommendations . These reports and responses are submitted to the parent advisory committee and to the Director of NSF . All reports and responses are public and posted on NSF's website .2 In FY 2016, six directorates and offices convened nine COVs, covering all or part of nine divisions and one cross -cutting program. A list of the COVs performed is provided on the next page. The chapters of the directorates also contain information on these COVs, as well as information on ad hoc reports. Evaluations and Research Evaluations at NSF are currently performed at t he discretion of the individual directorate, office, or program being evaluated. For discussion of how NSF uses planned, current, and recently completed evaluations in its program decisions, refer to individual directorate and office chapters. A list of the evaluations completed in FY 2016 follows. For more details about how the results of these specific evaluations are being used to shape agency decisions, see the chapter of the sponsoring directorate . Directorate chapters also contain a list of selected h igh-impact events (workshops, symposia, or other meetings resulting in publications) that inform their decision- making . For more information about program evaluation and collection and management of NSF progr ammatic data, see the Office of Integrative Acti vities chapter's section on NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability.

The guidance from GAO indicates that agencies should \"...describe the means the agency will use to verify its performance data...\" and \"...provide confidence that [their] performance information will be credible.\"3 NSF will continue this process in FY 2017 and FY 2018. In FY 2016, IBM Global Business Services (IBM) assessed the validity of NSF data and verified the reliability of the methods used to collect, process, maintai n, and report that data, and reviewed NSF's information systems based on GAO standards for application controls. IBM's FY 2016 report concluded: Based on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Full Year Verification and Validation (V&V) review, IBM was able to fully v erify the reliability of the processes and validate the accuracy of results reported for eight of NSF's nine annual performance goals. NSF was not able to complete the remaining goal in FY 2016 because the survey instrument was not available; IBM confirms that NSF did not achieve the goal. Overall, IBM verifies that NSF relies on sound business practices, internal controls, and manual checks of system queries to ensure accurate performance reporting. NSF maintains adequate documentation of its processes an d data to allow for an effective V&V review. Based on the V&V assessment, IBM has confidence in the systems, policies, and procedures used by NSF to calculate results for its performance measures that contained targets. NSF continues to take concerted step s to improve the quality of its systems and data. IBM confirms NSF's commitment to ensuring the accuracy of its reported GPRA results, and the reliability of its processes for collecting, processing, maintaining, and reporting data for its performance goals. 4 The data and information required to measure progress towards NSF's performance goals fall into three broad categories. 1. NSF automated administrative systems. Performance monitoring can be a valuable secondary function of such systems. Reporting can include data from systems that: Store and approve publications such as solicitations announcements, and Dear Colleague Letters; Collect transactional data about proposal and award management; Perform financial transactions; Store human resources data; or Permit keyword search of abstract or full texts of proposals and awards. The data were used either directly or for achieving milestones that involve the writing of a report . While not all goals require a high level of accu racy, data from these systems are highly reliable. 2. Reports on internal activities . Milestone achievement is often determined from review of records of certain activities and events. Records of this sort tend to be compiled from review of the evidence provided by goal leaders. 3. Data requests of external parties. Qualitative or quantitative information is solicited directly from awardees. 3 GAO, The Results Act: An Evaluator's Guide to Assessing Agency Annual Performance Plans, GAO/GGD-10.1.20 (Washington, D.C.: April 1998), pp. 40-41. 4 IBM Global Business Services, National Science Foundation Performance Measurement Verification and Validation Report, Fiscal Year 2016 Full Year Report .

Six of the nine goals fully achieved their targets in FY 2016 and three did not achieve one or more targets. Below is a tabular overview. Goal ID Performance Goal FY 2016 Result 1 APG: Improve Grad uate Student Preparedness Achieved 2 APG : Invest Strategically in Public Participation in STEM Research Achieved 3 Ensure that Key Program Investments are on Track Achieved 4 Ensure that Research Infrastructure Investments are on Track Not Achieved 5 Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions Achieved 6 Make Timely Award Decision s Achieved 7 Foster a Culture of Inclusion Not Achieved 8 Evaluate NSF Investments Achieved 9 Increase the Percentage of Panelists Participating in Merit Review Virtually Not Achieved Multiple years of trend data are available for NSF's quantitative performance measures (Goals 4, 6, and 9 ). Other performance goals monitor progress towards multiyear goals, such as implementation of a new process ( Goals 7 and 8) or monitoring of strategically important investments ( Goals 1, 2, 3, and 5). Other Information Performance - 44 Goal 1: Improve Graduate Student Preparedness (Agency Priority Goal) Lead Organization s: Directorate for Geosciences, Directorate for Engineering . Goal Statement Improve STEM graduate student preparedness for entering the workforce. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion A strong global economy relies on the ability to capitalize on technical innovations that result from a skilled and agile STEM workforce. To achieve this, the Nation's scientific workforce must evolve and mature to include more doctoral level researchers in positions outside of academia. These positions require comprehensive preparation in science at the graduate level, as well as proficiency in other critical skills. However, Ph.D. training remains largely focused on preparation for the research component of academic careers with an emphasis on skills needed at research institutions. The purpose of this APG is to provide opportunities for science and engine ering doctoral students to acquire the knowledge, experience, and skills needed for highly productive careers, inside and outside of academe . To achieve this goal, NSF is taking two approaches: piloting support for summer institutes, to provide students with broad experiences in pr ofessional development areas, and supporting supplements to existing research awards, to enhance graduate education opportunities. In the first year of this APG , NSF supported 80 supplements , exceeding its two-year goal to fund 75 supplements. NSF will co ntinue to support supplements in year two of the goal . NSF also requested proposals for summer institutes . One award was made, with more anticipated in year two . FY Target FY 2016 Result 2016 -2017 By September 30, 2017, NSF will fund at least three summer institutes and 75 supplements to existing awards to provide STEM doctoral students with opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills to prepare for a range of careers. Supplements = 80 Summer Institutes = 1 Trend Information This is a new goal in FY 2016 . The topic was identified through the 2015 Strategic Review process. FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 45 Goal 2: Invest Strategically in Public Participation in STEM Research (PPSR) (Agency Priority Goal ) Lead Organizations: Directorate for Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering, Directorate for Education and Human Resources. Goal Statement Build the capacity of the Nation to solve research challenges and improve learning by inve sting strategically in crowdsourcing and other forms of public participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research (PPSR). Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have involved the public in their research efforts to solve challenging problems for centuries . These types of activities have been referred to in a variety of ways. For this goal, PPSR is used as an overarching term that includes citizen science, crowdsourcing research, and similar activities . PPSR has grown significantly in the past decade, in part due to new technological tools that facilitate interactions between scientists and participants . Economic, societal, and technol ogical trends are increasing the variety and value of what PPSR can accomplish. PPSR approaches can address new research questions and contribute to ongoing STEM research. To achieve this APG, NSF will use three specific mechanisms to fund proposals that expli citly include PPSR approaches: 1. Early -concept Grants for Research (EAGERs) are designed as \"high risk -high payoff\" awards with the potential to quickly further our understanding of how PPSR is leveraged to support scientific discovery and the public's engagement with research . 2. Supplements to existing awards provide opportunities (1) to include PPSR approaches in projects that are appropriate for PPSR but haven't already incorporated PPSR approaches and (2) for other projects to deepen their use of PPSR approaches. 3. Research Coordination Networks support communication and coordination acr oss disciplinary, organizational, institutional, and geographic boundaries . In the first year of this APG , NSF issued two D ear Colleague Letters to solicit EAGERs and supplements that include PPSR , and funded 26 EAGERs and five supplements . NSF also conferred and participated with other federal agencies in the Federal Community of Practice for Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing meetings. FY Target FY 2016 Result 2016 -2017 By September 30, 2017, NSF will implement mechanisms to expand and deepen the engagement of the public in research . EAGERs = 26 Supplements = 5 Trend Information This is a new goal in FY 2016 . The topic was identified through the 2015 Strategic Review process. Other Information Performance - 46 Goal 3: Ensur e that Key Program Investments are on Track Lead Organization: Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management . Goal Statement Ensure that key NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion NSF instituted this goal in FY 2014 to track the interim progress of major investments towards their long- term goals. Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter of its Budget Request to Congress . Although the overall impact of these investments will not be realized for many years, tracking near -term indicators of implementation and progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections. In FY 2016, NSF successfully monitored the progress of three NSF-wide investments ( NSF INCLUDES , INFEWS, and Understanding the Brain) using a common set of indicators and reviewed the results with senior leaders. The indicators that NSF chose to measure were programmatic inputs and outputs that can provide valuable signals to managers and leaders about a program's vitality and potential success, as they address whether the program is being administered as planned or whether the program is generating enough interest from the community. The following were tracked quarterly in FY 201 6: Input indicator: progress towards the investment's funding level target . Output indicators: solicitations issued, proposals r eceived, awards made. Program -specific activities: e.g. PI meetings, workshops, and /or evaluation contract deliverables. These measures enabled managers and leaders to quickly gauge the status of a program's implementation, interest from the scientific community, whether the review process resulted in awards in a timely manner, and whether the program ha s met its internal goals for short -term outcomes . Tracking these measures over time provided managers and leaders with the opportunity to assess whether mid -course corrections were needed to improve program management and/or the overall direction of the investm ent. FY Target Result 2016 Monitor the progress of the following NSF -wide investments using a common set of milestones and indicators: NSF INCLUDES, INFEWS, and UtB.

Not achieved (4 of 6 monitored) 2011 - 2013 New goal in FY 2014 FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 47 Goal 4: Ensure that Research Infrastructure Investments are on Track Lead Organization: Large Facilities Office, Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management . Goal Statement Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account supports the acquisition, construction, and commissioning of major research facilities and equipment that provide unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and engineering . Performance of construction projects funded by the MREFC account is m onitored using the Earned Value Management (EVM) system . EVM is an integrated management control system for assessing, understanding, and quantifying what a contractor or field activity is achieving with program dollars . Monitoring cost and schedule is a s tandard measure of performance for construction projects . Projects that are under ten percent complete are not considered eligible for this goal because EVM data is less meaningful statistically in the very early stages of a project. Two of the three projects that w ere over ten percent complete by the end of FY 2016 were on track . At the end of FY 2016, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) was 71 percent complete and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST ) was 33 percent complete . Both projects had cost and schedule variances well below the ten percent thresholds. Explanation of Unmet Goal The FY 2016 goal was not met because of cost and schedule issues associated with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). These are discussed further in the NEON section of the MREFC Chapter of this Request. FY Target Result 2016 Construction Project Monitoring: For all MREFC facilities under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. Not achieved (2 of 3 projects were within cost and schedule variances) Trend 2016Construction Project Monitoring Performance Trends, FY 2011 -2016Other Information Performance - 48 Goal 5: Use Evidence to Guide Management Decisions Lead Organization: Office of Information and Resource Management Goal Statement Use evidence- based reviews to guide management investments. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion HRStat and PortfolioStat are processes in which agency leaders conduct regular data- driven reviews of human resources and IT portfolio information. HR Stat targets focus on development and refinement of a human capital management dashboard for senior management use, and on the reporting of those data to management in formal meetings. Portfolio Stat targets monitor NSF's IT investment evaluation process. HR Stat In fulfillment of T arget 1, t he Strategic Human Capital Management dashboard was updated in FY 2016 to provide additional data about priority initiatives in the focus areas of employee engagement, recruitment and retention, diversity and inclusion, and workload. C onsistent with the FY 2014 Strategic Review, NSF set a goal of retaining 70 percent of its permanent workforce onboard at the end of FY 2015 through the headquarters relocation at the end of FY 2017. The retention rate for that population is 90 percent through the end of FY 2016. HRStat meetin gs in 2 in FY 2016. Portfolio Stat NSF's IT governance bodies (the Enterprise Architecture Working Group, Capital Planning and Investment Control Working Group, and the IT Resources Board ) prepare d the FY 2018 IT budget request and prioritize d the IT investment portfolio. To inform their investment decisions, c ost and schedule data were presented to the governing bodies throughout the course of the fiscal year . Major invest ments reviewed included Enterprise BI, Public Access , and Proposal Management Efficiencies. 5 For the full target language from previous years, please refer to the FY 2015 Performance Report in the FY 2017 NSF Budget Request (nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2017/pdf/56_fy2017.pdf). FY Targets Result 2016 HRStat 1. Establish indicators to assess progress of three workforce initiatives designed to meet the objectives of the Opportunities for Action in NSF's FY 2014 Strategic Review for Strategic Goal 3, Objective 1. 2. During FY 2016, focus at least two evidence -based r eviews on the three identified workforce initiatives . Portfolio Stat 3. NSF's information technology (IT) governance boards will evaluate and prioritize proposed investments for FY 2018. 4. NSF's IT governance boards will use cost and schedule data for ongoing investments to inform investment decisions for FY 2018.

Goal Statement Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 182 days, or six months, of deadline, target, or receipt date, whichever is later. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Time to decision or \"dwell time\" is the amount of time that passes between receipt of a proposal and notification to the principal investigator about the funding decision. One of the most significant issues raised in customer satisfaction survey s is the time it takes NSF to process proposals. Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding process, but too short a time period may weaken the merit review process by forcing premature decisions . The six -month target seeks to strike a balance between the need of the investigator for timely action and the need of NSF for a credible merit review system. Goal Change History In FY 2015, this target was raised from 70 percent to 75 percent to be more in line with the historical trend of achievement at or above this level. The exception of FY 2014, in which NSF exceeded the 70 percent target by a historically low margin, was likely due to Foundation- wide delays in proposal proc essing after the lapse in funding authority in October 2013. The FY 2016 result of 77 percent was in line with historical achievement levels. FY Target Result 2016 75 percent. Achieved . Result = 77 percent. Trend 2016Time to Decision Performance Trends, FY 2011 -2016Other Information Performance - 50 Goal 7: Foster a Culture of Inclusion Lead Organization: Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) , Office of the Director. Goal Statement Foster a culture of inclusion through change management efforts resulting in change leadership and accountability6. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion Fostering inclusive work environments and realizing the full potential of the workforce's diversity requires agencies to employ effective management practices. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in partnership with the Department of Vete rans Affairs, developed the New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) in FY 2013 to measure and drive inclusive intelligence in the federal workplace . Inclusive intelligence is defined as intentional, deliberate, and pr oactive acts that ensure that people feel they belong and are uniquely valued. OPM has recently developed a process to supplement use of the New IQ by using change management tools to help agencies support diversity and inclusion more fully . The expected outcome of the process is that the leaders will improve the employee engagement levels of their employees, resulting in an increase in the overall New IQ scores and corresponding FEVS scores over time. NSF has realized slippage in its FEVS inclusion- related results over several years, and recognizes that having a workforce comprised of a mix of permanent and temporary rotator staff requires targeted efforts . In addition, NSF's workforce is challenged on another inclusion front with the administ rative and scientific staffs' feelings about uniqueness and belongingness . NSF anticipates that implementing the New IQ process in several of NSF's organizational units will initiate a set of behavior changes that can become habits throughout the Foundation. Explanation of Unmet Goal NSF's plan to choose two divisions in which to implement the New IQ in FY 2016 was delayed due to staffing transitions at NSF and delays in administration of the New IQ pulse (interim) survey . 6 NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversity and inclusion since FY 2011. Former goals were largely focused on NSF's efforts to attain \"Model EEO Agency\" status. For information on earlier versions of this goal, including full goal language, refer to the FY 2015 Performance Report in the FY 2017 NSF Budget Request (nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2017/pdf/56_fy2017.pdf). FY Target Result 2016 1. By September 30, 2016, ODI will conduct the new IQ process with two NSF organizational units . 2. Improve the two NSF organizational units' New IQ Self - Survey Scores by five percent above established baseline.

Achieved FY 2018 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 51 Goal 8: Evaluate NSF Investmen ts Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities. Goal Statement Enable consistent evaluation of the impact of NSF investments with a high degree of rigor and independence. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion The Evaluation and Assessme nt Capability (EAC), housed in the Office of Integrative Activities, provides NSF with the independent capacity to operate from a basis of evidence in program and policy decisions . The EAC has three multi- year goals: 1) e ncourage a culture of evidence- based planning and policy -making ; 2) encourage increased rigor, independence, and consistency in all evaluations and assessments ; and 3) develop and implement a coordinated evaluation framework . In FY 2016, EAC develope d plans for continuous program and portfolio improvement, targeted to activities carried out in three key areas of NSF investment . 1. Human Capital : The statement of work for a contract awarded to monitor Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students articulates the criteria for what constitutes evidence for evaluating the REU program. It proposes a variety of methods that could be employed to generate such evidence and how they might be used to assess success. 2. NSF-wide priorities : As of the end of F Y 2016, a contract was underway that builds upon a preliminary report on the feasibility of an evaluation of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace ( SaTC) program. The preliminary report establishes the evaluation framework to be used for the evaluation. 3. Long-term strategic investments: A contract to conduct an evaluation of the I -Corps program is underway . The research questions, design, and methods for obtaining and using evidence are discussed in the description of the evaluation framework developed by th e contractor . FY Target Result 2016 By September 30, 2016, NSF will have developed three illustrative models of evaluation frameworks in the following three areas: 1. investments in the development of U.S. science and engineering human capital, 2. investments in established NSF -wide priorities, and 3. long-term strategic investments . All targets achieved Trend Information 2015 1. By September 2015, the Evaluation and Assessment Capability will have developed evaluation quality principles and disseminated them to all directorates . 2. These quality principles will be followed by all new evaluation projects across the agency . 3. NSF will have incorporated logic models/theory of change in the language that describes the rationale for all new programs. No targets achieved 2011 - 2014 New goal in FY 2015 Other Information Performance - 52 Goal 9: Increase the Percentage of Panelists Participating in Merit Review Virtually Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities , Office of the Director . Goal Statement Increase the percentage of proposal review panelists that participate virtually while maintaining the quality of the merit review process. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Discussion NSF makes extensive use of panels of reviewers to evaluate proposals, holding around 1900 panels annually . Review panels provide ample opportunity to test new methods and practices . One such practice, the use of virtual meeting technology to supplement or replace in -person panels 7, was piloted at NSF from the early 2010s under the assumption that f ace-to-face panels impose a significant time burden on reviewers. NSF has had a performa nce goal relating to virtual panel usage since FY 20128. Usage of virtual panelists peaked in FYs 2013 and 2014 due to several factors: a response to reductions in travel budgets; development of training materials; and management's encouragement to utilize virtual panels as a viable reviewer participation mechanism . However, i n tha t time period and subsequently, surveys have consistently show n higher satisfaction ratings with in- person participation on the part of reviewers and NSF staff. Explanation of Unmet Goal The 28 percent target was a \"stretch\" level and not in line with projections for likely FY 2016 virtual panelist usage. Setting a stretch goal did not play a role in driving performance in this area. 7 The term \"virtual panelist\" refers to a panel reviewer who does not travel to a common location but instead participates via teleconference, videoconference, or an online meeting technology. 8 For four years, the goal tracked a pilot project that measured the number of \"wholly virtual\" panels, i.e. panels that used only virtual panelists. For more information about earlier versions of thi s goal, refer to the FY 2015 Annual Performance Report in the FY 2017 NSF Budget Request (nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2017/pdf/56_fy2017.pdf). FY Target Result 2016 By September 30, 2016, at least 28 percent of merit review panelists will participate virtually. Not achieved. Result = 25 percent.

Technical Informa tion Technical Info - 12 EXPLANATION OF FY 2016 CARRYOVER INTO FY 2017 BY ACCOUNT The National Foundation's (NSF) total unobligated balance of $183.46 million ($84.90 million for Discretionary accounts, including $6.30 million for Incoming Interagency Reimbursable Agreements, and $98.56 million for Mandatory accounts) is described below. DISCRETIONARY Within the Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account, $18.23 million (including $6.30 million in reimbursable funds) was carried over into FY 2017. Directorate for Geosciences Polar Programs (no -year funding) Amount: $2.06 million Reason: Recoveries from prior year obligations that were received too late in the fiscal year to obligate. Obligated: FY 2017 Quarter 2 Office of Integrative Activities (OIA) Amount: $6.33 million Reason: The complexity of co- funding for several INSPIRE award s prevented the timely obligation of these funds. Anticipated Obligation: FY 2017 Quarter 3 Amount: $199,402 Reason: Processing a new awardee in the Major Research Instrumentation Program delayed obligating the award. Anticipated Obligation: FY 2017 Q uarter 3 National Coordination Office for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NCO/NITRD) Amount: $617,984 Reason: NCO was unable to secure a lease with GSA in time to obligate the funds. The Reimbursable Work Authorization was completed in November 2016. Obligated: FY 2017 Quarter Reason: NNCO's planned move and the timing of GSA's negotiation of the new lease precluded obligating the funds in FY 2016. In addition, carryover funding was needed to cover costs to complete the required Nuclear Regulatory Commission study. Obligated: FY 2017 Quarter 1 The remaining R&RA carryover of $2.50 million consists of funds from throughout the Foundation for projects that were not ready for obligation in FY 2016. Within the Education and Human Resources (EHR) account, $5.37 million was carried over into FY 2017. Excellence Awards in Science and Engineering (EASE) Amount: $2.93 million FY 201 8 NSF Budget Request to Congress Technical Info - 13 Reason: Delays in the selection of a contractor to assist with the administration of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching program, which is managed by EHR on behalf of OSTP. Obligated: FY 2017 Quarter 2 Inclusion Across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) Amount: $720,192 Reason: Delays in obligation is due to the pre -award process for multiple new awardees. Obligated: FY 2017 1.62 million Reason: Robert Noyce program funding was carried over into FY 2017 for awards that were not ready for obligation. Anticipated Obligation: FY 2017 Quarter 4 The remaining $97,719 are residual funds from various EHR program activities. Within the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction no-year account, $37.21 million was carried over into FY 2017. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Amount: $28.41 million Reason: FY 2016 obligations were limited due to constru ction management transition. For additional information, please see the NEON section of the MREFC Chapter. Obligated: FY 2017 Quarter $6.70 million Reason: These funds reflect updated NSF policy for the ov ersight of contingency, as discussed in the MREFC chapter. Anticipated Obligation: TBD - Funds held in reserve until needed. The remaining $2.10 million is from completed projects. These projects are Ocean Observatories Initiative, Atacama Large Millimete r Array, South Pole Station Modernization, Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, and Large Hadron Collider. A portion of these carryover funds will be used for the enhanced oversight of MREFC projects. Within the Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM) no -year component, $23.71 million was carried over into FY 2017. NSF Headquarters Relocation Amount: $23.71 million Reason: to FY 2017. Anticipated Obligation: FY 2017 Quarter 3 Within the Office of Inspector General (OIG) two-year account, $380,002 was carried over into FY 2017. Office of the Inspector General Technical Informa tion Technical Info - 14 Amount: $380,002 Reason: Funds are expected to be used to procure audit and forensic contracts. The selection of awards and institutions to be audited will require careful preparation and is subject to changing circumstances and new information that may require additional time to process.

These amounts include the obligation of prior year appropr iations and other adjustments, and are therefore different from the FY 2016 Enacted Level. The sources of the variation are: Transfer of funds across appropriation accounts. Recoveries from prior year appropriations. This occurs when an award obligated in FY 2015 was de -obligated in FY 2016 and then re -obligated in FY 2016. Unobligated funds carried over from the previous year. Most activities in the R&RA and EHR accounts have two -year funding, so the carry over and the recoveries are associated with the F Y 2015 appropriation. Funding for Polar Programs, Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and Major Research Equipment and Faciliti es Construction activities is no -year, so additional obligations in FY 2016 could be associated with earlier years as well.
