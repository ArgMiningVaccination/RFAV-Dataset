[Prevalence of clinical mitral-valve prolapse in 1169 young women.](/papers/prevalence-of-clinical-mitral-valve-prolapse-in-1169-young-4nx130vjkw) 13 May 1976 [The New England Journal of Medicine](/journals/the-new-england-journal-of-medicine-3hxg8303)316 citations We conclude that in a selected population of patients with mitral-valve prolapse, those with the classic form (leaflet thickening and redundancy) are at higher risk than those without these features for the infectious and hemodynamic complications of mitral-valve prolapse, but not for stroke. Mitral-valve prolapse is considerably less common than previously reported among young patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including unexplained stroke, and no more common than among controls. Individuals with uncomplicated mitral valve prolapse did not have an increased risk of stroke, although a small increase in the risk may not have been detected. [Risk of stroke with mitral valve prolapse in population-based cohort study](/papers/risk-of-stroke-with-mitral-valve-prolapse-in-population-17274xzm1t) 01 Jan 1995 [Stroke](/journals/stroke-3dzqs8qa)54 citations This association may partly explain the observed genetic distribution of mitral valve prolapse. [Mitral valve prolapse and body habitus in children.](/papers/mitral-valve-prolapse-and-body-habitus-in-children-q7lnkkj16h) 01 Jan 1993 [Pediatric Cardiology](/journals/pediatric-cardiology-1vgvicvc)11 citations In a community based sample of the population, the prevalence of mitral-valve prolapse was lower than previously reported. [Prevalence and clinical outcome of mitral-valve prolapse.](/papers/prevalence-and-clinical-outcome-of-mitral-valve-prolapse-3l38xxl3np) 01 Jul 1999 [The New England Journal of Medicine](/journals/the-new-england-journal-of-medicine-3hxg8303)848 citations It is suggested that this sequence of events be considered as a possible pathogenetic mechanism of isolated mitral valve prolapse, particularly in the subset of aged patients. Furthermore, the risk may be higher than is indicated by this study, since 46 per cent of the controls underwent echocardiography for clinically suspected mitral-valve prolapse, suggesting an overrepresentation of mitral prolapse in the control group.
