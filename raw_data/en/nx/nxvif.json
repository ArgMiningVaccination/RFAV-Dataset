The rise of Mali began under Sundiata's rule. He was a mighty warrior and an impressive magician. With his great army he took over the salt and gold mines which then helped his empire thrive even more. Sundiata worked to improve agriculture and farming within the empire. For example, he cleared brand new land for beans, onions, and rice crops. He even introduced a new crop, cotton. The people evaluated cottons value and found that it was very useful, so they started selling it to other people. Sundiata took local leaders powers away and gave the responsibilities to himself.

This leads to a greater Word War II has been the most significant war in the history of civilization. It killed over 60 million soldiers and, innocent people. The war was incorporated into two significant campaigns which were Kokoda and Tobruk. Kokoda combatants were Australia and, United States. The war was fought in July 1942 to November 1942 against Japan. Tobruk's combatant were Nazi Germany and Italy. Tobruk started their war on April 10, 1941 to November 27, 1941 against Australia- British. There are two sides to every story to many Australians Kokoda was recognized as the efforts of the Australian soldiers being critical to the defense of Australia against the threat of the Imprial Japanese Army. Such famous historic figures such as paul Keating and John Howard retelling the Kokoda story with the exaggeration of the Anzac's defending Asutralia. But to some Australian's such as the former senior historian at the Australia war memorial, DR Peter Stanley, has stated that the Japanese were not planning to make themselves masters of Australia in 1942 and that any Japanese threat to Australia in 1942 was greatly exaggerated by wartime prime minister John Curtin for his own political ends.

During World War 2, the battle for the Kokoda Track played a significant role in ensuring that Australia was safe from a Japanese invasion.

To ensure that Australia was safe from the Japanese, Australian troops fought against the Japanese on the Kokoda Track. The effect this battle had on Australia will be discussed through looking at what happened in the battle for the Kokoda Track; the efforts of the Australian troops who fought in the battle; and the impact the battle had on the Australians back home. Yusef Komunyakaa's poem and Stephen Crane's excerpt factor similar and different events throughout their stories. While Crane's piece is written from one man's point of view, Komunyakaa uses the collective voice of a group of soldiers. In Crane's excerpt, it talks more about fighting, what's happening and going on in the war. In the poem, it talks more about what the soldiers do to mask their feelings and their emotions to stay strong and not get distracted thinking of memories of family.

These \"papers\" define the whole life of an African person without any type of documentary reinforcements. In Alexandra, people are forced to bear passbooks at all times to strictly limit the movements of black Africans. They live in continuous fear of being caught without them, so they remain incognito from the authority because it is a major crime in apartheid.
