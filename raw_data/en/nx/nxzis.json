Now our focus has changed to the preservation of tooth by treatments such as root canal, cosmetic filling, full mouth bridge, and more and more, but most of us fail to realize that associated with the oral disorder is the various system of the body that work continuously for maintaining the dental health of a person. One may wonder how Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) can be beneficial in dentistry. CAM may offer great benefits for the outcome of dental treatments since the treatment of dental disease does not depend only on the use of modern dental services. Complementary and Alternative medicine is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not considered to be part of conventional medicine. The CAM system includes: Homeopathic Remedies Meaning of Homeopathy The term Homeopathy comes from the Greek roots Homoios, meaning similar, and Pathos meaning suffering and sickness. Samual Christian Friedrih Hahnemann, a German physician, formulated the theory of homeopathy in the 1800s. Homeopathy treatments are based on three principles: This principle states that like cures like, which means that the correct remedy for a person's disease is that substance that produces in a healthy person. This principle state that medicine must be simple and single substance since collective effect of a mixture of different substances would be different. This primal and vital force is dynamic, immaterial, energetic, spirit-like force that embodies the essence of life and all its metabolic and functional activities. The dynamic nature of the Vital Force allows us to respond to all influential factors but instantaneously in a holistic way. The derangement of this vital force led to abnormal sensation and body function which constitute the disease. What Are Homeopathic Remedies? The fundamental of homeopathy is knowing and understanding symptoms, how they happen, and how they affect the body physically, psychologically, mentally, and emotionally; it is a medical system that utilizes a person's basic healing properties to achieve optimum health. Homeopathy remedies are a safe, natural alternative, non-addictive, and curative form of medicine to promote overall health & well-being in both adults and children. The remedies used in homeopathy are dilutions of natural substances derived from vegetable or mineral sources, not drugs or chemicals. In dentistry, homeopathy remedies are natural alternatives and biocompatible approaches to oral prevention and treatment.

Essential Oils & Oral Probiotic Although essential oils (EOs) have been used for various ailments since the ancient ages as holistic healing, they have blossomed in popularity throughout recent years, and their use in dentistry is no exception. All essential oils are derived from a plant source (leaf, root, bark, flower, or fruit); the pure essential oils are distilled from the plants with no additives. They are produced through two types of processes: extraction and distillation. They are comparable to human cells and tissues in their chemical structures, which makes it easy for the body to identify and accept them. Essential oils can produce more than one therapeutic effect due to their antiseptic and non-toxic properties, in contrast to synthetic chemicals that usually have one action and many side effects. With nearly 3,000 types of essential oils with a list of potential benefits for each one, there are endless possibilities to choose from. The most common oil is Coconut Oil, which is thought to diminish oral bacteria and draw toxins from the body while providing an antioxidant effect. Coconut oils are not considered essential oil but are used as the best oil for diluting essential oils. Rules of Essential Oils The oil pulling effect is when oil binds to the bacteria and draws the toxins from the body. Coconut oil, Sesame, and Sunflower oils may be used for oil pulling effect to have an antibacterial effect against bacteria in the mouth, thrush, halitosis (bad breath), and plaque-induced gingivitis. Essential oils such as Lavender and Orange may be used to not only provide a pleasant smell but also reduce anxiety and improve mood by stimulating parasympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous systems. Many studies have proven that essential oils such as Tea Tree (Melaleuca), Peppermint, Sweet Basil, and Thyme have exhibited substantial inhibitory effects and intracanal antiseptic solutions (antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral) four common Staphylococcus Aureus, Enterococcus Fecalis, Escherichia Coli, and Candida Albicans. Peppermint oils have the ability to inhibit biofilm formation in the oral cavity in addition to providing a therapeutic benefit in treating periodontitis, gingivitis, and halitosis. Essential oils like Clove are the most popular oil in the dental field, which acts as anesthetic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal agent. Clove oil contains a chemical called \"Eugenol\". It's used in the treatment of dry sockets, tooth pain associated with pulpitis, and hypersensitivity. Essential oils like Cinnamon may possess an anti-melanoma effect due to the antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects of cinnamon. Cinnamon could protect human cells against a spontaneous mutation in the human cells.
