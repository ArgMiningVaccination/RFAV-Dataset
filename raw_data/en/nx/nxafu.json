Introduction Physical education trends have developed recently to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical sports. Introducing students to activities like football, basketball, bowling, walking, hiking or frisbee at an early age can help students develop good activity habits that will carry over into adulthood. Some teachers have even begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, deep-breathing and martial arts. Studies have shown that physical activity enhances muscular strength and endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and provides many other physical benefits. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood. It can be taught to any age student making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Teaching non-traditional sports to students may also provide the necessary motivation for students to increase their activity and can help students learn about different cultures. Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising. Many people see physical education as physical activity or game. Physical activity or game is only a subset of the entire physical education curriculum; however, physical activity or Game is the key foundation of a successful physical education program. In today's high-tech society, a successful physical education plays an important role in the physical growth and development of students in fighting against the sedentary lifestyle. Through physical education, students acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes, and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle. It also provides an avenue for students to express themselves through movement and physical activity. 1.1 ROLE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT 6 1.1 Physical and emotional needs of the children Physical activity is critical to the development and maintenance of good health. Research shows that regular physical activity can help reduce your risk for several diseases and health conditions and improve your overall quality of life. Physical fitness involves the efficient functioning of your body organs. Fitness influences to a great degree not only to physical health but also the health of our mind such as mental alertness and emotional stability. When physical activity is combined with proper nutrition, it can help control weight and prevent obesity, a major risk factor for many diseases. Physical activity helps to reduce body fat by building or preserving muscle mass and improving the body's ability to use calories. Scientist in the field of Physical education recommends at least one hour of regular physical activity to be an integral part of our daily routine. Once you begin to exercise regularly, you will tone your muscles; increase the cardiovascular capacity, improve flexibility. As your body condition improves, you will discover many more reasons why exercise is so important to have a better quality of life. Exercise reduces stress, lifts moods, and helps us sleep better. Physical activity helps in the following: Developing and maintaining good health. Taking preventive measure against disease. Improving mental and physiological strength and physical fitness. Improving mental concentration. Building self-esteem Physical activity or exercise is often misunderstood and the sole contributor of the overall development of an induvial. It is very important to understand and differentiate meaning of physical activity and the overall health. Let us understand what does it mean to be 'healthy' and what are the major components of health. 7 Health Triangle The health triangle--also known as the Wellness Triangle--represents three aspects of living that contribute to optimal health. The three areas involve the physical, social and mental well-being of the individual. Each aspect makes up a side of the triangle. Optimal health is achieved once a balance between the three areas is reached. The concept of the health triangle was first introduced by the World Health Organization in 1948, which stressed the need for overall balance to achieve health and wellness. Figure: 1.1 - Health Tringle 8 Physical Health Physical health is one the most important component of the Health Triangle. When we say that a person is physically healthy, we understand that the person is not only externally healthy (healthy *BMI) but also internally healthy which refers to an efficient functioning of all his internal organ systems. The way to achieve this health is depicted in the diagram given below. Figure: 1.2 - Physical health 9 Mental Health The mental side of the health triangle has to do with an individual's cognitive and emotional well-being. A person is mentally healthy if he shows the following traits: Free of stress Able to think clearly and positively Able to focus or concentrate Reasonable memory Control over his/her emotion Free from depression and any mental disorders A mentally healthy person is able to learn well. Learning is the key to the development of skills, behaviors and knowledge. Social Health Social Health is the ability to live harmoniously in a society. One can develop social health by investing in relationships within family, friends and community. Social health is about realizing one's role in a society and being able to live by the rules and the norms defined for a harmonious community living. This requires respect towards self and others, effective communication skills, empathy and responsibility towards the environment. A good level of social health cannot be achieved unless one is able to care about other persons needs and respond positively. Figure: 1.3 - Mental health 10 The overall concept behind the health triangle is the importance of having all three sides in balance. When one side is off balance, the other two areas ultimately suffer. The physical side serves as the foundation for the other two, meaning both emotional (mental) and social health will be negatively affected when the body is sick or weak. Physical activity/sports provide the perfect opportunity to build Physical Health, thereby directly impacting social and mental health. Team games are perfect set ups where one learns how to interact with people from different backgrounds, levels of proficiency, age groups, gender, etc. groups, gender, etc. Step 1Play your favourite game with your friends for 30 to 40 minutesStep 2List the activities you performed and the skills you learnt eg. kicking, throwing, catching, passing etc.Step 4Write a short note ( 50 words) on what you gained from the activities/ games in terms of social, physical and mental healthStep 3 List down the feelings that you went through while performing the activities listed by youSocial, physical and mental health Figure: 1.5 - Step by step of achieving social, physical, and mental health 11 What have you learnt? After completing this session, you will be able to Identify the physical and emotional needs of the children Identify the Cognitive development and Psychosocial wellbeing of the children Materials Required: Props and equipment mentioned in the above Session. Conduct on-ground activities/ games with the props available and relate the use to age appropriateness. Checklist for Assessment Activity Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity. Part A Students could differentiate between 1. Physical and mental health 2. Mental and social health 3. Cognitive, Affective domain and Physical domain Part B Subjective Question 1. How physical, mental, and social health of an individual is inter-related? 2. What steps one should take to improve one's physical health? Activity 12 1.2 Factors Influencing Physical Activities In the previous chapters we learned about the factors affecting physical activities or the sports as whole. In this chapter let us understand the other factors like society and their influence in promoting physical activities and sports culture. Recap Physical fitness is the ability of an individual to perform day to day activities without undue fatigue Physical fitness is roughly divided into two - health related physical fitness and skill related physical fitness Physical fitness is an ability which differs from person to person and can also be highly trainable. There are 8 components of physical fitness - muscular strength, explosive strength, muscular endurance, speed, agility, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance and body composition. Factors affecting physical fitness 1. Age: Age is a chief factor which influences physical fitness. Physical fitness is measured by assessing physiological and physical performance. These physiological and physical performances vary according to age. These variations are depending on growth and development of muscles, bones, nervous system and other internal organs. As we age our physical size increases along with our functional and performance capacity 2. Gender: Male and female are different in terms of body composition and physiological functioning. These differences cater to gender specific roles assigned by nature. At the same time these differences also affect the physical fitness of male and female. There is a clear difference in the ability of male and female to continue an activity for a specific period of time, it's intensity and development of physical fitness as it's effect 3. Body composition: Body composition refers to the percentage of body weight that is composed of fat as compared with fat free or lean tissue (muscles). Body composition can be explained by somatotyping. Somatotyping is a technique to 13 divide people into three different types based on body shape and physique type. These types are known as \u00fc Endomorph \u00fc Mesomorph \u00fc Ectomorph Each body types mentioned above has its own advantages and disadvantages in achieving desired amount of physical fitness. For example, ectomorph is a lean and thin body frame. It is unrealistic for an ectomorph to achieve the same amount of muscular strength as an endomorph. 4. Nutrition: Physical fitness is highly affected by the energy input and output balance. The energy input is in the form of food intake the quantity as well as the quality of food and output is in the form of physical exercise. An important element of this nutrient intake is water. The diet requirement varies based on body type and nature of activity. A person should consume optimum nutrition based on his activity level and fitness goal. 5. Climatic conditions: Different climatic conditions affect the fitness level of an individual in many ways. Food pattern and activity level defers according to the season of the year. This phenomenon has a direct impact on the fitness level of an individual. Apart from that different geographical locations have different climatic conditions. This has significance in the food habits and physical activity patterns of people living in those locations. Different climatic conditions require different training requirements to develop and maintain physical fitness. Figure: 1.6 - Type of Body Composition 14 6. Lifestyle habits: These play a very important role in the fitness and wellbeing of a person. Starting with desk jobs, city life, lack of walking options, airconditioned home and offices, smoking and drinking habits, eating outside food etc. 7. Physical Activity: As discussed, lack of physical activity is one of the most important factors affecting physical fitness. Physical activity is critical for overall health at every age. Any form of exercise or movement of our body that uses energy is described as a physical activity. Regular physical activity includes participation in moderate and vigorous exercises and muscle strengthening activities. 15 INFLUENCE OF SOCIETY ON SPORT We all know and have experienced the impact sports make in our lives and in the society we all live in. There are numerous examples of positive impacts sports have made in different societies. But have you ever thought the other way around? How does a society can impact sports? How a society develops or reshape sports? The simplest definition of society is a group of people who share a defined territory and a culture. All human societies have a culture and culture can only exist where there is a society. Culture refers to the agreed norms, values, beliefs, interests, behaviours of the majority of people in a society. Culture is a way of life which is directly affected by the various factors in a society like environment, economy, political system and technology to name a few. For example, we say some societies are culturally oriented towards sports, it simply means that these factors directly or indirectly contribute towards the sporting culture in that society. But these factors are ever changing and these changes can be positive or negative. The advancement in economy, political system, technology, can lead to the advancement in sporting culture and the deterioration can also lead to the decline of the same. Let us discuss some examples of direct impact of society on sports based on the following factors. Environment: People sharing a common heritage or culture can have a different inclination or liking towards different games based on their geographical location, availability of play space and infrastructure. Adventure sports like mountaineering, skiing, bungee jumping, water rafting, etc. are common in northern and north-eastern parts of India. Similarly, water sports, beach volleyball, kayaking, are more common with the people living in coastal areas. The reason being the easy availability and easy access to places suited for these sports. It is likely that the people from these geographical locations are naturally fitter than the people living in other parts as they are exposed to more physically demanding games and sports. This makes them more obvious to get into sports which require more Figure: 1.7 - Water sports in Kerala Figure: 1.8 - Kids enjoying volleyball in Ladakh 16 physical strength and endurance. Athletes from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Manipur, Sikkim, Punjab, have excelled in various sports like football, boxing, volleyball, basketball, track and field. Economy: Economy plays an important role in the development of sports. Modern day sports require sports equipment and infrastructures of the best quality in order to excel and reach a certain level of competency. The countries which are spending huge amount of money in developing their sports infrastructures are the ones leading the Olympic medal tallies. Sports is no more performance oriented based on individual prowess but the infrastructure one gets exposed to also plays an important role. Top athletes are paid skyhigh salaries for their performances. Only the countries with the best available sports infrastructures can afford to have them play. This also leads to the creation of high-quality tournaments. Indian Premiere League (IPL) today attracts top athletes from the world of cricket. The rise of the Indian cricket team is the direct result of the quality tournaments being held in the country. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is among the richest sporting bodies in the world and is in a position to conduct tournaments of this magnitude because of the money it is generating from the public. The high growth economy, rapid rise of the middle class with disposable income and leisure time in India has contributed to the rapid growth in media, internet and television, driving interest and value in sports content. Bollywood glamour attracts rapid growth in advertising as local and international companies target this lucrative market. Involvement of Bollywood stars have given rise to public consciousness of sports. This attraction is reviving the games like Kabaddi and Hockey which were almost on the verge of extinction. Technology: Economy and technology are correlated. The advancement in technology is the direct result of the advancement in economy. A country with a good economy has the power to spend on technology, a must for any performance oriented sports. The decline of Indian hockey is a direct reflection of the slow progress in technology in the field of sports. Team India was the most feared team in the world with a record number of eight gold medals in Olympics. Figure: 1.9 - Kid playing football without shoe 17 The poor performances of Indian team in the field hockey are directly related to the introduction of artificial playing field like astro-turf. The advancement in technology and the involvement of science in sports led countries like Australia and Germany towards the pinnacle of field hockey. It is only in recent years that the Indian Hockey Federation has introduced astro-turf in hockey stadiums around the country. The Indian market presents a tantalizing prospect for organizations across the business of sport including: Local and international brands looking for ways to build their share of a huge consumer market Sports federations hoping to boost participation and grow commercial revenues Event and tour organizers seeking new destinations for sport Agencies and sport professional services aiming to grow internationally Stadium architects and contractors wanting to explore new opportunities. Political: Political stability or instability has a major impact in the world of sports. Kashmir is a live example where the current political situation has push them back to the stage where living is a priority on staying fit and healthy. Playing is a fundamental right to every children, but most of the times we saw the pictures of small kids throwing stones on the army people. Although throwing is a fundamental skill but instead of applying these skills on the field of sports they applying it on the road side. As we know, Olympic Games were conducted with the intention of bringing fragmented Greek states together. Truce was declared when these games were held. Contrary to the intention of ancient Olympic Games, in modern times Olympics were stopped due to wars. The 1916 Olympic Games were cancelled because of World War I, and the 1940 and 1944 Olympics were cancelled due to World War II. In 1920 Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Turkey were all banned from taking part because they were on the losing side in World War I. Japan, West Germany and East Germany did not attend the 1948 London Games. In 1960, South Africa was banned from the Olympics because of its racist policy. The 1972 Munich Games had few African participants because the African countries objected to the presence of the team from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). 20 countries withdrew from the 1976 Montreal Games because of New Zealand's rugby contacts with South Africa. United States of America (and about 60 allies) boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics Games. And the negative impacts due to the political frictions did not end with the history; even today countries Figure: 1.10 - Technology has a good impact on performance 18 like India and Pakistan do not play any international matches against each other except during the world cups. Figure: 1.11 - Destroyed stadium in Kashmir Figure: 1.12 - Boy aiming at police in Kashmir 19 What have you learnt?

Conduct on-ground activities/ games with the props available and relate the use to age appropriateness. Checklist for Assessment Activity Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity. Part A Differentiate between Environmental and technological factors in a society that affects sports positively Economic and political factors in a society that affects sports negatively Part B Subjective Question Four major factors in a society due to which sports develop or deteriorate/ decline. How do different sports gain popularity in different region due to environmental factors? What is the influence of sports in society What are the four major factors of a society that affects sports? List three modern technology used in Cricket matches Name the games that are famous in different parts of India due to environmental/ geographical advantages. Himachal Pradesh: Kerala: West Bengal: Manipur: Activity 20 1.3 Plan Physical Activities for Children As we have already understood that games and sports foster all-round development of children. Healthy body hosts a healthy mind. Sports and games direct energy of children to fruitful channels. It is said that play is the most useful leisure time activity of the adolescents. It is training for future. In the absence of opportunities for play, children get more engaged in sedentary activities such as computer games, video games, TV etc. and end up becoming obese, lethargic and prone to sickness/diseases. The Secondary Education Commission has made it compulsory for all the schools and educational institutions to have playing field along with the other necessary infrastructure. And suggests to schools where there are no proper playing fields to make use of the municipal parks or any open space available in the neighbourhood. This positive effort from the government can be made effective by a structured physical activity program. For the holistic development of children, physical education in school should incorporate the following: Activities should be fun so as to encourage all children to participate. Skills should be taught according to the diamond structure given below. Activities, props and equipment have be 'age appropriate'. Activities must to be structured and planned properly. All the children must be involved and none should be left behind. Progress of each child must be mapped through continuous assessment and remedial measures should be taken to ensure that learning outcomes are achieved. 21 Identifying physical activity sessions At this age, children are willing to experiment and explore. This is the right age for introducing the child to all sports skills. Their movement skills are well tuned and are well coordinated by now. They have a good mastery over their body, and their fundamental skills are good enough for them to perform new skills and new movement sequences. Children who cannot perform various skills properly should be provided additional learning and practice opportunities to improve their skills. Practice opportunities should be provided to children with sufficient time to develop the skills required. At this age most of the skills can be executed in the correct manner. Practice will make them perfect. Fitness activities become increasingly important at this age. If children are involved in sports and fitness activities now, one can be sure that the child will remain involved in sports through adolescence. Children who participate in moderate to vigorous physical activities for about an hour on three to four days each week can increase overall health. In this age we should not let any child to specialize in a particular sport even if they are very good in that sport. Encourage them to learn and participate different sport activities. At this age, the body is still developing, therefore, all skills need to be practised for a holistic development. At this age, children develop a self-image, strong enough to tolerate differences in how others react to them. They develop a stronger sense of right and wrong, having reached the stage of development for internalization of rules and regulations. They tend to become more self-reliant and can work independently. This is a good time to have children create personal fitness and motor skill goals and monitor their own progress, because they have a strong desire for self-improvement. These children also experience an increased desire for interaction with others. Children at this age have great interest in games and team sports. They will work hard and play hard. At this age, children like to demonstrate their skills and willingly try to perform better with time. They experience a lot of gratification because their timing is now more under control. They tend to be very interested in competitive sports. 22 Structuring physical activity sessions The physical activity in the primary years should be on introduction to basics of major sports in addition to developing fitness level of the students. The above picture explains the year/grade wise focus on the type of sports program. 23 Macro-planning A macro plan is a bigger picture, it's short and concise, just hitting the important highlights. The macro level is a snapshot of what you want to accomplish. For example: your end goal is, that a child should be able to play football basic so that is your Macro-Planning Meso-planning The meso-planning is a breakdown of each week or pair of Weeks with the goal to improve one or two things in that shorter period of time. The meso level of fitness is how you apply the planning to changes the results you will get. For example: To play football, what are the basic skills the child should learn, implementing those in your planning will be your Meso planning Micro-planning The micro-planning is a daily or couple day breakdown of specific skill or activities that are planned to improve upon one another to achieve the goals set in both the mesocycle and macrocycle. For example: How you are going to plan a session so that the child will be able to learn the fundamental skill of football. That will be your Micro planning Weekly planning In case of micro planning, we focus on one or two skills. However in weekly plan we focus on 2 - 3 sets of lesson plans that you want to finish. These planning are important things that move the child towards the long-term goals. Weekly planning will give you confidence and it is a short-term goal that you are setting for that group. These weekly plans should be followed by a visual assessment during the class to check the progress Weekly plan for grade 4-A- Week 1 Weekly plan for grade 4-A- Week 2 Monday FB.1: Ball control Monday FB.1: Passing Tuesday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday Figure: 1.15 -Macro, meso, and micro planning 24 Thursday FB.2: Dribbling Thursday FB.2: Shooting Friday Friday Saturday Saturday Following are examples of lesson plans to be read, understood and executed on the ground for Grade 3 to 5. Pay attention to the structure of the lesson plan which starts with goal and ends with learning outcome conclusion. Please refer to the section of warm-up and cool-down exercises If possible find a suitable school (Primary school) in your locality and take permission to do the following activities with the children. Best Time to perform these activities: 2 hours After having meal Reason: (It will provide sufficient energy to the body for these kind of activities) Figure: 1.16-Weekly plan for grade 4 kids 25 Football - Lessons on Ball Control Objective: Children will learn the skill of ball control in challenging situations.

Props & equipment required: Swimming rings, marking cones, saucer cones, hula hoops and bibs Coaching points Sprinting Tell the students that sprinting is fundamental to athletics. Tell students that they should keep their head steady, no wobbly movements. Good sprinting technique requires fast reactions, good acceleration and an efficient style of running. The upper body is inclined forward. Keep the arms bent (900) at the elbows. Arms should not be stiff while swinging. While sprinting students should run on the balls of the feet. Warm-up - 5 min Easy walking, jogging and gentle stretching exercises. Activity - 25 min Introduction and Sprint Practise (5 min) Divide students into groups of 10. Instruct students to perform shuttle run between cones 15metres apart. Repeat 3 times. Discuss the use of arms during acceleration, and the push from the back foot in order to run effectively. Sprint Start \"On your marks\" After the \"on your mark\" command the student should assume a crouch position (refer to the diagram) at the start line. Body weight should be distributed equally on the rear knee and hands. The arms should be shoulder width apart. 41 Ask the students not to touch the start line. The shoulders are kept forward, slightly ahead of the hands. Ask the student to keep the stronger leg in front. \"Set\" At the \"set\" command the student should raise his/her seat. At this position the athlete/student is like a coiled spring. The body weight is equally supported by arms and legs. The back and head form a straight line, ask the student to keep looking at the ground. \"Go/Clap/Fire\" Ask the student to vigorously extend his/her forward leg. The knee of the rear leg is driven forward. Ask the student to swing the arms vigorously. Ask the students to keep forward inclination for the first few steps. Gold Rush (15 min) Mark a rectangular field before the game begins. Divide students into teams A and B and divide the field in half using saucer cones. One team should be wearing bibs. At both ends of the field, on each team's side, there is a hoop containing several swimming rings or marking cones. The objective of the game is for students to run to the other team's side, take a ring from the hoop and run back to their side without being tagged. Students can be tagged when they are on the opponents' side of the field. Any player caught on the opponents' side, is frozen. 42 The free players can run over and link arms with the frozen players to free them. When two players are linked they cannot be tagged, but must return right away to their own side. There is a guard for the hoop containing the rings, but no member of the team is allowed in their own hoop. Players who make it across the field to the opponents' hoop are allowed to stand inside it without being tagged, but they still have to make it back to their side with the ring. Any player tagged on the way back with a ring, must freeze and must return the ring. Please refer to the diagram below Cool-down - 5 min Have children move slowly (e.g. in a slow jog, brisk walk) around the activity area. Lead or have a student lead a stretching routine. 43 Yoga - A Preview Yoga is a systematic and methodical process to control and develop the mind and body to attain good health, balance of mind and self-realization. Yoga can help to develop health, improve concentration, increase flexibility and strengthen willpower. If possible, establish a regular time of day to set aside for the Yoga practice. Generally, yoga is a disciplined method utilized for attaining a goal. The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha though the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated. Apart from the spiritual goals the physical postures of yoga are used to alleviate health problems, reduce stress and make the spine supple in contemporary times. Yoga is also used as a complete exercise program and physical therapy routine. \"Health is a state of complete harmony of the body, mind and spirit. When one is free from physical disabilities and mental distractions, the gates of the soul open.\" -B.K.S. Iyengar 44 Yoga - Benefits 1. All-round fitness. You are truly healthy when you are not just physically fit but also mentally and emotionally balanced. As Sri Sri Ravi Shankar puts it, \"Health is not a mere absence of disease. It is a dynamic expression of life - in terms of how joyful, loving and enthusiastic you are.\" This is where yoga helps: postures, pranayama (breathing techniques) and meditation are a holistic fitness. 2. Weight loss. With regular practice of yoga, we tend to become more sensitive to the kind of food our body asks for and when. This can also help keep a check on weight. 3. Stress relief. A few minutes of yoga during the day can be a great way to get rid of stress that accumulates daily - in both the body and mind. Yoga postures, pranayama and meditation are effective techniques to release stress. You can also experience how yoga helps de-tox the body and de-stress the mind. 4. Inner peace. We all love to visit peaceful, serene spots, rich in natural beauty. Little do we realize that peace can be found right within us and we can take a mini-vacation to experience this any time of the day! Benefit from a small holiday every day with yoga and meditation. Yoga is also one of the best ways to calm a disturbed mind. 5. Improved immunity. Our system is a seamless blend of the body, mind and spirit. An irregularity in the body affects the mind and similarly unpleasantness or restlessness in the mind can manifest as an ailment in the body. Yoga poses massage organs and strengthen muscles; breathing techniques and meditation release stress and improve immunity. 6. Living with greater awareness. The mind is constantly involved in activity - swinging from the past to the future - but never staying in the present. By simply being aware of this tendency of the mind, we can actually save ourselves from getting stressed or worked up and relax the mind. Yoga and pranayama help create that awareness and bring the mind back to the present moment, where it can stay happy and focused. 7. Better relationships. Yoga can even help improve your relationship with your parents, friends or loved ones! A mind that is relaxed, happy and contented is better able to deal with sensitive relationship matters. Yoga and meditation work on keeping the mind happy and peaceful; benefit from the strengthened special bond you share with people close to you. 45 8. Increased energy. Do you feel completely drained out by the end of the day? Shuttling between multiple tasks through the day can sometimes be quite exhausting. A few minutes of yoga everyday provides the secret to feeling fresh and energetic even after a long day. A 10-minute of meditation benefits you immensely, leaving you refreshed and recharged in the middle of a hectic day. 9. Better flexibility & posture. You need to include yoga in your daily routine to benefit from a body that is strong, supple and flexible. Regular yoga practice stretches and tones the body muscles and also makes them strong. It also helps improve your body posture when you stand, sit, sleep or walk. This would, in turn, help pain due to incorrect posture. 10. Better intuition. Yoga and meditation have the power to improve your intuitive ability so that you effortlessly realize what needs to be done, when and how, to yield positive results. It works. You only need to experience it yourself. Yoga is a continuous process. So keep practicing! The deeper you move into your yoga practice, the more profound are its benefits. Best Time to perform yoga: Early morning Reason: (boosting mental clarity and relaxation, increasing the release of endorphins (happy hormones) and making the body a more physically comfortable place to live in) Asanas Standing Asanas 46 Sitting Asnas Asnas in lying position Shavasana: Shavasana is performed after completion of all the yogic exercises. Lie down on the back. Keep the arms alongside the body, but slightly separated from the body, and turn the palms to face upwards. Close your eyes. Relax the whole body, including the face. Let the breath occur naturally. Stay in the same position for 2-3 minutes. 47 Sun Salutation (Surya Namaskar) Sun Salutation is a worship to Sun, the god of light. Surya Namaskar is the other name for Sun salutation. Morning time is best, but anyhow if you are unable to do Surya Namaskar in morning then do it in evening or either when your stomach is empty. There are certain benefits of Surya Namaskar like fat reduction, expansion of lungs, improved blood circulation, good digestive system without constipation. There are 12 steps of Surya Namaskar. 12 steps of Surya Namaskar: Step 1 (Pranamasana): Stand with your feet together. Place the palms of your hands together at chest level. Step 2 (Hasta Uttanasana): Inhale and raise your arms upward. Slowly stretch your arms backwards over your head.Step 3 (Paadahastasana): Exhale and slowly bend forward, let hands touch feet or the ground. Try to touch your head to the knees.

Make sure to look up. Step 5 (Chaturanga Dandasana): While exhaling bring the left foot together with the right to the beginning position of push up. Step 6 (Ashtanga Namaskara): Continue to exhale as you lower your body to the floor until your feet, knees, palm, chest and forehead are touching the floor. This is called \"Sastanga Namaskara\" where eight body parts are in contact with the floor. The buttocks are raised up in this position. Step 7 (Bhujangasana): Inhale and stretch forward and up. Use your arms to lift your torso. Make sure that you only bend back as far as it feels safe and comfortable. (It is ok to keep your arms bent at the elbow). This is called the \"Kobra position\". Step 8 (Adho Mukha Shvanasana): Exhale, Raise the buttocks, push the head down and have a complete arch with the heels touching the ground and palms on the floor. Step 9 (Ashwa Sanchalasana): Inhale and step your right foot forward into the lunge position. Step 10 (Paadahastasana): Exhale and bring your feet together trying to bring your head to your knees. Step 11 (Hasta Uttanasana): Keep your arms extended as you raise them above your head. Lean slightly back. Step 12: Exhale and in a slow graceful motion let your arms go your sides. End by bringing your hands back to prayer position. 49 What have you learnt?

To determine the design and the investments required in a sports facility, one needs to be clear about the purpose of such a facility. The purpose of such a facility could vary from a community recreation center to a facility to conduct competitions. The success of a sports facility is decided by its usage. In order for the facility to be popular it needs to be well equipped and maintained. The subset and the most important of a sports facility are the props and equipment used to get the optimal experience from it. Let us first understand the difference between Props and Equipment Props are the tools/learning aides that we use in physical activity to 1. Mark play spaces 2. To learn and practice skills 3. To improve fitness Equipment is all the material associated with the sport which is needed to play a sport. Other than the above primary usage of props they are also useful in 1. Making any physical activity colourful and attractive 2. Helping create a variety of drills for practicing skills 3. Helping create age appropriate challenges 4. Increasing the interest and the engagement of the children. 2. PROPS AND EQUIPMENT 52 2.2 Factors affecting selection of props and equipment Sports equipment or props (as discussed above) plays and important role in having a sporting experience. They vary in shape, size, type, etc. depending on the factors such as indoor/ outdoor sport, age of the learners, infrastructure availability, etc. Regardless, of the type of sport, there are some important factors that need to kept in mind while selecting any sport equipment. These are: 1. Age appropriateness: The equipment/ props must be age appropriate 2. Industry Standard: They must be manufactured as per the industry guidelines. E.g. tennis ball made of rubber and not leather, cricket bats made of wood and not metal, etc. 3. Sports type: They must be selected as per the type of the sport. For example, Basketball, Volleyball should not be used to play football and vice-versa. 53 4. Infrastructure: Depending on the type of sport and where it is played the selection of props and equipment is determined. For example, indoor courts/ play area requires less rugged equipment that an outdoor equipment that are exposed to direct sun and other harsh weather. The type of equipment and props is determined by the mobile (makeshift) and permanent play space. For example, a permanent goal posts, basketball posts, volleyball poles are required to be installed in a permanent designated place. If the play area is used for multi-purpose activity, the dismantlable, mobile type of the same equipment are to be used. 5. Group size: They must be calculated as per number of learners. If a large group of students, for example, 40 students play at a time, it is always best to divide them into smaller groups and each group should be given adequate number of props to play with. The small group also require customization of the equipment such as small size goal post for football, mobile cricket stumps, etc. Thus, influencing the selection of props and equipment during planning the sports training. 6. Budget: One of the most important factors that influences the selection of props and equipment is the budget availability. Sports equipment prices are directly affected by their quality. Equipment price ranges from a few hundred to lakhs. Leading international manufacturers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, etc. come with a premium price as compared to some less-known brands. The experience (ease of playing, comfort, durability) also varies depending on the brand as the better follow industry standards and better materials while manufacturing the equipment and props. Why Props and Equipment must be age Appropriate? 54 Physical development in children happens slowly. The various stages of physical development are 1. Toddlers (one to three years old) 2. Early Childhood (two to six years old) 3. Elementary school (six to twelve years old 4. Pre-adolescence (nine to fourteen years old) 5. Adolescence (from fourteen years to twenty-one years) At these developmental stages the physical ability of children differs and the physical activity and the props and equipment need to be appropriately chosen. The appropriate choice of pros and equipment ensures 1. Absence of boredom in play 2. Presence of challenge to keep the children engaged If props are not chosen in an age appropriate manner it can lead to a. Injury: If the props are for a higher age bracket and being used for a younger group b. Lack of interest: if the props are for a lower age bracket and are being used for an older group 55 List of some commonly used Props and Equipment Equipment/ Prop Prop/ Equipment Name Usage Parachute Teaching various levels of space awareness (high, mid & low), Co-ordination among the team members.

Checklist for Assessment Activity Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity. Differentiate between 1. Props and equipment 2. Temporary and permanent play space Subjective Questions: List the factors affecting the selection of props and equipment Why props and equipment should be age-appropriate? What are the negative effects of selecting non-age appropriate props and equipment during play activities What have you learnt? After completing this session, you will be able to Identify age-appropriate props and equipment to conduct sports activities Select props and equipment as per the requirement Determine props correctly for age appropriate lessons and skills Minimize the risk associated with usage of non-age specific props and equipment 70 2.3 Maintenance and Process of Inspection of Field Inspection and maintenance of sport facilities The play space (ground, court, etc.) and play equipment are subject to changes based on usage and other factors. Therefore, they must be inspected on a regular basis. The frequency of inspection will be determined by many factors including use, overuse, equipment age and materials, and external factors like the age of the users, climate, in accidents like fire. Low Frequency Inspections Often performed quarterly or semi-annually, low frequency inspections are in-depth investigations of the equipment and surfacing looking for wear and tear. This inspection requires a staff member with mechanical knowledge and extensive knowledge about play equipment and surfacing standards. During or immediately after the inspection, staff should do preventive maintenance and repairs and/or remove damaged equipment to remedy problems discovered in the inspection. An example of this type of maintenance would be replacing heavily worn chains that were noted during the inspection. 71 High Frequency Inspections Often performed daily or weekly, high frequency inspections look at frequently changing conditions caused by use, weather, and/or vandalism. During a high frequency inspection, staff checks and corrects playground conditions such as loose-fill surfacing depths, sanitation issues, and the presence of trash and debris. If any hazards are discovered, staff should follow school or agency procedures such as completing documentation, taking the area out of use, and/or correcting the problem. Use the following checklist for the inspection of Play Area. S. No. Question \u00d6 or X Corrective Action Person Responsible Completion Date General 72 Is the playground generally clean and well maintained?

Do adjacent structural elements form a vertex angle greater than 55 degrees? Are the bases of equipment free of tripping hazards? Are the areas above and around equipment free of suspended hazards? Are the ladders, stairways, and ramps built in accordance with the requirements listed in Table 2 of this report? 75 Maintenance and service of sport facilities To keep quality of sports surfaces, it is necessary to do regular maintenance like Remove leaves, stones, pebbles, flints, pieces of sharp objects from the pitch Swipe the floor daily; if it is a cemented floor Allow only recommended footwear on the court Maintain cleanliness of pitch and its surroundings. Maintain cleanliness and quality of props and equipment Periodically check the maintenance of goal posts, volleyball poles, basketball post, etc. Keep sufficient dustbins Special maintenance at least once a year: 76 Level and slope of the ground should be such that the is no water logging Repair and check for drainage systems Special brushing with professional machinery (e.g. for cemented floor) Follow the maintenance instructions carefully for all artificial turf Examples of Props and Equipment Maintenance: Check the pressure carefully. Pressures for various balls are as follows; Football - 5.5-16PS Basketball - 7-9PS Volleyball - 5.8-6.5PS Before using the balls: \u00fc Inflate balls to correct pressures. \u00fc Before you inflate the balls moisten the needle. \u00fc To inflate balls, squeeze balls while gradually adding a small amount of air at a time. \u00fc Inflating balls with too much air at once will damage the inner tube/ bladder. \u00fc Avoid inflating balls with machines as it may over inflate. After using the balls: \u00fc Deflate little air after use. If the same air pressure remains in balls after use, balls may expand or deform. \u00fc Wipe the surface with a soft cloth. \u00fc If you are unable to remove dirt easily, wipe balls with a moistened cloth. 77 \u00fc If you are unable to remove dirt with moistened cloth, wipe balls with a cloth moistened with water-diluted mild detergent. \u00fc If you use mild detergent to clean balls, thoroughly wipe off any remaining detergent to ensure that it does not remain on the ball surface. (detergent may cause stain). \u00fc Wipe the ball afterwards with a dry cloth. \u00fc Dry balls out of direct sunlight in a well-ventilated place. Do not keep it under direct sunlight for long. \u00fc If the ball has been soaked by rain, wipe away moisture and dirt using a cloth. Dry the ball out of direct sunlight in a well-ventilated place To store balls: \u00fc Avoid leaving balls in a place that is exposed to direct sunlight. \u00fc Avoid storing balls in hot or damp places. \u00fc Store balls in a well-ventilated place. \u00fc Inflate balls regularly and store them in a well-ventilated place out of direct sunlight. Even if the equipment is not in use, it requires regular cleaning and maintenance. To maintain Props and Equipment you should perform the following activities: 1. After the activity, use a dry cloth to wipe the props/ equipment and store in a well-ventilated place out of direct sunlight. 2. Check the condition of the props/ equipment regularly to avoid using a damaged prop. 3. Do not leave the props/ equipment in direct sunlight for the whole day. It would reduce the life of props/ equipment. 4. Do not store the props and equipment made of iron/ metal in a damp place. The moisture may lead to rusting. 78 5. Do not apply water on any leather props and equipment. Always use dry cloth to clean. 79 What have you learnt?

If you follow healthy practices, you will live a healthy and long life. You will also be more productive and efficient. 3. HYGIENE AND SAFETY 81 3.1 Maintenance of Hygiene in Play Area Playground Hygiene Our surroundings affect health. It is very important that we take care of our surrounding and play are to stay fit and healthy. We must demonstrate a responsible behaviour towards our surroundings in order to get the best out of it as well as to preserve them for the future. These are some of the things you can do to help. Don't litter, always carry a bag with you to bring waste and dispose it off in a dustbin Throw garbage only in a dustbin Don't spit in public places or on the ground Keep your changing room clean Don't destroy plants; don't pluck flowers and leaves around the play area Segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories Use disinfecting and cleaning agents to maintain health and prevent the spread of germs and illness, it is a process aiming at providing a healthy environment. It can also be described as activities aimed at improving and maintaining the standard of basic environmental conditions affecting the well-being of people. 82 Whether you play indoor or outdoor, it is important to take a general look at the equipment to make sure that it is clean and well maintained. Some of the points that you need to keep in mind are as follows: There should be no broken equipment and props Wooden equipment should not be cracked or splintered Metal equipment should not be rusted Children should be aware of the unsafe and dangerous areas/ locations, if any Surface materials on the playground should be maintained regularly so that the surfacing is loosely packed and covers all appropriate areas \u2014 especially the fall zones surrounding playground equipment Playground equipment should be made of durable materials that won't fall apart or worn down too much by the weather Make sure that there is enough free space in front of equipment like slides, swings etc. Do not allow children to be in close proximity when equipment is in use Check for objects (like hardware, S-shaped hooks, bolts, nails and sharp or unfinished edges) that stick out on equipment and could cut a child or cause clothing to become entangled All hardware on equipment should be secure, with no loose or broken parts. Plastic and wood should show no signs of weakening, and there should not be any splintered or rusted surfaces If the playground has a sandpit, check for hazardous debris such as sharp sticks or broken glass, and be sure that the sand is free of bugs. It is advisable to cover sand pits when not in use to prevent contamination from animals Keep your playground clean and safe by picking up garbage and using the equipment properly. Report to higher authorities for any problem immediately related to safety If any of the equipment seems broken, loose, or in need of maintenance, designate it as off-limits immediately; report the problem to the appropriate authorities and follow up for completion 83 84 85 86 What have you learnt? After completing this session, you will be able to Identify the steps to maintain playground hygiene Identify the steps to maintain environmental hygiene Conduct hygiene survey in your school playground using the checklist Differentiate between 1. Playground and common area hygiene 2. Municipal waste and medical waste 3. Hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste Subjective Questions 1. Explain the factors affecting the condition of the play are and equipment 2. List the steps to maintain hygiene at playground 3. Why is it important to keep oneself and one's environment clean? Activity Check your progress 87 3.2 Demonstrate Basic First-Aid First Aid - Concept First Aid is a combination of simple but quite effective and active measures to prevent possible complications. First Aid means the treatment given to a 'patient' till proper medical aid comes. Giving First aid is an important skill. By performing simple procedures and following certain guidelines, it may be possible to save lives by giving basic treatment until professional medical help arrives. First Aid - Purpose and basic principles The purpose of First Aid is to preserve life, assist recovery and prevent aggravation of the injury, until the services of a doctor can be obtained or during transport to hospital or to the patient's home. Always send someone to call for help while you perform first aid. Principles: 1. Do first things first quickly, quietly and without panic 2. Guard against or treat for shock by moving the patient as little as possible. 3. Do not attempt too much 4. Reassure the patient and those around in order to reduce tension 5. Stop any bleeding 6. Give artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. 88 Cuts and Bruises Cuts and bruises are part of growing up. Do not become paranoid about the children's safety and prevent them from exploring. At the same time know what to do when they injure themselves. If cuts are deep and do not stop bleeding, seek medical help. What to do? Rinse the wound clean with water. If the wound is bleeding, then apply pressure to stop the blood flow. Use a sterile gauze or bandage to do that. Raise the injured part to above the heart level to slow down the bleeding. When the bleeding stops, cover the wound, if necessary with a clean bandage. Prevention: Teach the children to handle sharp objects with the right technique. Supervise them when they do. Make the children's environment in school and at home safe, i.e. avoid sharp corners, glass furniture, access to sharp objects like knives etc. Heat Exhaustion Signs and Symptoms Severe Thirst Muscle weakness Nausea, sometimes vomiting Headache Increased sweating Decreased responsiveness or loss of consciousness Difficulty in breathing What to do? Bring the child under shade, undress him and make him lie with his feet elevated. If the child is alert, use a cold sponge on his head. Give him sips of cool water or sports drinks If he vomits, turn him to the side to prevent choking. In the case of heatstroke seek medical help immediately. 89 Breathing Difficulties If someone stops breathing, see if the person can speak or respond when touched on the shoulder. If not, call for help - and immediately begin first aid. Send bystanders for help. But if you're alone, perform basic life support for one minute before going for help. 1. Place the person on his or her back on the floor. 2. Tilt the head, so that the chin is pointing upwards. Do this by placing the fingertips under the jawbone, then lift gently while pressing down softly on the person's forehead. This is done to make sure the tongue is not blocking the throat. 3. Keep holding the head in this way while checking for breathing. Look if the chest is rising and falling, or place your ear next to their mouth to listen for breathing and feel breath on your cheek. Only check for 10 seconds. 4. If there's normal breathing, hold the head as described above until help arrives. If there's no breathing or gasping breaths, start basic life support. Cuts Bleeding With all types of bleeding, it's important to stop the flow of blood as quickly as possible. Small cuts Small cuts in the veins stop bleeding and clot within a few minutes. The area should then be washed, and a plaster placed gently on top. Deeper cuts Deeper cuts in the veins produce dark blood that seeps out slowly and steadily. It can be stopped by gentle pressure on the wound with a sterile or clean cloth, followed by the application of a clean or sterile bandage. Often, these wounds need sewing or gluing, and therefore medical treatment will be necessary after first aid. Choking Choking is the mechanical obstruction of the flow of air from the environment into the lungs. This usually occurs when food that has not been thoroughly chewed gets stuck. It also occurs when a foreign body or object is lodged in the throat or wind pipe. A person who is choking can usually communicate with 90 hand movements, and may place their hand against their throat. In such a case he/she will definitely need help, so summon assistance for him/her. Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, first aid should be administered as quickly as possible. First Aid To give first aid, perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver), as given below: Stand behind the person. Wrap your arms around the waist. Tip the person forward slightly. Make a fist with one hand. Position it slightly above the person's navel. Grasp the fist with the other hand. Press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust \u2014 as if trying to lift the person up. Perform a total of 5 abdominal thrusts, if needed. If the blockage still isn't dislodged, repeat the five-and-five cycle. To clear the airway of an unconscious person: Lower the person on his or her back onto the floor. Clear the airway. If a blockage is visible at the back of the throat or high in the throat, reach a finger into the mouth and sweep out the cause of the blockage. Be careful not to push the food or object deeper into the airway, which can happen easily in young children. Begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the object remains lodged and the person doesn't respond after you take the above measures. The chest compressions used in CPR may dislodge the object. Remember to recheck the mouth periodically. Basic Sports Injuries Sports injuries are injuries that typically occur while participating in organised sports, training sessions or fitness activity. These injuries may be caused due to lack of proper safety equipment, improper training, etc. Injury could be acute traumatic or chronic injury. Acute traumatic injury are caused by a single application of force, for example a strain, sprain, fracture etc. whereas chronic injury happens over a period of time due to repetitive incorrect training. These include stress fracture, tendinitis etc. 91 1. Sprain: Ligaments are tissues that stabilize and support the body's joints. A sprain is an injury to a ligament caused by tearing of the fibres of the ligament. The ligament can have a partial tear, or it can be completely torn apart. Sprained ligaments swell rapidly and generally, the greater the pain and swelling, the more severe the injury is. 2. Muscle strain: A muscle strain is injury to muscle as a result of strenuous activity. A strain is a twist, pull or a tear of a muscle or tendon. First Aid for Sprains Follow the instructions for R.I.C.E. 1. Rest the injured limb and avoid all activities. 2. Ice the area. Use a cold pack to help limit swelling after an injury. Try to ice the area as soon as possible after the injury and continue to ice it for 15 to 20 minutes, four to eight times a day, for the first 48 hours or until swelling improves. Do not to use it too long, as this could cause tissue damage. 3. Compress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage. 4. Elevate the injured limb above your heart whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling. 92 The concept of first aid kit A well-stocked first-aid kit is as important as props for every physical education classes. The first aid kit should be within an easy reach for the teacher to use in case there any emergencies. A well-stocked first aid kit will enable you to respond effectively to common injuries during a physical education class. Usually a first aid kit is available in all medical stores. Though it is available in the medical stores, it is essential for a physical education teacher to know what are the items included in a first aid kit. Below is the list of items required for a first aid kit; First-aid manual Sterile gauze pads of different sizes Adhesive/ glue tape Adhesive bandages in several sizes Elastic bandage A splint Antiseptic wipes Soap Antibiotic ointment Antiseptic solution (like hydrogen peroxide) Hydrocortisone cream (1%) Acetaminophen and ibuprofen Tweezers - small instruments for plucking hairs and picking up small object Sharp scissors Safety pins Disposable instant cold packs (if available) Calamine lotion Dettol or savolin lotion Thermometer Plastic non-latex gloves (at least 2 pairs) Touch and extra batteries A blanket Mouthpiece for administering CPR (can be obtained from your local medical shop) 93 A list of emergency phone numbers - nearest hospital, school principal, a reliable taxi driver Blanket (stored nearby) 94 What have you learnt?

What are the basic principles of first aid? b. What is the basic first aid for sprain and strain? c. What are the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke? d. What are the six principles of first aid? 96 3.3 Emergency Response and Causality Management Sports injuries are commonly caused by overuse, direct impact, or an impact that is greater than a body part can withstand. There are two kinds of sports injuries: acute and chronic. An injury that occurs suddenly, such as a sprained ankle caused by an awkward landing, is known as an acute injury. Chronic injuries are caused by repeated overuse of muscle groups or joints. Poor technique and structural abnormalities can also contribute to the development of chronic injuries. Medical attention to any sports injury is important, because you may be hurt more severely than you think. Types of Sports Injuries Type of Injury Symptoms Ankle Sprain Pain, swelling and stiffness Bruises Small bleeding spots on to the skin Cuts and Abrasions Mild to severe bleeding, knees and elbows are prone to this type of injury Dehydration Heat exhaustion and heat stroke due to too much of water loss from the body Groin Strain Pain and swelling at the groin area Hamstring Strain Pain swelling and bruising Knee Joint Injuries Pain, swelling and stiffness Stress Fractures Severe pain, this injury is usually due to impact of repeated jumping or running on hard surface. Shin bone pain is an example of this injury 97 Following are some of the first aid techniques to prevent further damage to an injured part; Rest - keep the injured area supported and avoid using for 48-72 hours. Ice - apply ice to the injured area for 20 minutes every two hours for the first 48-72 hours. Compression - apply a firm elastic bandage over the area, extending above and below the painful site. Elevation - raise the injured area above the level of the heart at all times. In case of a lower limb injury, immobilise the injured part. Referral - as soon as possible, see a doctor No Heat - do not apply heat, it will increase bleeding No Playing or Running - running or exercise increases blood flow, delaying healing No Massage - massage increases swelling and bleeding, also delaying healing How do you prevent sports injuries? Below are some of the common points an athlete or coach should keep in mind to prevent the occurrence of sports injuries; Warm up thoroughly by gently going through the motions of your sport and performing slow, sustained stretches. Wear appropriate footwear. Tape or strap vulnerable and injured joints, if necessary. Use the appropriate safety equipment, such as mouth guards, helmets and pads. Drink plenty of fluids before, during and after the game. Try to avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day. Maintain a good level of overall fitness, particularly in the 'off season'. Make sure that the overall fitness level is optimum with enough muscle strength. Ensure training includes appropriate speed and impact work so muscles are capable of the demands of a game situation. Don't exert beyond the level of fitness. Gradually increase intensity and duration of training. Use good form and learn or teach correct technique of performing skills. 98 Cool down after training session with gentle, sustained stretches. Allow adequate recovery time between sessions and repetitions. Have regular health and sports specific assessments to know the level of fitness 99 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) CPR is executed during an emergency when someone to save a person's life if their heart stops beating from sudden cardiac arrest. CPR can increase the chances of survival if performed immediately. For non-healthcare providers or bystanders without formal CPR training: The recommendation is for compression-only CPR, or hands-only CPR, without mouth-to-mouth breathing. This version of CPR is recommended for people without formal training who see an adult or teen suddenly collapse outside of a hospital or medical facility, for example at home, at work, in a park, or place of business. If you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse, it's important to act fast and follow these steps for hands-only CPR: STEP 1: CHECK FOR BREATHING Check for signs of breathing\u2014either the chest rising and falling or feel or hear the breath. STEP 2: CALL FOR HELP (AMBULANCE - 112) If the person is not breathing or is gasping, ask someone to call 112 or call yourself. STEP 3: ADJUST YOUR BODY TO PERFORM CHEST COMPRESSIONS Kneel next to victim. Use your fingers to locate the end of the victim's breastbone, where the ribs come together. Place two fingers at the tip of the breastbone. Place the heel of your other hand above your fingers (on the side closest to the victim's face). Then put the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand, so your hands are stacked (intertwining fingers is recommended). 100 STEP 4: PERFORM CHEST COMPRESSIONS Push hard and fast in the center of the chest until help arrives. You can use the weight of your body to add strength to your pushes. It's important to push, giving 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Which is about the same tempo as the song \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees. For adult and teenage victims, the recommended compression depth is at least 2 inches (5 cm), while avoiding chest compression depths greater than 2.4 inches (6 cm). For children (age 1 year to puberty), recommended compression depth is about 2 inches (5cm). Don't remove your hands from the victim's chest, just your weight. Avoid leaning on the victim between compressions\u2014allow the chest to return to its normal position. STEP 5: WAIT FOR HELP Continue to perform compressions until help arrives. 101 Rehabilitation of sports injuries Treatment and rehabilitation depend on the type and severity of the injury. Always see a doctor if pain continues after 24 hours of the injury. Never attempt self-treatment which may worsen the injury. Physiotherapy can help to rehabilitate the injured site and, depending on the injury, may include exercises to promote strength and flexibility. Returning to sport after injury depends on doctor's or physiotherapist's assessment. Trying to play before the injury is properly healed will only cause further damage and delay recovery. The biggest single risk factor for soft tissue injury is a previous injury. In the meantime, you can maintain your fitness by choosing forms of exercise that don't involve your injury; for example, ride a stationary bicycle while your sprained wrist is healing. Most rehabilitation programs go through different stages, an acute stage, immediately after injury, middle or rehabilitation stage where the aim is to regain normal movement and strength and finally a functional or sports specific phase where exercises are more relevant to the activity. These stages are further explained in the below table: Stages Points to be noted during each stage Functional Activities The first movement after treatment period, these movements develop necessary strength and flexibility at the injured part to function Sports activity, specific exercise and training Very low intensity - these activities are for developing enough muscular endurance to start the training Bracing and Taping Bracing or taping the injured part to provide extra support and protection to the injured part Modalities Increase in the intensity of movement in terms of speed, duration and resistance to increase load bearing capacity Regaining of movement ability Ability to perform activities in full intensity. The injured part is ready to bear optimum training load 102 Exercises for rehabilitation The following exercises are generally performed for rehabilitation: Ankle exercises involve rehabilitation exercises for the calf muscles, achilles tendon injuries and ankle including ankle sprains. Arm and elbow exercises are done to work the biceps and triceps muscles as well as the muscles which pronate and supinate the forearm. Back exercises are done to work the back muscles. Core and abdominal exercises are used to work the trunk and are ideal for avoiding back pain. Hip and groin exercises are used to work the adductor and hip muscles. Knee exercises cover early, middle and late stage exercises for rehabilitation from thigh injuries including hamstring strain exercises, quadriceps strain as well as jumpers knee, iliotibial band friction syndrome, and knee ligament injuries Shoulder exercises cover the exercises and general approach to shoulder rehabilitation. 103 Wrist and hand exercises for recovering from wrist sprains and other hand injuries. 104 What have you learnt?

In order to do that he must have adequate knowledge of how to live a healthy lifestyle. Health is not merely the absence of disease, it is a positive quality of the living body, of which fitness for one's work and the happiness are distinguishing marks. Health is the way; there is no way to health. Let all the habits of living be health promoting. The term health is not an abstract thing but a relative concept. In it we see a continuum of freedom from sickness to better and positive health. According to WHO (World Health Organization), \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity.\" Recently this definition has been amplified and it has been added, \"Attainment of a level of health that will enable every individual to lead a socially and economically productive life.\" Physical Fitness Physical fitness is to a human body; what fine-tuning is to an engine. It enables us to perform up to our potential. Fitness can be described as a condition that helps us look better, feel pleasant and do our best. More specifically, it is \"The ability to perform daily tasks vigorously, with energy left over for enjoying leisure-time activities and meeting emergency demands. It is the ability to endure, to bear up, to withstand stress, to carry on in circumstances where an unfit person could not continue, and is a basis for good health and well-being\". Benefits of Physical Fitness Exercising for fitness is not just for Olympic hopefuls or supermodels. In fact, you are never too fit, too young or too old to get started. Regardless of your age, gender or role in life, you can benefit from regular physical activity. If you are committed, exercise in combination with a sensible diet can help you to provide an overall sense of well-being and can even help to prevent chronic illness, disability and premature death. 4. SPORTS AND FITNESS 107 Some of the benefits of increased physical activity or physical fitness are: Improved Health through Increased efficiency of heart and lungs Increased muscle strength Reduced risk of major illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease Weight loss Reduced cholesterol levels Reduced blood pressure Improved Sense of Well-Being through Increased energy levels Improved quality of sleep Increased mental sharpness Reduction of stress Improved ability to cope with stress Improved Appearance through Weight loss Improved posture Toned muscles Enhanced Social Life through Improved self-image Increased opportunities to share an activity with friends or family members Increased opportunities to make new friends Increased Stamina through Increased productivity Less frequent injuries Increased physical capabilities Improved immunity to minor illnesses 108 ECTI 4.1 Selecting Yearly Sports Activities The school yearly sports activities are planned at the start of every academic year. The yearly activities are directly mapped to the 'Goals' for the sports. These are aligned to the school Vision and Mission and therefore with the consent of the school management. In addition, the sports activity for the school is also determined by the various factors like: \u00fc Infrastructure available in the school \u00fc PE teacher/ Coach employed by the school and their specialization \u00fc Past achievements/ history of the school in sports \u00fc Type of school (boys, girls, co-education) \u00fc Students level in different sports \u00fc Sports popularity in the region where school is located Once the goals are agreed upon. It is the responsibility of the PE and sports department to form teams for different sports and categories. In a school set up, it is important to note that the selection for different sports and categories can only happen once the students are trained to certain extent is specific sports. Therefore, the selection of teams involves a process that is to be meticulously planned and executed. The widely practiced process for team selection can have three staged: 1. Talent Detection: Where students are given enough exposure to a variety of sports and then grouped based on their interest levels and the skill sets required to play the sport of the identified sport. 2. Talent Identification: Recognizing current participants, who are already playing the sports of their choice, with the potential to excel in that. This stage involves predicting performance over various periods of time by measuring physical, physiological, psychological and sociological attributes. 3. Talent Development: Providing students suitable learning environment so their sporting talent can be realized. Let us understand the selection process and criteria for some of the popular sports. 109 Every child is born with the capacity of becoming a good sportsman so long as he or she is given the right opportunity at the right age. Ease of skill acquisition and development is affected by many factors, very few which appear to be innate, for example training appropriateness. In fact, evidences are available that points to the fact that the level of competency can be improved beyond maximal by deliberate practice. In other words, individuals have often exceeded their own expectations, and even those of others. A change of training method has been demonstrated to lead to performance increments even in individuals who appear to have been less competence. Talent DevelopmentProviding students suitable learning environment so that talent can be realizedTalent IdentificationRecognizing current participants, who are already playing the sports of their choice, with the potential to become elite performers. Predicting performance over various periods of time by measuring physical, physiological, psychological and sociological attributes Talent DetectionDiscovery of potential performers who are not currently involved in the sports in question. 110 Process of Talent Detection, Identification and Development Conduct the lessons mentioned in the previous chapter to start with the following assessments FOOTBALL Football Talent Detection Space Awareness Can run around while keeping safe distance between other players 1st Month- Selection Ball Control Controls the ball when it comes to him or kicks it away Use of foot Can use both the feet Sense of Direction Dribble the ball from one end to the other end of the field Contact with the ball The player makes contact with the different parts of the foot (Inside, Outside, Instep, sole, Heel, Toe) Passing Ability Can pass the ball to the team mate Shooting Can take a shot towards the goal Endurance Can play continuously for an hour 111 Talent Identification Ball Control Is able to juggle the ball continuously for 5 to 10 times with both feet After 3 months - Team Building Dribbling Can keep the ball close to the foot while dribbling in different directions Passing Can pass with accuracy to the team mate using inside of the foot Attacking Can beat an opponent in a 1v1 situation Defending Can disturb the opponent and recover the ball when the opponent has the ball possession Kicking Can kick the ball on the ground level and also in the air to do long passes (in different trajectory) Shooting Can shoot at the goal with some force and accuracy Sprint Can sprint for minimum 15 meters with quick change in direction Endurance Can jog/run continuously for an hour Talent Development An indicative weekly training plan for after-school coaching sessions.

Activity 121 4.2 Organizing Sports Competition In this chapter we will discuss on how to organize different sports events in school. Following are the list of events that can take place in any of the months in a school. Use the planning process and the execution tools of each of these events during the month of execution. List of important events in a year Sports Day Intramural & Extramural Tournaments Independence Summer/Winter Camp Organizing Sports Day Sports Day is one of the most awaited events in any school. The entire school is involved in Sports Day. The management, teachers, non-teaching staff, students, parents all contribute to making the Sports Day successful. Any event that involves such a large number of people and activities can only be successful if it is properly planned. In any big event there are three important stages: Pre Sports Day (Preparation phase) Sports Day Post Sports Day AgendaInvitationsPlan for the Mass DisplaysCostumes Day 122 1. Pre-Sports Day or Preparation phase: Preparation for a sports day starts at least one month prior to the day of the event. Once the program for the Sports Day is finalized, preparations need to start. There could be different roles/ tasks where people from different departments need to contribute. The typical roles in the organization of a Sports Day are as follows. a) Setting up the agenda for the Sports Day b) Assigning of duties c) Inviting chief guest and parents A. Setting up the agenda for the Sports Day Example of a Sports Day Agenda SPORTS DAY SCHEDULE <School Name> <Date> <Venue> v Assembly 8.50 am v Arrival of Chief Guest 9.00 am v Welcome Speech 9.00 am v Lighting Flame 9.05 am v Sports Day Declared Open 9.10 am v Balloons Release 9.10 am v Chief Guest Speech 9.15 am v March Past 9.20 am v Flag Hoisting 9.45 am v Mass Demonstration 10.00 am v Activity Begins 10.15 am v Prize Distribution 12.00 noon v Vote of Thanks 12.15 pm 123 v National Anthem 12.25 pm v Dismissal B. Assigning of Duties a. Preparing the students for various Mass Drill and Displays b. Selecting the athletes who would participate on the sports day c. Facility management - Seating arrangements for guests, parents, students, water refreshments, toilet facilities, etc. d. Procurement of materials e. Master of ceremony for the sports day: Assign the job to two to three teachers who possess good language skills and who can update the event details time to time f. Invitation for the event g. Assignment of duties on the Sports day A school could select a theme for a sports day. Example could be environment, seasons, earth, industrialization, etc. This theme can be used to guide the mass displays, the costumes and the music. Students from various standards can be selected for mass displays. Practise session with responsible teachers need to be assigned in the time table. Usually getting a group of 100 -200 students to perform in a synchronized manner requires a lot of practise. One to two months of daily practise are usually assigned by schools. The Physical Education department needs to decide the sports events to be conducted on the sports day. Students need to be trained and selected through Heats. Sufficient time needs to be allocated for both these activities in the regular time table. Facility Management The Physical Education staff is assigned the duty of preparing the ground and the audience area. This could include levelling, marking, cleaning the sports grounds. For the chief guests and audience, the facilities of dias and podium, flag hoisting poles and flags, Shamiana, chairs, tables, PA system, decoration of the playing area, etc. need to be planned. Usually the school flag is hoisted on Sports Day. 124 Facility Management Checklist Marking Lime powder/ POP - depending on ground condition Grounds men As required Ground preparation watering/ levelling/ stones/ safety/ court cleanliness Demarcation/Barricading Elevated rope boundary Track & field equipment Hurdles, starting blocks Stop watch As required Clapper/Whistle/Gun As required Tables As required Chairs As required Water dispenser As required PA system As required First- Aid kit As required Medical facility/Medicines/ORS/Glucose As required Rest rooms Check cleanliness Shamiana/ Chairs As required School flag, House Flag, Balloons, Pigeons, Torch, bouquets As required Certificates, Medals, Trophies As required Invitation cards As required Procurement: Check and list all the items required by all departments for the Sports Day and procure them in time. C. Inviting Chief Guest and Parents Identify a chief guest who comes from a decorated sports background. Invite him/her in advance. Talk to him/her about your school and also tell him if about your theme or if you want him to emphasize something specific in his talk. It is always a good practice to tell your speakers for how long they should speak. You Sports day should run on schedule and that means that every item on the agenda needs to start and finish on time. Invite all the parents in advance. 125 2. Sports Day: The day of the event becomes easy if the duties and responsibilities assigned to the various individuals are properly done. There should always be a checklist to make sure that the things planned prior to the sports day are in place. In addition, the entire sports day (day of the event) is to be defined properly. A dress rehearsal is recommended a day or two prior to the Sports Day. Checklist on the day of the event Yes/ No/ NA 1.March Past 1.1 Ground marking 1.2 Drums and sticks (at least 2 drums and 4 sticks) 1.3 House flags, Houses placards 1.4 Flag stands 2.Mass Drill 2.1 Ground marking - formation(s) with entry and exit 2.2 PA system and music CD 2.3 Teacher's name with their assigned duty 2.4 Props 3.Athletic Events and Fun Games 3.1 Track marking 3.2 Event list 3.3 Officials - Competition director, starter, time keepers, etc. 3.4 Starter's stand / Clapper/ Gun 3.5 Stop watch 3.6 Batons for relay 3.7 Props and equipment related to athletic events and fun activities 3.8 Event completion sheets 4.Prize Ceremony 4.1 Certificates, Trophies/ Medals - 1st, 2nd & 3rd place with ribbon 4.2 Tray to present Medals 4.3 Guest name(s) - To give away the prizes 4.4 Vote of thanks 5.Facility Arrangement 126 5.1 Volunteers - Tasks distribution to volunteers and briefing on their role 5.2 Wash Room/ Toilets 5.3 Drinking water 5.4 Shamiana, chairs, tables for students and audience 5.5 Victory stand 5.6 Stationary items - paper, pen/ pencil, eraser, sharpener, etc. 5.7 Balloons 5.8 PA/ Music System - speakers and multiple microphones including cordless microphones 6.

March past is marching of troops on parade past a person who is reviewing them. It is a formal type of walking that involves maintaining a steady heel beat and cadence. They are often performed in costume of the same colour and are accompanied by marching bands with placards. March past is held for a wide range of reasons. It could be either military parades, parades during the sports day or other occasions where participants march in formation. Acquaint yourself with the specific marching rules you will have to follow. There are some basics that apply to all forms of marching. Marching begins from standing at the position of attention. In this position, your feet are together at the heels and spread apart at an approximately 45 degree angle. You should have an upright posture, and chin should be up looking forward. Your hands should be resting at your sides with your palms gently rolled up, not clenched (as if you are holding a grocery bag). 128 Wait for the command to begin marching. The most common command \"Forward, march\", \"Forward\" is the direction in which you are supposed to march. Start marching with your left foot. If your feet are properly attired, you should be able to hear the heel beat of everyone marching, which will help you to maintain the cadence. Move your arms naturally as you march. Keep your fingers curled into your palms, but allow your arms to naturally swing back and forth. Do not keep them straight at your sides, or forcibly swing them back and forth. Maintain upright posture, and professionalism. Your movement should have snap and precision. Keep your chin up and look proud. Keep your eyes forward. Do not look to the left or right. Use your peripheral vision to stay aligned with the people to your front and right. Maintain approximately the same distance (normally arm's length) throughout the march. March until commanded to halt. Halt from a march by taking one more step with the left foot after the command is called, and then bring the right foot back to form the position of attention. After March Past it is Mass Drill which attracts the attention of the audience. 129 Mass Drill Mass drill is another important event in a Sports Day agenda. All mass drills are theme based, and themes can be something like swachh bharath, global culture, industrialization etc. A good mass display has the following elements 1. Synchronized actions to a theme. 2. Good lively music. If you use Bollywood songs make sure that they have good lyrics which make sense for the occasion otherwise go for instrumental pieces. 3. Colorful costumes. 4. A good entry and exit strategy. 130 Given below is an example of a Mass Drill Formation 131 3. Post Sports Day: It is generally the wrapping-up of the event. Task Process \u00fc/\u00fb Props collection Collect all props and equipment, score boards, cards, stationeries and put back to the designated place.

How to conduct Mass Drill? 134 Organizing Tournaments A tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors; all participating in a sport or game. The task of organizing tournaments can go from very simple to extremely complex. Depending on the type of sport, you may have individual players, small teams or large teams. You may have tournaments going from one day to several months. You may have winners decided on accumulated points or knock outs. You may have tournaments played over multiple locations/ countries or in a single stadium. In this session, we will focus on simple tournaments that are typically organized at school levels. Broadly there are three stages in which you could plan the organization of any tournament. Pre-Tournament Tournament Day Post Tournament Post Tournament Winding upFeedback and to the Team Organizing TeamFixture/ Agenda 135 Pre-Tournament A school may decide to host a football tournament. The immediate questions to ask are 1. Venue - Where we are going to conduct the tournament? 2. Date and time lines - When is the tournament? 3. How many entries - Expected number of participating teams 4. What Infrastructure is available - Does the school have ground and require equipment to conduct the tournament? 5. Number of resources available - Total number of people needed to organize the tournament. Some of these questions are interlinked. For example, if I have only one ground and two teachers I may have a restriction on how many teams I invite for the tournament. If I do not have overnight accommodation for player, I might restrict the tournament to only a day. Once the date, venue and number of participants is decided then one gets into the details of the planning. The following pages shows a short a short summary of the various aspects of tournament planning and execution. 136 137 What is a checklist and what are the advantages to work with them? Checklist is a tool that helps you ensure that you do not forget or miss out on anything important while organizing the event. It is a working document that is updated as one learns. There are many advantages of working with checklists. These are shared below: 1. You can plan and prepare well in advance. 2. You can list all items so as to not forget anything. 3. With a checklist it is easy to handover the tasks to new team members. 4. It makes the whole organizing experience stress free as you are not dependent on specific people. 5. It makes working with large teams possible and gives good supervision control. 138 Tournament Day On the tournament day all preparations need to pay off. It is important for the whole team to be present at the venue at least one hour before the tournament start time. The team should review all the checklists and prepare for their individual responsibilities. The tournament manager needs to re-emphasize the communication structure and the agenda for the whole day. The list of events should have a start and end time and the responsible person assigned. The more effort you put in the preparation phase the easier it gets on the tournament day. Be Aware: Even if you have prepared a lot there will be unforeseen issues that will come up during the tournament. It is important for all team members to keep their emotions under control, trust each other, depend on each other and resolve issues without getting into a blame game. The way the team manages to support each other will decide the success of the event. 139 140 Post tournament Step/ Sequence Tool Process/ Task When \u00fc\u00fb Comments (if any) 1 Props collection Collect all props and equipment, score boards, cards, stationeries and put back to the designated place.

Why do we need to study the guidelines for organizing a tournament? 143 4.3 Conduct Fitness Sessions When you play a sport, you want to do the best you can. Training improves your fitness thereby your performance. The basic components of physical fitness such as endurance, strength, speed and flexibility can be developed through different training methods that are briefly described here. Training is important for a number of reasons. Some of these reasons are as follows: \u00fc It increases cardiovascular capacity. \u00fc It helps your body convert more fat to energy. \u00fc It strengthens your muscles, making them more tolerant to the stresses caused by prolonged exertion. \u00fc It strengthens the connective tissue (tendons and ligaments) \u00fc It can be fine-tuned to your specific sport which will help you improve your performance rapidly. Health Related Components Aerobic Capacity: It is the maximum amount of oxygen that the body can utilize during an exercise session. It is the ability to complete or perform a task, routine, activity in the presence of oxygen. Cardiovascular exercise is used to improve aerobic capacity by strengthening the heart muscle and developing the rest of the cardio respiratory system. It is also called as cardiovascular fitness which requires the heart and blood vessels to supply the working muscles with oxygen for long periods of time. Some of the examples of aerobic capacity are, \u00fc Running long distances \u00fc Jogging \u00fc Swimming \u00fc Cycling Anaerobic Capacity: The ability to complete or perform a task, routine, activity in presence of less oxygen or reserve oxygen. Anaerobic exercise is short-lasting, high-intensity activity, where your body's demand for oxygen exceeds the oxygen supply available. Anaerobic exercise relies on energy sources that are stored in the muscles and, unlike aerobic exercise, is not dependent on oxygen from (breathing) the air. Some of the examples are, \u00fc 30 m run \u00fc 50 m run 144 \u00fc 100 m run \u00fc Weight lifting Strength: It is the maximum force that can be developed in a muscle or group of muscles during a single maximal contraction. Some of the examples include, \u00fc Standing Broad Jump (explosive strength of legs) \u00fc Medicine Ball Throw (explosive strength of shoulder) Flexibility: It is the range of movement possible at a joint. Is an important part of fitness that we need to keep into our old age. Babies have a natural suppleness and can suck their toes. We tend to lose flexibility as we grow older. Some of the examples of flexibility include, \u00fc Sit & Reach - touching your toes without bending your knees \u00fc Split \u00fc Gymnastics \u00fc Yoga - Asanas Weight or Resistance Training: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN OF PRIMRY YEARS. 145 Conduct the following activities to develop the fitness levels of students. Co-operative Games for Fitness Activity - 1 Aim: To play various cooperative games. This will help the children develop specific fitness components namely agility, strength, balance and flexibility. Props & Equipment Required: Saucers, cones, softballs, volleyball, basketballs and footballs. Warm-up - 5 min Flip the Saucer - Agility, balance and team work Divide the children into two teams - A and B Scatter saucer cones in a playing area such that half of them face downwards and the remaining half face upwards as shown in the picture. Assign the upward facing cones to team A and the downward facing cones to team B. Team A's job is to flip team B's cones and keep their own cones from flipping. Team B also does the same thing. The team whose cones are least flipped is the winner. Play the game for 2 min, rest the students for 1 min and then continue the game for an additional 2 min. Lead, or have a student lead, a stretching routine. Activity - 25 min Touch the Dragon's Tail - Agility, balance and team work (10 min) Divide the children in groups of 10 - 12. In a group of 10, 9 children should make a line formation holding the others' waist - ideally the tallest child should be in the front and shortest at the back. This is the dragon. The child who is not part of the dragon formation (10th child) should have a soft ball. He/she should attempt to touch the tail of the dragon i.e. the last child of the dragon. The dragon as a team should move and avoid being touched in the tail. 146 Touch the Dragon's Tail Bombardment: Jumping, landing & throwing The participants are divided into 2 teams, 1 team is a 'running team' and the other team is a 'bombardment team'. The bombardment team should stand on the two sides of the bombardment zone with volleyball and softball. The objective of bombardment team is to hit the ball to the members of the running team below the knee and by only under arm throw. Running team moves from the starting line to end line without being hit by the ball, anyone who crosses the finish line without being touched by a ball earns a point for the team. The game continues till everyone is out and the total points are noted. Now, change the team i.e. the running team becomes bombardment team and the bombardment team becomes the running team. The team scoring more points is the winner. Bombardment Fire Throw: Upper body strength and throwing Divide the children in two teams. Both the teams will compete against each other in a throwing and a catching game. Each team will have its zone and will stand 15 to 20 m away from the opponent team. The game starts with a throw from one team member to the opponent zone. Use overhead throw for more power but the throw must be below the head level. The throwing team gets one point if the opponent fails to catch the throw. The opponent team gets a point if the throwing team throws the ball out of the opponent's zone. 147 Cool-down - 5 min Have children move slowly (e.g., in a slow jog, brisk walk) around the activity area. Lead, or have a student lead, a stretching routine. 148 Activity - 2 Aim: To develop lower body strength Infrastructure Required: Playground Props & Equipment Required: Cones/ Saucers/ Polyspots, Flat rings, Beanbags Class Size: Large class size of 40-50 Warm up: Dynamic and static How to Proceed Divide the children into four groups Make four hopscotch pathways using flat rings (refer to the diagram) The first child in each group should throw the bean bag inside the flat ring and try to collect it while hopping. The child should then come back and pass the bean bag to the team mate standing in front. Make it as a relay and chose a winning team. Chicken Ball Race Mark two lines 10m apart Continue with the same four groups. This time have half of the children from each group stand on the other line (refer to the diagram) Give each group one ball The first child from each group should hold the ball between their knees and jump towards the partner. 149 Once he/she reaches his/her partner, ask them to hand the ball over to the partner. This child will hold the ball between their knees and jump towards their partner. Continue this activity till all the children have had a chance to participate in the chicken ball race. 150 Activity -3 Aim: To play various cooperative games. This will help the children develop specific fitness components namely agility, strength, balance and flexibility. Props & Equipment Required: Saucer/ Cones, volleyballs, softballs, footballs, basketballs. Warm-up - 5 min Have students move around the activity area in a variety of ways, slowly increasing their speed. Lead, or have a student lead, a stretching routine (see Appendix for sample). Activity - 25 min You may form groups and do the activities simultaneously depending on the class size. 1. Circle Race: Agility and team work Divide the children in teams of five. Each team joins their hands and forms a circle and should stand behind the starting line. Finishing line is marked at a distance of 15 to 20m. On a signal, both the teams run towards the finishing line ensuring that the circle is intact. While running, the team should also move as a rotation without breaking the circle. The team that crosses/ touches the finish line first will be the winner. 2. King and Pawn: Throwing and footwork All the participants should form a close circle. Keep a volleyball/softball at the centre of the circle. Everyone in the circle should keep one leg forward pointing the toe towards the ball (kept at the centre of the circle). The ball is tossed in the centre of the circle by the teacher. To whomsoever the ball touches, he/she becomes a Pawn and tries to hit the ball to other participants whereas other participants protect themselves by dodging the ball. Hitting is allowed only below the knee level. Pawn is permitted to dribble and move forward in order to hit the other children. Whenever any child is hit by the ball he joins the Pawn. Two or more pawns shall only pass for moving in any direction for hitting others. The child who remains \"NOT OUT\" till the end is called the ''KING'' 151 4. Ballwich- Jumping and team work Divide the children in teams of 6. Each team should have 5 large balls - basketball, volleyball, football and softball. Have a start line. The finish line should be 10m away. Each team should stand in a line formation with balls sandwiched between their chest and the back of the child ahead of them - one ball sandwiched between two partners. Their arms should be extended sideways and they cannot touch the ball after the signal/ start. Each team should move from the start line to the finish line without dropping the ball. Any team that drops the ball should go back to the start line and re-start the race. The team that finishes first is the winner. Cool-down - 5 min Have children move slowly (e.g., in a slow jog, brisk walk) around the activity area. Lead, or have a student lead, a stretching routine. 152 Warm-up and Cool-down Exercises A proper warm up can increase the blood flow to the working muscle which results in decreased muscle stiffness, less risk of injury and improved performance. Additional benefits of warming up include physiological and psychological preparation. Benefits of a Proper Warm Up: Increased Muscle Temperature - The temperature increases within muscles that are used during a warm-up routine. A warmed muscle both contracts more forcefully and relaxes more quickly. In this way both speed and strength can be enhanced. Also, the probability of overstretching a muscle and causing injury is far less. Increased Body Temperature - This improves muscle elasticity, also reducing the risk of strains and pulls. Blood Vessels Dilate - This reduces the resistance to blood flow and lower stress on the heart. Increased Blood Temperature - The temperature of blood increases as it travels through the muscles, and as blood temperature rises, haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily in the muscles. This means a slightly greater volume of oxygen is made available to the working muscles, enhancing endurance and performance. Improved Range of Motion - The range of motion around a joint is increased. Hormonal Changes - Your body increases its production of the various hormones responsible for regulating energy production. During a warm-up, this balance of hormones makes more carbohydrates and fatty acids available for energy production. Mental Preparation - The warm-up is also a good time to mentally prepare for an event by clearing the mind, increasing focus and reviewing skills and strategy. Positive imagery can also relax the athlete and build concentration. 153 Keep it simple: March: March on the spot. Lift your knees high and move your hands in a coordinated manner. Do various locomotor actions like jumping on one foot, on two feet and march walking forward and backward, on signs given by the teacher. Tip Toes: Walk on your tip toes. Let's Box: Stand still and 'shadow box' by punching the air in front of you (obviously not touching anyone!). Shiver and shake: Shake your body in a shivery motion. Bend over and try to touch your feet. Bend over sideways to both sides. Smugglers This is a warm up game using coloured hoops and coloured bean bags. Scatter the hoops around the area in which you are working. Split the class in half - into smugglers and 'goodies'. The goodies should have a 30 second head start to place bean bags in their correct corresponding coloured hoop. On the blow of the whistle, the smugglers must 'steal' the bean bags from their correct hoops and place them incorrectly. The 'goodies' have to keep going to try and remedy the problem. Lots of fun, and gets the heart rate going! Jungle Outing Take the children on a jungle journey. Let them enjoy all the experiences that one would have when hiking through the jungle. The teacher should give appropriate commands, and the children should carry out a suitable action: jump over logs duck under branches high knees through quicksand run from the tiger tip toe past the snake talk to the monkeys (ooh, ooh, aah, aah), etc. This really gets the kids heart pumping and they have a blast! 154 Do the Opposite Children have to listen very carefully! On GO - The children must stop. On STOP - The children must move around the space either walking or running. On UP - The children must sit or lay down. On DOWN - children must stretch up to the ceiling. The teacher can catch the children doing the incorrect action if desired. Aerobic warm up You can do the following aerobic movements in any sequence for about 5-10 minutes as a warm up routine. Hop right and left Beginning with the right foot, step in your place and hop. Repeat on the left. Cue the children: Right hop, left hop. Jump Right and turn Beginning with your feet together and hands on hips, jump in your place for eight counts.

There is no active supply of nutrients to the cartilage tissues covering the ends of bones in joints. Cartilage is fed by the migration of particles from the joint fluid surrounding it, known as the synovial fluid. To be able to absorb the synovial fluid optimally, the cartilage has recourse to an alteration of pressure and suction forces. It is precisely this regular rhythmic exchange optimizing the supply to the cartilage that is achieved with the flexibility exercises. Indulging in regular stretching exercises leads to enhanced cartilage nutrition and loosening up of all the connective tissues. While performing stretching exercises both outward and inward concentration is necessary. 159 What have you learnt?
