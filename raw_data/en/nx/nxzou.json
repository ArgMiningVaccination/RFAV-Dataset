The cause of RA remains unknown. Symptoms The most common symptom of RA is joint pain and morning joint stiffness. Several joints on both sides of the body are usually affected, especially those of the hands, wrists, knees, and feet. Affected joints may feel warm or appear swollen. People with RA may have other symptoms, including weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and, occasionally, fever. Healthy Lifestyle Tips Although exercise may initially increase [ pain ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1051005#hn-1051005-need-to-know), gentle exercises help people with RA.1 , 2 Women with RA taking low-dose steroid therapy can safely participate in a weight-bearing exercise program with many positive effects on physical function, activity and fitness levels, and bone mineral density, and with no aggravation of disease activity.3 Many doctors recommend swimming, stretching, or walking to people with RA. Holistic Options The role of [ manipulation ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2943006#hn-2943006-001) in managing RA has received little study. In one small controlled trial,4 patients with RA were found to have more tenderness at certain body locations compared to healthy people. Six minutes of gentle spinal manipulation decreased this tenderness temporarily in the spinal areas but not in areas around the knees or ankles. The effect of manipulation on the symptoms or progression of RA has not been investigated. [] Eating Right The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. |Recommendation||Why| |Eat healthy fats|| | A low-fat diet that avoids animal fat in meat and dairy may help decrease the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. Feeding a high-fat diet to animals who are susceptible to autoimmune disease has increased the severity of RA. People with RA have been reported to eat more fat, particularly animal fat, than those without RA. In short-term studies, diets completely free of fat have helped people with RA. Since at least some dietary fat is essential for humans, though, the significance of this finding is not clear. |Pour on the olive oil|| | Olive oil appears to reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Preliminary evidence suggests that consumption of olive oil, rich in oleic acid, may decrease the risk of developing RA. One trial in which people with RA received either fish oil or olive oil, found that olive oil capsules providing 6.8 grams of oleic acid per day for 24 weeks produced modest clinical improvement and beneficial changes in |Limit animal fats|| | People with RA who eat less arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid found in animal fats), by avoiding meat, egg yolks, and whole-milk products may experience a reduction in tender and swollen joints. Arachidonic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid found in animal fats that the body uses to make inflammatory substances. In a controlled study, people with rheumatoid arthritis were instructed to reduce their arachidonic acid intake to less than 90 mg per day by eating minimal amounts of meat, no egg yolks, and only low-fat milk products. Compared with a group following a typical Western diet, the low arachidonic acid diet led to a 14% reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints. A second part of this study also found that the anti-inflammatory benefits of fish oil were significantly better when combined with the low arachidonic acid diet. |Try fasting, followed by a vegetarian diet|| | In one study, fasting followed by a 12-month vegetarian diet improved rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Fasting has been shown to improve both signs and symptoms of RA, but most people have relapsed after the returning to a standard diet. When fasting was followed by a 12-month vegetarian diet, however, the benefits of fasting appeared to persist. It is not known why the combination of these dietary programs (i.e., fasting followed by a vegetarian diet) might be helpful, and the clinical trial that investigated this combination has been criticized both for its design and interpretation. |Try the Warmbrand diet|| | A diet free of meat, poultry, dairy, chemicals, sugar, eggs, and processed foods has helped people with rheumatoid arthritis in anecdotal reports. Strictly vegetarian diets that are also very low in fat have been reported to reduce RA symptoms. In the 1950s through the 1970s, Max Warmbrand, a naturopathic doctor, used a very low-fat diet to treat people with RA. He recommended a diet free of meat, dairy, chemicals, sugar, eggs, and processed foods. A short-term (ten weeks) study employing a similar approach failed to produce beneficial effects. Long before publication of that negative report, however, Dr. Warmbrand had claimed that his diet took at least six months to achieve noticeable results. In one trial lasting 14 weeks\u2014still significantly less than six months\u2014a pure vegetarian, gluten-free (no wheat, rye, or barley) diet was gradually changed to permit dairy, leading to improvement in both symptoms and objective laboratory measures of disease. The extent to which a low-fat vegetarian diet (or one low in animal fat) would help people with RA remains unclear. |Check for food allergies or sensitivities|| | Your healthcare provider can help you determine if certain foods are making your arthritis worse. Food sensitivities develop when pieces of intact protein in food are able to cross through the intestinal barrier. Many patients with RA have been noted to have increased intestinal permeability, especially when experiencing symptoms, and RA has been linked to |Cut back on coffee|| | Drinking four or more cups of coffee per day was associated with an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis in preliminary research. Drinking four or more cups of coffee per day has been associated with an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis in preliminary research. [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. |Supplement||Why| | | 3 Stars Borage Oil 1.1 to 2.8 grams of GLA daily | | Oils containing the omega-6 fatty acid gamma linolenic acid, such as borage oil, have been reported to be effective in treating people with rheumatoid arthritis.

In a preliminary trial, an extract of the Chinese herbal remedy Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, in the amount of 360 to 570 mg per day for 16 weeks, produced improvement in symptoms and laboratory tests in eight of nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, one patient developed high blood pressure during the trial. In a double-blind trial, an extract of this herb, given in the amount of 360 mg per day for 20 weeks was significantly more effective than a placebo at reducing disease activity. A lower amount (160 mg/day) was also more effective than the placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. No serious side effects were reported. | | 3 Stars Vitamin E 1,200 to 1,800 IU daily | | Vitamin E is an important antioxidant, protecting joints against oxidative damage.
