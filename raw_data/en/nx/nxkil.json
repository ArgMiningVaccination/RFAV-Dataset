This is a dynamic time in the profession of nursing and I'm excited to share some of our many accomplishments from the past year. Our nurses embody a spirit of compassion and a relentless focus on improving the lives of the patients and families we serve. Through that focus, we live Ochsner's mission to Serve, Heal, Lead, Educate and Innovate. This year our nurses brought to life several improvement initiatives that will keep our patients safer, more comfortable, and better informed about their care. In this report, you will see highlights of our new bedside hand-off program, new bedside technology, and how our nurses are involved in care delivery, research and care design. In addition to delivering on our promise to our patients, we are also committed to the well-being of our staff. This year we've invested in hundreds of programs to develop our highly professional nursing team. You will read about Care for the Caregiver, a new initiative we've launched in 2017 that is intended to support better health and well-being for our staff. We are proud of all of our recent accomplishments and we have a keen eye on the future. Having an adequate supply of exceptionally educated and well trained professional nurses is among our top priorities. We search locally, nationally and internationally for the best and brightest to join our strong team of nearly 5,000 nurses. We partner with almost 200 academic organizations and host hundreds of nursing students every year in our organizations. I read somewhere that \" Nursing is where passion meets purpose .\" That is no more true anywhere than right here at Ochsner.

The professional development program recognizes and rewards clinical nursing expertise in direct patient care. The program engages nurses in professional development activities with the goal of enhancing professional nursing practice and fostering ongoing skill development. Nurses who participate in the clinical ladder program are nurses who go above and beyond in their role. Each year, participants have the chance to move to the next level of the clinical ladder with pay incentives for each new level. Teresa Rongey, BSN, RN, CCRN, is a critical care nurse in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit at Ochsner Health Center- Elmwood Campus. As a participant in Ochsner's Clinical Ladder program, she shares: \"I have been a nurse with Ochsner for nearly 21 years and this year is the first time that I applied for the Clinical Ladder. Initially, I found the Clinical Ladder to be intimidating. I knew there were benefits to participating, but I felt overwhelmed by the application process. It appeared that there were so many requirements. I finally 'took the plunge' and decided to complete the Clinical Ladder packet to submit in February of 2017. In the middle of 2016, I sat down with a couple of co-workers who were familiar with the Clinical Ladder and they gave me feedback about what activities would be good to include in my application packet. This past year, I worked as a preceptor, served as charge nurse, and planned team building activities on my unit which makes me feel fulfilled to know I'm guiding new nurses and contributing to my team. As we looked through the packet, I realized that because of the professional development activities I participate in and the leadership roles I serve in, I would not only be able to meet the requirements for the Clinical Ladder, but I would also be able to get at least a level two. Imagine my surprise when I heard the news that I was approved for level three! I have now become an advocate for the Clinical Ladder and I try to give co-workers guidance and encouragement so that they too can share in the benefits. It has helped me not only financially but has shown me how I can help others on my team become more actively engaged professionally. I am grateful to my friends that gave me guidance and for the opportunity to participate in this program.\" In 2016 nearly 1,000 Ochsner nurses participated in the Clinical Ladder.Clinical Ladder engages nurses who spend 50% of time in patient care in professional development activities. EMPLOYER of Choice Through the Clinical Ladder, Ochsner nurses collaborate and lead in designing health care processes. \"The Clinical Ladder program drives nurses to participate on committees and get involved with initiatives where they play an active role in decision-making; their voice helps improve patient care and our health system and strengthens the nursing profession.\" Sylvia Hartmann, MN, RN, NEA-BC Chief Nursing Officer, LOOKING AHEAD TO 2018 OCHSNER NURSINGNURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: EMPLOYER OF CHOICENURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: PROVIDER OF CHOICECELEBRATING OCHSNER NURSES The Center for Nursing Research: Changing Practice...Changing Lives The Center for Nursing Research is available to assist with work-related projects and academic-related assignments as you pursue higher education and accrue clinical ladder points.

Karen Rice, DNS, APRN, ACNS- BC, ANP , Program Director, Center for Nursing Research worked with us closely to develop the abstract, organize the outline, and delineate the objectives. We originally intended our project as only a poster submission but Dr. Rice convinced us that the work we had done represented much more. She was instrumental in coaching us through the submission process and encouraged us to present the project as a podium presentation. Additionally, she offered her invaluable support throughout the process of preparing for the conference, down to taping a video segment of our scope cleaning process. It is important for nurses to realize that unit initiatives aimed at improving outcomes can easily become opportunities to disseminate best practice with the help of The Center for Nursing Research. Sharing unit-based experiences through presentation at conferences helps you become part of a strong professional community, allows you to network with others who share your professional passions, and develops your personal and institutional credibility.\" NURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: EMPLOYER OF CHOICE12\"What brings me joy at work is the progress that Ochsner Medical Center- West Bank Campus team has made in elevating our practice in nursing research and incorporating evidenced based practices (EBP ,)\" says Melissa Adams, Chief Nursing Officer, OMC- West Bank Campus. \"This year, our Clinical Nurse Specialist worked with many of our nursing units and auxiliary departments to promote EBP and research throughout our facility and the effort resulted in nurses participating in journal clubs and presenting posters and presentations at local and national conferences. Here are just a few examples: Dr. Deidra Dudley, DNS, MN, MS, RN-BC, NEA-BC, AVP OMC-West Bank Campus presented her doctoral research on nurse well- being and quality of working life at multiple local and national conferences.

Difficult and traumatic experiences can be a part of every day in healthcare and they take a toll on employees. Ochsner Nurses are committed to supporting each other. \"The program is meant for any employee who cares for patients, including physicians, nurses, technicians, house staff and students,\" says Cristina Wheat, C.O.P .E. Program Director. The program supports healthcare providers who been involved in an adverse patient event and recognizes healthcare providers who experience a traumatic event as also being victims. This second victim phenomenon can and has caused providers great angst and anxiety, depression-like symptoms, isolation, an inability to function well at work, biased judgment, or even withdrawal from the healthcare profession altogether. \"When I contact a nurse, I explain what the COPE program is and that I am here to listen and support the nurse. I have had conversations in person and on the phone\" says Deborah Goodlett, MSN, RN, Director of Education and Professional Development, Ochsner Medical Center-Kenner. \"I am there to listen to as much as the nurse needs to tell me or as little. The call is confidential and I assist by confirming that emotional symptoms like sadness, insomnia and shame are normal and will improve over time. I am there to listen, I make sure I leave them with my phone number and let the nurse know I am available to talk again in the future if needed. The program allows nurses to care for nurses during challenging times. The C.O.P .E. program is a way for us to show how much we care for our employees. When a nurse experiences the loss of a patient or a medical error that has a negative outcome, he or she can be emotionally impacted. Through the program, nurses are given an opportunity to share with another nurse who cares.\" We believe that TEAMWORK makes us strongerC.O.P.E. is voluntary and completely confidential. C.O.P.E. matches healthcare providers with a peer who would not be otherwise involved in the adverse event. The peer supporter provides a supportive setting to express thoughts and reactions to enhance coping and resilience.ADVERSE EVENT SUPPORT: OCHSNER NURSES PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT THROUGH THE C.O.P .E PROGRAM One C.O.P.E. participant shared, \"I am blown away that 48 hours later, someone I don't know called just to see how I am.\"NURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: EMPLOYER OF CHOICE16The work we do as a healthcare team is fulfilling and exciting work but also has high demands on all aspects of our health and well- being. That is why Ochsner's nursing leadership team is shining a light on the need to care for caregivers. The Care for the Caregiver initiative places priority on championing the health of nurses at Ochsner and supporting a healthy work environment. \"It's that passion to provide for others that often gives nurses permission to be at the bottom of their personal list of priorities. This means that in such physically and mentally demanding roles as caregivers we are at risk for burnout,\" says Tracey Moffatt, MHA, BSN, RN, CNO Ochsner Health System in Just Breathe: Strategies for Caregivers To Replenish Their Spirits , an article published on Ochsner's To Your Health blog. The initiative supports nurses' health and well-being through activities like a nurse executive task force for creative scheduling, assessment of nurses' Work-Related Quality of Life, trainings, initiating \"quiet rooms\" for restoring breaks, and creating a menu of supportive resources.

Write down the last time you felt stressed. What did you do well, why? What could you improve, how? Reflection can also help you connect to your purpose, identify your strengths, stay positive and practice gratitude. Committing to activities that relax you is a key to maintaining resilience or your ability to cope with stressful experiences. Breathing exercises can help you relax quickly. Take deep breaths for 60-90 seconds a few times a day to renew and calm your mind. Meditation is another way to calm your mind and relax. Meditate by focusing on a word, prayer, or sound for 15 minutes a day. Taking restoring breaks is one way to find balance. During your next break, limit distractions, turn your phone off, practice gratitude, stretch, or use breathing exercises to renew. When you leave work, do the things that restore you and practice good sleep hygiene. Committing to the renewal of your mind, body, and spirit is a priority to maintain resilience. Renew by nourishing your body with healthy food, exercising, getting enough rest, and managing stress. Helpful stress reduction techniques include managing negative thoughts, stretching your body, connecting with others, getting organized, and using art therapy and music therapy.

Understanding that a double mastectomy was difficult for a patient, Chabert nurses, Heather Champagne, RN, decided to their patients' day. Recognizing that the patient was disheartened, they asked the patient if they could decorate her surgical breast binder. They renamed the garment to \"Chabert Secrets\" and set about personalizing it for her. With the patients permission, other staff joined in and before she knew it the patient was smiling and laughing. The patient later shared that this had improved her outlook and attitude and she felt much more hopeful facing her future and suggested that they do it for all of the patients undergoing this life changing surgery. Patient-Centered Care in the Bayou Region \" 'When was the first time you knew that you wanted to be a nurse?' I often ask of the caregivers that would like to join my team\" , shares Jana Semere, Chief Nursing Officer, Bayou Region, Ochsner Health System. \"Inevitably, there is a defining moment in each nurse's life that leads him or her to pursue a career in nursing. As I listen to the nurse speak of these personal moments that have shaped his or her career path, I am able to gain insight into his or her work ethic and whether they embody the character traits that nurses exemplify every day-humility, service, compassion, and teamwork. With those qualities in mind, nurses are sent forth to change lives and to positively influence each patient's experience while they are entrusted in our care. I am both confident, and eternally grateful, in knowing that our patients feel comforted, cared for, safe, and supported throughout every event that places them in our hands because of the remarkable Bayou Region team,\" Jana says.

The Patient Safety Culture Assessment is a yearly assessment that gathers valuable feedback from Ochsner employees. In response to feedback received, several improvements have been put in place for a safer environment of care, like the use of standardized Bedside Handoff and Patient Safety Huddles. BEDSIDE HANDOFF Nurses invite patients to participate in care through Bedside Handoff. Bedside Handoff provides a standardized procedure for nurses to use when giving a report on patients during the change-of-shift. The innovative use of the process increases efficiency of the time spent at the bedside and keeps patients at the center of their care, including patients and their families in the important activity and offering them the opportunity to ask questions. Nurses use the SBART communication tool to organize critical information into categories: situation, background, assessment, recommendation, and thank you. Bedside handoff affords increased consistency of patient care through the use of the new EPIC tool, peer accountability, review of the plan of care updating the white boards, and taking the first set of vital signs. Nurses have reported that they start their shift with an understanding of how to organize and plan their day because they have seen each of their patients within the first thirty minutes of the shift. Off-going nurses have reported the satisfaction of saying goodbye and thanking the patient for the opportunity to care for them which allows a closure to the time spent and relationship built in the prior 12 hours. PROVIDER of Choice Standardized Communication is Safe Communication Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Thank you NURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: PROVIDER OF CHOICE26AMBULATORY NURSES ENSURE HIGH QUALITY CARE WITH PATIENT SAFETY HUDDLES Research supports the use of huddles to enhance communication, increase transparency, strengthen teamwork, and assist healthcare staff in providing safe patient care. In 2016, the Ambulatory Nursing Executive Council (ANEC) identified an opportunity to raise awareness of potential safety concerns related to patient falls, specimen labeling, and medication administration, using a multi-disciplinary patient safety huddle. Patient safety huddles help prevent potential problems or recurrent issues and offer a greater degree of accountability for huddle participants. During huddles, staff members are empowered to bring forth concerns and propose solutions to issues. Nurses use tools like the Fall Scene Investigation tool and the Mislabeled Specimen Mini Root Cause Analysis tool to investigate occurrences and problem solve in real time. In 2017, the Fall Scene Investigation and the Mislabeled Specimen Mini Root Cause Analysis forms have been embedded in the Safety on Site (S.O.S.) system and staff members are required to complete them before closing the patient file. ANEC has developed additional tools, like the Medication and Vaccine Occurrence Drill Down tools, to encourage nurses to report concerns and occurrences, increase the number of Good Catches, and improve safety of medication administration.

The Performance Improvement department evaluated the issues reported and brought together a workgroup to start an improvement project with a goal to reduce inpatient iatrogenic hypoglycemia. The workgroup team consisted of a clinical pharmacist, physician, dietician, nursing team, diabetic educator, dietary, and pharmacy staff. The team met weekly to review the cause and effect of our processes with a specific goal to reduce hypoglycemia effects by 10%. Several initiatives were put in place to meet the goal, some of which include a clinical pharmacists' review of hypoglycemia with provider-specific education, staff education on hyperkalemia treatment, standardized sliding scales, daily reporting of hypoglycemic events in morning safety huddle, and staff education. Since the start of the program, which began in 2015, we've completed the following initiatives: Epic glucose Narrator was completed allowing nursing and physicians to view a graph of glucose levels and insulin administration. Diabetic education for all teams with a snack brochure assigned to all nourishment rooms to ensure proper midnight snacks for patients. Standardization of meal times for diabetic patients. Continuous staff education and training for onboarding of new staff. Monthly meetings to review progress and reassessment for continuous improvement. \"As we continue to improve the care we are delivering to our diabetic patients, our results show great success. Our goal was to improve by 10% and by the end of 2016, we improved in reduction of insulin induced hypoglycemia by 30%.\"PROVIDER of Choice Donna Martin MSN-HCSM, RN Chief Nursing Officer,Ochsner Baptist Medical CenterNURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: PROVIDER OF CHOICE28 THROUGH THE LIFESPAN, WE ARE WITH YOU.

Quiet Time is an evidence-based structured time period when the lights are dimmed, interruptions are minimized and new moms and their support persons are encouraged to sleep and bond with their baby with skin-to- skin contact. During Quiet Time, daily from 2:00pm through 4:00pm, all visitation is prohibited, lights are dimmed, televisions are turned off, and traffic is minimized on the unit. The multidisciplinary team of stakeholders, including the Mother Baby Unit staff, dietary, lab physicians, patient escort, clinic staff, and administration, participated in planning the program. Once the administration team approved the project, staff and patient education began with brochures, wall clings, introduction in prenatal classes and both staff and clinic meetings. Project leaders ensured that a good process was in place to educate moms during their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Because of the new Quiet Time program, we have seen decreased separation of the mother and infant during the night and improved rates of exclusive breastfeeding. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (\"BFHI\"), a global program sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) encourages and recognizes hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for breastfeeding mothers and their babies.

Ochsner Medical Center-West Bank Campus Family Unit has 2 certified car seat technicians who work with each client, one-on-one, to give you the instructions needed to accurately install and restrain your child. Ranked 3rd highest in Region B, we perform on average 250-300 checks per year. We are available to current or future patients, as well as the outside community. The OMC-West Bank Campus is our primary checking station, but we also participate in several community events at different locations. For example, we do car seat checks and installation at a popular retailer on the westbank, Krunchy Mama. At Zephyr Field, we work in collaboration with Louisiana Passenger Safety Task Force - UMC to donate booster seats to qualifying families. We are present at OMC-West Bank Campus' Mommy-to-Be open house and Baby Expo event at the Pontchartrain Center for demonstration and instruction. We find it best when our parents have the car seat installation done prior to the birth of their baby, but are present throughout the week to perform checks during hospital stay. We also offer installation and checks during times of transition or purchase of new car seat. Our goal is to ensure the safety of your child throughout their many stages of growth.

EPIC Rover and Secure Chat- Nursing leaders have been working closely with our physicians, informatics team and project management partners to bring new innovations to life. Secure Chat is an Epic tool that allows users to send secure text messages through mobile applications. In May, Ochsner introduced a limited release of this functionality to include physicians, APPs, residents and community physicians. A pilot program, testing broader use of this functionality for nurse-to-provider communication, also begin at OMC-Baton Rouge at the same time. With the aim of broadening the pilot, Ochsner will invest in replacing current Spectralinks with new devices for inpatient units. The new devices use the Epic Rover application that will enhance nurses work experience and significantly improve patient care and safety. Based on what we learn through this pilot, we anticipate broadening this program to include nurse-to-provider communication across our system before the end of this year! \"With the integration of nursing expertise, knowledge, and wisdom, an informaticist facilitates the best options for delivering quality care by ensuring the appropriate data elements are available in the electronic medical record.\" ADVANTAGES OF SECURE CHAT AND ROVER IN EPIC Direct to providers: Nurses will be able to view the on- call schedule and message providers directly without going through the operator. Patient-centered conversations: HIPAA-compliant integration with patients' treatment teams all in one app will supplement existing workflows to reduce wasted time. Nursing Documentation Improvements: Nurses will be able to use the Rover app to document medications, take pictures for documentation and document in the flowsheets. Easy to use: Because Secure Chat works like other common instant messaging apps, the look will be familiar to most users. Users will know if they have new messages even if they aren't logged in to the app similar to your smart phone.Ann Lockhart, MN, RN-BC Assistant Vice President Clinical Transformation and Informatics New Tools: Dinamap Neuron Monitors Allows Real Time Documentation Beginning in August 2017, OMC-West Bank Campus installed Neuron monitors to Dinamaps which will allow real-time documentation of vital signs into Epic. Currently, once the nurse or PCT obtains a patient's vital signs via a Dinamap, he/she must then go to a computer, login, and then document the information into Epic. This new process will facilitate immediate availability of vital sign data. This real time documentation is used to display alerts to clinicians for changes in the patient's vital signs. Real time documentation is critical for early identification of patient change in condition in order to have early intervention. HOW DO DINAMAP NEURONS WORK? The patient's Epic record will be accessed on the Neuron by scanning the patient's arm band ensuring the correct patient and chart. The vital signs will then be obtained via the Dinamap, and once the nurse and/or nurse technician verifies the information is correct and hits send, the information will go directly into the patient's Epic medical record within minutes. What is the benefit? No delay in documenting vital signs into Epic, hence avoiding any delay in patient care. Timing The Neurons will be focused in the MedSurg and Telemetry units at OMC-West Bank Campus in a pilot, and eventually the technology will be installed across the system. LOOKING AHEAD TO 201846LOOKING AHEAD to 2018 PHILANTHROPY UPDATE AND NEW NURSING INNOVATION FUNDS In 2016, donors entrusted $76,457 to nursing funds through the system, an increase of 40 percent over 2015. The Nursing Education Endowed Fund provided support for beside nurses to participate in scholarship to improve bedside care. Ochsner Health System nurses have ownership of their practice when they are able to identify their learning needs and pursue scholarship accordingly through the Nursing Education Endowed Fund and campus or region-specific funds. NEW OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT NURSES We're proud to introduce new regional funds that will provide resources for all nursing needs throughout the system. Known as Innovation funds, these opportunities for support embody Ochsner's Mission to Serve, Heal, Lead, Innovate and Educate, allowing each to flourish through the nurses at the Greater New Orleans Region, the Baton Rouge Region, the Bayou Region, the North Shore Region and the West Bank. The first project these funds will target promise to promote an environment where the well-being of our colleagues is a priority. Each day, our Ochsner nurses work hard to put patients and their families first. Our nurses take an oath to devote themselves to the welfare of those committed to their care. In doing so, they often make incredible sacrifices. It's important that we find ways to find the right balance between work and life. Sometimes that can be something as simple as taking a moment to step away and recharge. That's why having a space for healing the mind, body and spirit is important - a place for One Moment of quiet and stillness so our nurses have an opportunity for restoration throughout their day if needed. This quiet space is just one more tool we hope to give our staff - ensuring they find balance in their day and approach every encounter with compassion. This effort is made possible through donations to the campus Nursing Innovation funds. None of this is possible without the generosity of our donors.

These are just a few ways they care for our patients: 1. A nurse is the first person to lay hands on a patient whose heart has stopped to initiate CPR. When God saves a life, it is the nurse who feels that heart begin to beat again beneath his or her hands. 2. A nurse is the one to recognize the earliest signs that a patient is having a stroke, to get the needed diagnostic tests ordered for a patient, and to administer life-saving medication. 3. It is a nurse who touches her patient's cool skin when she hears the words, \"I just don't feel right,\" and realizes her patient is having a heart attack. That same nurse sees a slight change in blood pressure with another patient, gets orders for a sepsis work-up, starts antibiotics immediately, and saves the patient a trip to ICU... or worse. 4. A nurse is the one who catches an error in medication dosing before it reaches the patient. 5. A nurse is the one who teaches a new doctor which medication reverses the effects of benzodiazepines with a patient who is barely breathing, gives the medicine, and watches the patient wake up. 6. A nurse holds a 41 year old man newly diagnosed with end-stage heart failure in her arms and lets him cry big tears on her shoulder as he worries about what will become of his wife and three children. 7. A nurse shows her patient who just received a kidney transplant the urine pouring into his foley catheter, sees the tears of joy in his eyes, and chants with him and his family that pee is beautiful. 8. A nurse puts her stethoscope in her patient's ears and lets him listen for the first time to the sound of the heart that was transplanted into his body a few days before. 9. A nurse holds a ten-year old little girl's hand as she whispers a final goodbye to her dying mother. 10. A nurse cheers loudly with unabashed shouts of \"Whoo-hoo!\" as she watches a patient who wasn't expected to live walk out of the hospital. 11. Nurses are the ones who teach transplant patients how to avoid infections (which can be lethal) once they go home, and teach them self-care so that they can enjoy their new chance at life. 12. When there is no hope left for a patient and the family says, \"There's nothing anyone can do,\" it's the nurse who tells them \"There is something we can do. We can keep your dad comfortable.\" The Nursing with Soul collection is a forum for nurses to share stories, reflections, and artwork and is published on Ochsner's Share Your Story website and the System Nursing Professional Development SharePoint site.

ALTON OCHSNER'S CREED Develop to the utmost one's God-given talents. Utilize every waking moment to improve one's self - spiritually, educationally, and physically. Be honest with yourself and with others. Be loyal. Loyalty is one of the finest of all attributes and it is found so infrequently. Leisure, although beneficial, is too frequently abused because of the inability to utilize it in a beneficial manner. Such instances cause waste and may result in detrimental excesses, such as alcoholism and boredom. Mental activity delays deterioration of the mind, much as physical activity prevents muscular atrophy. Develop and maintain a positive attitude. Determination and industriousness result in unexpected positive results. Live every moment, minute, hour, and day to the fullest. Strive to make each day better than the previous one. Life is not eternal and every moment is so precious; none should be wasted.LOOKING AHEAD TO 201850 51 LOOKING AHEAD TO 2018 OCHSNER NURSINGNURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: EMPLOYER OF CHOICENURSING STRATEGIC PRIORITY: PROVIDER CHOICECELEBRATING OCHSNER NURSES 52\"Care for one, that's love .
