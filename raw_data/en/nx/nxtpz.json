The stimulation of a specific point on th body with a specific method, resulting in a therapeutic homeostatic effect. The ancient Chinese discovered 361 acupoints in humans and 173 acupoints in animals. Modern research shows that acupoints are located in the areas where there is a high density of free nerve endings, mast cells, small arterioles and lymphatic vessels. A number of research studies have shown that stimulation of acupoints induce the release of beta-endorphins, serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Therefore, acupuncture for pain relief is well supported by these scientific studies. What are Acupuncture methods and goals? Acupoints may be stimulated in a variety of ways. These techniques include dry needling, moxibustion, aqua-acupuncture and electro-acupuncture. Whatever tools are used, the goal is always the same: to restore the flow of Qi and allow homeostasis to return. How safe is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a very safe medical procedure when administered by a qualified practitioner. Very few side effects have been found in clinical cases. How long does each treatment take? Each session will take approximately 40-60 minutes. Does Acupuncture hurt? A proper acupuncture treatment may induce distension and heaviness sensations along the contraction of local muscle. Over 95% of patients are comfortable with acupuncture therapy. Due to the relaxation effect, some animals fall asleep during treatment. Why is Acupuncture frequently combined with herbs?
