Health Check BBC World Service - - Health & Fitness - Health issues and medical breakthroughs from around the world. - [What happened to babies with Zika virus](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-happened-to-babies-with-zika-virus/id261779764?i=1000626248387) What happened to babies with Zika virus In March 2015, Brazil reported a large outbreak of the Zika virus infection. Over the next year, the disease became a global medical emergency. Thousands of babies were born brain-damaged, after their mothers became infected while pregnant. As the World Health Organisation discusses the current global Zika situation and the lessons learned from the outbreak, Claudia Hammond is joined by Dr Graham Easton to hear from the families affected in Brazil and ask what life is now like for the babies who were born with complications. We also hear about new recommendations for how communities around the world can better prevent Sudden Cardiac Death, as well as research on whether how far away you are from a defibrillator is related to how deprived your area is. Claudia speaks to a psychiatric nurse and the woman who says she saved her life by going above and beyond the call of duty. And we hear about the world first from Australia, where scientists discovered a living worm in the brain of a woman who'd been experiencing stomach pain and night sweats.

But the person he operated on died, as did subsequent patients. And in 2013, Macchiarini was reported to Sweden's Karolinska Institute, where he had carried out the operations, for scientific misconduct. Over the years, Health Check has followed the story and in this programme we hear the latest as Macchiarini appeals against a prison sentence in Sweden for gross assault. Claudia Hammond is joined by BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher who has been finding out whether eating his meals quickly or slowly is better for his health. And he brings us news from the USA of one of the first functional kidney transplants from a pig into a human.

It's the latest in a string of health alerts issued by WHO in the last 12 months. According to reports, 300 children died worldwide last year by taking contaminated cough syrups. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby joins Claudia Hammond to discuss this and the latest health research. When the Ugandan government passed tough anti LGBTQ legislation in May, health experts claimed it would have a devastating effect on HIV healthcare services. We hear from a clinic in Kampala where people living with HIV are scared to collect their medicine. And Claudia speaks to Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at University of California Berkeley in the USA, Bob Knight. His team are trying to improve technology for people who struggle with speech by decoding brain signals. All with a bit of help from classic rock music. Presenter: Claudia Hammond Producer: Clare Salisbury - [A closer look at leprosy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-closer-look-at-leprosy/id261779764?i=1000623964266) A closer look at leprosy In the week that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that leprosy could now be endemic in the South-eastern United States, Claudia Hammond looks at global action on leprosy with science journalist Kamala Thiagarajan. There is an international effort to learn more about weaning seriously ill people off ventilator support in hospitals. We hear about the Weansafe study from Ireland. Professor of integrated community child health at University College London, Monica Lakhanpaul joins Claudia in the studio to discuss why the roll out of a new vaccine for RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) in the US could be a gamechanger. And why on your next trip to a hospital, you could see groups of elderly in-patients going on walks. Could it help prevent the effects of bedrest?

While she was in hospital in the USA, her cells were harvested without her knowledge which, since being replicated infinitely, have gone on to enable research into cancer, dementia and Parkinson's. As well as contributing to the development of vaccines for polio and COVID-19. Her family have fought for decades to get justice for the \"stolen\" cells, and this week reached a settlement with Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The United Nations says we now live in the era of \"global boiling\". As temperatures continue to soar across the southern USA, the BBC's Health and Science Correspondent James Gallagher heads to a high-tech heated chamber in the UK, on a mission to find out how hot is too hot for our bodies to cope with. In Sweden, dentist Dr Nivetha Natarajan Gavriilidou tells Claudia Hammond about her work using the bone structure of the jaw to predict how we might get shorter as we age. Could it lead to dentists working closer with GPs? It's a question we also put to our studio guest family doctor Ann Robinson. Who brings us new research from the USA that could lead to better treatment for children's runny noses. And potentially some good news if you're struggling to shave seconds off your 5KM PB. Could beating your time be down to your genes? Presenter: Claudia Hammond Producer: Clare Salisbury - [Playing catch up on childhood immunisations](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playing-catch-up-on-childhood-immunisations/id261779764?i=1000622437927) Playing catch up on childhood immunisations The World Health Organisation and UNICEF say global immunisation services reached 4 million more children in 2022 compared to the previous year, after a huge backslide during the Covid 19 pandemic. But the progress in countries like India and Indonesia masks continued decline in many lower income countries. Global health expert Tabitha Mwangi and Claudia Hammond discuss how immunisation numbers can bounce back. They also look at new research from Sub-Saharan Africa that suggests as many as one in 10 teenagers might have high blood pressure, and what might be the most effective way of lowering it? While you may be gripped by the action from the Women's football World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, Dr Kerry Peek is keeping a careful eye on the games for health reasons. She's one of a team of 'concussion spotters' deployed this year for the first time at the tournament. Claudia asks her why professional sports women are more at risk from head injuries than men. And are you a perfectionist? Psychologist Dr Thom Curran says striving to be perfect could put our mental health at risk.

Note: this is serious journalism, not faddy health infotainment. I am a better person for listening to Health Check: more knowledgeable and more thoughtful. Highly recommended Claudia Hammond, you rock! Thank you for the awesome podcast :) "}
