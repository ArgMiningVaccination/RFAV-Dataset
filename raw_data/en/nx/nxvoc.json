Once you go 'Woo Woo', you never go back. I called our episode 'A vaccination for your Vibration', which is very apt as the day we recorded I had just received my first covid vaccination. I was full of gratitude for this albeit with a pretty sore arm. There are so many profound teachings when it comes to our soul. Rohit passionately shares his belief that our purpose is to awaken to our eternal spirit. Jesus said: The kingdom of heaven is within you. What did he mean? That deeper place within us, the non material spark, our spirit, essence, consciousness and substance. He also said: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they shall see God. Many interpret this to mean those who work to become free of the ego and WOW does the power of prayer and meditation help us to do this. To quote Rohit: We are a spirit encased in a physical body and when we tap into this deeper part, we become in tune with our true selves and therefore we are less likely to go into a spiral of self destruction. They say 'there is a God shaped hole in all of us'. I believe we have physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health and all are important. We talk a lot about surrender. This involves turning the analyser down, a skill that can be practised with mindfulness and energy meditation. These forms of meditation are what I see as a gym for the mind. We can strengthen these muscles. When we surrender and step back from the logical and analytical, left side of our brain, that is when the downloads come. Often, the deeper you can go, the more insights that come. As we discuss, sometimes those insights come from people aka guides in our lives. Sometimes people bless us with positive energy and then other times, people trigger us. Both experiences can teach us a lot, seeing these lessons as an important part of our journey helps us to live with a greater sense of gratitude and contentment. Rohit and I discuss the way that we react to others that trigger us. When we can let things bounce off us, knowing that nothing is personal, we are in a high vibrational state. When we become reactive, we are in a low vibrational state. It makes sense. The lowest and most broken I have been mentally, the most reactive I have been. It's an illness. Compassion, love and joy is who we really are in spirit at the heart of everything. We need to do the work to strip the fear away that we have picked up when 'life gets in the way'. It's important to remember, that when we go through a period of growth, it can be easy to be triggered by others. Rohit shared with me his journey with meditation and how he has been able to access much deeper experiences and as a result has completely transformed his life. As a meditation teacher, he is able to guide himself to these deep states without using an app. After the 8 week mindfulness course I completed at the start of 2019, I found myself getting into trance quickly to the point I could attend a full day retreat of intense practise. It can be common to see lights, Rohit describes his experience as seeing a blue, violet and white light (roughly 20 minutes into meditation). He likens it to a plane taking off and then getting into the clouds, the sweet spot. He shares with us the difference, in his experience, between mindful and deep devotional prayer and a feeling of complete oneness with the divine power versus routine prayer, perhaps asking for a list of what we need without taking it too deep. The formula Rohit shares for the most powerful meditation sessions - Meditation + Devotional Prayer +Cultivation of Gratitude and unconditional love = deep and powerful, life changing prayer. I have experienced very powerful moments with God without going into super, deep trance but I do understand what Rohit means. I find that the more I meditate, the deeper my prayer practise becomes. I also find that the power of music can take me to amazing spiritual places, especially when in a place of worship with lots of others who are vibrating at such a high level. This is something that can leave me buzzing for hours after and open my heart up to a crazy kind of love and compassion that feels supernatural. As I have shared before, this is something I will have to manage when things open back up, because increased spirituality is linked with increased mania and I need to be careful I don't fly too high like before. We got pretty deep, talking about meditation and the things that come up when you access these higher states of consciousness. Sometimes it can be overwhelming in terms of information that comes through. Signs and insights from above can come like buses. I have been keeping tabs on my mind and body after deep meditation sessions, to ensure that connecting deeply to my soul doesn't strip me from being grounded in the body. I like my grounded side too and I need this to stay healthy. This will be the goal moving forward but I will stay focused on love, ensuring fear doesn't stop me from these mind blowing experiences. Thanks to Rohit for sharing so deeply.

He has been volunteering for Science Divine, a not for profit organisation founded by his spiritual master, which has been at the forefront of spreading the joys of meditation & alleviating suffering for thousands of poor children by providing them free education and housing in India. Rohit's penetrating insights into human condition, his ability to combine principles of eastern philosophy & spiritual traditions with modern science to drive home the message of relevance of spirituality for our modern times has inspired & continues to inspire many. While he was growing up, Rohit's experiences instilled in him an extraordinary depth & a keen sense of curiosity, which he has been continuously channelling in his ongoing spiritual journey. One experience, which has left a profound impact on Rohit, was his mother's indomitable fight against brain cancer on two separate instances, which she eventually won through her sheer perseverance & will. Witnessing his mother's ability to exercise grace, faith, surrender & determination in her successful fight against cancer, inevitably left a profound impact on him. From an early age, he began to delve into the deeper dimensions of human existence, such as what it really means to be a human, what is our purpose of life, whether divine really exists, why is there suffering in life & what are the means by which we can manifest lasting joy in our life. This overwhelming sense of inquisitiveness inevitably led Rohit to immerse himself in spiritual texts and writings of Spiritual teachers and mystics, spanning across myriad of spiritual traditions. He drew immense succour from the writings of great spiritual masters such as Buddha, Krishna, St. Francis, Lao Tzu, Guru Nanak, Kabir, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi, Gurdjieff, Jiddu Krishnamurthi, Os ho and many more. An understanding dawned on him that the highest spiritual truth is one, which has been offered to humanity through various religious texts and interpretations by different spiritual masters since time immemorial. By studying the spiritual texts, he also realised that by harnessing spiritual practices such as meditation, breath work and yoga , we can realise joy and inner peace in our modern lives. In a nutshell- He found that spirituality is as much relevant to a modern society as it was to our ancient civilisation. Its not a coincidence, that findings from Modern Science continues to validate the therapeutic benefits of spiritual practices, such as meditation, yoga & breath work. In the evolving scientific domain of epigenetic's & quantum physics, it is being increasingly proved that we can harness the power of our intention, belief & heart to manifest healing & success in our life. Currently, Rohit is immersed in writing his debut novel, which he envisions as the go-to spiritual guide book for a contemporary human. The book will illuminate, upon how anyone can harness timeless spiritual principles and mindset to thrive in their life. It'll weave together ancient spiritual wisdom with findings from modern science.to reinforce the relevance of spirituality in our modern life. It'll exhort the readers to awaken themselves from their spiritual slumber & empower them with the techniques to manifest anything they desire.
