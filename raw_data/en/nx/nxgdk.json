Seymour 2016 Consumer LeRoy Strohman, D.D.S. 2017 Consumer Executive Director's Report by Kathy Weinberg, MSN, RN Presort Standard U.S. POSTAGE PAID Permit No. 14 Princeton, MN 55371Have You Completed Your CE Requirements? by Laura Hudson, MSN, RN Associate Director - CE/Workforce Every year, board disciplinary actions include lists of nurses who are sanctioned for failing to complete continu- ing education (CE) requirements for license renewal. E very day, board staff processes CE audits indicating not all Iowa nurses are following the 655 Iowa Administrative Code (IAC), chapter 5 rules. T he maximum fines for failing CE au - dits is $1,000 and the matter becomes a permanent public disciplinary record for the licensee. T his article is intended to provide licensees with information about the CE admin-istrative rule requirements for nursing licensure. Continuing education (CE) is mandated by Iowa law as a prerequisite to renewal of an Iowa nursing license. T he requirement is as follows: F or renewal of a three year license, the requirement is 36 contact hours, or 3.6 continuing education units (CEUs). F or renewal of a license that has been issued for less than three years, the requirement is 24 contact hours, or 2.4 CEUs. T his applies to the first renewal after any one of the following: - I nitial Iowa licensure by examination - I nitial Iowa licensure by endorsement from an - other state - R eactivation from inactive status A license issued for less than three years is granted for two years, plus the number of months to the birth month. T hereafter, the license must be renewed every three years. F or reactivation from an inactive status, the require - ment is 12 contact hours that are not more than 12 months old at the time the credit is submitted for re - activation. Nurses must complete nursing CE within the license renewal period. T he timeframe when a licensee may take CE coursework to count toward license renewal begins the 16th of the birth month, and runs until the nurse re - news his/her license for the next renewal period. Y ou should plan to renew your license 30 to 60 days prior to the expiration date listed on your nursing license wallet card. T herefore, every three years, there will be a period between when you renew your license, and the actual ex - piration date of the license, when CE credits do not count toward renewal requirements. I n other words, when you renew your nursing license, CE requirements must be met - you do not have until the expiration date listed on your wallet card. This is an example: A nurse is renewing his/her three year renewal and has a birthday on December 20th. T he actual expiration date of the license is December 15th. T he nurse cannot renew until after October 15th, and should plan to renew no later than November 15th. E ven though the actual expiration date of the license is not until De - cember 15th, all of the CE credits must be done before the nurse completes the renewal application by mid-Novem- ber. Upon renewal of the license in mid-November, this nurse should honestly be able to answer the attestation statement on the renewal application stating that he/she Continued on page 6 Continued on page 6Hello everyone! On August 27, 2014, the Iowa Board of Nursing's revised mission statement became effective. The mission statement is as follows: The mission of the board is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the licensure of nurses, the practice of nurses, nursing education and continuing education. I thought it would be interesting to take a historic look at nursing regulation in Iowa and how regulation looks today, as it relates to the four areas highlighted in the mission statement. This is part one of a two-part arti-cle, in this edition of the Nursing Newsletter, I will address the licensure of nurses and the practice of nurses. The text in italics is taken from historical documents stored in the board office, there is no specific author cited. Licensure of Nurses . In 1908, the licensing exam was comprised of 50 essay questions divided into five sections, at least one of which was completed orally. There were 10 questions on \"disease of men\" taken by male candidates only. The first license issued by examination was number 696 because 695 nurses had been licensed by waiver on the basis of previous experience or education. All seven testers who sat for the examination passed. Six months later, 50 individuals took the exam and Iowa recorded its first failure. The examination was comprised of essay questions until 1935 when a Board-constructed, multiple choice exam of 500 questions was initiated. In 1946 the exam was changed to a national State Board Test Pool Exam (SBTPE). State boards converted from the SBTPE to the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) in 1982. In 1994 the National Council of State Boards of Nursing converted to a computerized adaptive testing methodology (CAT) that al - lowed candidates to self - schedule the NCLEX examination at board approved centers of their choice. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing's CAT is the testing methodology which continues today. To be eligible to sit for the NCLEX an applicant must have grad - uated from an approved nursing program preparing reg-istered nurses as defined in Iowa Code section 152.5(1) or an approved nursing program preparing practical nurses as defined in Iowa Code section 152.5(1). To be licensed an applicant must pass the NCLEX. Licensure is also based on board approval of an applicant with a criminal history or a record of prior disciplinary action, regardless of jurisdiction. Licensure today is defined by the Iowa Code and the Iowa Administrative Code . A nurse is li- censed in Iowa upon initial licensure by examina-tion, renewal of their license or by endorsement from another state. It is defined in Iowa Code sec - tion 147.2 that a person practicing nursing shall obtain a license from the board for the profession. The Iowa Board of Nursing protects the pub - lic by ensuring that those individuals practicing Page 2 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - November, December 2014, January 2015 This newsletter is a nonpublic forum.

NSBN Revises Definition of Entry-Level Nurse AUGUST 6, 2014 - CHICAGO - The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) Board of Directors has approved a revised definition of the entry-level nurse in the NCLEX environment, which was the result of analysis leading to the question of what constitutes the length of the entry-level period. The designation of entry-level will now be defined as a nurse having no more than 12 months of experience ; previously it was defined as a nurse having no more than six months of experience. NCLEX examinations are developed to measure the minimum knowledge, skills and abilities required to de - liver safe, effective nursing care at the entry level. Part of the development process is to periodically review and define the examinee profile, the practice environment for entry-level nurses and the environment's effect on the length of the entry-level period. NCSBN conducts the NCLEX practice analyses every three years to examine entry-level practice. Using the data collected from these studies, NCSBN develops the NCLEX Test Plans. Analysis of data from a nine-year span indicates that the health care environment has become in-creasingly complex and what defines entry-level nursing should be reevaluated. NCSBN then r esearched practices used in other professions to identify the entry-level peri-od, the current entry-level practice environment, today's client population and the results of a nurse focus group and arrived at the new definition that will be used from this point forward. Read more details on the research behind the change in the entry-level definition at the following link: https:// www.ncsbn.org/Review_EntryLevel_Characteristics_and_NCLEX.pdf Reprinted with permission of NCSBN. Iowa nurse Kelli Aukes, RN, was certified by NCSBN as participating in their nationwide study to describe entry-level registered nursing prac - tice. The IBON would like to acknowledge Kelli and congratulate her for taking part. She acc ept- ed the opportunity to make a difference and con- tribute to the nursing profession. Thanks, K elli!

Licenses that expire November 15, 2014, are due by Oc - tober 15, 2014, and can be renewed any time after September 15, 2014. Licenses that expire December 15, 2014, are due by November 15, 2014, and can be renewed any time after October 15, 2014. Licenses that expire January 15, 2015, are due by De - cember 15, 2014, and can be renewed any time after November 15, 2014. Licenses that expire February 15, 2015, are due by Jan - uary 15, 2015, and can be renewed any time after December 15, 2014. A $50 late fee is required for licensees who renew within the 30 days after the license lapses. Licenses that are not re - newed will automatically be placed on inactive status on the 16th of the month following the expiration of the license. The continuing education requirement for license renew - al is 36 contact hours (3.6 CEUs) for renewal of a full three year license. Licensees renewing for the first time after the license was originally issued, or for the first time after a reacti - vation, will need 24 contact hours (2.4 CEUs) completed after the effective date printed on the wallet card.has met the 36 contact hours required for a three (3) year license. Carry-over credits are no longer allowed, and were eliminated from the administrative rules in 2001. Using the above example, if the nurse renews on November 15th, and takes a class on December 1st, the CE credits earned for the class do not count for the current renewal, and they cannot be carried over to the next renewal peri - od effective December 16th. You should make it a practice to keep track of nursing CE credits throughout the renewal period. Before beginning your license renewal application, all of your CE documen - tation should be in-hand and verified by you as meeting CE requirements. That way, if you are chosen for a random audit when you renew, you are immediately ready to send in your paperwork documenting your CE coursework. Re- member: If it is not documented, it is not done ! To be accepted for audit purposes, CE certificates for in - formal coursework must include the following: your name as attendee, the title of the class, date the course was tak - en, the place where the class was held, name and provider number of Board-approved providers for live coursework held in the state of Iowa, and must clearly list the number of contact hours or CEUs awarded. A tr anscript from an employer's online learning system is not sufficient docu - mentation for audit: Individual certificates for classes are needed. Self-study courses and on-site courses attended out - side of Iowa are acceptable if they qualify as appropriate subject matter, and are either covered by an approved Iowa provider, or have been granted special approval, or are approved by one of the following: a. The American Nurses Association (American Nurses' Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation) b. The National League for Nursing c. The National Federation of Licensed Practical Nurses d. National Association for Practical Nurse Education and Service, Inc. e. A board of nursing in any other mandatory con - tinuing education state. As soon as you complete an online self-study course, print the certificate and store it in a safe place. As a nurse licensed in the state of Iowa, it is your responsibility to know, and follow, the administrative rules governing your nursing practice. Make it a pr iority to choose CE activities that will benefit you and your patients or clients in your nursing practice, and which meet the administrative rule requirements for CE. Make a commitment to quality, lifelong learning - and to accu - rate documentation that can support the efforts you have taken. Questions or concerns about CE requirements may be directed to Laura Hudson, Associate Director - CE/Work - force, at laura.hudson@iowa.gov , or by calling 515-281- 8808. CE REQUIREMENTS Continued from page 1 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S REPORT Continued from page 1 nursing have an active Iowa license and meet the require - ments as defined in Iowa Code and Iowa Administrative Code for licensure. As a practicing nurse you are ac - countable for maintaining your licensure through timely renewal. On a personal note, I am considered an old, maybe the word should be \"seasoned, \" nurse, but as many of you do, I remember taking the licensing exam with hundreds of other \"graduate nurses\" in Veterans Auditorium on a very hot summer day. Actually it was a two-day event, with five different fill in the dot tests. Testing has certainly come a long way. Who knows what it will be like in the years to come? I am sure there will be an \"App\" for it! The Practice of Nursing . On March 12, 1907 the Iowa Legislature took the first step toward ensuring that indi - viduals providing nursing care to the citizens of Iowa were qualified to do so by passing a law that required education and licensure by examination. Prior to 1907, hospitals set their own educational standards as a condition of employ - ment. There was not an entity to prohibit an individual from claiming to be a nurse. The 1907 Code of Iowa required an applicant to be 23 years of age and of \"good moral character. \" The latter re - quirement remained in law until 1964. Proof was supplied in the form of personal references, preferably from clergymen and teachers. There was no definition of the practice of nursing in the first Nurse Practice Act. The first legal definition of nursing is found in the 1938 Code of Iowa and identifies that \"any person shall be deemed to engage in the practice of nursing who practices nursing as a graduate or registered nurse, or publically professes to be a graduate or registered nurse and to assume the duties incident to such a profession. \" What defines nursing today? According the Iowa Code, Chapter 152, the \"practice of nursing\" means the practice of a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse. The code goes on to say, the \"practice of a licensed prac - tical nurse\" means the practice of a natural person who is licensed by the board to perform services in the provision of supportive or restorative care under the supervision of a registered nurse or a physician. The \"practice of the profession of a registered nurse\" means the practice of a natural person who is licensed by the board to formu - late nursing diagnosis and conduct nursing treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems through services, such as case finding, referral, health teaching, health counseling, and care provision which is supportive to or restorative of life and well-being. Though not defined in Iowa Code, the Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) must also practice within the constraints of the definition and rules pursuant to the Iowa Administrative Code 655, chapter 7. In today's world you, the licensed practical nurse, the registered nurse and the ARNP , must ask yourselves if you are practicing nursing within the parameters of the definitions as cited in Iowa Code and Iowa Administrative Code, and within your specific scope of practice. You must ask yourself, is my practice guided by my education, ex - perience, competencies, and is it upheld by the highest standards of practice based on research and evidence? As a licensed nurse in Iowa you are accountable for your actions, for using sound nursing judgment and for carrying out the nursing process. Every day you should ask yourself, does my practice promote the protection of the public's health safety and welfare? CARING RN/LPN's NEEDED!

Governor's Nursing Task Force (Culver, March 3, 2008), the Iowa Needs Nurses Now coalition recommendations, and legislation passed in 2010, effective January 5, 2011. Funding was not secured for the 2010 legislative mandates. In September 2011, a representative from the Iowa Council of Nurses made a request to the Iowa Board of Nursing to create a new professional staff position and to join a growing number of states with nursing workforce centers. On September 14, 2011, the Board voted to establish a nursing workforce center and established a professional full time position to support the workforce center. In early 2012, an associate director was hired, with duties split between continuing education and the workforce. The current associate director was hired in November 2012, with approximately 35% of duties focused on workforce. Concurrent with the staff hiring, the IBON began collecting nursing workforce minimum dataset information through the new online registration process for nursing licensure. At the September 2013 IBON meeting, the Board voted to appoint an advisory committee to facilitate the strategic planning and direction for Iowa's nursing workforce center, known as the Iowa Center for Nursing Workforce. The committee's charge was: 1) to identify the overall strategic direction for the Iowa Center for Nursing Workforce, and 2) to establish priorities for the Iowa Center for Nursing Workforce. Over the course of three meetings held in 2014, the workforce advisory committee studied historical information about nursing and healthcare workforce initiatives, con-ducted a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) about current nursing workforce concerns in the state, and created a mission statement for the Center. Pursuant to the Committee's charge, a list of recommended goals and initiatives was developed for consideration by the Board. These recommendations are presented in an effort to guide the Center in priorities and resources for the years 2014 - 2017. The Committee's suggestions are high-level, and not intended to fully encompass the work of the Center. The associate director and other board staff will determine the details of the strategic plan, establish the success measurements, and manage the work - flow of the projects. The Advisory Committee plans to meet on a quarterly basis going forward.

The surgery went well, and the patient was admitted overnight for observation. That evening, the nurse gave the patient Demerol for pain as prescribed. When the patient vomited shortly thereafter, the nurse assumed the medication had been expelled and gave the patient another dose. Later, the patient complained of inadequate pain control. The nurse alerted the physician, who ordered another pain medication. By 1:15 a.m., the patient coded. The team could not resuscitate her. The patient's daughter filed a lawsuit. The case was settled for more than $1 million, split evenly among the nurse and two physicians. 1 COULD YOU MAKE THIS MISTAKE\u2014 AND BE SUED?
