The hard deposits that are formed due to excess bile salts in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Many people look for ways to flush out gallstones at home before going to a doctor. The majority of us believe that a significant health condition has symptoms that can be easily diagnosed. But that's not the case! While some significant illnesses show signs that anybody can recognize, some disorders and syndromes are considered to be extremely difficult to detect. Gallbladder disease is one such condition that affects a large number of people, particularly the elderly and women. Gallstones in the gallbladder are undiscovered until they cause severe pain. Let's take a look at what gallstones are and how they are caused before we get into the home remedies that can help you get rid of them. Keep reading! In This Article What Are Gallstones? Gallstones are hard, crystalline balls that are formed in the gallbladder from excess cholesterol or bile salts. These stones can vary greatly in size - from being the size of a grain to as large as a tennis ball. What Causes Gallstones? Gallstones are excruciatingly painful as the stones might get pushed into the tube. This happens when there is an excessive amount of cholesterol, and there is not enough bile secreted to saturate the cholesterol, which forms a crystal ball. However, stones can also be formed by bile salts too. In women, pregnancy-related hormonal changes and factors like rapid weight loss and obesity pave the way for gallstone formation. Besides, people relying on junk and fast foods are also prone to stones in the gallbladder. These gallstones go through the bile duct and may cause blockage in the duct, which sends bile to the small intestine from the liver. When this occurs, the gallbladder gets choked and the built up pressure triggers pain in the abdomen region ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899548/)). A [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.08.22277386v1.full) was conducted to investigate the occurrence of gallstone disease in the United States. It was found to be amongst the top 10 most common digestive disorders with 1.5 million emergency department visits and the 5th most common digestive disease diagnosis with 741,000 admissions in 2018. [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470440/)). How To Get Rid Of Gallstones Naturally [Dr. Peter Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-michael-md-mba-80087251/), MD, says, \"It is possible for a gallstone to pass out of the gallbladder on its own. If it is small enough, it may exit the gallbladder through the bile duct into the intestines. However, the gallstone can be stuck in the bile duct, which can cause pain, obstructions, and possibly infections which is an emergency case. Always contact your physician if you experience these systems in order to get proper treatment.\" While surgery for getting rid of gallstones is quite commonplace, it is better if you take precautions to prevent their formation in the first place. Gallbladder surgery, also called cholecystectomy, can cause years of discomfort, including nausea, diarrhea, and even jaundice. It can increase chances of contracting bowel cancer as well. Besides, the level of cholesterol in blood also shoots up post surgery. Let's take a look at a few home remedies to get rid of gallstones.
