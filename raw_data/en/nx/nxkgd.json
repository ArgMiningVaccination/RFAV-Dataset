Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the two most common neurogenerative diseases STATS The global burden of dementia is staggering, and on the rise. There are 75 million Americans with ApoE4, the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. It is expected that by 2050, there will be over 160,000,000 patients with Alzheimer's disease globally. 1 in 9 pplover the age of 65, 1 in 2 pplover the age of 80 will develop Alzheimer's As of Nov 2016 it is THE leading cause of death in the UK For women, Alzheimer's is more common than breast cancer, as women make up over 65% of the patients and 60% of the caregivers. 3rd leading cause of death in the world, behind CVD and AD Alzheimer's is said to have no cure, however, treatments for symptoms are available and Research continues.

The plasma levels of various cytokines are increased during ongoing depression and are reduced to normal levels after recovery 50 non medicated MDD patients The cytokines interleukin ) were significantly elevated (p=0.01 -0.047) in depressed patients at baseline compared to healthy controls. After 12 weeks of treatment, the plasma levels of seven of these nine cytokines (IL -1Ra, IL -6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, G -CSF, and IFN )had decreased significantly compared to baseline and did not differ from those in the healthy controls. Recovery from depression was associated with reduction to normal levels of the majority of the measured cytokines. These results strongly support the notion that a complex network of cytokines is involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Dahl J, et al. Psychoneuroendocrinology . 2014 Jul;45:77 -86.

In addition to decline in memory, dementia can cause changes in mood or personality and, at times, agitation or aggression. Antipsychotic drugs have been prescribed to help manage these symptoms. However, according to the FDA, antipsychotic drugs are expensive, costing hundreds of millions of Medicare dollars. They also increase the risk of death, falls with fractures, hospitalizations and other complications. Pear, Robert. \"Psychiatric Drug Overuse is Cited by Federal Study.\" The New York Times .

The resulting studies provide evidence consistent with the idea that social adversity, particularly that involving parent -offspring interactions, alters the epigenetic state and expression of a wide range of genes, the products of which regulate hypothalamic -pituitary - adrenal function. We also address the challenges for future studies, including that of the translation of epigenetic studies towards improvements in treatments. Anacker C, et al. Dialogues Clin Neurosci . 2014 Sep; the evolution of hypocortisolism Hellhammer and Wade Propose a model whereby hypocortisolism may develop via hypoactivity of the HPA axis after prolonged period of chronic stress . after an initial period of hyperactivity and hypersecretion, hypocortisolism may develop as a type of maladaptive \"overcompensation\" of the self - preservation mechanisms designed to protect metabolic machinery (specifically the brain) from the ill effects of persistent cortisol elevation. Stress The Brain -Body Connection 2008 S Karger AG SwitzerlandHypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis, adversity and adolescent adversity (CA) and the hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis have been suggested to play a major role in the etiology of non -suicidal self -injury (NSSI), no study has thus far investigated both its associations and interactions with adolescent NSSI. METHOD: We investigated CA (antipathy, neglect, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse) and indices of HPA axis activity (salivary and hair cortisol) in a clinical sample of 26 adolescents engaging in NSSI and 26 age -and gender -matched healthy controls (HC). We used standardized interviews for the assessment of CA (CECA), NSSI (SITBI -G), and axis I diagnoses (MINI -KID). Salivary cortisol sampling was surveyed using a monitoring system and instructed via telephone calls. RESULTS: Adolescents engaging in NSSI exhibited significantly higher cortisol awakening responses compared to HC. No differences were found with respect to the diurnal slope or hair cortisol. In the presence of CA, healthy adolescents showed flatted diurnal cortisol slopes while those engaging in NSSI exhibited significantly steeper ones. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that adolescents engaging in NSSI may exhibit a stronger cortisol awakening response, potentially in expectation of strain. However, elevated cortisol levels may not be maintained throughout the day, especially among adolescents with a history of CA. Reichl C, et al. Psychoneuroendocrinology . 2016 Dec; 74:203 -211. The neurobiological Correlates of Childhood Adversity and Implications for Treatment Conclusion Early adversity is associated with abnormalities of several neurobiological systems that are implicated in the development of psychopathology and other medical conditions. Early life stress negatively impacts treatment outcome and individuals may require treatments that are specific to this condition. Stress exposure activates the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system, which play a major role in coordinating the neural and behavioral response to stressors. Following stress exposure, corticotropin - releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are released from a neurotransmitter a nd modulates sympathetic arousal ; it also acts in concert with AVP to stimulate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone pituitary. cortex to synthesize and release glucocorticoids; cortisol is the most abundant and potent glucocorticoid in humans. In addition, the sympathetic nervous system secretes catecholamines . In the context of normative acute stress experiences, this activation results in the alteration of several physiological systems to allow adaptive responses to stressors. Appetite, gastrointestinal activity, sexual function, and fuel storage are inhibited in order to prioritize metabolism for rapid cognitive and muscular action. Cardiovascular activation increases blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and blood is diverted to muscles and brain ( 6). This system is regulated homeostatically , with negative feedback from cortisol acting at hypothalamic and pituitary glucocorticoid receptors to terminate the acute stress response. However, when stressors are excessive or prolonged, attempts at maintaining homeostasis can lead to alterations of basal and provoked HPA axis activity and associated functioning of autonomic, metabolic, and immune systems 128(6): 434 -47. Hypocortisolism Maternal separation within the first few days of birth induced permanent increased sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to ACTH.

Baseline plasma levels of total 17 - estradiol (Total -E2), total testosterone (total -T) and bioavailable testosterone (bio -T) were measured for all cases of incident dementia (n = 105) and for a random sample of the cohort (n = 413). Risk for dementia associated with low bio -T was greater in older men (80 years or older) than in younger men (younger than 80 years; HR, 3.11; P = .011 vs. HR,1.07, P = .715, respectively) and in men with high level of education compared with those with low level of education (HR, 2.32; P = .0002 vs. HR,0.95; P = .790, respectively). No significant association was found between Total -E2 and dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of testosterone are associated with a risk for dementia in elderly men. The association between low bio -T and dementia may be more relevant to men 80years or older and men with a high level of education. Carcaillon L, et al.

Alzheimers 2013 Sep 10.In older adults only, we found significantly high cortisol levels and low memory performance in the condition favoring young adults. In contrast, cortisol levels were lower and memory performance was better when older adults were tested in conditions favoring them. There was no effect of testing condition in young adults.The results demonstrate that older adults' memory performance is highly sensitive to the testing environment. These findings have important implications for both research and clinical settings in which older adults are tested for memory performance.Inflammation Dental caries Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF -a, IL-6, IL-8 found in the saliva of patients with dental caries versus controls. Severe periodontitis is associated with elevated inflammatory markers in otherwise healthy populations. Ninety -four systemically healthy subjects with severe generalized periodontitis participated in a prospective six -month blind intervention trial. Periodontal parameters and inflammatory markers (CRP and IL -6) were evaluated prior to and 2 and 6 months after therapy. 6 months after treatment, significant reductions in serum IL -6 and CRP were observed.

Pesticides, environmental pollution from industrial waste, hormonally - modulating plastics, fire retardants, and cosmetic additives all stimulate our immune systems to varying extents and disrupt optimal production of energy on a cellular level, particularly in vulnerable tissues like the thyroid. Toxins: Metals, pesticides, synthetic chemicals in hair and skin products and environment Stress (= Leaky Gut = Leaky Brain) Stress. This catch -all term, broadly defined, represents the ultimate link between hormones and inflammation, because stress, whether it's psychological or physiologic, triggers the release of cortisol. Cortisol helps to mobilize blood sugar so that you can run effectively and efficiently from that tiger chasing you. It also acts as a systemic immune suppressant, lowering levels of secretory IgA, an important body guard of the gut mucosa.

For example, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine is driven by the enzyme dopamine b - hydroxylase, which requires vitamin C, copper and vitamin B3 (niacin) to fuel the conversion. Cofactors are often vitamins or minerals. B vitamins are especially important in neurotransmitter pathways. Cofactors Clinically, cofactors become important when conversion is slow. For example, if norepinephrine is elevated, and epinephrine levels are low, there is likely an issue with the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). This will result in the N/E ratio being elevated. The cofactors in this conversion are SAMe , Mg and cortisol. Treatments might include supplementing with SAMe or Mg, and addressing adrenal gland dysfunction. CofactorsCofactors: Pearls Activated forms of vitamins are essential when providing cofactor support. For example, vitamin B6 should be given in the form of pyridoxal -5-phosphate Folate and B12 should be given in the form of methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) and methylcobalaminAdaptogenic herbs Adaptogens do exactly what their name would suggest...help the body resist and adapt to stress. To be officially called an adaptogen , a compound must be able to enhance the body's physiology without any adverse side effects. They promote a normalizing action, tonifying adrenal glands and improving the body's ability to handle stress. Adaptogens promote balance in the whole adrenal gland: the adrenal cortex which secretes cortisol, the adrenal medulla which secretes norepinephrine, epinephrine, and a small provide a restoring and balancing action to the nervous system.

Over the past decade, studies have demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and brain function, i.e. the microbiota -gut-brain axis. Alterations in gut microbial composition is associated with marked changes in behaviors relevant to mood, pain and cognition. Dysfunction of the microbiome -brain -gut axis has been implicated in stress -related disorders such as depression, anxiety, and irritable bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Although not fully elucidated, accumulating data indicated that the gut microbiota communicates with the CNS through neural, endocrine and immune pathways. Probiotics attenuate anxiety and depressive like behaviors in experimental animal and human models. This emerging concept suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota may be a tractable strategy for developing novel therapeutics for complex CNS disorders.
