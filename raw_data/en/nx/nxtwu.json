TCM incorporates the use of herbs and natural medicinal plants, acupuncture, massage, nutrition, meditation, and exercise. Chinese medicine is presently one of the world's main disciplines of medical care, serving more than one-fourth of the world's population. It is a method of balancing, regulating, and strengthening the life force of the human body, called Qi. Acupuncture: A key component of TCM, acupuncture is the medical practice of using thin needles to stimulate certain points on the body to move energy (Qi) and alleviate pain, calm the nervous system, or help treat various health conditions. Once the needles are in, there can be a tingling or electric sensation, but usually not pain. When receiving acupuncture, many people feel relaxed; and some even fall asleep.
