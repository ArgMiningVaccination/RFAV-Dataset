There's no 'dirty' food per se, but a focus on healthy, whole foods. These include foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, beans, nuts, seeds, healthy fats, fatty fish, and other lean proteins. These are full of the vitamins and minerals you need whilst ensuring added sugars and unhealthy fats are reduced to a minimum. This meal plan is easy to follow too, with all the recipes taking less than an hour and mostly no-cook breakfasts and lunches. The article below will cover everything you need to know about following a clean eating diet plan and offer a sample 7 day plan to follow. [View 7 Day Clean Eating Diet Plan PDF](https://medmunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/7_day_taster_final_2023.pdf) Foods to Eat on a Clean Eating Plan Generally, you'll want to focus on eating whole foods. Although all foods can be part of a healthy diet, it can be a good idea to just focus on eating more of the healthy foods on the list below: - Fruits. E.g. apples, pears, oranges. Berries also contain lots of antioxidants - Vegetables. All kinds of vegetables are great, but particularly cruciferous vegetables (e.g broccoli, cauliflower) - Whole grains. E.g. brown bread, quinoa, bulgur wheat. These are rich in fiber. - Fatty fish. E.g. salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring. These foods contain the most omega-3 fatty acids, an important nutrient in reducing inflammatory diseases. - Beans. E.g. haricot, black, red. - Legumes. E.g. chickpeas, lentils, peas. Both legumes and beans are great sources of plant-based protein. - Nuts and seeds. E.g. almonds, walnuts, pistachios. Flaxseeds and chia seeds are also a great plant-based source of of omega-3 fatty acids - Low-fat dairy. E.g. milk, eggs, yogurt. Be sure to check the labels for extra added sugar. - Olive oil. Choose extra-virgin varieties, which aren't diluted with cheaper oils. - Lean protein. E.g. fish, chicken, turkey. These contain less saturated fats than in red meats like beef and pork. These foods are lower in sugars and higher in important vitamins and nutrients, including fiber and protein. General Guidelines for Clean Eating Although it's good to know the types, it's a good idea to know some basic principles that you can follow to keep your eating as clean as possible. On the whole, you'll want to prioritize eating whole, fresh food rather than canned food. Canned food often has lots more sodium, which can lead to increases in blood pressure. If you're hungry between meal times, it's a good idea to stock up on some healthy snacks. Fruits, berries, nuts and seeds are great choices that are full of fiber. High fiber contents within food help keep you full without consuming many calories. You'll also want to start experimenting with different herbs and spices rather than using salt all the time to flavor food. Protein and fiber are both nutrients you should ensure you are getting enough of. Both help you feel satiated, meaning you stay full and therefore, will feel the need to snack less. Protein is essential in preventing muscle loss and fiber helps improve digestion. A good habit to pick up is to check the food labels. You may be surprised how much sodium/salt or sugar are in particular foods. Certain types of foods are also high in saturated fats, so it's good to be aware of how much you are consuming. Eating a clean diet doesn't mean starving yourself or being overly restrictive with your food choices. This causes nutritional imbalances, which can lead to health problems.

Combining all those foods and principles into a diet can be a tricky process. However, the Mediterranean diet is one of the diets that has been studied a lot and the consistent results it produces is why it's considered one of the best to follow.
