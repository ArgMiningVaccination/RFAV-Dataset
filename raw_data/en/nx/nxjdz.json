These feedback loops from muscle contraction and mechano-transduction to the Ca2+homeodynamics and to the electrical excitation are essential for understanding the E-C coupling dynamic system and arrhythmogenesis in mechanically loaded hearts. This white paper comprises two parts, each reflecting key aspects from the 2018 UC Davis symposium: MEC (how mechanical load influences electrical dynamics) and MCT (how mechanical load alters cell signalling and Ca2+dynamics). Of course, such separation is articial since Ca2+dynamics profoundly affect ion channels and electrogenic transporters and vice versa. In time, these dynamic systems and their interactions must become fully integrated, and that should be a goal for a comprehensive understanding of how mechanical load influences cell signalling, Ca2+homeo- dynamics and electrical dynamics. In this white paper we emphasize current understanding, consensus, controversies and the pressing issues for future investigations. Space constraints make it impossible to cover all relevant articles in the eld, so we will focus on the topics discussed at the symposium.

Preamble Recognizing the critical need to combine experimental methods and mathematical models in studying complex heart disease mechanisms, the UC Davis Cardio- vascular Symposia series provides an on-going forum for experimentalists, modellers, physicians and scientists to exchange ideas and build collaborations. The goal of this meeting series is to develop an in-depth quantitative understanding of the interplay of cardiac electrical, Ca2+ and mechanical signalling, and how each of these systems feed back on each other dynamically (Abstract Figure). Such feedback systems can both stabilize physiological function and cause pathological dysfunction. Under- standing these feedback systems is critically important for identication of causes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction (e.g. in heart failure) and the development of effective therapies. The UC Davis Cardiovascular Symposium series has been organized to integrate such experimental and modelling studies in a series of meetings. The rst symposium (2010) took an integrative view of E-C coupling and arrhythmia mechanisms that set the stage for a series of more focused topics: on Ca+channels and Ca2+signalling system (2012), Na+channels and Na+ regulation (2014), and K+channels and K+regulation (2016) and mechanics and energetics (2018). Each of these are essential to our integrated understanding and benet greatly from combining experimental investigations with mathematical modelling studies and clinical perspectives. We shall come full circle from the rst 2010 meeting in 2020, when we return to focus on integration amongthese areas. (See https://basicscience.ucdmc.ucdavis. edu) Mechano-electric coupling (MEC) Consensus, controversies and open issues There is consensus about the following: (1) Many ion channels (including sarcolemmal and non-sarcolemmal) are mechanically modulated. rIon channels that change their open probability primarily in response to mechanical stimulation (mechano-sensitive channels) can be divided into cell-stretch and cell-volume activated ion channels (SAC, VAC, respectively).rV AC increase their open probability in response to cell swelling; they are constitutively active in hypertrophic myocardium - but they are not believed to be major determinant of beat-by-beat mechano-sensory behaviour or drivers of responses to acute mechanical stimulation.rSAC can be divided into cation-non-selective (SAC NS) and potassium-selective channels (SAC K).rNon-myocytes (broblasts, macrophages) are mechano-sensitive; they express SAC and can contribute to cardiac electrophysiology. (2) Mechano-sensitive channels affect cardiac electro- physiology rSAC NSappear to contribute to acute electrical responses to stretch, so much so that C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of Physiology responses to mechanical stimuli can generally be accounted for in quantitative models by simply invoking SAC NS.rSAC Kcause re/hyperpolarization; they may contribute to action potential (AP) shortening, in particular in pathological settings such as ischaemia.rSAC NSactivation can increase intracellular Ca2+, either directly or indirectly (via Na+/Ca2+ exchange, NCX). The resulting intracellular Ca2+ signals can be highly compartmentalized.rDrug actions, including drug effects on ion channels, can be mechano-modulated. Controversies and open issues are:rAmplitudes and kinetics of SAC and V AC in physio- logical and pathological states, and how they affect the delicate balance of currents during the cardiac AP , are ill-explored.rWe can track strain, but not stress, at the cell level in native cardiac tissue. As a result, for many mechano-electric coupling processes we do not know key biophysical input parameters.rThe explicit in vivo molecular mechanisms of activation, and how best to mimic them experimentally, are unclear.rOur ability to interpret dynamic mechanical effects on electrophysiology is equally limited by difculties in identifying 'differential' and 'proportional' signalling pathways.rThe dynamics of 3-D deformation of sub- cellular nano-structures, and their relevance for micro-to-macro cardiac function are ill-explored and form a key frontier for further research.rMechanistic links between acute (beat-by-beat time scale or faster), intermediate (second to minutes) and chronic effects (e.g. involving cell and tissue remodelling) of stretch-induced changes in cardiac electrophysiology are unclear.rIn general, we know more about MEC effects in pathological settings (arrhythmogenic effects) than about the role of V AC and SAC in normal homeostasis. MEC conceptual orgins Clinical awareness of mechanical modulation of heart rate and rhythm can be traced back by at least a century in the Western medical literature, with examples both for mechanical induction (Meola, 1879) and mechanical termination (Schott, 1920) of heart rhythm disturbances. Following early experimental work that identied the intra-cardiac nature of mechanically induced changes in cardiac electrophysiology (Schlomka & Hinrichs, 1932), mechano-electric coupling (MEC) was conceptualized as part of cardiac electro-mechanical auto-regulation by Ursula Ravens (n \u00b4ee Thophile) in 1967 (Kaufmann &Theophile, 1967). Since then, pioneering work by Max Lab, Frederick Sachs, Michael Franz and others has moved MEC from a footnote in cardiac electrophysiology to its appreciation as a fundamental part of cardiac functional integration (for a comprehensive collection of inter- national research on the topic, see the multi-author textbook, edited by Kohl, Franz and Sachs (Kohl et al. 2011)). MEC is based on at least two interacting molecular mechanisms: mechano-sensitive ion channels (see next section) and mechanical modulation of intracellular calcium handling (see section on MEC effects via changes in intracellular Ca2+handling). MEC effects via mechano-sensitive ion channels General aspects. Mechano-sensitive ion channels can be split into channels that require a change in cell volume (cell volume-activated ion channels: V AC) and those that activate directly in response to membrane deformation (stretch-activated ion channels: SAC). Since acute effects of mechanical stimulation on cardiac electrophysiology, including beat-by-beat responses, are thought not to involve cell volume changes, SAC are usually considered a primary target for MEC research as it pertains to acute electrophysiological responses to mechanical stimulation. It is important, however, to note that V AC contribute to cardiac MEC responses in cells subjected to swelling, for example during ischaemia or upon reperfusion. Inter- estingly, V AC are constitutively activated in the enlarged cells of failing hearts (Clemo et al. 1999), suggesting the presence of a 'set point' for cardiomyocyte cell volume by an as-yet-unidentied mechanism. Like many other changes in cardiac structure and function, causal chains of events occurring during chronic tissue remodelling are difcult to explore. This represents an important area for further study. SAC can be sub-divided by their ion selectivity into cation non-selective (SAC NS) and potassium-selective (SAC K) channels. While somewhat arbitrary, this division is helpful when considering effects on cell electro- physiology, as SAC NSwill depolarize resting cardio- myocytes, while SAC Kwill have a re- or hyperpolarizing effect. Given that resting cardiomyocytes respond to mechanical stimulation (if they show any response at all) by depolarization, it is thought that SAC NSdominate MEC effects in healthy cells under normal conditions (Kohl et al. 2006). In addition to ion channels whose open probability is primarily graded by mechanical events, many ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are mechanically modulated - both in terms of their open probability (Morris, 2011) and in terms of their functional integration into the surface sarcolemma (Boycott et al. 2013). Figure 1 provides a recent overview of mechano-sensitive ion channels C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of Physiology C/circlecopyrt2019 The Physiological Society1288 L. T. Izu and others J Physiol 598.7 that highlights both their ubiquitous presence across living kingdoms and the breadth of proteins identied (from Peyronnet et al. 2016). This listing is in constant flux, and the relatively recently identied Piezo channels (Coste et al. 2012), which appear to be gated by bilayer tension (Cox et al. 2016), have now been found in the heart as well (Liang et al. 2017). In addition, we now appreciate that there are individual mutations that may convey increased mechano-sensitivity to ion channels such as TREK-1, which may be associated with an increased risk for arrhythmogenesis in patients (Decher et al. 2017). These ndings could open up pathways to 'mechano-transduction targeting' for personalized therapeutic strategies. That said, in general it has remained challenging to identify biologically relevant biophysical input signals for mechano-sensitive ion channel gating. Part of the challenge is that, while we are getting better at tracking cell strain in native tissue (Botcherby et al. 2013), we a r es t i l lf a rf r o mt r u er e a d o u t so fc e l ls t r e s si nt h em y o - cardium. While suitable fluorescent probes for measuring cytoskeletal stress have been developed (Rahimzadeh et al. 2011), challenges remain in terms of their calibration and use within native tissue, such as the heart. Given our current inability to accurately identify biologically relevant input parameters, can we at least unequivocally identify the respondents to mechanical stimulation? Well, to some extent yes. As under- lying molecular targets are increasingly being identied, both up- and down-regulation approaches have been used to substantiate the players involved in stretcheffects on cardiac electrophysiology. Of course, genetic modication is burdened by the possibility (probability) of compensatory changes in the presence and/or activity of other pathway elements. This can, in part, be compensated using acute pharmacological interventions. A problem here is that we are lacking target-specic blockers and activators (as reviewed in detail elsewhere: Peyronnet et al. 2016). T o assess SAC NScontributions, GsMTx-4, a peptide from the venom of the Chilean tarantula Grammostola spatulata (Suchyna et al. 2000), is the intervention tool of choice. GsMTx-4 shows good selectivity for SAC NSand is useful not only in cardiac cells, but also in native tissue (Bode et al. 2001). This is not 'a given' and has led to false-negative observations with other, less suitable pharmacological agents such as gadolinium and streptomycin (Cooper & Kohl, 2005; Zhang et al. 2018). A note of caution is warranted here for all cell culture studies: streptomycin, an obligatory component of most commercial culture media, is a formidable blocker of SAC NSand stretch-induced changes in Ca2+handling (Gannier et al. 1994; Belus & White, 2003). The experimental difculties in linking biophysical inputs to molecular players, and cellular responses to organ-level mechano-sensitivity, have contributed to the high relevance of computational models in the quantitative assessment of potential pathways of cardiac MEC (see section on Modelling MEC at the organ level).

This can trigger excitation in resting atrial (Bode et al. 2001) and ventricular myocardium (Franz et al. 1992). This is in line with a major contribution by SAC NS, whose pharmacological block can abolish ectopy. During the action potential (AP), acute stretch responses depend on the difference between current cellular membrane potential and reversal potential of stretch-activated channels (for SAC NSbetween 0 and 15 mV), causing abbreviation of early and prolongation of late AP time courses, including early and delayed afterdepolarization-like potential changes (EAD, DAD; see Fig. 2 (Kohl et al. 2001)). It has been difcult to identify an evolutionary advantage for cardiac MEC. One line of thought is that mechano-regulation of the ionic milieu would have been an early requirement during the emergence of cellular life forms, whose presence/preservation did not exert a negative evolutionary pressure - so mechano-modulation of ion channels is conserved in all cell types that have been assessed. Alternatively, the electrophysiological consequences of mechano-sensitive ion channel activation could be a side-effect of a QRS Vulnerable Window for 2. Schematic representation of cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) responses to stretch-activated ion channel (SAC) opening at different timings during the AP Within a short critical time-window during early ventricular repolarization (just prior to the peak of the T wave; see schematic ECG trace), these can combine to render both trigger (red) and sustaining mechanisms (blue) for ventricular rhythm disturbances (Commotio cordis). Reproduced from Kohl et al. (2001).different, more important role in the heart: the local matching of cellular Ca2+load (and, hence, contractile performance) to global circulatory demand (Markhasin et al. 2003). This would be relevant for an organ that relies on synchronized and force-balanced contraction of millions of muscle cells that lack targeted external control mechanisms (such as individual neuro-muscular junctions), in particular as each of these cells experiences slightly different stress-strain dynamics during normal cardiac activity. Relevant mechanisms would include both (i) mechanical modulation of trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ fl u x( w h e t h e rd i r e c t l yb yp e r m e a t i o no fC a2+through SAC, or indirectly, e.g. by SAC-medicated Na+influx that NCX (Gannier et al. 1996; Jin et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2017)) and (ii) mechanical modulation of Ca2+flux between intracellular stores and cytosol (for example via a stretch-induced increase in ryanodine receptor (RyR) open probability (Iribe et al. 2009 a) or mitochondrial Ca2+release (Belmonte & Morad, 2008)). Whatever the explanation, the physiological benet of cardiac mechano-electric cross-talk - beyond potential contributions to preload-adjusted sino-atrial node pacemaking (Quinn & Kohl, 2012) - remains a matter of debate. What is well-established is that the arrhythmogenic potential of mechanical stimulation, if ill-timed, may trigger sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (Schlomka & Hinrichs, 1932; Kohl et al. 2001; Link, 2012). Inter- estingly, this is an example of cardiac MEC research where conceptual (Kohl et al. 2001) and computational prediction of quantitatively plausible mechanisms in 2-D (Garny & Kohl, 2004) and 3-D (Li et al. 2004) computational models of ventricular myocardium pre- ceded experimental conrmation by many years (Quinn et al. 2017). We now know that focal electrical excitation, for example triggered by a precordial impact in myo- cardium just underneath the impact site (Link, 2012), may give rise to reentrant excitation if this ectopic focus occurs just on the trailing edge of the preceding repolarization wave, which acts as a functional block zone preventing uniform spread of the ectopic wave (Quinn et al. 2017). While this may give rise to sustained tachyarrhythmia, the vulnerable window for this is impact location-dependent and short (Fig. 2), so that most mechanically induced ectopic beats are benign in healthy myocardium. Diseased myocardium. Overall, mechanistic insight into MEC in diseased tissue is limited. Reasons include the aforementioned inability to determine local stress levels in native tissue and the often signicant structural and functional remodelling in chronic disease settings. Functional remodelling includes alterations in ion channel presence and activity, such as an upregulation o fV A Ci nh y p e r t r o p h i e dc e l l s( C l e m o et al. 1999), C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of Physiology C/circlecopyrt2019 The Physiological Society1290 L. T. Izu and others J Physiol 598.7 or metabolic and mechanical co-activation of ATP K channels (Van Wagoner, 1993) in ischaemic tissue (Huang et al. 2013), with demonstrable knock-on effects on local intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and arrhythmogenesis (Bollensdorff & Lab, 2011). In addition, mutations that alter ion channel mechano-sensitivity are starting to emerge as clinically relevant contributors to arrhythmogenesis (Decher et al. 2017). Structural remodelling gives rise to signicant heterogeneity in active and passive mechanical properties, which will affect MEC responses. Examples include inhomogeneous stress-strain behaviour in and around ischaemic foci (where paradoxical segment lengthening can be observed), scar border zones (BZ; where stiff scar tissue gives rise to varying stress gradients as the surrounding tissue changes from resting to contracted and back), or asynchronous activation of different cardiac tissue regions (for example as a result of bundle branch block or during cardiac resynchronization therapy). Some of the scenarios in which non-uniform contraction contributes to arrhythmogenesis are explained the next two sections: MEC effects via changes in intracellular Ca2+ handling and Modelling MEC at the organ level. MEC effects via changes in intracellular Ca2+handling General aspects. E-C coupling is traditionally seen as a sequence of events, where electrical activity (e.g. an AP) results in the rise and decay of an intracellular Ca2+transient, with the consequential rise and fall of contraction. Y et there is feedback from mechanics to Ca2+a n de l e c t r o p h y s i o l o g y ,a sw e l la sf r o mC a2+to electrophysiology. This could be called reverse mode E-C coupling. A key signalling molecule involved is intracellular Ca2+. A typical example of Ca2+-related arrhythmogenesis is when Ca2+is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores by 'leaky' RyR during diastole, or during AP repolarization. This Ca2+can initiate a Ca2+wave, followed by DAD or EAD (Bers, 2014). Below we will focus on an example that depends on Ca2+release from myolaments, rather than the SR. Ectopy secondary to non-uniform EC coupling. In failing hearts, wall stress increases as a result of dilatation of the left ventricle (LV). This increased wall stress aggravates regional differences in contractile strength around the impaired muscle. Regional differences in contractile strength may cause paradoxical stretching of impaired muscle by contractions of neighbouring more viable muscle. This forms a BZ between regions of stretch and shortening. In 2005, Wakayama et al. (2005) described spatially non-uniform muscle contractions that lead to DAD-induced arrhythmias. Quite different from Ca2+leak-induced Ca2+waves (T er Keurs & Boyden, 2007), the arrhythmogenic Ca2+waves initiating these triggered propagated contractions in this multicellular cardiac pre- paration arise from acute reduction of myolament Ca2+ binding in regions near damaged areas. In this case, Ca2+ waves are dependent on mechanical stretch and release at the border between the damaged and intact regions. For these experiments, ter Keurs et al. created a controlled local reduction of myolament force development in a length of normal multicellular rat trabecula. This was accomplished by exposing the pre- paration to a small jet of a solution that contained either 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), or low external Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o;s e eF i g .3 B,i n s e t ) .T h e ym e a s u r e d sarcomere length (SL) and with the jet off there was SL shortening in this region. However, when the jet was on, the weakened region near the centre of the jet experienced stretch by the strong regions on either side of the jet (increased SL, Fig. 3 A,r i g h t ,a n d B). Here the initial Ca2+rise during the wave initiation was shown to be caused by Ca2+dissociation from myo- laments as a result of quick release and shortening of active sarcomeres (Wakayama et al. 2001). This is because the Ca2+binding afnity is positively correlated with the number of Ca2+-activated cross-bridges (Allen & Kentish, 1985). Rapid shortening of sarcomeres in the BZ during relaxation causes Ca2+release from troponin C on the thin laments. This release can initiate the Ca2+waves. Elimination of SL shortening will inhibit the initiation of Ca2+waves, while SR Ca2+load and release will enhance such waves. Thus the initiation is not caused by Ca2+leak from SR, but by an intra- cellular Ca2+surge from myolaments that are a major site of Ca2+buffering in myocytes (Bers, 2001). Such aC a2+surge can then induce SR Ca2+release waves which lead to DAD that, under certain conditions, trigger electrical activity (Fig. 4). Indeed, the amount of Ca2+ dissociated from myolaments affects the frequency of the arrhythmias. For example, the maximum rate of muscle relaxation was inversely correlated with the cycle length of the arrhythmia. An unresolved issue is that these waves propagate in multicellular preparations at 0.2-2.8 mm s1, too Ca-release ( /223c0.1 mm s1;B r e t t e et al. 2005), which normally do not cross gap junctions between myocytes, but is much slower than expected for full-blown AP propagation in tissue ( >200 mm s1;M y l e s et al. 2012). While the mechanism may be a hybrid, some mechanistic details about this potentially important MEC mechanism in arrhythmogenesis need further testing. EAD generation secondary to myolament protein dynamics: computational model. Recent computational modelling has concluded that myolament protein C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. of cardiomyopathy model could affect EAD formation and possibly arrhythmias in this heritable substrate (Zile & Trayanova, 2017). The paper concluded that incorporation of troponin C buffering of cytosolic Ca2+alters the AP repolarization reserve, which leads to EAD emergence and triggers for arrhythmia. The utility of computational modelling at the organ level is discussed in more detail in the next section. Modelling MEC at the organ level We focus on organ-level electro-mechanical modelling studies, as these have advanced over recent years, progressing through different scopes of mechanistic research and corresponding model complexity. MEC effects at the level of individual cells have, in contrast, been modelled before the turn of the Millennium (Landesberg & Sideman, 1994; Noble et al. 1998; Kohl et al. 1998; Rice et al. 1999) and they are thus not discussed in detail here. In short, experimentally observed responses of single cardiac cells to stretch have generally lent themselves to being reproduced using computational models (for reviews, see Kohl et al. 1999; Trayanova & Rice, 2011). Below we pre- sent the main areas of MEC exploration by computational modelling at the whole-heart level. Role of mechanical impact in arrhythmogenesis and arrhythmia termination in the heart. In early whole-heart studies, mechanical stimulation was incorporated through its impact on the electrophysiology of the heart,namely through uniform regional SAC activation. In the modelling study by Li et al. (2004), both SAC NSand SAC Kare recruited upon mechanical impact. The impact is administered at various coupling intervals following pacing at the apex. The results demonstrated that the impact induces sustained reentrant excitation only when (1) a new activation is elicited by mechanical stimulation (caused by activation of SAC NS), and (2) upon return to the original region of impact, this activation does not encounter an extension of AP duration (prevented by activation of SAC K,s u c ha sK ATP). Furthermore, a subsequent study by Li et al. (2006) elucidated the mechanisms involved in termination of ventricular tachy- cardia by precordial thump and its decreased rate of success in ischaemia. Results demonstrate that precordial thump-induced SAC NSopening in normoxia reduces heterogeneity in transmembrane partially excited and depolarizing resting myo- cardium, causing foci of excitation that eradicate the excitable gap, thus facilitating tachycardia termination. Decreased precordial thump efcacy in ischaemia was caused by recruitment of K ATP, which diminishes the depolarizing effect of SAC NSon resting tissue and caused pronounced AP shortening, thus facilitating establishment of reentry. Electromechanical transduction and arrhythmogenesis in the diseased heart. In these studies, model complexity has increased, with representation of both electrical and mechanical function and their coupling.

Izu and others J Physiol 598.7 under the conditions of acute ischaemia, as well as the effect of acute stretch on the substrate for ventricular brillation (VF; Fig. 5; Jie et al. 2010). Jie et al. showed that the ventricles had a central ischaemic zone (CIZ) and an intermediate BZ, and this was used to represent the electrophysiological and mechanical milieu in the heart at several stages post occlusion. The study found that large muscle strain developed in the ischaemic region during contraction. In both BZ and CIZ, cell membranes under- went mechanically induced subthreshold depolarizations, or DAD-like events, whereas such depolarizations were absent in the normal zone. The DAD-like events resulted in mechanically induced ventricular premature beats (VPB), originating from the ischaemic border (particularly in the LV endocardium where muscle strain and strain rate were largest), but not from CIZ, since in the latter ischaemic injury suppressed excitability. VPB beats then travelled intramurally until emerging from the ischaemic border on the epicardium, initiating reentry. A subsequent study by Hu et al. (2013) examined the role of SAC recruitment on scroll wave stability in VF using an even more complex model, and image-based human ventricular electromechanics model. In VF, SAC recruitment is heterogeneous, and this affectselectrophysiology and VF complexity. The study used a wide variety of SAC reversal potentials and channel conductances. Opening of SAC with a reversal potential of60 mV diminished scroll wave breakup for all values of conductances by flattening heterogeneously the AP duration restitution curve. Opening of SAC with a reversal potential of 10 mV inhibited partially scroll wave break-up at low conductance values by flattening heterogeneously the conduction velocity restitution relation. For large conductance values recruitment of SAC with a reversal potential of 10 mV did not reduce the likelihood of scroll wave break-up, because Na+channel inactivation in regions of large stretch led to conduction block, which counteracted the increased scroll wave stability due to an overall flatter conduction velocity restitution. The role of mechano-electric coupling in debrillation. Finally, mechano-electric transduction effects in debrillation were explored through a bidomain electromechanics model suitable for the delivery of external electrical shocks (Li et al. 2008).

Mechano-chemo-transduction (MCT) Consensus, controversies and open issues There is consensus on the following: (1) The Frank-Starling (F-S) mechanism and Anrep effect. rThe heart has the intrinsic ability to adapt to changes in preload and afterload. Intrinsic adaptation has two components: the Frank-Starling (heterometric) and the Anrep effect (homeometric or inotropic).rThe Frank-Starling mechanism is activated by elevated end-diastolic volume (and sarcomere length) and is thus under heterometric regulation. The F-S mechanism is instantaneous (beat to beat) without requiring Ca2+changes.rThe Anrep effect occurs gradually over many beats (minutes timescale) and increasing contractility by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+transients and/or myolament Ca sensitivity. Multiple biochemical signalling pathways have been implicated. Anrep can restore EDV and sarcomere length towards the initial state (and is homeometric). (2) Mechano-chemo-transduction (MCT) pathways. rMCT system in the cardiomyocyte.rMCT pathways involve cardiac mechanosensors, chemotransducers, and effectors;rThe mechanical sensors may include myo- lament proteins (e.g. titin and crossbridges) and cytoskeletal and transmembrane protein complexes that interact with extracellular matrix and neighbouring cells (e.g. at focal adhesions, dystrophin, integrins and desmosomes). Controversies and open issues are: rDifferent labs have found different roles for nitric oxide (NO) signalling in mechano-chemo-transduction: some found that NO plays no role in stretch-induced Ca2+sparks, but others found that NO is critically important for MCT.rThe apparent controversy above might be explained by hypothesizing that different 'dimensionality' of the mechanical strain or stress imposed on surface versus C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors.

Frank-Starling mechanism and Anrep effect The heart has the remarkable ability to adapt its output to tremendous variations in the haemodynamic demand of the body, with the cardiac output ranging from 3 L min1 at resting level to 20 L min1during vigorous exercise. The heart must not only be able to increase the output b u ta l s od os oi nt h ef a c eo fa f t e r l o a d s( a r t e r i a lp r e s s u r e ) that range from <100 to >300 mmHg (MacDougall et al. 1985). As Ernest Starling writes in his Linacre Lecture, this adaptation to changing demands \"occurs equally well after total destruction of the nerves connecting the heart with the central nervous system\" (p.5, Starling, 1915). In other words, the adaptive ability of the heart lies largely within the heart itself. Otto Frank (Frank, 1895) is equally credited for what is usually called the F-S mechanism. The quest for molecular understanding has occupied physiologists since that time. In this section we will not recapitulate the excellent recent review on MCT (Schonleitner et al. 2017). Instead, we will recount some old and new research that brings into focus fundamental questions that remain unanswered and suggest modern experiments that may cast new light onto the intrinsic mechanisms that underlie the adaptation of the heart to changing mechanical loads. Starling's promulgation of the 'law of the heart' (Patterson et al. 1914) and Anrep's work on the heart's adaptation to afterload (von Anrep, 1912) mark the modern period of investigating the heart's adaptive response to mechanical load. Starling (Patterson et al. 1914, Starling, 1915) described the law of the heart as \"the energy of contraction . . . is a function of the length of the muscle bre.\" The Frank-Starling mechanism and Anrep effect are both illustrated by the pressure-volume (P-V) loops obtained from the LV in a mouse in Fig. 6 A.Curve ais the P-V loop before the outflow resistance was increased by transaortic constriction (TAC). Immediately after TAC, the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) expands (note the rightward shift of P-V loop b). This expansion engages the F-S mechanism resulting in more forceful contraction that manifests itself as an increase in developed pressure. The relationship between increasing contraction force and increasing muscle length stands as one of the great foundation stones of cardiac physiology. This fundamental relationship at the sarcomeric level is shown by the monotonically increasing F-S curve (F-S) in Fig. 6 B, based on experiments using trabeculae (Allen & Kurihara, 1982), which shows developed force ( F) as a function of sarcomere length ( L). The F-S law of the heart has stood the test of time, but even as it was being established, evidence emerged that muscle length was not the sole determinant of contra- ctile force. Gleb von Anrep (von Anrep, 1912) found that increasing the outflow resistance caused an initial increase in LV EDV (the rightward shift in the P-V loop atob in Fig. 6 A) but after 10-30 min EDV recovered almost completely ( P-V loop shift from btoc), exhibiting the normal stroke volume at much higher pressure and stroke work (SW). Indeed, compared to P-V loop a, the LV was producing much higher pressure at the same EDV (or SL). This is the eponymous Anrep effect. Figure 6 Cand Dshows the time course of P-V loop changes (from panel A) in ner detail for EDV , ESV , ejection fraction (EF) and d P/dtmaxupon TAC at time 0. These data show that immediately following TAC there is an expansion of the EDV and ESV (panel C), a decrease in ejection fraction, and an increase in contraction force as indexed by a greater d P/dt(panel D). The increase in contraction force is expected from Starling's law as a consequence of the increased EDV . After 30 min, both the EDV and ESV have returned to their pre-TAC values. Despite the heart's return to the initial LV chamber volume, the contractile force remains sufciently large (measured by d P/dt) for the ejection fraction - and therefore the stroke volume (indicated by the equal widths of the P-V loops before and 30 min after TAC in panel A) - to recover completely. At the 30 min time point the increased force cannot be due to the F-S mechanism because the EDV is at its initial value so the muscle lengths are the same. Load-tuning property of cardiac muscle: generation of different forces under different mechanical loads at the same muscle length We can use Figure 6 Bto interpret the results shown in panels AandC.L e t Lobe the muscle length at end-diastole (/223cEDV1/3) before outflow resistance increase. At this time the muscle develops force F(a). Let Fbe the force needed C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The of Physiol 598.7 Mechano-transduction in cardiomyocytes 1295 to eject the blood at the higher outflow resistance. The initial increase in EDV engages the F-S mechanism and after a few beats the LV expands to the point where the force of contraction is sufcient to eject the volume of blood equal to the venous return. This chamber volume corresponds to length Land the muscle generates force F(b). During this phase, the muscle length travels along path Aof the Allen-Kurihara F-S curve. As the EDV decreases (Fig. 6 AandC) the force of contraction must be maintained to eject blood against the higher output resistance, so the trajectory of the muscle length is horizontal along path B. After about 15 min the EDV stops decreasing to a value equal to its initial value Lo.A tt h e steady state the muscle length equals Lobut must generate force F(c)=F(b). Therefore, the muscle of length Locan generate different forces, as seen in F(a)a n d F(c). Thedifference between these two forces, /Delta1F=F(c)F(a) reflects the increase in contractility. We call this ability of the muscle to generate different forces under different loads at a given muscle length the load-tuning property . In fact, such load tuning is an inherent property of the heart, whose contractions have to be 'inter- nally heterogeneous' to achieve 'externally homogeneous' pump function (Katz & Katz, 1989). The auto-regulatory ability of the heart to adjust its regional contractility to spatio-temporally varying alterations that are driven by haemodynamic demand has been studied extensively, including 'duplex models' of isolated interacting muscle segments. These are kept in dened mechanical and biochemical conditions (interacting mechanically, while positioned in two separate baths), including more recent approaches where biological muscle segments A CB D150 Tsp4+/+ Cb a120 90 60 30 001 0 2 0 3 0 LV Volume ( L)LV Pressure (mmHg) Peak tension F 40Baseline TAC 1 minute TAC 30 minutes F (c)F-S Fiber lengthB b AC a LO L*F 50 ESV EDV2.2 1. 3 1. 2 1. 1 1. 0 0.9 0.8 -5 0 5 10 15 Time after TAC (minutes)20 25EFdP/dt 30 352.0 1. 8 1. 6 1. 4 1. 2 1. 0 0.8 05 1 0 1 5 Time after TAC (minutes)20 25 30Relative change Relative changeF (a)F (b) Figure law and Anrep effect A, pressure-volume ( P-V) loops before TAC (light black), 1 min after TAC (dashed curve), and 30 min after TAC (heavy black).

These studies highlight that MCT is the basis on which individual myocardial segments match their contractility to actual demand - in the absence of neuro-muscular junctions that grade skeletal muscle performance (for review, see Solovyova et al. 2014). Given the muscle's load-tuning force output, it is clear that muscle length cannot be the sole determinant of contractile force. Other than strain (fractional length change), what mechanical stimulus could also be involved? A logical candidate is the mechanical stress (force/area). L a p l a c e ' sl a wt e l l su st h a tt h ew a l ls t r e s si sp r o p o r t i o n a l to the product of the chamber pressure and chamber radius. Anrep's observation was the rst indication that the heart responded not only to mechanical strain as described by Starling's law but also to mechanical stress. The response of the heart to an increase in the outflow resistance shown in Fig. 6 actually has four names: (1) the Anrep effect , which honors its discoverer; (2) homeometric autoregulation (Sarnoff et al. 196 0), which emphasizes the increase of contractility at the same muscle length; (3) slow force response (Parmley & Chuck, 1973; Donald et al. 1976; Allen & Kurihara, 1982; Kentish & Wrzosek, 1998), which emphasizes the slow time-dependent signalling (up to tens of minutes) to increase inotropy; and (4) stress-stimulated contractility (Seo et al. 2014), which highlights the role of stress instead of strain in increasing contraction force. We think that the attachment of four different names to the same phenomenon attests to the long history of trying to understand this puzzling phenomenon. The Anrep effect presents two fundamental challenges that were addressed in this symposium: (1) How does the cardiomyocyte distinguish mechanical stress from strain? (2) What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the stress-stimulated contractility? Stress-stimulated contractility is caused by increased Ca2+transient The ability of cardiac muscle to generate two different forces at the same muscle length suggests that the cardio- myocyte can distinguish stress from strain. Around the 1980s, researchers used multicellular preparations such as trabeculae and papillary muscle to measure strain and stress, as well as cytosolic Ca2+level. In a typical experiment, the muscle was stretched to a xed length and isometric tension was measured. The consensus emerging from these studies is that stretch of the muscle caused an immediate increase in the contractile force (Frank-Starling), followed by a gradual further increase of force over minutes, called the slow force or Anrepresponse (Parmley & Chuck, 1973; Donald et al. 1976; Allen & Kurihara, 1982; Kentish & Wrzosek, 1998) Importantly, the immediate force increase did not involve a n yc h a n g ei nt h eC a2+transient, which is caused by the strain-dependent myolament-based F-S mechanism (Moss & Fitzsimons, 2002; Solaro, 2007), whereas the slow force response involves increased cytosolic Ca2+transients and in some cases enhanced myolament Ca2+sensitivity contractility (Allen & Kurihara, 1982; Kentish & Wrzosek, 1998). Since the 1990s, researchers further developed techniques to study the strain and stress effects on single cardiomyocytes that allow in-depth exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms. A classical technique is to attach a pair of micro-cantilevers (i.e. carbon bres, glass rods) to the surface of cardiomyocyte and then stretch the cell along the longitudinal direction (Gannier, et al. 1994). This one-dimensional (1-D) stretch technique applies longitudinal strain and stress on the cell but not transverse compression, because the cell is free to expand transversely in bath solution. The Kass group (Seo et al. 2014) found that myocyte stretch during auxotonic contraction caused an immediate increase of the force, and then a gradual increase of contractility accompanied by increased Ca2+ transient; this single cell response recapitulates the F-S and Anrep effects. Kohl's group (Iribe et al. 2009 b)a n d Lederer's group (Prosser et al. 2011) found that stretch of the resting cardiomyocyte caused a transient rise of Ca2+ sparks and waves, and repetitive stretches caused sustained rise of Ca2+sparks. (Prosser et al. 2013). The Chen-Izu group developed a 'cell-in-gel' system allowing them to embed single cardiomyocytes in a 3-D hydrogel made of polymer matrix in solution (Jian et al. 2014). When the cell is paced to contract in the gel, the viscoelastic gel resists both the cell shortening and broadening to exert 3-D stress (i.e. longitudinal tension, transverse compression, and surface traction with normal and shear stresses; Shaw et al. 2013) The stiffness of the gel reduces shortening, but increases Ca2+transient amplitude and Ca2+spark frequency (Fig. 7). A distinct novelty of the 'cell-in-gel' approach is to apply stress on the myocyte during auxotonic contraction against a 3-D visco- elastic matrix, without pre-stretching the cell, and thereby separating the stress from strain. How mechanical stresses affect the electrical dynamics in the cell-in-gel system is yet to be studied. Mechano-chemo-transduction pathways linking mechanical forces to Ca2+dynamics Research from the 1990s to the present has focused on delineating the molecular pathways, or MCT, that link cellular mechanics to changing Ca2+dynamics. These C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of the subject of excellent reviews by Cingolani et al. (2013) and Schonleitner et al. (2017). Here we briefly catalogue the known pathways and highlight some differences that might reveal different mechano- sensing modalities. We also consider that different experimental settings involve different strains and/or stresses on the cell (Chen-Izu & Izu, 2017), which need to be taken into account in order to understand and compare the data obtained using different experimental settings. Integrin-angiotensin-NHE pathway. Mechanical stretch of1integrin at the cardiomyocyte surface initiates a number of different signalling pathways by causing release of angiotensin II (Ang II) from myocytes (Browe & Baumgarten, 2004). The Ang II then activates angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1receptor), which begins a cascade that ultimately activates chloride-permeant stretch-activated channels (Browe & Baumgarten, 2004) or the Na+-H+exchanger (NHE) and NCX, leading to a secondary increase in the Ca2+transient (Alvarez et al. 1999; Calaghan & White, 2004; Cingolani al. 2013). Thrombospondin pathway. Thrombospondin-4 (TSP4) is an matricellular protein that increases in hypertension and heart failure. Cingolani et al. (2011) found that in mice lacking TSP4 the P-V loops did not have the evolutionaryhallmark characteristics of the Anrep effect shown in Fig. 6 Afollowing acute TAC. Instead, 30 min post TAC the P-V loop remained right-shifted and the stroke volume was not restored. This paper shows the interaction of the extracellular matrix and the myocyte in mechano-sensing. TRPC6/3-PKG pathway. Using the 1-D stretch system with compliant carbon bres attached on the cardiomyocyte, Seo et al. (2014) tested the hypothesis that the trans- ient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6) participates in stress-stimulated contractility. Inhibiting TRPC6 using cGMP to activate protein kinase G (PKG) or using a TRPC6 knockout eliminated the increase in Ca2+ transient amplitude and slow force response of papillary muscle to stretch. In whole-animal studies, where outflow resistance was increased by TAC, the pressure-volume loops in control animals exhibited the kind of response shown in Fig. 6 A. Immediately following TAC, the P-V loop shifted to the right and narrowed but after 15 min the end-diastolic volume of the P-V loop shifted back to the left (in fact below the control volume in their gure) and the stroke volume increased, indicating an increase of stress-stimulated contractility. The TRPC6 knockout lacked the decrease in the end-diastolic volume after 15 min. These elegant studies reveal the importance of TRPC6 in stress-stimulated contractility increase but leaves open the identity of the mechanosensor, a possible G-coupled protein receptor. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.01234CaT peak (F/F0) Time (s)0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 of 3-D hydrogel matrix containing red fluorescence beads.

Using the 1-D stretch system with carbon bres attached to the cardiomyocyte, Iribe et al. (2009 b) showed that stretch of resting cardiomyocytes elicited a transient increase in the Ca2+spark rate. Subsequently, Prosser et al. (2011) showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production linked to isoform 2 of NADPH oxidase (NOX2), which they call X-ROS signalling, was responsible for the stretch-induced Ca2+ spark rate increase. The link between cellular mechanics and X-ROS signalling is compelling because an intact microtubular network is essential for the stretch-induced Ca2+spark rate increase (Iribe et al. 2009 b; Prosser et al. 2011; Khairallah et al. 2012; Robison et al. 2016). In support of this possibility, modelling studies by Limbu et al. (2015) show that X-ROS activation during the diastolic lling phase of the heart could increase the magnitude of the Ca2+transient. NOS-NO pathway. Using a cell-in-agar technique, Petroff et al. (2001) found that stretching the tubing encasing the cell-in-agar increased Ca2+transient amplitude and the Ca2+spark rate in cardiomyocytes. This MCT pathway involves nitric oxide (NO) signalling because both the Ca2+sparks and the Ca2+transient increase were abolished by L-NAME ( NG-nitro- knockout of eNOS (eNOS/). Using the 3-D cell-in-gel system, Jian et al. (2014) found that stress-stimulated Ca2+sparks were abolished by pharmacological inhibition of nNOS or genetic knockout of nNOS (nNOS/). Furthermore, both constitutive nNOS and eNOS are involved in a stress-stimulated increase in the Ca2+transient, and the stress effect on the Ca2+transient was abolished by inhibiting NOS (Jian et al. 2014). These data strongly support the hypothesis that NOSs and NO signalling serve as a critically important chemo-transducer in the stress-stimulated MCT pathway. The above studies show that mechanical strain and stress on cardiomyocytes activate various chemotransducers that lead to modulation of the intracellular Na+and Ca2+handling system. The effects of mechanical strain a n ds t r e s so nt h eC a2+homeodynamics have several functional consequences. For example, a stress-induced increase of systolic Ca2+transient through the TRPC6/3 and the cardiomyocyte contractility. Strain- and stress-induced spontaneous Ca2+sparks and waves are expected to promote arrhythmogenic activities. However, the electro- physiological and Ca2+handling systems in rodent myo- cytes differ signicantly from that of larger mammalian rabbit, dog, pig, human; Bassani & Bers, ventricular myo- cytes exhibit very brief APD driven by robust trans-ient outward current ( Ito) and a late low plateau level dominated by inward NCX current. In contrast, larger mammals have long APDs with positive plateaus, little Itoand repolarization that is driven by delayed rectier K+currents ( IKrand IKs), which are absent in rodents. Furthermore, in rodents, Ca2+handling is over- whelmingly dominated by SR Ca2+release and reuptake, with little Ca2+influx via Ca2+current, and SR Ca2+ stores are higher at baseline and are maintained in resting cardiomyocytes. In larger mammals, a greater fraction of E-C coupling-related Ca2+enters with each beat via Ca2+current and leaves via NCX, and SR Ca2+ content increases with heart rate are critical to inotropic reserve. Another complicating factor is that experiments are often performed at room temperature, which can alter electrophysiological, Ca2+handling and contractile properties. Hence, caution needs to be taken in translating the experimental ndings in rodent models to human pathophysiology. Different mechano-sensing modalities Interestingly, the involvement of NOS-NO signalling in the MCT pathway differs drastically in different experimental settings. As mentioned before, the NOS-NO signalling has been found to be critically involved in stress-stimulated MCT in the 3-D cell-in-gel system (Jian et al. 2014) and in the 3-D cell-in-agar experiment (Petroff et al. 2001). In contrast, inhibiting NOS with L-NAME did not affect strain-stimulated MCT in the 1-D stretch system, as found in the studies by Calaghan & White (2004), Seo et al. (2014), Iribe et al. (2009 b) and Prosser et al. (2011) T o resolve this apparent controversy, Chen-Izu & Izu (2017) proposed a hypothesis on different mechano-sensing modalities based on the 'dimensionality' of the mechano- sensors (i.e. 1-D longitudinal strain vs. 3-D stresses). The apparent controversy on the NOS-NO involvement in MCT pathways opens a window into the different mechano-sensing modalities. One critical difference between the 1-D stretch experiments and the 3-D cell-in-gel experiments is the engagement of cell-surface mechanosensors (Chen-Izu & Izu, 2017). Figure 8 illustrates a conceptual model of how different mechano- sensors may respond to different strains and stresses. The surface mechanosensors are illustrated as the yellow circles (or ellipses if under strain/stress), and the inter- nal mechanosensors are seen as the red or green circles (or ellipses if under strain/stress). When the myocyte lengthens (or contracts) along the longitudinal axis, the cell also narrows (or widens) in the transverse direction because cell volume is conserved. The inter- nal mechanosensors experience the same strain (relative length change) for a given cell strain during stretch or contraction, regardless of the external environment. By contrast, the surface mechanosensors are profoundly C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of Physiol 598.7 Mechano-transduction in cardiomyocytes by stiffness of the external environment. Specically, in the 1-D stretch experiments, myocytes were immersed in bath solution and stretched along the long axis, so the myocyte is largely under longitudinal strain and stress. The bath solution imposes little trans- verse compression or shear stress on the cardiomyocyte; hence, the cell-surface mechanosensors are not under stress during stretch or contraction. However, in the cell-in-gel system, the myocyte embedded in a 3-D visco- elastic gel must pull the gel along the long axis as it contracts and push the gel along the transverse axis as it widens, and the cell surface pulls against shear force (Shaw et al. 2013); hence, the surface mechanosensors are subject to transverse and shear stresses during stretch or contraction (as in the myocardium, extracellular matrix, or hydrogel polymer matrix). Therefore, we propose a simple hypothesis, according to Occam's Razor, that the cell-surface mechanosensors activate the NOS-NO signalling pathway. Perspectives Linking modelling and experiments T h es t u d yo ft h eh e a r th a se n j o y e das t r o n g e ri n t e r - action between mathematical modelling and experimental work than many other areas of physiology. Niederer et al. (2019) give an excellent history of the development of mathematical models of cardiac mechanics. A special issue in the JMCC (introduced by Smith and Niederer (Smith & Niederer, 2016)) focuses on cardiac modelling at both the cellular and tissue and whole-organ levels. An important theme from this special issue is the increased specicity ofthe models, which enables a closer comparison between experimental data and simulation results. Here we focus rst on what we consider success stories and later on challenges that arise in studying mechano-electrical coupling and mechano-chemo- transduction. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the Anrep effect in the whole heart and its correlates, slow force response and stress-stimulated contractility in cardiac muscle and single cardiomyocytes, remains incomplete. Because experimental work in the 1980s showed that the SFR required Ca2+entry, a stretch-sensitive L-type Ca2+channel would seem to be important for the SFR. The importance of modelling is highlighted by Bluhm et al. (1998), who showed that a stretch-sensitive Ca2+channel would not account for the slow increase of force characteristic of the Anrep effect. Rather they were able to model both the magnitude and timing of the SFR by assuming that the Na+-K+pump or the Na+leak current were stretch dependent. Later Niederer & Smith (2007) were able to model the SFR using a non-specic stretch-activated current that allowed Na+entry in conjunction with NHE. A surprising and important nding was that the stretch-sensitive NHE c o u l dn o t ,b yi t s e l f ,g e n e r a t et h eS F R ,c o n t r a r yt ot h ev i e w arising from extensive experimental studies. These studies illustrate some of the important contributions modelling can make to understanding cardiac physiology. The Niederer & Smith (2007) study showed how the interaction of SAC and NHE generates the SFR. Importantly, they explained how the experimental protocol of preincubation with NHE blockers might have led to a misinterpretation of the primary role of the NHE in SFR. The explanation is subtle; SFR depends on the Cell-in-solution CellingelCONTRACTION STRETCH Figure 8. Conceptual model of how different mechanosensors may sense different strain and stress Upper row: when the cell is in solution, the surface mechanosensors (yellow circle with spring) are not under transverse stress and surface traction. Lower row: when the cell is contracting in 3-D viscoelastic environment, the surface mechanosensors are under transverse compression and shear stresses. The internal mechanosensors (green and red circles with spring) are under longitudinal tension during stretch or compression during contraction. C/circlecopyrt2019 The Authors. The Journal of Physiology C/circlecopyrt2019 The Physiological Society1300 L. T. Izu and others J Physiol 598.7 balance between Na+influx and efflux, which can shift with the resting Na+level because of the cubic [Na+]I dependence of the NCX flux. Long incubation with an NHE blocker reduced [Na+]ito a point that limits the ability of NCX to raise [Ca2+]ito support the development of the SFR. It would probably be difcult to disentangle these interactions by experiments alone. Iribe et al. (2009 a) and Prosser et al. (2011, 2013) showed that stretch immediately increases Ca2+spark rate, possibly through X-ROS signalling. In an editorial Mark Cannell (Cannell, 2009) suggested that the stretch-induced Ca2+spark rate increase might contribute to Starling's law of the heart and in particular the SFR. Limbu et al. (2015) modelled X-ROS signalling under cyclic stretching in a single myocyte and calculated spark rates and Ca2+transients. The model faithfully reproduced the Ca2+spark data from experiments but the Ca2+ transient results diverged from experimental data. In their simulations the initial stretch caused an immediate increase in the Ca2+transient magnitude but its peak magnitude declined on subsequent stretches. These results are inconsistent with the body of experimental results showing no increase in the Ca2+transient in the initial stretch and slowly increasing Ca2+transient amplitude. Such trenchant differences between model results and experiments should be viewed positively because they open opportunities for modellers and experimentalists to focus on how the model got some things right and where the model needs modication. We think the current computational models of cardiac E-C coupling need to be further improved. Many parameters in the current models were derived from experimental data obtained in different species and under various articial conditions. Hence the models need to be improved based on new data obtained under more physiological conditions, such as using mechanically loaded cardiomyocytes (instead of load-free cells). Furthermore, adding mechanical load and mechano-chemo-electro-transduction feedbacks into the E-C coupling model will be a necessary step towards developing more realistic models. Recognizing the importance of the back-and-forth dialogue between modelling and bench experiments, it is critically important to bring together modellers and experimentalists to have this dialogue, to learn from each other, and to develop interdisciplinary collaborations. Plurality of mechano-chemo-electro-transduction pathways The plurality of mechano-chemo-electro-transduction pathways discovered so far suggest that mechanical strain and stress on the cardiomyocyte can be sensed and transduced by various mechano-sensors located in different sub-cellular structures. In this white paperwe focus only on a few mechano-electro-transduction and mechano-chemo-transduction pathways discussed in the symposium and depicted in Figure 9. We recognize the existence of many other mechano- sensors and their mechano-electro-transduction and mechano-chemo-transduction pathways and recommend excellent reviews on the Anrep effect (Cingolani et al. 2013), SAC (Baumgarten, 2007; Peyronnet et al. 2016), and mechano-sensitivity of Ca2+signalling (Schonleitner et al. 2017). Here we wish to emphasize that different experimental settings involve different mechanical strains and stresses, which would affect different mechano- sensors depending on their sub-cellular localization and dimensionality. It is plausible that the internal mechano- sensors are poised to sense longitudinal strain and tension, whereas cell-surface mechanosensors are poised to sense surface traction and transverse compression. Therefore, caution is needed in clarifying the precise mechanical stimuli for analysing molecular mechanisms and comparing the data from different experimental settings. It is also important to use different mechanical stimuli to interrogate different mechanosensors in order to piece together a more precise and comprehensive map of the mechano-chemo-electro-transduction pathways.

Cell contraction against ECM applies mechanical stress that can be sensed by surface-mechanosensors (yellow). The molecular identities of many mechanosensors are yet to be discovered (labelled X and Y). Depicted are several known MCET pathways: Nox2-ROS, integrin-AngII, homeodynamics (see MCT section). Stretch-activated channels (SAC) and volume activated channels (VAC) have also been linked to Ca2+ permeability that may affect the Ca2+entry and intracellular Ca2+ homeodynamics (see MEC section). C/circlecopyrt2019 The Physiol 598.7 Mechano-transduction in cardiomyocytes 1301 demands of the body. One wonders whether the plurality of mechanosensors and MCT pathways might be needed to adapt the force generation to different stressors and demands. Different mechanosensors and MCT pathways might stratify into different time and force hierarchies. Time hierarchy. The F-S mechanism and the Anrep effect have distinct time domains. The F-S mechanism is fully engaged within one or two heartbeats while the Anrep effect develops over many minutes. T eleologically such a separation into rapid and slow time domains makes sense. Changes in venous return due to post- ural changes or left-right ventricular flow mismatch are transient disturbances that the F-S mechanism rapidly corrects without the expense of increased Ca2+signalling. Adjusting to sustained increases in afterload caused by activities with a large static component such as boxing (Mitchell et al. 2005) or shovelling snow (Franklin et al. 1995), on the other hand, requires a different strategy. The heart might be trading off the cost of Ca2+signalling to reduce the energetic cost of contracting against higher wall tension resulting from wall stretch. Research discussed here focused on acute changes in mechanical loading where the response time of the heart is on the order of a few seconds to a few tens of minutes. How chronic hyper- tension, operating on time scales of months to years, affects MEC and MEC remains largely unexplored. Force hierarchy. Systolic blood pressure is around 120 mmHg but can reach 350 mmHg while doing double leg presses (MacDougall et al. 1985). Just as different tools are used to measure distance and force it seems reasonable that different mechanosensors and MCT pathways might respond to different levels of strain and stress. T o go beyond teleological speculation, future experiments must pay careful attention to the characteristics of mechanical loading (i.e. strain, stress, location, magnitude) imposed on the myo- cyte and determine which MCET pathway is operative by pharmacological or genetic dissection. Sequential application of specic channel blockers electro- physiologists to 'peel back' the layers of ionic currents that underlie the action potential (Banyasz et al. 2011; Hegyi et al. 2018). Perhaps a similar approach might be useful to determine how different MCET pathways stratify in time and force hierarchies. MCT and MEC feedbacks in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling The heart pumps blood against an ever-changing mechanical load. The heart also has intrinsic mechanisms to sense the strain and stress and autoregulate contra- ctile force to maintain a constant cardiac output. Although the heart's response to mechanical loading was described by Frank, Starling and Anrep more thana century ago, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that transduce mechanical load to influence the Ca2+ handling and electrical activities in the cardiomyocyte are far from fully understood. The classic description of excitation-contraction coupling has information flowing from the electrical system to the Ca2+control system and then to the contractile system. MCT and MEC reverse the flow of information enabling a continuously bidirectionally information feedforward and feedback between these three dynamic systems. According to control theory, such closed-loop feedback is necessary for auto- regulation of the system. Continuing research on MCT and MEC is essential for understanding the heart as a smart pump that senses mechanical strain and stress and autoregulates contractile force to maintain cardiac output. But as with any control system operating out of its design space, Ca2+dysregulation and arrhythmias can emerge. References Allen DG & Kentish JC (1985).
