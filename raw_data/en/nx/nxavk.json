Schachter Introduction Despite an expanded array of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), improvements in and increased availability of brainsurgery, and aggressive worldwide campaigns to narrowthe diagnosis and treatment gaps, a signicant proportionof patients treated for epilepsy continue to haveseizures or troublesome AED-related side effects [1],and millions of people with epilepsy around the worldhave no access to modern treatments [2]. Patients treated for chronic medical conditions, such as epilepsy, and especially those with ongoing symptoms,such as seizures or medication-related side effects, oftenturn to complementary and alternative medical (CAM)therapies for relief, preferring 'natural' treatments to'articial' or 'synthetic' drugs, believing that 'natural'treatments are better and safer, and valuing the increased self-management afforded by their relationships with alternative healthcare providers. Likewise, people withepilepsy or other chronic disorders who live in regions ofthe world where geographic, economic, cultural, social orreligious factors present barriers to accessing modernmedical treatments generally receive CAM therapies astheir primary healthcare, or in association with medicine(e.g. AEDs) [3-6]. The National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) denes CAM therapies as those healthcare and medicalpractices that are not currently an integral part ofconventional medicine, and consequently are nottypically taught in the standard curricula of Western(e.g. American) medical schools. CAM therapies includeherbal medicines as part of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM; which also features acupuncture), Ayurveda, and other healthcare systems; homeopathy; mind-body therapies, such as yoga, prayer and therapeutic substances, including high-dose vitaminsand dietary supplements; special diets; movement,manipulation and massage therapies, including reflexo-logy, massage, osteopathy, chiropractic, Reiki andQigong; and electromagnetic forces.Osher Research Center, Harvard Medical School; Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Correspondence to Steven C.

This review highlights the ndings of recently published studiesof complementary and alternative medical therapies and epilepsy, and provides anupdate of the US Food and Drug Administration's role in regulating herbal products.Recent ndingsComplementary and alternative medical therapies are often tried by patients with epilepsy, frequently without physician knowledge. Many modalities have been evaluated in patients with epilepsy, though methodological issues preclude any rm conclusionsof efcacy or safety. Some herbal medicines have been shown experimentally to havemechanisms of action relevant to epilepsy and promising actions in animal models.SummaryThere is currently a paucity of credible evidence to support the use of complementaryand alternative medical therapies in patients with epilepsy. Herbal medicinestraditionally used for epilepsy and compounds isolated from them, as well as other herbal medicines and their constituent compounds that have been shown experimentally to have mechanisms of action relevant to epilepsy, should undergofurther preclinical evaluation with a view towards clinical development under the newUS Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Additional studies of other, nonherbalcomplementary and alternative medical therapies are also warranted based onanecdotal observations or pilot studies that suggest a favorable risk-benet ratio.

Interested readers are referred to other sources that provide greater detail,particularly on specic therapies and safety consider-ations [7 /C15,8-14,15/C15]. Scope of use of complementary and alternative medical therapies in epilepsy This section analyses the use of CAM therapies in developed and developing countries. Developed countries Up to 40% of patients attending epilepsy centers in devel-oped countries take or have taken herbal medicines ordietary supplements, and the majority may not informtheir physicians [16-18]. Products most often takeninclude ginseng, St usage was intended for epilepsy-related symptoms or comorbidities such as memory disturbance (gingko) and depression (St John's Wort). Likewise, gingko biloba wasthe most common herbal product identied in a survey ofherbal use among residents of American nursing homes,including residents with a diagnosis of epilepsy, raising thepotential for herbal-related adverse effects such asincreased seizure frequency [19 /C15]. Liow and colleagues [20] assessed usage of and percep-tions about a variety of CAM therapies among 228 adultpatients with epilepsy in the midwestern US using a25-item survey. Thirty-nine per cent of the samplereported using CAM therapies, including 25% whoseuse was specically for seizure control. The most commonforms of CAM were herbs/dietary supplements, prayer/spirituality, 'mega' vitamins, chiropractic care and stress management. Developing countries The choice and use of CAM therapies by persons with epilepsy in developing countries, including those who subsequently move to industrialized countries, are influenced by existing traditional systems of healthcare,educational level, and prevailing cultural beliefs, such asthat epilepsy results from evil sprits or sins of a past life[21-26]. For example, Carod-Artal and Vazquez-Cabrera[27 /C15] collected information from several different groups of shamans and medicine men in Central and SouthAmerica about the epilepsy-related beliefs among their people. One group believed that epilepsy turned the affected person into a witch and was caused by an attacksuffered by the animal spirit who accompanies theperson, after a ght between the spirits who serve theforces of good and evil. Other groups thought it was dueto the revenge of the armadillo spirit killed by a huntsmanor a witchcraft that enters into the nose and the head, as awind. Treatments consisted of roots kneaded and diluted in water, a ritual animal sacrice and dried insect infu- sions and bird's blood. Complementary and alternative medical therapies used for epilepsy This section examines CAM therapies used for epilepsy. Herbal medicines Herbal medicines have been used to treat convulsive seizures for thousands of years, often as a major com-ponent of well established systems of healthcare such asTCM [28-30], Korean traditional medicine [31], andAyurveda, a medical system and a science of life thatis believed to have originated in India 6000 years BC [32]. TCM practitioners usually prescribe combinations of herbal medicines [33]. Over 130 herbal medicines usedsingly or in combinations for the treatment of epilepsy inthe Far East have been reported in English or an Asianlanguage [15 /C15,34/C15], which as of March 2005 consisted of three randomized controlled trials, ve nonrandomizedcontrolled trials, six case control studies and 57 observa-tional studies including case reports [35]. Only one clinical study could be identied since 2005 in the English litera- ture [36]. These clinical trials are generally difcult of methodological issues in study design,inadequate powering, categorization of seizuretypes and epilepsy syndromes, questionable choices ofoutcome measures and statistical methods, and lack ofcharacterization of the herbal medicines used for activeinterventions, as further discussed below. The most frequently used herbal medicines in the pub- lished epilepsy literature from the with epilepsy toadopt specic lifestyle and dietary practices, and to takeherbal preparations, the most common being Brahmira-sayan, Brahmighritham, Ashwagandha, old pure desighee, daily fresh juice of brahmi with honey, and pow-dered root of wild asparagus with milk. Other Schachter 185Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Interpretation of these results, however, is often limitedby inconsistent descriptions of the methods used toauthenticate the source plants, produce extractions andfractions, characterize the active ingredients and conductthe evaluations [15 /C15]. More recent investigations have attempted to address these limitations [38-40,41/C15/C15]. For example, Khan et al. [42] studied the effects of Bacopa monnieri extract, a traditional Ayurvedic therapy, on glutamate receptor binding and NMDA R1 gene expres-sion in the hippocampus of pilocarpine-induced epilepticrats. Unlike many other papers, this report describesthe source of the plant material as well as the authen-tication and extraction methods. Further, voucher speci-mens were prepared and stored, allowing for furthercharacterization of the plant materials or repeat laboratory studies. The most common strategy for selecting herbal medi- cines for laboratory or clinical studies has been to choosethose products that have a historical tradition of use astreatments for seizures. A recent paper [43 /C15] suggests an alternative approach based on epidemiology. Salih andMustafa noted that the prevalence of epilepsy among school children of Khartoum Province, Sudan, was lower compared with that of Europe and North America. Theyfurther observed that Vicia faba (broad beans) is a major food item for these children, much more so than forpopulations away from the Nile River. They thereforespeculated that the constituents of Vicia faba have anti- convulsant properties. Consistent with this hypothesis,they reported that an extract of Vicia faba effectively reduced seizures in the mouse strychnine model. Acupuncture Acupuncture is another major component of TCM thathas been used for people with epilepsy throughout thecenturies, usually in conjunction with herbs [44].Acupuncture appears to have anticonvulsant effects ina variety of animal models [45,46]. While various theories have been advanced to account for the putative anticonvulsant effects of acupuncture,including involvement of the vagus nerve and its centralconnections [47], demonstration of efcacy in patients islargely limited to open series or case reports. A recentCochrane review identied only three randomized trialspublished in any language through June 2005, including two in China and one in Norway [48 /C15]. The adult trial, which utilized the acupuncture points known as LR3, LI4, GV20 and one or two other points based onindividual diagnoses [49] found no evidence thatacupuncture reduced seizure frequency or duration ofseizure-free periods signicantly more than shamacupuncture. Based on methodological limitations suchas inadequate description of randomization and blinding procedures, the authors of the Cochrane review con- cluded that neither one of the remaining two studies,both in children, provided evidence of clinical benet. Anadditional, more recent literature review also found noevidence to support the use of acupuncture in patientswith epilepsy [50]. Two studies published after the Cochrane review period present illustrative methodological issues. In one [51], ve courses of acupuncture treatment were given to98 patients said to have 'Jacksonian epilepsy' and 52 weresaid to have a 'markedly effective' In theother study [52], 100 paroxysmalepilepsy' were randomized the'total 94% in the catgut-treated patients compared with 82% in the VPA-treated patients. Psychological therapies and mind-body techniques Psychological therapies and mind-body techniques encompass a variety of methods appropriate for children[53] and adults, including behavioral inhibition of symp-toms at seizure onset [54], cognitive-behavior therapy[55], relaxation techniques such as yoga and related meditative techniques [56,57], and neurofeedback [58,59]. Evaluating these treatments in double-blinded,randomized, controlled trials is generally not feasible,and while small open or pilot studies may suggest atherapeutic effect, evidence from large, randomizedstudies is either negative or not available. For example,the most recent Cochrane reviews on psychological thera-pies [60] and yoga [61] found no conclusive evidence of benet in patients with epilepsy. Nevertheless, inves- tigators continue to conduct open trials, which usually areinterpreted to show therapeutic effects without sideeffects [62]. Homeopathy The modern-day father of homeopathy was SamuelHahnemann (1755-1843), who proposed that 'like should be cured with like', meaning that homeopathic preparations to treat patients' symptoms should includeplant or animal products that cause similar symptomswhen given to healthy volunteers [63], and which arethen serially diluted and vigorously shaken before beingtaken by patients [64]. Homeopathic medicines are taken by patients with epilepsy [3], though critics maintain there are no incre- mental benets of homeopathy in excess of a placeboeffect [65]. Interestingly, a homeopathic preparation ofBelladonna was recently shown in an uncontrolled study186 Seizure disordersCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.to reduce tonic-clonic seizures in 10 of 10 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy as reported by their owners [66]. Regulation of herbal medicines and recent developments Herbal medicines in the US are regulated by the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, whichdenes a dietary supplement as a product taken bymouth that contains a dietary ingredient intended to supplement the diet, including herbs or other botanicals. Manufacturers of herbal products cannot claim they areeffective against a specic disease or medical condition,such as epilepsy, nor are they currently required to produceherbal products using 'good manufacturing practice'(GMP) standards, as is the case for pharmaceutical pro-ducts. Patients are generally unaware of the resulting widevariability in consistency, potency, and per-capsule quantity of herbal products from lot to lot - even from bottle to bottle - of the same product. Two recent developments are changing the role of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in overseeing themanufacturing and labeling of herbal products. First, inJune 2007, the FDA issued its nal rule entitled 'currentgood manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements' (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/cf0441.pdf) thatwill signicantly tighten manufacturing standards, therebyimproving the quality and consistency of herbal products.Second, the FDA is now reviewing the safety and efcacyof complex herbal preparations for their approval forspecic indications. The rst such approval, in late2006, was for a special extract of green tea that the FDA approved as a topical treatment of genital warts caused by the human papilloma virus. This new mech-anism opens up the possibility that herbal extracts couldbe developed as potential FDA-approved treatmentsfor epilepsy. Conclusion CAM therapies are heterogeneous in nature and are often tried by patients with epilepsy without the knowl- edge of their physicians, and despite the lack of wellcontrolled trials to support their use and the possibility ofadverse effects [7 /C15,67]. Therefore, neurologists need to ask their patients with epilepsy whether they useCAM therapies, especially he rbal products, evaluate the associated possible risks with regard to seizureexacerbation and pharmaco kinetic and pharmacody- namic interactions with AEDs , and advise their patients accordingly. Nonetheless, herbal medicines with a tradition of use for epilepsy and compounds isolated from them, as well asother herbal medicines and their constituent compoundsthat have been shown experimentally to have mechan-isms of action relevant to epilepsy, should be furtherevaluated in animal models of epilepsy and moved into clinical development when feasible to assess for efcacy, safety and tolerability, using procedures that are consist-ent with the new FDA approval mechanism for herbalproducts [15 /C15,68,69]. Additionally, more studies of phar- macokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions betweenAEDs and herbal products are needed. Additional studies of other, nonherbal CAM therapies, such as acupuncture and mind-body techniques, are also warranted based on anecdotal observations or pilotstudies that suggest a favorable risk-benet ratio; how-ever, methodological limitations will likely continue toimpede their evaluation in the foreseeable future unlessnovel approaches to clinical study design and conduct areimplemented [70].
