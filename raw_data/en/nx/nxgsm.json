WHEREAS, on February 12, 1809, Nancy Hanks Lincoln gave birth to a son in a tiny log cabin on the banks of Nolin Creek, in Hardin County, Kentucky, unaware that the child she was holding would someday hold the future of a battered Union in his hands; and WHEREAS, the Lincoln family moved to Knob Creek in 1811, and although young Lincoln lived in the Commonwealth for just a brief time, he would later recall those early years of climbing trees, f ishing in clear creeks, and learning passages from the Bible from his beloved mother, as some of the fondest memories of his life; and WHEREAS, having moved first to Indiana, then to Illinois, Abraham Lincoln began working as a store clerk, and educated himself by reading Shakespeare and Robert Burns and learning basic mathematics. After a failed campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, and a failed business venture, Lincoln was appointed Postmaster of New Salem, and later Deputy County Surveyor, then w as elected to the legislature in 1834, as a member of the Whig Party, and served there until 1842. He also studied law, and practiced throughout his adopted state; and WHEREAS, Abraham Lincoln was instrumental in the organization of the Republican Party of Illinois in 1856, and four years later, was elected as the sixteenth President of the United States, and the first elected from that party; and WHEREAS, just over a year after his inauguration, Abraham Lincoln saw the beginning of the nation's darkest years, when the Union was divided, and brother fought brother during the bloody Civil War, which broke the heart of America and its leader; and WHEREAS, having witnessed the tragedy of slavery throughout his life, President Lincoln was determined that no man or woman should be bought and sold as the property of another, and fought steadfastly for the rights of every human being, without regard to the color of one's skin, culminating in the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation; and WHEREAS, after year s of bloodshed, the Civil War finally came to an end on April 9, 1865, but the victory was short -lived for President Lincoln, who was shot and killed by an assassin the following week, bringing an end to the life of one who has become a legendary figure in American history, often considered to have been one of the greatest of this nation's leaders; and WHEREAS, this day marks the beginning of the celebration of the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, born of humble beginnings, but leaving a legac y of courage, honesty, and freedom, as his words remind us still that, \"America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves\"; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Senate concurring therein: Section 1. On this day, in the chambers of the Old Capitol, whose halls were graced by the likes of Henry Clay, and where the acrimonious words of secession debates still echo, the General Assembly proudly recalls the legacy of the Commonwealth's greatest son, and joins our sister states in celebration of the birth of Kentucky's Abraham Lincoln 200 years ago. Signed by Governor February 18, 2008. CHAPTER 2 (HB 168) AN ACT relating to operator's licenses. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1.

(12) Authorization for disinterment, transportation, and reinterment or other disposition shall be required prior to disinterment of any human remains. The authorization shall be issued by the state registrar upon proper application. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all manners of disposition except cremation and without regard for the time and place of death. The provis ions of KRS 381.765 shall not apply to remains removed for scientific study and the advancement of knowledge. (13) After a death certificate has been on file for five (5) years, it may not be changed in any manner except upon order of a court.

(b) To order or accept delivery of any new motor vehicle with special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment not included in the list price of the motor vehicle, as publicly advertised by the manufacturer or distributor.

(f) To change the capital structure of the dealership, or the means by or through which the dealer finances the operation of the dealership, provided that the dealership at all times meets any reasonable capital standards agreed to by the dealer, excluding any entity engaged primarily in providing financing or insurance on motor vehicles. (g) To refrain from participation in the management or investment in, or the acquisition of any other line of new motor vehicle or related products; provided, however, that this section does not apply unless the new motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicles, and that the new motor vehicle dealer remains in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of the franchise and with any reasonable facility requirements of the manufacturer, and no change is made in the principal management of the new motor vehicle dealership. (h) To change location of the dealership, or to, during the course of the agreement, make any substantial alterations to the dealership premises, when to do so, would be unreasonable in light of the current economic, political, and social considerations. (i) To prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability to be imposed by this law, or to require any controversy between a dealer and a manufacturer, distributor, or representative, to be referred to any person other than the duly constituted courts of the Commonwealth or the United States of America, or to the commissioner, if the referral would be binding upon the dealer.

Revaluation of the United States dollar, in the case of foreign -make vehicl es or components; or 3.

(k) To compete without good faith with a new motor vehicle dealer in the same line make, operating under an agreement or franchise from the aforementioned manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factor y representative in the relevant market area. A manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative shall not, however, be deemed to be competing when operating a dealership, either temporarily for a reasonable period, not to exceed one (1) year, or in a bona fide retail operation which is for sale to any qualified independent person at a fair and reasonable price, or in a bona fide relationship in which an independent person has made a significant investment, subject to loss in the dealers hip, and can reasonably expect to acquire full ownership of such dealership on reasonable terms and conditions.

The manufacturer shall have the burden of proving that any requirement upon which an offer was conditioned was reasonab le and necessary to fulfill the dealer's obligations under the franchise when the offer was made. A requirement shall not be found to be reasonable and necessary to fulfill the dealer's obligations under the franchise if the manufacturer cannot CHAPTER 17 39 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version prove that it was within the control of each dealer to meet the requirement imposed on the dealer as a condition of the offer. (5) A dealer who alleges a good faith belief that the dealer has been, or is being, discriminated against in violation of subsection (3) of this section, may demand in writing that the manufacturer furnish the dealer with pertinent information reasonably necessary for the dealer to determine if discrimination exists. If the manufacturer fails to furnish the dealer with the information demanded within thirty (30) days of the manufacturer's receipt of the dealer's written demand, the manufacturer shall have, in any subsequent legal proceeding, the burden of proving that the alleged violation has not occurred. (6) Any dealer who is discriminated against by a manufacturer in violation of subsection (3) of this section shall recover three (3) times an amount equal to the value of what the dealer would have received if the manufacturer had complied with subsection (3) of this section upon furnishing any item or opportunity to another dealer.

May make disclosures to the applicant and the insured, either on the application or an amendment to the application to be completed no later than the delivery of the policy, which shall include but not be limited to the following statement or a substantially similar statement: \"If you have entered into a loan arrangement where the policy is used as collateral, and the policy does change ownership at some p oint in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be true: a. A change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life; b. A change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one (1) life; c. Should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on the insured's life in the future, the insured's hig her issue age, a change in health status, or other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage and may result in significantly higher premiums; and d. You should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure of the loan.\"; and 2. May require certifications from the applicant or the insured or both which shall include but not be limited to the following statement or a substantially simil ar statement: \"I certify that: a. I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy; b. My loan arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for procuring this policy; and c. The borrower has an insurable interes t in the insured.\" Section 6. KRS 304.15 -715 is amended to read as follows: (1) A life[viatical] settlement provider entering into a life[viatical] settlement contract with any person shall first obtain: (a) If the owner [viator] is insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner [viator] is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a life[viatical] settlement contract; and (b) A document in which the insured conse nts to the release of his or her medical records to a life[viatical] settlement provider, life insurance agent, or life[viatical] settlement broker and, if the policy was issued less than two (2) years from the date of application for a life[viatical] settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy. (2) The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a life[viatical] settlement provider or life[viatical] settlement broker not later than thirty (30) cale ndar days after the date the request is received. The request for verification of coverage shall be made on a form approved by the executive director. The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In its response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at that time regarding the validity of the insurance CHAPTER 32 91 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version contract or possible fraud, and s hall provide sufficient detail of all reasons for the investigation to the life[viatical] settlement provider or viatical settlement broker. (3) Prior to or at the time of execution of the life[viatical] settlement contract, the life[viatical] settlement provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner [viator] consents to the life[viatical] settlement contract, represents that he or she has a full and complete understanding of the life[viatical] settlement contract and a full and complete unde rstanding of the benefits of the policy, and acknowledges that he or she has entered into the life[viatical] settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued. (4) All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee shall be subject to the applicable provision of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information. (5) All life[viatical] settlement contracts entered into in this state shall contain an unconditional right to rescind a life[viatical] settlement contract before the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after the date it is executed or fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of receipt of the proceeds of the life[viatical] settlement contract by the owner [viator] . If exercised by the owner [viator] , rescission is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given, and within the rescission period all proceeds, and any pre miums, loans, and loan interest are repaid to the life[viatical] settlement provider. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the life[viatical] settlement contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the life[viatical] settlement provider. The life[viatical] settlement provider shall effectuate the change of ownership of the policy or certificate to the owner [viator] immediately upon effective rescission by the owner [viator] . (6) The independent third -party trustee shall transfer the proceeds that are due to the owner [viator] within two (2) business days upon receipt of acknowledgment of the transfer of ownership from the insurer. (7) Failure to tender consideration to the owner [viator] for the life[viatical] settlement contract by the date disclosed renders the life[viatical] settlement contract voidable by the owner [viator] for lack of consideration until the time consideration is tendered to and accepted by t he owner [viator] . (8) Contacts with the insured for the purpose of determining the health status of the insured after the execution of the life[viatical] settlement contract shall only be made by the life[viatical] settlement provider or its authorized representative and shall be limited to once every three (3) months for an insured with a life expectancy of more than one (1) year, and to no more than once per month for an insured with a life expectancy of one (1) year or less. The life[viatical] settlemen t provider shall explain the procedure for these contacts at the time the life[viatical] settlement contract is entered into. The limitations set forth in this subsection shall not apply to any contacts with an insured for reasons other than determining the insured's health status. Life[Viatical] settlement providers shall be responsible for the actions of their authorized representatives. (9) The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement con tract lawfully entered into in the Commonwealth or with a resident of the Commonwealth. (10) If a life settlement broker performs any activities required of the provider under this section, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled those requirements of this section that have been properly performed by the broker. (11) If a life settlement broker performs any of the disclosure activities required of the provider under Section 4 of this Act, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled those requirements of Sec tion 4 of this Act that have been properly performed by the broker. (12) Within twenty (20) days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has become subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 5 of this Act. (13) Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual, or an owner to a broker in exchang e for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a broker from reducing such broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses. (14) The broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value paid or given to a broker which relates to a life settlement contract. 92 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY Section 7.

Members who were retired on or before June 30, 2002, shall be entitled to return to work under the provisions of this section as if they had retired with thirty (30) years of service. Nonqualified service credit purchased under the provisions of KRS 161.5465 or elsewhere with any state -administered retirement system shall [may] not be used to meet the thirty (30) year requirement set forth in this subsection . Out-of-state teaching service provided in public schools for kindergarten through grade twelve (12) may count toward CHAPTER 78 213 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version the thirty (30) year requirement set forth in this subsection even if it is not purchased as service credit, if the member obtains from his or her out -of-state employer certification of this service on forms prescribed by the retirement system.

There shall be documentation that the social service worker, prior to the court hearing, made an effort to contact the parents to inform them of the specific problems that could lead to removal so they have an opportunity to take corrective action. If the parents are unavailable o r do not respond to attempts to communicate, the specific circumstances shall be documented; (b) If it appears that the child's health or welfare or physical, mental, or emotional condition is subjected to or threatened with real and substantial harm and there is not reasonably available an alternative less drastic than removal of the child from the home, the cabinet shall petition the District Court to review the commitment pursuant to KRS 610.120 in relation to the cabinet's intention to remove the child from the parent's home. The petition shall set forth the facts which constitute the need for removal of the child.

If, after a reasonable time, it appears the child has been abandoned, the cabinet shall petition the District Court to review the case; or (d) If there exist reasonable grounds to believe that the child is in danger of imminent death or serious physical injury or is bein g sexually abused and that the parents are unable or unwilling to protect the child, the social service worker shall, with the assistance of a law enforcement officer, immediately remove the child prior to filing a petition for review. Within seventy -two (72) hours after the removal, the cabinet shall file a petition for review in District Court pursuant to KRS 610.120 with a request for an expeditious hearing. If the court fails to find that the child's health or welfare or physical, mental, or emotional c ondition is subjected to or threatened with real and substantial harm, or recommends a less drastic alternative that is reasonably available, the child shall be returned to the parents' home.

CHAPTER 104 (SB 69) AN ACT relating to the hazardous waste management fund and making an appropriation therefor. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. KRS 224.46 -580 is amended to read as follows: (1) The General Assembly declares that it is the purpose of this section to promote the developmen t of statewide programs, under the responsibility of a single agency, which are intended to protect the health of the citizens and the environment of the Commonwealth from present and future threats associated with the management of hazardous wastes and the release of toxic chemicals regulated under Title III, Section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, including disposal, treatment, recycling, storage, and transportation. The intent of the General Assembly is to add to and coor dinate, and not replace, existing efforts and responsibilities in the areas of hazardous waste management, toxic chemical manufacture, processing, or other use, and to leave the primary burden and responsibility for hazardous waste and toxic chemical reduction on private industry; and further to finance assistance and coordination by imposing assessments on the generation of hazardous waste. The assessments are intended to produce a reduction in waste generated; to promote the use of new techniques in recyc ling, treatment, and alternatives other than land disposal; and to place the burden of financing additional hazardous waste management activities necessarily undertaken by state agencies on the users of those products associated with the generation of hazardous waste. The General Assembly further finds that Kentucky's industries need assistance in developing and implementing pollution prevention goals and that a fund should be established to provide technical and financial assistance to those industries. (2) The Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet is given the authority to administer the provisions and programs of this section and the responsibility to achieve the purposes of this section. (3) In addition to all specific responsibilities contained elsewhere in this chapter, the cabinet shall: (a) Respond effectively and in a timely manner to emergencies created by the release of hazardous substances, as defined in KRS 224.01 -400, into the environment. The cabinet shall provide for adequate containm ent and removal of the hazardous substances in order that the threat of a release or actual release of the substance may be abated and resultant harm to the environment minimized. The provisions of KRS 45A.695 to 45A.725 may be suspended by the cabinet if necessary to respond to an environmental emergency. (b) Provide for post -closure monitoring and maintenance of hazardous waste disposal sites upon termination of post -closure monitoring and maintenance responsibilities by persons permitted to operate the facility pursuant to this chapter. 370 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (c) Identify, investigate, classify, contain, or clean up any release, threatened release, or disposal of a hazardous substance where responsible parties are economically or otherwise unavailable to properly address the problem and the problem represents an imminent danger to the health of the citizens and the environment of the Commonwealth. (4) The cabinet shall have the authority to finance the nonfederal share of the cost for clean up of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96 -510). (5) The cabinet shall recover, when possible, actual and necessary expenditures incurred in carrying out the duties under this section. Any expenditures recovered shall be placed in the hazardous waste management fund. (6) It is the expressed purpose of this section to accomplish effective hazardous waste and toxic chemical management that results in a reduction of the generation of hazardous wastes and the release of toxic chemicals within the Commonwealth; further, it is a purpose of this chapter to allocate a portion of the cost of administering necessary governmental programs related to hazardous waste and toxic chemical management to those industries whose products are reasonably related to the generation of hazardous waste. (7) There is hereby imposed upon every person engaged within this state in the generation of hazardous waste an annual hazardous waste assessment to be determined pursuant to this section according t o the quantity by weight of hazardous waste generated, except that no assessment shall be levied against generators for any quantity of \"special wastes,\" waste oil, or spent material from air pollution control devices controlling emissions from coke manufacturing facilities. The assessment shall not be imposed upon any person for any quantities of hazardous waste generated by others for which that person is a secondary handler that stores, processes, or reclaims the waste. The assessment shall be reported a nd paid to the Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet for the generation of hazardous waste on an annual basis on January 1 of each year. The payment shall be accompanied by a report or return in a form that the cabinet may prescribe. If a federal law is enacted which accomplishes or purports to accomplish the purposes set forth in this section and which levies an assessment or tax upon any business assessed pursuant to this section, the amount of the assessment to be levied upon the business under thi s section shall be reduced by the amount of the federal assessment or tax upon the business. The reduction shall only be authorized when funds raised by the federal assessment or tax are made available to the state for any of the activities to be funded under this section. If federal moneys are available to carry out the duties imposed by subsection (3) of this section, the assessment shall cease to be levied and collected until such time as federal moneys are no longer available to the Commonwealth for the se purposes. The assessment shall be charged against generators of hazardous waste until June 30, 2016 [2008] . After this date, no further hazardous waste management assessment shall be charged against generators. The hazardous waste assessment shall be waived for any generator owing less than fifty dollars ($50) for the year. However, a return must be filed by generators to whom a payment waiver applies. (8) The assessment on generators shall be one and two -tenths cents ($0.012) per pound if the waste is l iquid, or two-tenths of a cent ($0.002) per pound if the waste is solid. (a) Hazardous waste that is injected into a permitted underground injection well shall be assessed on a dry weight basis; (b) Hazardous waste treated, detoxified, solidified, neutralized, recycled, incinerated, or disposed of on -site shall be assessed at one -half (1/2) of the appropriate rate, except for recycled waste used in the steel manufacturing process which shall be exempt; (c) Waste that is subject to regulation under Sectio n 402 or 307B of the Federal Clean Water Act shall be exempt; and (d) Emission control dust and sludge from the primary production of steel that is recycled by high temperature metals recovery or managed by stabilization of metals shall be exempt ; and (e) Waste that is delivered from the generator to an on -site or off -site industrial boiler or furnace and burned for energy recovery in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations shall be assessed at one -half (1/2) of the appropriate rate . (9) Except for waste brought into the state by a company to an affiliated manufacturing facility of the company receiving the waste, any person who transports hazardous waste into the state for land disposal or treatment which is generated outside of the state shall pay an assessment to the hazardous waste facility which first receives the waste for storage, treatment, or land disposal. The assessment rate shall be identical to the rate CHAPTER 104 371 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version described in subsection (8) of this section. The facility shall remit the as sessment to the cabinet on an annual basis on January 1 of each year. The payment shall be accompanied by a return the cabinet shall prescribe. (10) If any generator or hazardous waste facility subject to the provisions of subsection (8) or (9) of this section fails or refuses to file a return or furnish any information requested in writing by the cabinet, the cabinet may, from any information in its possession, make an estimate and issue an assessment against the generator or hazardous waste facility and add a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the assessment so determined. This penalty shall be in addition to all other applicable penalties in this chapter. (11) If any generator or hazardous waste facility subject to the provisions of subsection (8) or (9) of this section fails to make and file a return required by this chapter on or before the due date of the return or the due date as extended by the cabinet, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the cabinet, that the failure is due to reas onable cause, five percent (5%) of the assessment found to be due by the cabinet shall be added to the assessment for each thirty (30) days or fraction thereof elapsing between the due date of the return and the date on which it is filed, but the total penalty shall not exceed twenty -five percent (25%) of the assessment. (12) If the assessment imposed by this chapter, whether assessed by the cabinet, or the generator, or any installment or portion of the assessment is not paid on or before the date prescri bed for its payment, there shall be collected, as a part of the assessment, interest upon the unpaid amount at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the date prescribed for its payment until payment is actually made to the cabinet. (13) There is hereby created within the State Treasury a trust and agency fund which shall not lapse to be known as the hazardous waste management fund. The fund shall be deposited in an interest -bearing account.

Restricted Funds receipts shall be credited and allotted to the respective fund or account out of which a specified appropriation is made in this Act. All receipts of Restricted Funds shall be deposited in the State Treasury and credited to the proper account as provided in KRS Chapters 12, 42, 45, and 48.

Prior to authorizing the appropriation of any excess, unbudgeted Restricted Funds pursuant to this section, the State Budget Director and the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet shall review the adequacy of the General Fund Surplus Account with respect to its availability to support authorized expenditures from the General Fund Surplus Account, known as Necessary Government Expenses. In the event that General Fund Surplus Account moneys are determined by this review to be adequate to meet known or anticipated Necessary Government Expenses during fiscal year 2008 -2009 or fiscal year 2009 -2010, respectively, then the appropriation increase may be approved. In the event that the review indicates that there are insufficient funds available or reasonably estimated to become available to the General Fund Surplus Account to meet known or projected Necessary Government Expenses for the fiscal years enumerated above, the State Budget Director and the Secretary of the Finance an d Administration Cabinet may disapprove the request for additional Restricted Funds expenditure authority and may direct the excess Restricted Funds identified to the General Fund Surplus Account in order to meet Necessary Government Expense obligations. The results of any review shall be reported to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue in accordance by a budget unit pursuant to KRS 48.630 that relates to Restricted Funds or Federal Funds shall include documentation showing a comparative statement of revised estimated receipts by fund source and the proposed expenditures by proposed use, with the appropriated sums specified in the Budget of the Commonwealth, and statements which explain the cause, source, and use for any variances which may exist.

KRS 134.580 is amended to read as follows: (1) As used in this section, unless the context requires otherwise: (a) \"Agency\" means the agency of state government which administers the tax to be refunded or credited. (b) \"Overpayment\" or \"payment where no tax was due\" means the excess of the tax payments made over the correct tax liability determined under the terms of the applicable statute without reference to the constitutionality of the statute. (2) When money has been paid into the State Treasury in payment of any state taxes, except ad valorem taxes, whether payment was made voluntarily or involuntarily, the appropriate agency shall authorize refunds to the person who paid the tax, or to his heirs, personal representatives or assigns, of any overpayment of tax and any payment where no tax was due. When a bona fide controversy exists between the agency and the taxpayer as to the liability of the taxpayer for the payment of tax claimed to be due by the agency, the taxpayer may pay the amount claimed by the agency to be due, and if an appeal is taken by the taxpayer from the ruling of the agency within the time provided by KRS 131.340 and it is finally adjudged that the taxpayer was not liable for the payment of the tax or any part thereof, the agency shall authorize the refund or credit as the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals or courts may direct.

(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the agency to make or cause to be made any refund except within four (4) years of the date prescribed by law for the filing of a return including any extension of time for filing the return, or the date the money was paid into the State Treasury, whichever is the later, except in any case where the assessment period has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the department, the limitation contained in this subsection shall be extended accordingly. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the agency to authorize any refund to a taxpayer without demand from the taxpayer, if in the opinion of the agency the cost to the state of authorizing the refund would be greater than the amount that shou ld be refunded or credited. (6) This section shall not apply to any case in which the statute may be held unconstitutional, either in whole or in part. (7) In cases in which a statute has been held unconstitutional, taxes paid thereunder may be refunded to the extent provided by KRS 134.590, and by the statute held unconstitutional. (8) No person shall secure a refund of motor fuels tax under KRS 134.580 unless the person holds an unrevoked refund permit issued by the department before the purchase of ga soline or special fuels and that permit entitles the person to apply for a refund under KRS 138.344 to 138.355.

KRS 214.181 is amended to read as follows: (1) The General Assembly finds that the use of tests designed to reveal a condition indicative of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be a valuable tool i n protecting the public health. The General Assembly finds that knowledge of HIV status is increasingly important for all persons, since treatment using antiretroviral medications can slow disease progression, prolong and improve the lives of HIV -positive individuals, and reduce the likelihood of perinatal mother -to-child transmission [despite current scientific knowledge that zidovudine (AZT) prolongs the lives of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome victims, and may also be effective when introduced in the e arly stages of human immunodeficiency virus infection] . Many members of the public are deterred from seeking testing because they misunderstand the nature of the test or fear that test results will be disclosed without their consent. The General Assembly finds that the public health will be served by facilitating informed, voluntary, and confidential use of tests designed to detect human immunodeficiency virus infection. (2) A person who has signed a general consent form for the performance of medical proc edures and tests is not required to also sign or be presented with a specific consent form relating to medical procedures or tests to determine human immunodeficiency virus infection, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, or infection with any other causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that will be performed on the person during the time in which the general consent form is in effect. However, a general consent form shall instruct the patient that, as part of the medical procedures or tests, the patient may be tested for human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis, or any other blood -borne infectious disease if a doctor orders the test for diagnostic purposes. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5)(c) of this section, the results of a CHAPTER 150 733 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version test or procedure to determine human immunodeficiency virus infection, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, or infection with any probable causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome performed under the authorization of a gen eral consent form shall be used only for diagnostic or other purposes directly related to medical treatment. (3) In any emergency situation where informed consent of the patient cannot reasonably be obtained before providing health -care services, there is no requirement that a health -care provider obtain a previous informed consent. (4) The physician who orders the test pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section, or the attending physician, shall be responsible for informing the patient of the re sults of the test if the test results are positive for human immunodeficiency virus infection. If the tests are positive, the physician shall also be responsible for either: (a) Providing information and counseling to the patient concerning his infection or diagnosis and the known medical implications of such status or condition; or (b) Referring the patient to another appropriate professional or health -care facility for the information and counseling. (5) (a) No person in this state shall perform a test designed to identify the human immunodeficiency virus, or its antigen or antibody, without first obtaining the informed consent of the person upon whom the test is being performed, except as specified in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. (b) No test result shall be determined as positive, and no positive test result shall be revealed to any person, without corroborating or confirmatory tests being conducted. (c) 1. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure to the patient of preliminary positive results from HIV rapid tests, if results are delivered with an explanation of the following: a. The meaning of a reactive rapid test; b. The importance of confirmatory testing; and c. The importance of taking precautions to reduce the risk of infecting others while awaiting the results of confirmatory testing. 2. In special cases where immediate actions may be necessary to protect a patient, such as potential perinatal transmission or incidents warranting post -exposure pr ophylaxis, a preliminary positive result from a HIV rapid test may be disclosed to the patient and used as a basis to recommend options for prophylaxis or treatment. (d) No person who has obtained or has knowledge of a test result pursuant to this section shall disclose or be compelled to disclose the identity of any person upon whom a test is performed, or the results of the test in a manner which permits identification of the subject of the test, except to the following persons: 1. The subject of the te st or the subject's legally authorized representative; 2. Any person designated in a legally effective release of the test results executed prior to or after the test by the subject of the test or the subject's legally authorized representative; 3. A physician, nurse, or other health -care personnel who has a legitimate need to know the test result in order to provide for his protection and to provide for the patient's health and welfare; 4. Health -care providers consulting between themselves or with heal th-care facilities to determine diagnosis and treatment; 5. The cabinet, in accordance with rules for reporting and controlling the spread of disease, as otherwise provided by state law; 6. A health facility or health -care provider which procures, processes, distributes, or uses: a. A human body part from a deceased person, with respect to medical information regarding that person; or b. Semen provided prior to the effective date of this section for the purpose of artificial insemination; 734 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 7. Health fac ility staff committees, for the purposes of conducting program monitoring, program evaluation, or service reviews; 8. Authorized medical or epidemiological researchers who shall not further disclose any identifying characteristics or information; 9. A person allowed access by a court order that is issued in compliance with the following provisions: a. No court of this state shall issue an order to permit access to a test for human immunodeficiency virus performed in a medical or public health setting to any person not authorized by this section or by KRS 214.420. A court may order an individual to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus only if the person seeking the test results has demonstrated a compelling need for the test results which cannot be accommodated by other means. In assessing compelling need, the court shall weigh the need for testing and disclosure against the privacy interest of the test subject and the public interest which may be disserved by disclosure which deters blood, organ, and semen donation and future human -immunodeficiency -virus -related testing or which may lead to discrimination. This paragraph shall not apply to blood bank donor records; b. Pleadings pertaining to disclosure of test results shall substitute a pseudonym for the true name of the subject of the test. The disclosure to the parties of the subject's true name shall be communicated confidentially, in documents not filed with the court; c. Before granting any order, the court shall provide the individual whose tes t result is in question with notice and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceedings if he or she is not already a party; d. Court proceedings as to disclosure of test results shall be conducted in camera, unless the subject of the test agrees to a hearing in open court or unless the court determines that a public hearing is necessary to the public interest and the proper administration of justice; e. Upon the issuance of an order to disclose test results, the court shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure, which shall specify the persons who may have access to the information, the purposes for which the information shall be used, and appropriate prohibitions on future disclosure. No person to whom the results of a test have been disclosed shall disclose the test results to another person except as authorized by this subsection. When disclosure is made pursuant to this subsection, it shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that includes the following or subs tantially similar language: \"This information has been disclosed to you from records whose confidentiality is protected by state law. State law prohibits you from making any further disclosure of such information without the specific written consent of the person to whom such information pertains, or as otherwise permitted by state law. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose.\" An oral disclosure shall be accompanied by oral notice and follo wed by a written notice within ten (10) days. (6) (a) The Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall establish a network of voluntary human immunodeficiency virus testing programs in every county in the state. These programs shall be conducted in each public health department established under the provisions of KRS Chapter 212. Additional programs may be contracted to other private providers to the extent that finances permit and local circumstances dictate. (b) Each public health department shall have the ability to provide counseling and testing for the human immunodeficiency virus to each patient who receives services and shall offer the testing on a voluntary basis to each patient who requests the test. (c) Each public health department shall provide a program of counseling and testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection, on an anonymous or confidential basis, dependent on the patient's desire. If the testing is performed on an anonymous basis, only the statistical information relating to a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus infection shall be reported to the cabinet. If the testing is performed on a confidential basis, the name and other information specified under KRS 214.645 shall be reported to the cabinet. The cabinet shall continue to provide for anonymous testing and counseling.

Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. (7) No public health department and no other private or public facility shall be established for the primary purpose of conducting a testing program for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex, or human immunodeficiency virus status without first registering with the cabinet, complying with all oth er applicable provisions of state law, and meeting the following requirements: (a) The program shall be directed by a person who has completed an educational course approved by the cabinet in the counseling of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex, or human immunodeficiency virus infection; (b) The program shall have all medical care supervised by a physician licensed under the provisions of KRS Chapter 311; (c) The program shall have all labo ratory procedures performed in a laboratory licensed under the provisions of KRS Chapter 333; (d) Informed consent shall be required prior to testing.

He shall so examine each domestic insurer not less frequently than every three (3 ) years. Examination of a reciprocal insurer may include examination of its attorney -in-fact as to its transactions relating to the insurer.

(3) The board shall adopt administrative regulations with respect to the eligibility of p risoners for parole, the conduct of parole and parole revocation hearings and all other matters that come before it, or conditions to be imposed upon parolees.

The notice shall include the time, date, and place of the hearing provided for in this subsection, and the name and address of a person to write if the recipie nt of the notice desires to attend the hearing or to submit written comments. (6) Persons receiving notice as provided for in subsection (5) of this section may submit comments, in person or in writing, to the board upon all issues relating to the parole of the prisoner. The board shall read and consider all comments prior to making its parole decision, if they are received by the board not less than seven (7) days before the date for the hearing. The board shall retain all comments in the prisoner's perma nent Parole Board file, and shall consider them in conjunction with any subsequent parole decisions affecting the prisoner.

(2) As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply: (a) \"Clandestine methamphetamine lab\" means any inhabitable property used for the manufactu re of methamphetamine as defined by KRS 218A.1431; (b) \"Contaminated property\" means any inhabitable property that has been used to manufacture methamphetamine and has been assessed as containing methamphetamine contamination; (c) \"Decontamination standards\" means standards used to determine that a contaminated property has become decontaminated; (d) \"Inhabitable property\" means any building or structure and any related curtilage, water, water system, or sewer system used as a clandestine methamphetamine drug lab that is intended to be primarily occupied by people, including a mobile home or an individual unit of a multifamily housing unit , that may be sold, leased, or rented for any length of time. \"Inhabitable property\" shall not include a hotel, as defined in KRS 219.011; (e)[(b)] \"Surface material\" means any porous or nonporous substance common to the interior of a building or structure, including but not limited to ceilings and walls, window coverings, floor and floor coverings, counters, furniture, heating and cooling duct work, and any other surface to which inhabitants of the building or structure may be exposed; and (f)[(c)] \"Related hazardous material or hazardous waste\" means any hazardous waste as defined in this chapter or hazardous material as defined in KRS 174.405 that is related to the clandestine production of methamphetamine. (3) (a) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations providing for decontamination standards for contaminated property, including: 1. Decontamination s tandards for methamphetamine and methamphetamine precursors; 2. Decontamination standards for materials used in methamphetamine production, including related hazardous material or hazardous waste; and 3. Sampling and testing standards for contaminated properties with a tiered response system for decontamination services. (b) Absent administrative regulations described in this subsection, the decontamination standard for methamphetamine inside inhabitable property is less than or equal to one -tenth of one (0.1) microgram of methamphetamine per one hundred (100) square centimeters of surface material [, unless the cabinet promulgates an administrative regulation providing for a different standard. The cabinet may provide for other standards by administrative regulations as follows: 768 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (a) Standards for precursors to methamphetamine that are consistent with the standard for methamphetamine or standards for related hazardous material or hazardous waste; and (b) The number and locations of surface material sample s to be collected based on the circumstances of the contamination and acceptable testing methods. In the absence of an administrative regulation as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, at least three (3) samples must be collected from the surface material most likely to be contaminated at each property ]. (4) The Department of Kentucky State Police shall promulgate administrative regulations establishing assessment procedures for determining if an inhabitable property is a contaminated property . (5) Upon a determination that an inhabitable property is a contaminated property under subsection (4) of this section, the state or local law enforcement agency shall notify the cabinet of its findings and results of assessment. (6) The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations to establish a reasonable, appropriate, and protective tiered response system to address the level of decontamination services required for a contaminated property based upon the degree of methamphetamine production and the degree of potential contamination resulting from methamphetamine production as indicated by the results of assessment by responding state or local law enforcement: (a) Tier 1 shall be for a transient contaminated property where the manufacturing of methamphetamine with anhydrous ammonia was initiated but only limited amounts of reagents or precursors are present and open, and where minimal spill and staining may be observed; (b) Tier 2 shall be for a transient contaminated property where the manufact uring of methamphetamine with moderate activity or the use of red phosphorous is evident but only limited amounts of methamphetamine, reagents, or precursors were produced over a relatively short period of time, and where spills and staining may be observed; (c) Tier 3 shall be for an entrenched contaminated property where precursors and reagent production has occurred over an extended period of time, from many weeks to several months, and where spills, staining, and burn pits may be observed. This tier de signation shall be considered as the default tier designation for homes and rental property with reoccurring methamphetamine production; and (d) Tier 4 shall be for a mass production contaminated property where large quantities, such as multiple pounds, of methamphetamine, reagents, or precursors are present, and where potentially severe environmental effects may be indicated because of the large quantities of drummed or buried waste is discovered. Due to the potential for significant releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, law enforcement agencies shall consult with the cabinet prior to making this tier recommendation. (7) Any contaminated property, regardless of the initial level of methamphetamine contamination, shall meet the decontamination standard set forth in subsection (3) of this section, and regardless of the results of testing or assessment, shall require at least a Tier 1 cleanup response. A property owner shall certify to the cabinet that the property has been cleaned to the standard set forth in subsection (3) of this section. (8) (a) Only contractors certified by the [ Environmental and Public Protection] cabinet shall be authorized to conduct the decontamination services for inhabitable properties following the protocols of the tiered response system . The cabinet shall maintain a list of vendors and contractors with current certification to provide decontamination services. In order to become a certified contractor, a contractor shall: 1. Register with the cabinet; 2. Post a surety bond or obtain other financial assurance , which shall include but is not limited to a corporate guarantee, financial test -based self -insurance, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination of assurances, in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for a Tier 1, 2, or 3 cleanup and two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for a Tier 4 cleanup, which may be aggregated [five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)] ; 3. Provide a certificate issued by an insurance company licens ed to do business in Kentucky, certifying that the contractor has a public liability insurance policy in an amount deemed sufficient by the cabinet for any personal or property damages that might occur to third parties CHAPTER 161 769 Legislative Research Commission PDF Version arising from the performance of decontamination services for inhabitable properties by the contractor or his or her employees or agents; 4. Certify that decontamination will be performed safely and in accordance with 803 KAR 2:403; and 5. Certify that each cleanup conducted meets the decont amination standard required by subsection (3) of this section. (b) Any contractor who is certified by the cabinet, and whose certification is in good standing, prior to the effective date of this Act shall retain that certification without having to be recertified. (c) Upon registration, the [ Environmental and Public Protection] cabinet shall either accept or deny the contractor's certification. The cabinet may revoke the certification of any contractor for cause and may collect the forfeited financial as surance of any contractor found to be in violation of this section. Forfeited financial assurance may be used by the cabinet to decontaminate inhabitable properties. (d)[(c)] The cabinet shall [may] promulgate administrative regulations to establish standards and procedures for contractor certification and to establish reasonable fees to implement this section. (9)[(5)] When a state or local law enforcement agency investigates [becomes aware that] an inhabitable property that it has reason to believe has be en used [ has been contaminated by its use] as a clandestine methamphetamine drug lab, the state or local law enforcement agency shall, at the request of the state or local health department under its respective authority pursuant to KRS Chapter 211 or 212, post a methamphetamine contamination notice on each exterior door of the inhabitable property, except that in the case of a multifamily housing unit it shall post the notice on each entrance door to the individual unit. The Department for Public Health sh all promulgate administrative regulations establishing the notice requirements and the process for removing the notice from inhabitable properties. Any homeowner listed on the deed of the dwelling may request an administrative hearing pursuant to KRS Chapter 13B to determine whether the methamphetamine contamination notice is proper by filing a request for appeal with the Department for Public Health within thirty (30) days of the methamphetamine contamination notice having been posted on the property. The responding state or local law enforcement agency shall, within three (3) business days of when the notice is posted [ the day that it becomes aware of the contamination] , report it by fax or e -mail to the local health department. (10)[(6)] Any owner of contaminated property who leases, rents, or sells contaminated property upon which a methamphetamine contamination notice has been posted under subsection (9) of this section shall disclose in writing to any potential lessor, tenant, or buyer that the propert y is contaminated with methamphetamine and has not been decontaminated pursuant to the requirements set forth in this section. If the property has been decontaminated and released by the cabinet from the need for further action, notice under this subsection shall not be required. The Department for Public Health shall promulgate administrative regulations setting forth the disclosure requirements [Upon receipt of a fax or e -mail referring to an inhabitable property provided by a state or local law enforcemen t agency under subsection (5) of this section, a local health department shall act to protect the public from health hazards posed by methamphetamine contamination of inhabitable property. To carry out this responsibility, a local health department shall rely on its powers under KRS Chapter 212 to post a notice of methamphetamine contamination on each exterior door of the inhabitable property, except in the case of a multifamily housing unit. In that case, the local health department shall post a notice of methamphetamine contamination on each entrance door to that unit. The notice shall warn the public of the health hazards posed by the methamphetamine contamination of the inhabitable property] . (11) Once contaminated property has been decontaminated in accordance with standards set forth in subsection (3) of this section, the cabinet shall make available to owners of contaminated property who lease or rent the inhabitable property information about federal income tax deductions or credits available to comp ensate for damage done to the property in commission of a crime, including methamphetamine production done by someone other than the owner. (12)[(7)] To effect the provisions and promote the purposes of this section, the Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, and the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet shall integrate their efforts with other state agencies to provide information and training to the public about the health hazards associated with methamphetam ine laboratories. 770 ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (13)[(8)] The Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, and the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet shall pursue funds from the federal government, through grants or any other funding source, to help pay for the cost of assessment and decontamination of inhabitable properties.
