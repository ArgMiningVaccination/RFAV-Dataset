However, there is paucity of studies assessing post-vaccination side effects, especially in Africa, and thus, the need for this study. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of post-covid-19 vaccination side effects; the frequency of occurrence of each side effect and the willingness to receive the second dose of the vaccine. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among Corp members undergoing the three-week compulsory orientation course in a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp in Keffi, North-Central Nigeria. A total of 552 Corp members received the Covid-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca), 268 consented and were enrolled in the study. Data were obtained through online Google forms and were analyzed using SPSS version 26. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 25 years (SD = 2.5). The prevalence of post-covid-19 vaccination side effects was 90.7%, 95% CI (86.8 - 93.8). The most common side effects were weakness (53.5%), pain at the injection site (52.7%), and headache (52.7%). There was a weak association between the duration of symptoms and intake of medications (Cramer's V = 0.148) which was not statistically significant. About a quarter, 62 (24.0%), of the respondents who received the first dose of the vaccine, were unwilling to accept the second dose, mainly due to their fear of the side effects - 53 (85.5%). Conclusion: Our study population had a high prevalence of post-covid-19 vaccination side effects. Thus, the need to educate recipients on possible side effects and remedies.
