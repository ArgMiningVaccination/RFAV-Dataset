I've lived in this community for six years - taxpayer - I own...owning my home. It's a wonderful community. I'm totally in favor of the NBAF facility being here. I'm college educated. I know all the ramifications, consequences, details, that have been spelled out at many of the public hearing sessions which I have attended about this facility, and I continue to be in favor of it. Our community has such a diverse and wide base of knowledge in this area. It would make sense to have that facility here in Manhattan, Kansas. Take advantage of the intellectual people, the facilities that already exist that would wonderfully supplement and complement the endeavors of NBAF facility. I hope that you will choose Manhattan, Kansas as the site. It makes sense. It would be the right decision to make on behalf of all of the citizens of this country and it would benefit those globally. It's the right thing to do.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the safe operation of the NBAF. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of those accidents. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2522 From: Upper Oconee Watershe d Network Subject: UOWN Comments on NBAF James V. Johnson, Program Manager Department of Homeland Security 18-August, 2008 Dear Mr. Johnson, The Upper Oconee Watershed Network -- a 10 year old nonprofi t organization based in Athens with 186 members dedicated to protecting the Upper Oco nee Watershed -- opposes the siting of the NBAF on South Milledge Avenue in Athens, GA. This is an environmentally sensitive area that is unsuitable and inappropriate for such a large, toxic facility. Below, we list our specific comments on the EIS: 1.Erosion and sedimentation are no t adequately addressed in the EIS. There will be substantial land disturbance during construction, and we think that more rigorous analysis such as environmental simulation modeling is needed to quantify these effects in the EIS. We ask that stream restoration be required to mai ntain Oconee River water quality at its current level during and after construction, that th is be described in the EIS, and that the cost of restoration be included in a cost-benefit analysis of this site. 2.The risk of increased discharge of treated waste into our rivers needs to be analyzed in the EIS to ensure that water quality standards and criteria are not exceeded in the operation of the proposed NBAF. Treated waste can reduce the oxygen in the stream to th e point where fish are killed - this occurred twice last year in Athens below the wastewater treatment plant. The EIS must address the possible lack of water for waste dilution by: 1) providing quantitative/numerical estimates (with uncertainty b ounds) on the timing and amount of waste loads and estimated river flows; and 2) comparing these estimates to state standards/criteria to demons trate compliance. 3.We believe that there is not enough water to support this facility. EIS p. 3-35 list t wo alternatives for meeting water needs-- the EIS states that one alternative will not m eet peak needs, and that the other alternative is not recommended by Athens-Clarke Coun ty Government. The EIS must present a feasible alternative for meeting water needs. We ask that the EIS be revised to include a quantitative an d comprehensive an alysis of the proposed NBAF withdrawal within the context of the water budget an d estimated future water availability in this watershed (including a consideration of climate change scenarios), and cite relevant studies on this watershed. Also, scientific literature recognizes the adverse impact of flow alteration on fish, mussels and amphibians - the EIS must address how flow alteration due to NBAF water withdrawal and impervious surface will affect the >100 species that live downstream. 4. According to the Site Characterization Report, about 550,000 gallons of fuel will be stored on site. Assuming these fuel storage tanks are located underground, they will have to be built in bed rock. Borehole data mentioned in the Site Characterization Report reveal relatively shallow groundw ater levels in some areas. Therefore, there is a risk for groundwater contamin ation, and any such contamination will migrate to the river via fractures in the bedrock. This will be nearly impossible to clean up. This same thing is happening in adjacent areas in the State Botanical Garden of Georgia because of leaking swine lagoons, as evidenced by data collected by our organization. The EIS must quantify the risk and potential environment al impact of these fuel storage tanks.1|11.2 2|8.2; 3|12.2 3 cont.| 12.2WD0339 upper, oconee Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 11.2 DHS notes the commentor's erosion control concerns. The NBAF EIS Section 3.7.3.1 describes the affected water resources at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative including surface water, stormwater, groundwater and floodplains. The potential consequences of the proposed NBAF's construction and operation on these same water resources are described in Sections 3.7.3.2 and 3.7.3.3. Section 3.6.3.1 describes the potential 292,000 cubic yards of on site material that may be displaced and/or managed. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the water quality risk to the Middle Oconee River from increased treated wastewater discharges from the Athens-Clarke County Middle Oconee facility due to NBAF operations. An evaluation of the impact from the proposed operation of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site on the sanitary sewage infrastructure is located in Section 3.3.3 of the NBAF EIS. Based on current treatment capabilities and planned improvements, no sanitary sewage infrastructure constraints have been identified for the South Milledge Avenue Site. In addtion, an evaluation of the impact from the NBAF operation on the area's general water resources, to include surface water and groundwater, is located in Section 3.7.3 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. The NBAF EIS Section 3.3.3.3.4 describes the proposed NBAF's potential sanitary sewage at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative and the local limits for wastewater inffluents of the Middle Oconee WWTP. WWTP sewage acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements would apply to the proposed NBAF. As described in Chapter 3 Section 3.7.3.3.1, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes. Section 3.3.3.3 describes the likely boiler fuel would be natural gas; however, if No.2 fuel oil is proposed, the fuel would be stored in above ground storage tanks meeting SPCC standards. Section 3.13.4 describes the waste management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.3 and 3.7.3 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes commentor's concern that diesel fuel will be stored in underground tanks for NBAF emergency generator operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The current design of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site specifies only above-ground tanks for fuel storage. No underground tanks are included in the NBAF design.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2523 While the EIS is a substantial piece of work, we feel that several places need more rigorous and quantitative analysis in order for the site to be fairly evaluated. Such analysis is warranted for such an impo rtant, irreversible decision. We also ask that in consideration of the effects described both in the EIS and above, Table Es-3 is revised to rate effects on the \"Water\" Resource for the South Milledge Site as \"Mod erate.\" This would be consi stent with page ES- 10 where the EIS reads: \"Moderate effects that would occur would be to the follow ing resources\" under which the first bullet is POTABLE WATER. Thank you for considering our comments.

The benefits of choosing Kansas on the merits of an imal health research a nd development are well known and unequivocal. As Director of the Manhattan Regional Airport , I would also like to highlight the benefits of convenient air transportation. The Manhattan Regional Airport is located less than 9 miles (15 minutes) from the proposed building site of the NBAF. The Manhattan Regional Airport is an FAA certificated Primary commercial service airport capable of supporting all the commercial and corpora te air travel needs of staff and visitors of NBAF. We offer frequent daily service to Denver In ternational and Kansas City International airports allowing for convenient connections to and from all major domestic and international locations. In March 2008 Governor Sebelius approved legislation providing $2 Million in support of our ongoing effort to attract additional air service to another Lar ge Hub airport. This effort has received broad based support from across the State. As the airline industry navigates out of its toughest economic time in history, we are well positioned to gain additional service that will enhance the already convenient service, and provide more options to the traveling public. Once again, let me express my stro ng support for NBAF in Kansas, and my assurances that the Manhattan Regio nal Airport stands ready to support the NBAF mission. If I can answer any questions or provide additional information about our Airport's capab ility, please don't hesitate to call. Sincerely, Peter C. Van Kuren Airport Director Manhattan Reg ional Airport 5500 Fort Riley Blvd. Suite 120Manhattan, | 24.4WD0430 Van Kuren, Peter Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.

Good afternoon. My name is Dirk B. Vanderleest. I'm with the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority. I am the Chief Executive Officer and I'm here to comment on the NBAF environmental for Flora, Madison County, Jackson, Mississippi and I just want to state for the record that JMAA, that is Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, supports this facility in the metropolitan area. It would bring a tremendous amount of opportunities, not only for the local economy, but also for the airport authority itself. We embrace the opportunity to participate with this project. Thank you. 1| 24.5 Vanderleest, Dirk Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.5 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2528 VanSickle, Ronald and Linda Page 1 of 3 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.

Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's water use and source concerns and DHS acknowledges regional drought conditions. As described in the NBAF EIS Section 3.7.3.3.1, the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water approximately 0.76% of Athens 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to approximately 228 residential homes. The NBAF EIS Section 3.7.3.1.1 describes three potable water sources accessible to the South Milledge Avenue Site; the Middle Oconee River, North Oconee River, and the Jackson County Bear Creek Reservoir. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for the proposed research that would be conducted within the NBAF. Modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding an accident at the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations was evaluated in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the NBAF. RVF and foot and mouth disease SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. The potential consequences of pesticide use would be evaluated during the preparation of a site-specific response plan. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's opinion. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 8.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The impact from the proposed operation of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site on the local sanitary sewage system capacity and infrastructure is discussed in Section 3.3.7.3.4 of the NBAF EIS. The design and operation of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site would prevent negative impact to the Sewage Treatment Facility infrastructure and treatment capabilities. Specifically, as summarized in Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS, pre-treatment of liquid waste streams would be implemented as necessary to meet treatment facility acceptance criteria, therefore avoiding potential impacts. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 9.3 The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Site-specific effects at the Umstead Research Farm Site are discussed in Section 3.4.7. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Section 3.13. Air emissions were estimated using SCREEN3, a U.S.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2534 EPA dispersion modeling program. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As discussed in Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, several different technologies are being considered for carcass and pathological waste disposal. Table 3.13.2.2-4 provides a brief description and comparison of the three most likely technologies being considered (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As discussed in this section, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of these wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual site requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by-products, and operation and maintenance requirements. Because the method of carcass and pathological waste disposal has not yet been determined, Section 3.4. of the EIS (Air Quality) assumes that incineration, the treatment technology with the greatest potential to negatively impact air quality, will be used to assess the maximum adverse impact. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2535 Villaronga, Lydia Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement regarding employment. The number of short-term and permanent jobs are discussed in Chapter3, Section 3.10 of the NBAF EIS. It is expected that approximately 2,700 direct temporary jobs would result from construction of the NBAF, with many of the jobs being filled locally. Approximately 483 permanent jobs, including the initial 326 direct jobs, would result from operation of the NBAF. Permanent employees will include scientific and support staff as well as operations, maintenance and security staff. A portion of the permanent jobs at the NBAF will be filled locally and the household spending by new residents and the operations of the NBAF are expected to indirectly support additional jobs that will be filled by the local labor force. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Although the small-scall production facility to be used for vaccine production has a maximum capacity of 30 liters, no live virus would be used in the process.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2536 MD0117 1|24.1 Vinton, Daniel Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives in favor of the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2537 Wade, Brenda Lee Pettrey Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2538 Wade, Nell Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative since the site has already experienced the effects of an existing laboratory performing a similar function. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 22.5 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding mitigating an accidental release. USDA is responsible for responding to foreign animal disease outbreaks. Site specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies, that would address how an accidental release would be addressed. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.5 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The potential economic effects of an accidental release at the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative are discussed in Section 3.10.9.5 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.5 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding a release of a pathogen at the Flora Industrial Park site and the potential for wildlife (birds) to spread the released pathogen. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. By definition and as identified in Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS, BSL-4 facilities are specifically designed to safely handle exotic pathogens that pose a high risk of life threatening disease in animals and humans through the aerosol route and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. The NBAF would provide state-of- the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. A discussion of insectary operations is contained in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 and elsewhere in the NBAF EIS. Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1.1 (Biosafety Design) of the NBAF EIS, also provides a discussion of the biosafety fundamentals, goals and design criteria for the NBAF operation. In addition, information has been added to Chapter 2 regarding operations and containment of arthropod vectors. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts each of which has the potential to release a vector. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release of a vector are low. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations was evaluated in Chapter 3, Section 3.8.9 and Section 3.10.9 as well as in Section 3.14 (health and Safety) of the NBAF EIS. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. The RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. In addition, oversite of NBAF operations, asChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2539 described in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (APHIS). DHS also notes commentor's concern regarding the impact of a FMD release. The potential economic effects resulting from an accidental release of FMD is discussed in Appendix D and Chapter 3, Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF DEIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease free. DHS notes the commentor's concern that site specific operational, safety, security and emergency response plans are not included in the NBAF EIS. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The anaysis conducted in the NBAF EIS was based on conceptual design plans posted on the DHS website. More detailed design plans would be developed as the project moves into the final design phase. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific operational, safety, security and emergency protocols and plans would be developed that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans would also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns about the sustainability of funding for NBAF to ensure safe and secure operations. The U.S. Congress and the President are responsible for determining funding priorities for government programs. DHS spends funds in accordance with congressional intent. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide for safe operation and maintenance for the life of the facility. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the cost of the utility infrastructure to support the NBAF operation at the Flora Industrial Park site. Chapter 3, Section 3.3.5 of the NBAF EIS includes an assessment of the current infrastructure, a discussion of the potential effects from construction and operation of the NBAF, and the identification of any infrastructure improvements necessary toChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2540 meet design criteria and insure safe operation. Financing mechanisms for identified utility improvements or updgrades are beyond the scope of the NBAF EIS. However, while the potential costs of proposed actions are not a factor in the environmental impact analysis presented in the NBAF EIS, cost information and the scope of the cost analysis performed is summarized in Chapter 2, Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS to provide pertinent information to the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology so that he may make a more informed decision with respect to the alternatives presented in the NBAF EIS. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the impact of the NBAF operation on the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad track to the east of the Flora Industrial Park Site. A discussion of current land use, including the tracks east of the site, potential changes in land use, and the projected impacts to land use based on the construction and operation of the NBAF at the Flora Industrial Park Site is provided in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.5 of the NBAF EIS. No alterations of current land use designations and planning resulting from the proposed NBAF are anticipated. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding improvements to transportation infrastructure. An evaluation of the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Umstead Research Farm site, to include transportation infrastructure improvements, is provided in Chapter 3, Section 3.11.5 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 17.5 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the impact of the NBAF operation on the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad track to the east of the Flora Industrial Park site. A discussion of current land use, including the tracks east of the site, potential changes in land use, and the projected impacts to land use based on the construction and operation of the NBAF at the Flora Industrial Park site is provided in Section 3.2.5 of the NBAF EIS. No alterations of current land use designations and planning resulting from the proposed NBAF are anticipated. DHS also notes the commentor's concern regarding improvements to transportation infrastructure. An evaluation of the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the Flora Industrial Park site, to include transportation infrastructure improvements, is provided in Section 3.11.5 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 12.5 DHS notes the commentor's concerns. The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Section 3.13. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. The NBAF will be operated in accordance with the applicable protocols and regulations pertaining to stormwater management, erosion control, spill prevention, and waste management. Section 3.13.6 describes site specific waste management processes that would be used to control and dispose ofChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2541 NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.5 and 3.7.5 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 18.5 Section 3.13.2.2 in Chapter 3 of the NBAF EIS addresses the technologies being considered for the treatment of animal carcasses and pathological waste. In addition, Table 3.13.2.2-4 provides a brief description and comparison of the three most likely technologies being considered (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As shown on the table, all of these technologies produce non- infectious residuals. As a result, there is no need for the local wastewater treatment plant to test for or remove disease organisms. As discussed in Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of animal carcasses and pathological wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual site requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by-products, and operation and maintenance requirements. Because the method of carcass and pathological waste disposal has not yet been determined, Section 3.4. of the EIS (Air Quality) assumes that the treatment technology with the greatest potential to negatively impact air quality, incineration, will be used to assess the maximum adverse effect. Similarly, because alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest impact on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3 of the EIS (Infrastructure) assumes that alkaline hydrolysis will be used to assess the maximum sanitary sewage impacts. DHS has no plans to put facility wastewater in underground tanks. The liquid biowaste gathering and treatment system will be housed in a dedicated space below the floors of the BSL3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 areas. This space will be similar to a vault and it will provide another layer of containment that would prevent any accidental leakage or spills from leaving the facility. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2542 Wade, Nell Page 2 of 2 Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's mission is to study foreign animal, zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and emerging diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The NBAF would enable research on the transmission of these animal diseases and support development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies for foreign animal, zoonotic and emerging diseases. By proposing to construct the NBAF, DHS is following policy direction established by the Congress and the President.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2543 Walker, Eleanor Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 6.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern and acknowledges the proximity of the South Milledge Avenue Site to the State Botanical Garden. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, 80% of the site consists of pasture, and the adjacent lands consist of forested lands and small, perennial headwater streams. Approximately 30 acres of open pasture, 0.2 acres of forested habitat, and less than 0.1 acres of wetlands would be affected by the NBAF. However, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden as indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3. Only minimal indirect effects would occur from operations due to increases in light and noise. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.1 DHS notes the commentor's preference for siting the NBAF in a more isolated location such as the current Plum Island location. The NBAF EIS fully analyzes the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.1 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The potential biological and economic effects of a pathogen release from the NBAF are included in Appendix D and Sections 3.8.9 and 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, respectively. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites. As noted in Appendix D and Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. The mainland sites have similar economic consequences regardless of the livestock populations in the region. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the impact of the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site on the area's potable water infrastructure and general water resources. An evaluation of the impact from the proposed operation of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative on the potable water supply and infrastructure is located in Section 3.3.3 of the NBAF EIS. Based on planned improvements to comply with NBAF design criteria, no potable water infrastructure constraints have been identified for the South Milledge Avenue Site. In addtion, an evaluation of the impact from the NBAF operation on the area's general water resources, to include surface water and groundwater, is located in Section 3.7.3 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and DHS acknowledges the drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1, the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water approximately 0.76% of Athens 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to 228 residential home's annual potable waterChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2544 usage. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2545 Walker, Garland and Jean Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the human health and safety of the surrounding special- needs residents. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan and individual facility plans regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF, and which would include stipulations for all special-needs populations. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.3 See response to Comment No. 1. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Section 3.13.2.2 in Chapter 3 of the NBAF EIS addresses the technologies being considered for the treatment of animal carcasses and pathological waste. In addition, Table 3.13.2.2-4 provides a brief description and comparison of the three most likely technologies being considered (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As discussed in this section, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of these wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual site requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by- products, and operation and maintenance requirements. As discussed in Section 3.13.8.3, sanitary wastewater from the NBAF would have to meet South Granville Water and Sewer Authority (SGWASA) acceptance criteria. These criteria do not allow infectious wastes to be discharged to the SGWASA. The NBAF would be operated to meet all applicable discharge requirements imposed by SGWASA; however, consideration of SGWASA's historical compliance record is not within the scope of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 23.0 See response to Comment No. 3. In addition, DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans would also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. DHS notes the commenter's concern for security of the NBAF. Regardless of location, the NBAF would have the levels of protection and control required by applicable DHSChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2546 security directives. A Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only) was prepared that evaluated site-specific security issues and will be considered in the decision making process on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where.

Johnson U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Science and Technology DirectorateMail Stop #2100; 245 Murray Lane, SW Building 410Washington, DC 20528 Dear Mr. Johnson: Thank you very much for the opportunity under the aegis of NEPA to comment on your proposed NBAF facility as outlined in your \"Draft Environmental Impact Statement June 2008 for the US Department of Homeland Security National Bio andAgro-Defense Facility\" . I enjoyed meeting many of you at the Public forum here in Athens. Thank you for listening to us, and I hope you will continue to do so in regard to the proposed NBAF lab in Athens, Georgia. As a concerned scientist and professor of students at the University of Georgia, I am against such a facility being built in the Athens-Clarke County community, and I hope my evaluation of your DEIS will support my statement! My comments pertain tothe proposed location of the facility adjacent to the Middle Oconee River, University of Georgia property, in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. I realize that my job may be in danger if I speak against such a facility; Dr. David Lee holds a considerable amount of power at the University, including allowing ordisallowing applying for grants, allocation of grant money and lab space, and otherresearch endeavors that are our livelihood as professors. Dr. Arnett Mace, as well, can also affect how much I teach, whether I can still have graduate students, etc. However, asI am an American citizen who, as a daughter of a Marine and a granddaugher of a Marinewho fought in WWI and WWII, I hope, I am still protected by the right of free speechwhich they so valiantly fought for. As way of background on me, I worked for a short time as an environmental consultant for Tetra Tech and for five years as a benthic laboratory manager or benthicinvertebrate biologist for an Environmental Consulting firm that prepared EIS statements concerning marine systems off the coast of California. I am now a professor of Geologywho is also co-staffed in Marine Sciences at the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia. I want to thank you again for allowing us to comment on this report, and I hope that my comments help improve your DEIS document. I also hope to show you that theAthens citing is not a good choice for you r proposed BSL3/BSL4/ASBL-4 facility and that a smarter alternative is either not build the facility and continue to useCanada/Australia's facilities; or, locate the proposed NBAF site on an island or in alocation as remote as possible for containment reasons. But, Athens is not an appropriatechoice as I hope to demonstrate to you. I hope I did not make too many errors or havemisrepresented you, as I could not read every detail of this report given the time I had.1|25.2 2|5.0WD0674 Walker, Sally Page 2 of 14 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. DHS notes the commentor's statement. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the Expression of Interest.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2550 Walker, Sally Page 3 of 14 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. All materials used in analysis and preparation of the NBAF EIS will be included in the Administrative Record. In addition, DHS made available on its website (www.dhs.gov/nbaf), on or about August 11, 2008, the key supporting documents which are expected to assist the DHS decision maker in making a final decision about NBAF. These documents include the Site Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study, and other documents. It is DHS' opinion that adequate time was provided to review the supporting documents. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's question. Information regarding local contributions were redacted from the document. DHS notes the commentor's statement. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the no action and site alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 23 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance. Consultation wirh the NRCS regarding Prime and Unique Farmlands at the South Milledge Avenue Site is complete and is located in Appendix G. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding possible impact to the area's water resources. The NBAF will be operated in accordance with the applicable protocols and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials handling, spill prevention, and hazardous waste management. The NBAF EIS Section 3.13.4 describes the Waste Management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.3 and 3.7.3 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Section 3.3.3.4 describes the Middle Oconee WWTP's sewage acceptance criteria that the NBAF would have to meet. DHS acknowledges the regional drought conditions. DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns andChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2551 DHS acknowledges the drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1, the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water approximately 0.76% of Athens 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to 228 residential home's annual potable water usage. Section 3.7.3.1.1 describes the potential potable water sources, the Middle and North Oconee Rivers and the Jackson County Bear Creek Reservoir. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential effects on aquatic species and water quality at the South Milledge Avenue Site. Table 3.8.3.1.3-1 in the NBAF EIS provides a list of fish species that have been collected from the Middle Oconee River. As described in Section 3.8.3.2.2, impacts to a headwater stream would impact aquatic resources within a 50-foot reach. However, a properly designed road crossing would have little or no adverse effect on downstream aquatic resources. The impacted stream, which extends into the fenced pasture, has been severely impacted by loss of buffering vegetation and erosion and sedimentation. If the final design plan does not avoid stream impacts, DHS would consider restoration of the unaffected stream segments as mitigation for the impacts. As described in Section 3.8.3.2.3, best management practices and requirements for a stormwater pollution prevention plan would mitigate potential erosion and sedimentation impacts during the construction process. The NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for minor adverse impacts on aquatic communities due to direct stream impacts, stormwater runoff, pollutant transport, and erosion and sedimentation. However, as described in Section 3.8.3.3.1, best management practices and low impact design (LID) features would be used to minimize the potential for such impacts. Preliminary LID measures that are being considered include pervious pavement in both parking lots and pedestrian walkways, capturing and using roof runoff for landscape watering, and grading parking lots to filter storm water through landscaped areas. As described in Section 3.3.3.1.4, sewage acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements would apply to the wastewater discharged from the proposed NBAF. The Athens-Clarke County Sewer Use Ordinance of 2007 provides limits on specific pollutant discharges to the Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility. The NBAF would be designed and operated as necessary to comply with Athens-Clarke County Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility criteria and avoid the discharge of potentially harmful wastewater constituents. Implementation of approved erosion control measures, utilization of LID storm water pollution prevention measures, and compliance with wastewater treatment standards would prevent significant impacts on downstream aquatic communities; including macroinvertebrates, amphibians and fish.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2552 Obviously, a large part of the site is a wetland adjacent to the Middle Oconee River, and this is not adequately addressed. Additionally, the extensive driveways and parking lots, without any mitigation facilities such as rain gardens and the ilk, can further damage the fragile Middle Oconee River thathas over 90 species of macroinvertebrates, the base of the food chain for birds, mammals,and many other vertebrates in the area. This \"parkinglot\" effect has not been modeled as toits impacts on the nearby watershed. Therefore, the public does not know the full extent ofthe environmental damage to our watershed of this proposed facility. 1. Executive Summary 1.0: \"The United States needs to update and expand its facilities to study the range of foreign animal diseases that are potential threats to United States (U.S.) agriculture.\" \"Today, expansion is taking place within the federal sector as well. There are seven new federal fac ilities r ecently built, currently under construction, or planned, which have one or more BSL-4 laboratories. There are also BSL-4 laboratories at universitiesand in the private sector. While the number of BSL facilities is difficult to quantify ,m a n y more BSL-3 laboratories exist compared with BSL-4 labs (GAO 2007). \" My comments :There are now over 1500 labs studying new and old animal diseases, including zoonotic diseases in the United States (GAO 2007). Our taxpayer money has funded approximately 50 billion dollars of such labs in the United States (Bush administration budget: Operation BioShield; but started during the Clinton administration). While the EIS does cite the GAO 2007 report,they fail to mention the reason for such a report: the GAO revealed a deep security threat in that not one federal agency knows how many, where, and what these high containment facilities are doing ; oversight of such labs is missing . That's the problem: if an intentional leak, as in the Anthrax problem. occurs or an accidental leak, wouldn't it be difficult to pinpoint the problem? Rectify the situation? The public is notinformed of these types of risks. This EIS does not justify why we need yet another lab to do the samething that these other labs are doing, but with an added, more dangerous facility never before built on themainland U.S. (a BSL4/BSL3/ABSL-4 lab) with no conflict-of-interest free oversight agency of such afacility. UGA, Merial, are not conflict-of-interest free entities, nor is the Georgia Alliance or the MedicalCollege of Georgia. As taxpayers, we need a conflict-of-interest free entity to protect us. This EIS statement does add that the most dangerous diseases known to humans and other animals (e.g. Hendra, Nipah) will be studied in a new BSL3Ag-BSL-4 combined facility that no US labs now have, tobe relocated in a highly urbanized, congested area of the United States next to farms with economically-important livestock, located within a few thousand feet of the Oconee Watershed area that flows into theseventh most endangered river in the United States, and close to a University with over 32,000 studentsthat live or commute and drink the water from the Oconee River watershed area. Even if a small leakoccurs, the economic impacts of such an event have not been adequately modeled. This is a majoroversight of the EIS statement for the proposed NBAF facility, and also a major oversight by our state andlocal Government. 2. Executive Summary 1.0: \"T he Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), where much of the current research on foreign animal diseases is performed, is an essential component ofthe national strategy for protecting U.S. agriculture from a bioterrorist attack involving theintentional introduction of viruses such as foot and mouth disease. However, PIADC wasbuilt in the 1950s and is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The NBAF would fu lfill the need for a secure U.S. facility that could s upport collaborative efforts among researchers from federal and state agencies and academia.\" My comment: Almost every University that can afford it are studying animal diseases in the U.S., many funded since 2001 by Operation BioShield. Have we gained anything from this?No answers are provided in the EIS statement. The only bioterrorism event that occurred inthe US was the Anthrax Event, killing five people, cultures of which came from the the U.S.Government's military biodefense base at Ft. Detrick. Currently, there are over 100 labs withAnthrax in them, is that safe? I don't know. I expect that millions, if not billions of tax-5Cont.|12.2 6|21.2 7|27.0WD0674 Walker, Sally Page 4 of 14 Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the safe operation of the NBAF. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of those accidents. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. DHS notes the commentor's question regarding oversight of NBAF operations. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the small-scale vaccine and reagent production laboratory (current good manufacturing practice or cGMP module is part of the NBAF). Under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, the USDA/APHIS, Veterinary Service's Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible to license all veterinary biologics (vaccines, antisera, bacterins, and diagnostic reagents and test kits). The cGMP module would support the development and eventual licensure of vaccines and anti-viral therapies discovered at NBAF and would operate in accordance with cGMPs described in U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Parts 210/211/600 and 610). The cGMP module would have the ability to develop up to 30 liters of vaccine; however, it should be noted that no live FMD virus vaccines would be developed in this facility, only recombinant or inactive virus fragments would be used. Since the cGMP facility would be housed within the main NBAF building and no live FMD virus would be used for vaccine production, the type of incident that occurred at the Pirbright facility inChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2553 the United Kingdom would not occur. NBAF research studies would provide consistent/reproducible data on products and processes of biological countermeasures, which would allow technology transfer to industry partners/contract manufacturers (not in the NBAF) for scale-up and commercial product manufacturing. The industry/manufacturer would be selected using an open competition. DHS notes the commentor's statement. The risk assessment and methodology described in Appendix E and Section 3.14 represents a reasonable, conservative, and well-thought approach to determine hazards associated with potential accidental releases. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. DHS notes the commentor's views and opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS show that even though the Plum Island Site has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. The lower potential effect is due both to the water barrier around the island and the lack of livestock and susceptible wildlife species. As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control andChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2554 Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 27.0 DHS notes statement. suggestion. Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS describes other alternatives considered including using existing laboratories. However, this was dismissed from further study because no other facility exists in the United States capable of conducting the research to satisfy the USDA and DHS missions. DHS notes the commentor's preference for siting the NBAF in a more isolated location such as the current Plum Island location. The NBAF EIS fully analyzes the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2555 payer money was used to figure out which U.S. taxpayer funded lab the Anthrax came from in the last 7 years. The question is: is another lab justified? I say, use existing Australia andCanada facilities for the most dangerous pathogens, and continue with the current upgrade toPlum Island. But keep NBAF off the mainland U.S. Further, congressional inquiry into the safety of the Plum Island facility found many egregious errors, miscommunications or lack of communication between DHS and thesubcommittee analyzing the safety of Plum Island. DHS denies those accusations accordingto the people I talked too at the Public meeting, but they have yet provided me with theinformation to counteract the GAO and Congressmen Dingell's findings, which are notdiscussed in this document, although many other comments from those reports are. 3. Executive summary 1.0: \"Agriculture is the largest industry and employer in the United States, generating more than $1 trillion in economic activity annually, including more than $50 billion in exports. U.S. agriculture is threatened by the entry of foreign pests andpathogens that could harm the economy, environment, plant and animal health, and publichealth3. A key component of this economy is the livestock industry, which contributes over$100 b illion annually to the gross domestic product4. Diseases affecting livestock could have significant impacts on the U.S. economy and consumer confidence in the food supply\" It is for that reason that Congress passed an act in the 1950's restricting labs that study such diseases to islands. Tagged on to the recent Farm Bill, DHS was able to get around that long-standing Congressional Code, to allow the DHS to build such a dangerous facility on themainland U.S. I, as a US Taxpayer, am appalled that the DHS wishes to risk putting aBSL3Ag/BSL4/ASBL4 lab right in the middle of livestock, students, and our river that gives usour drinking water. Based on human pathogen BSL4 labs like the CDC, there is a \"mild tomoderate\" risk that dangerous pathogens can get out, in which case, as per the DHSstatement, we stand to lose much more money than the NBAF will ever bring in, if it does.The risk for a BSL3Ag/BSL4 facility has not been modeled in this EIS report, because no lab BSL3Ag/4/ASBL4 lab exists. Therefore, we do not know the risk of such a facility. But, given the Pirbright lab incidence, just with Foot and Mouth disease (a BSL3 disease), theuntold slaughter of livestock and the economic damage was great. Can Athens-Clarke Countyafford that? I don't think so if we are worried about shutting off streetlights to save money. 4. Executive Summary 1.0 :\"The NBAF research mission would be based on current pathogen and disease risk assessments, subject to change as threats and risk assessmentschange.\" My comments: Does this statement mean that NBAF could turn into a bioweapons lab, as Plum Island has been, in the event of a major terrorist attack? Hopefully not, as they dohave a statement in the DEIS saying they are required by law not to be a bioweapons plant.Does this mean that we'll never know the pathogens that NBAF will study because ofNational Security? In the event of an accident, how will the citizens and students of Athens-Clarke County be protected? Informed? Reimbursed for economic hardship? If a studentbecomes infected in the BSL 3 labs, will the public be notified? Current oversight, accordingto the CDC and congressional reports is lacking for high-level biosafety labs in the UnitedStates. The EIS does not discuss any of these issues, because they are assuming (based on littleevidence) that this lab is safe, so therefore we don't have to think of any scenarios. We needto think of the worst case scenarios and model them (and not all of the worst case scenarioswere modeled in this report, such as explosion of the underground fuel tanks, leaks from suchtanks, a large airplane hitting the proposed site, etc.). 5. Executive Summary 1.0: \"The proposed NBAF would consist of two laboratory facilities and four outbuildings. One of the two laboratory buildings would be the primary research7Cont.|27.0 6Cont.|21.2 8|2.0WD0674 Walker, Sally Page 5 of 14 Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. DHS notes the commentor's question regarding oversight of NBAF operations. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2556 building containing the BSL-2, BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 laboratories with associated support spaces. The other building would be a laboratory for small-scale vaccineand reagent production.\" My comments : What is scale vaccine and reagent production\" building? How much? What type of vaccines? The Merial plant associated with the Pirbright labs in England had aleak of Foot and Mouth disease, with bad consequences for farmers and citizens in Englandwhere this took place. We have a Merial plant here in Athens, it generates vaccines. Willthe DHS work with them? The consequences of a leak from the NBAF vaccine facility or aMerial plant in associated with such a facility are not modeled in this EIS report. 6.Executive Summary 1.0: \"It would either be operated directly by the government or operated by a contractor with strict government oversight.\" My comments: Currently, there is no one agency that has oversight of the high-level biosafety labs recently built in the US through Operation BioShield or other federal, state orprivate mandate. What is the agency that will provide oversight? Is it fair to say that thereis no conflict of interest here? The current problem recognized by the CDC in relation tothe University of Texas incident shows that institutions are not into protecting even theirown students. Rather, they are more interested in protecting their money source. This is amajor problem, and I'd rather spend my taxpayer dollars protecting citizens rather thanbuilding more biolabs until we know that there is an unbiased oversight agency charged withprotecting the public. Contracting out, too, was one of Pirbright's problems, because not alllabs are fully funded to maintain the facilities. None of these issues are touched on in thecurrent EIS statement. 7.Executive Summary 1.0: \"Once the NBAF reaches its life expectancy, DHS may choose to decommission the facility and transition the property for future use. St andard decontamination protocols would be performed according to the Biosafety inMicrobiological and Biomedical Laboratories to ensure the health and safety of the workersand the public.\" My comments: I'd like to know what the \"site-specific protocols\" are for the proposed NBAF Athens site because it is in an ecologically-sensitive area adjacent to our drinking watersource, the Middle Oconee River. This issue of \"decontamination of the site\" is notaddressed. Also, are we guaranteed these that these protocols will be used if anothercontractor takes over the facility? These issues are not addressed in the EIS document. 8.Executive Summary 1.0: \"a federal steering committee recommended sites to the DHS selection authority... Some sites were eliminated from further consideration due to weaknesses and/or deficiencies, including the following: Lack of proximity to existing BSL- 3 or BSL-4 research programs that could be linked to NBAF mission requirements; Difficulty in demonstrating ability to attract world-class researchers and scientists or skilled technical workforce with necessary experience; Insufficient infrastructure, utilities, or other siting difficulties; and Insufficient community support.\" My comments : first, world-class researchers have been leaving UGA in droves because of the lack of support for their endeavors, especially since 2001 (eg., cancer researchers,pharmeceutical researchers, biological and ecological researchers, etc.).

Comment No: 9 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the small-scale vaccine and reagent production laboratory (current good manufacturing practice or cGMP module is part of the NBAF). Under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, the USDA/APHIS, Veterinary Service's Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible to license all veterinary biologics (vaccines, antisera, bacterins, and diagnostic reagents and test kits). The cGMP module would support the development and eventual licensure of vaccines and anti-viral therapies discovered at NBAF and would operate in accordance with cGMPs described in U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Parts 210/211/600 and 610). The cGMP module would have the ability to develop up to 30 liters of vaccine; however, it should be noted that no live FMD virus vaccines would be developed in this facility, only recombinant or inactive virus fragments would be used. Since the cGMP facility would be housed within the main NBAF building and no live FMD virus would be used for vaccine production, the type of incident that occurred at the Pirbright facility in the United Kingdom would not occur. NBAF research studies would provide consistent/reproducible data on products and processes of biological countermeasures, which would allow technology transfer to industry partners/contract manufacturers (not in the NBAF) for scale-up and commercial product manufacturing. The industry/manufacturer would be selected using an open competition. DHS notes the commentor's concern about the Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities Department's ability to treat NBAF Wastewater. Section 3.3.3 of the NBAF EIS addresses both the current sewage system capacity and infrastructure and the sewage system improvements required to handle NBAF discharges. The NBAF would be designed and operated as necessary to prevent negative impact to the Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities sewage treatment capabilities resulting from flow rate or potentially harmful wastewater constituents. Specifically, as summarized in Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS, pre-treatment of liquid waste streams would be implemented as necessary to meet treatment facility acceptance criteria, therefore avoiding potential impacts. DHS notes commentor's concern that diesel fuel will be stored in underground tanks for NBAF emergency generator operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The current design concept of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site specifies only above-ground tanks for fuel storage. No underground tanks are included in the NBAF design. DHS notes commentor's concern that fuel oil will be stored in underground tanks for NBAF emergency generator operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The current design of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site specifies only above-ground tanks for fuel storage. NoChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2557 underground tanks are included in the NBAF design. Section 2.2.2.5 Pollution and Spill Prevention, identifies the control and countermeasure requirements and plans required for the operation of fuel oil storage tanks at the South Milledge Avenue site and include a Pollution Prevention Plan, a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan and a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. Implementation of all plans will prevent impact to surface water and groundwater resources. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the estimated usage of potable water and generation of wastewater from the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue site. Section 3.3.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS estimates the total annual water consumption at 43,000,000 gallons per year. Section 3.3.3.3.4 of the NBAF EIS estimates the annual wastewater volume at 26,500,000 gallons per year. DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding possible impact to the area's water resources. The information cited by the commentor from Appendix E, Section E.3.4.5 was inaccurate and has been removed from the NBAF Final EIS. The NBAF will be operated in accordance with the applicable protocols and regulations pertaining to stormwater management, spill prevention, and waste management. The NBAF EIS Section 3.13.1 describes the methodology applied to Waste Management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3 and 3.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 10 Issue Code: 23.0 Resource-specific mitigation measures are identified in the NBAF EIS and summarized in Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS. The mitigation measures described in this section would be adapted, as appropriate. Should a decision be made to build the NBAF, all practicable means to avoid or minimize potential adverse effect from the selected alternative would be incorporated into the design of the NBAF. Further, the Record of Decision would identify any required mitigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs that would be necessary to offset any environmental impacts associated with the NBAF. DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the effects of construction on bedrock in the area. The NBAF EIS Section 3.6.3 describes the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative's soil and geological conditions and Section 3.6.3.2 describes potential construction consequences. A detailed geotechnical report will be prepared for the selected site and will be used in the NBAF's final design specifications including subsurface rock strata and construction implications. The proposed NBAF developed footprint will reduce the allowable area for groundwater recharge, however preliminary design parameters such as pervious pavement and stormwater reuse will minimize the effect. DHS notes the commenter's concern for security of the NBAF. Regardless of location, the NBAF would have the levels of protection and control required by applicable DHS security directives. AChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2558 Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only) was prepared that evaluated site- specific security issues and will be considered in the decision making process on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. Security would be provided by a series of fencing, security cameras, and protocols. In addition, a dedicated security force would be present on-site. Additional security could be provided via cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2559 have less than five students) so that graduate students have no classes to take in some science departments. Therefore, I would argue that UGA is a poor choice for your proposed labbecause the \"skilled technical workforce\" will not be there for you; it is not going to turnaround, because this has been going on since 2001, and we are down more than 600 facultymembers and counting. You can read President Adam's letter outlining the budget cuts to ourchancellor if you don't believe what I say (available online). Second, the citing of the proposed NBAF facility is in the Oconee Watershed region, is a major problem. Somebody wasn't doing their homework when they suggested this area toyou, and I'll comment on that later. And lastly, the community has not been adequately informed of this facility (although DHS has posted notices, I am not faulting you at all), that is: UGA has not informed itsfaculty, staff, or students of the pros- and cons- of such a facility; the local government alsohas not informed its citizens of the pros-and cons of such a facility; the local paper has, upuntil a few days ago, tamped down on any opposition to speak up about the \"cons\" of such afacility, in fact, calling anyone who raises issues about water or safety a \"protestor\" or\"ranter\". And, at the Public DHS meeting on Thursday night, the Dale Cordley presenterskipped the \"Risk\" slide and thereby did not inform the public of the \"cons\" of such a site.He couldn't even list the pathogens when asked by a member of the audience. All these itemsare a disservice to the citizens of Athens, Oconee County and the workers/students whoattend UGA. Please take these issues in mind, as it is clear that the community here has notbeen informed about the issues in an unbiased manner. A few people have pushed thisinitiative and the majority of the public has been kept out of the loop, including myself.

Executive Summary: \"...South Milledge Avenue Site... closer to surface waters, so the potential for effects are greater... Runoff from the construction site has the potential to entersurface or groundwater sources, but storm water management during construction wouldminimize the potential for this to occur. Similar effects could occur with operation of theNBAF... Strict compliance with storm water pollution prevention plans and spillmanagement protocols would minimize the potential and mitigate the potential effects of a spill.\" \" Cumulative Effects .There would be minor cumulative effects to air quality, water supply, wastewater treatment capacity, and traffic with some of the site alternatives. Water use at the South Milledge Avenue Site ... would contribute to regional water use during thecurrent drought conditions, although there are few large regional d evelopment projects planned for the near future.\" Water is the most fundamental issue not fully addressed in the EIS report for Athens. Water provides for the beauty and ecology of our area, as well as our drinking water, sewage dilution, recreation, and functioning of our city. Athens is cited within theOconee watershed region, a region that drains into the Altamaha River, one of the seventhmost endangered rivers, not to mention its species, in the U.S. From NBAF siting report, part of DEIS released on 25 July 2008: \"Water: Dual water service is required to the site with a minimum delivery pressure of 35 psi. Water consumption ranges between 50,000 and 275,000 gallons per day with a peakflow rate of 657 GPM. The maximum value includes cooling tower make-up water forpeak cooling days during the summer months and is less other times of the year.The estimated total annual water consumption is 43,000,000 gallons.\" The estimated amount is more than Athens-Clarke County can give you, even in a good year.

The statement in the 25 July report contradicts the Executive summary amounts. We are in a massive drought year, and things are not lookingbetter. \"Discharge to the sanitary system ranges between 50,000 and 150,000 gallons per day with an annual estimated discharge of 26,500,000 gallons. If a tissue digester isutilized for carcass disposal a small percentage of the effluent stream would have thefollowing composition. BOD (mg/L) 10,250 COD (mg/L) 19,600 Suspended pH 9.48 It is anticipated that a dilution level acceptable to the local sewer districtwould be achieved based on the total effluent discharge from the facility. This would beconfirmed as part of the detailed design phase.\" This amount of discharge will overload our already overloaded system. We need a new wastewater facility plant, but none is on the horizon. NBAF will not help matters any in thisregard, and this could be a major biohazard problem. The lack of water based on extremedrought conditions in this area does not provide enough water to \"mix\" the wastewatercoming from the proposed NBAF facility. This is one of the most fundamental issuesprecluding the safe operation of such a facility in Athens. Why you haven't been informedof this is very worrisome. 1 0 .G a s ,f u e lo i l :1.6 million gallons of fuel oil to run Plum Island , not known for Athens. Are there underground storage facilities planned to store this fuel? How will it get to theproposed NBAF plant, and what are the safeguards this fuel will not leak into the surroundingbedrock or surface wetlands that flow directly into the Middle Oconee River? This is notdiscussed in the EIS statement. Appendix these factors been modeled appropriately? The risks are low according to the DEIS, however, they do occur, and when they happen, what will ensue? This needs to be modeled,not that the likelihood is low that these events will happen. Figure e.4.2.1-1 shows thatearthquakes are relatively common in the area, unlike Texas. Therefore, the risk is muchhigher than the DEIS has modeled. Siting document, 25 July 2008: \"Natural Gas: The CUP should be provided with a 10 PSI natural gas supply to meet the installed natural gas burning equipment firm capacity of 133,500 CFH.Fuel Oil: Multiple fuel oil tanks serving the boilers and generators with a total capacity of 550,000 gallons are required...\" These tanks would most likely be located underground, adjacent to a wetland, and near the Middle Oconee River. Leaks from such tanks have not been modeled in the DEIS, nor theeffect of an earthquake or conflagration on such facilities. 11.

Therefore, I do notsee that air quality is \"not likely to be affected.\" 12. Noise .\"Noise effects would be similar for all sites, although residential or recreational receptors near the South Milledge Avenue Site ... may be more likely to be affected.\" Construction, running generators and boilers can potentially cause a lot of noise. Definitely the South Milledge site will be more affected than any other site because of itswildlands/pasture/wetlands/forest location. I agree with this statement. 13. Sewer run between 25 million and 30 million gallons of treated wastewater per year. Based on the 25 July 2008 siting document the proposed facility could potentially run almost 300 million gallons of water through it a day, isn't this a low estimate for our sewage systemsthat is posted in the Executive summary? 14. Geology and soils. Not addressed, focus on excavation of soils (\"Temporary effects to soils...due to site clearing... ), but the Athens site is located on bedrock, indicating extensive and expensive blasting would ensue in bedrock, not soils, to build the facility, causing majornoise level problems, enhanced air quality problems, increased siltation into the MiddleOconee River, and destruction and/or modification of wetlands without any mitigationmentioned; in addition, fracturing of such bedrock to allow water to flow through it,potentially allowing for more sources of non-point pollutants. \"It is not anticipated that prime or unique farmlands would be affected, although coordination with the NRCS is not complete\" The proposed Athens siting is within farmland on the UGA campus, the fact that an EIS for farmland/pastureland/wetland was not done is un acceptable; the public has not been informed. Up to 520,000 square foot structure to be built in this area...15. Biological Resources .\"The clearing would remove approximately 30 acres of vegetation, although all of the sites have been previously disturbed to some degree. Wetlands would be affected at the South Milledge Avenue Site from road and utility crossings (less than 0.5 acres), and approximately 0.2 acres of forested uplands would be lost. Threatened orendangered species, aquatic resources, and wildlife would not be directly affected byconstruction or normal operations at any site. An accidental release of pathogens from theNBAF would adversely affect selected wildlife populations\" None of these statements have been addressed in the body of the EIS document as per EPA guidelines for NEPA ( 1999 on NEPA website: EPA Considering environmental monitoring for EIS statements) . Deforesting 30 acres of vegetation located adjacent to the Middle Oconee River would have deleterious affects on stream ecology where over 90 species ofmacroinvertebrates reside (Grubaugh and Wallace, 1995, Limnol. and O ceanogr. 40: 490- 501). These macroinvertebrates provide the major food source directly or indirectly formammals including humans, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fish, and other invertebrates in thisregion. Further, the Middle Oconee River is where Athens draws most of its drinking water.11|9.2 12|10.2 9Cont.|8.2 13|11.2; 10Cont.|23.2;12Cont.|10.2;11Cont.|9.2 14|26.2 14Cont.|26.2;15|13.2;2Cont.|12.2WD0674 Walker, 14 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 10.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the effects of construction on bedrock in the area.

The current design does not include use of groundwater resources; however, a basement structure could alter on-site goundwater flow patterns. Any facility infrastructure located in the basement area would be contained in the event of a spill or leak. Comment No: 14 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the no action and site alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. Comment No: 15 Issue Code: 13.2Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2563 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential effects on the Middle Oconee River adjacent to the South Milledge Avenue Site. As indicated in Section 3.8.3.2, the NBAF would affect primarily pasture areas consisting of non-native cultivated forage grasses. The forested portion of the South Milledge Avenue Site along the Oconee River is a high value riparian buffer; however, impacts to the forested area would be minor (0.2 acre), and these impacts would occur within the existing pasture fence-line in areas that have been disturbed by grazing. The high value forested riparian buffer would be preserved, and would continue to provide an effective buffer for the Middle Oconee River. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2564 The EIS has not addressed the impact of removal of 30 acres of riparian and woodlands that are now protecting part of the Middle Oconee watershed region, in terms of providing water,filtering such water, and reducing siltation to the river. An \"accidental release of pathogens\"and its effects on this watershed system has not been addressed. 16. Cultural Resources. \"No effects to cultural resources are expected to occur with construction or operation of the NBAF at any site. Consultation with state and federallyrecognized Native American Indian tribes has been initiated.\" How can they find \"no effects\" when they haven't even inquired if there are cultural artifacts on this site? Because the Middle Oconee River is an archaeologically-important river, humanstend to live on rivers, it stands to reason that they could be altering an archaeological site.The fact that such a study was not done is a breach of the pubic trust in the federalgovernment, and since UGA is government land, the public has a right to know. 17. Socioeconomics :Operation of the NBAF would result in 250 to 350 direct jobs and an estimated income of between $26.8 million and $30.4 million annually. \"Losses could beparticularly severe in states where animal and crop production is concentrated. Forexample, Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota produce 53% of the total U.S. swineproduction (GAO 2005a).\" If foot and mouth disease is accidentally or intentionally released from this facility, it is estimated by the EIS that it would cost GA 300 million dollars in lost revenue and other factors. What NBAF will potentially make pales in comparision to what Athens-Clarke County could lose (and the state of GA), not to mention the town of Watkinsville. We already know that most of the direct jobs will go to the Plum Island scientists and staff, sowhat will Athens be gaining to help the impoverished people? Not very much. UGA,however, would gain a lot, but only a few select groups of people. Also, if an outbreak occurshere, North Carolina will also be shut down. What will be the collateral costs be? We don'tknow, as they aren't in this report. The FMDV outbreak at the high-level biocontainmentlabs at Pirbright in 2007 show that the collateral costs are great, but the full amount has notbeen tallied as of yet. 18.Existing Hazardous, Toxic, and Radiological Waste. The proposed Athens site has not been evaluated for the existence of hazardous waste, etc. It was recently f ound that the State Botanical Garden had repositories of hazardous wastes, so why hasn't the proposed NBAF sitebeen evaluated as well? If the construction will take place in a watershed area of the MiddleOconee River, this would be important to know. This is a grave oversight, and needs to beundertaken. 19. Waste management. \"Construction would generate construction debris, sanitary solid waste, and wastewater. Operation of the NBAF would result in generation of wastewater, waste solids, and medical, hazardous, and industrial solid wastes.\" \" Another FMD outbreakoccurred in Surrey, England, in August 2007. An epidemiological investigation reportconcluded that the live virus release was most likely from the drainage system...It is believedthat the virus was carried offsite...Estimates of direct costs for a FMD outbreak in the U.S.similar to the United Kingdom outbreak run as high as $24 billion, with the destruction ofabout 13 million animals. Even a single case of the disease would cause our tradingpartners to ban imports of live animals and animal products from the U.S. and could resultin losses of between $6 billion and $10 billion per year while the country eradicated thedisease and regained disease-free status (GAO 2003).\" One leak would cost Athens-Clarke County in lost UGA football revenue, students, tourism, and jobs that it would not recover unless massive federal funds were given to supplant this lost2Cont.|12.2 16|14.2 17|15.2; 18|18.2 7Cont.|21.2WD0674 Walker, Sally Page 10 of 14 Comment No: 16 Issue Code: 14.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Historic Preservation Division has determined that no historic or cultural resources would be affected by the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site and compliance of the provisions under Section 106 has been completed and compliance with the consultation provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act has been achieved. A copy of the agency correspondence is provided in Appendix G of this NBAF Final EIS. Comment No: 17 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible economic effect would be significant for all sites. The potential economic effects including those from an accidental release are discussed in Appendix D and Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease free. Comment No: 18 Issue Code: 18.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern about existing hazardous waste contamination. Section 3.12 of the NBAF addresses existing hazardous, toxic, or radiological waste contamination at all of the candidate NBAF sites. The methodology used to prepare the section is presented in Section 3.12.1 and information for the South Milledge Avenue Site is in Section 3.12.3. Based on the information provided by the Phase I environmental site assessments performed for the South Milledge Avenue Site, DHS concluded in Section 3.12.3.2 that \"no construction or operational impacts are anticipated due to existing hazardous, toxic, or radiological waste contamination.\" Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2565 income. These losses have not been figured into the current EIS document. Even England had to stop their soccer, rugby matches, and even postponed a national election because of a footand mouth outbreak in 2001. 20. Health and safety.A.)\"The results indicate that for all sites the risk was none to low for all accident scenarios except an over-pressure fire , where an explosion would occur due to the buildup of a large amount of gas or flammable chemical in an enclosed area. The risk for an over- pressure fireaccident was moderate for all sites. For all sites except the Plum Island Site, the overall riskrank was moderate due to the potential easy spread of a disease through livestock or wildlife.The risk rank for the Plum Island Site was low or none due to the low likelihood of anydisease getting off of the island\" \"In addition to BSL-4, the NBAF would have animalbiosafety level-4 (ABSL-4) in which special biocontainment features are used to conductresearch involving high-consequence livestock pathogens in large animal species.

As a result, the collected data have necessarily been incomplete (Schell 2006;CDC and NIH 1999). Also, it has been suggested that these reports might under-represent thetrue number of LAI because they do not account for subclinical (asymptomatic) infections.Collection of accurate data regarding LAI continues to be \"hampered by an indifference toand, frequently, an unwillingness to report these incidents\" in part \"due to fear of reprisaland the stigma associated with such events\" (Harding and Byers 2000; Harding and Byers2006).\" There is no oversight of the proposed NBAF facility, which is a very real risk, affecting students and citizens of Athens-Clarke County. Given the lack of self-policing as discussed bythe DEIS (see above quote), this is one of the most dangerous problems. The Harvard Crimson in 2007 had this to say about a a Boston University biosafety infringement: \"addition to concerns a bout the facility itself, Boston City Counc illor Charles H. \"Chuck\" Turner '62 said at the meeting that he lacked confidence in BU's safety procedures. Turner referred to a2004 incident in which three BU researchers fell ill after unknowingly handling a contaminated strain of the bacteria tularemia. However, according to the Boston Globe, BU officials did not report the illnesses to the Boston Public Health Commission until 28 days after DNA analyses revealed the strains under study had been contaminated. The Globe also revealed that BU failed to update its proposal for a BSL-4 lab , which claimed that BU labs had experienced no \"laboratory-acquired infections\" in more than 10 years, after the infections had been discovered.\" B.) The DEIS Appendix B (June 2008) outlines that incidents are \"decreasing\", it is not convincing given the previous sentence saying that such incidents are unde r-reported. Further, the GAO has detailed many lapses at the Plum Island site, but these are not discussed in the DEIS. Please document those lapses in lab safety from the Plum Island facility and why the GAOhad to investigate the lab. C.) It is clear from the EIS statement that the safest place for such a facility housing a BSL3Ag/BSL4 lab is either on an island or a remote desert somewhere far away from people,livestock, out of prevailing winds and watersheds that provide drinking water. Even PlumIsland is too close to the mainland for such a proposed facility. Risks involving a BSL-4/ABSL-4 lab were not modeled for this report, and thus, the public has no way of knowingwhat the risks really are. If such a leak occurred, intentionally or accidentally, from any ofthe labs that have been built since 2001, including the proposed mainland citing of NBAF,this is of greater risk because the pathogens will be here, right in downtown Athens.

Appendix B includes a comprehensive list of incidents that have occurred in the U.S. and worldwide and includes the incidents at Plum Island. This information was used to help determine the types of accidents and consequences that were used in the risk assessment found in Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2566 the reasons given for the Anthrax scare is that the scientist was worried about funding; the Anthrax scare allegedly gave this person lots of funding. Human error and maintenanceproblems are the chief causes of leaks at high-level biosafety labs. D.)DEISappendixE-70:\"Underproperlaboratoryprocedures,thelikelihoodofaworker inhalingorotherwisebecomingexposed(e.g.,throughcutsintheskinoringestion)toaninfectiousagentshould below.\" This is an unsupported statement, please explain why this is, when most lab incidents that I am aware of are caused this way (including needle/knife pricks). E.) DEIS appendix p. E-70: \"Workerswouldreceiveannualphysicalexaminationsand consultationaboutbiologicalworkhazards,andrecommendedvaccineswouldbeadministeredbythemedicalstaff.\" The DEIS outlines that almost all the diseases to be studied at the NBAF facility have no vaccines or cures; this is a misleading statement suggesting to the public that this facility isabsolutely safe for medical personnel and others working there. Please modify this statementto remind people that there are no vaccines for most of these diseases. F.) DEIS appendix E 3.4.2: \"FMDVandNipahvirusarenotconsideredashavinga biologicalvectortransmission\". Any animal can be a biological vector, not just ticks, etc. According to the CDC: \"The natural reservoir for Hendra virus is thought to be flying foxes (bats of the genus Pteropus ) found in Australia. The natural reservoir for Nipah virus is still under investigation, but preliminary data suggest that bats of the genus Pteropus are also the reservoirs for Nipah virus in Malaysia\". Bats are biological vectors of transmission for Nipah. If animals aren't vectors, then what is an infectious disease? The DEIS statement is misleading to the public as to the true nature of transmission of these serious, fatal diseases. Later, in appendix E, there is this animal is a vector, but this is buried in the Appendix section where most of the public won't read it. I welcome this statement, but it is contradicted in earlier statements. Please tellthe public that vectors can be any animal, including humans, which is why this facility is verydangerous if located within highly populated areas with students, farm animals, and wildlifenext to a river. G.) DEIS appendix E 3.4.4: \" Humidity greater than 60% and temperatures less than 80oF have been shown to be the most favorable conditions (Garner 1995). (for viral transmission) Georgia is just perfect for this scenario, which makes citing NBAF in Athens not a good choice.

Although the statement is accurate, it has been modified accordingly. Comment No: 21 Issue Code: 17.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. However, as the commentor states, bats of the genus Pteropus are considered \"reservoirs\" for the Nipah virus, which is transmitted via body fluids and close-contact aerosol means. Foot and mouth disease virus is transmitted via aerosol and not through a vector such as a mosquito or tick. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2567 infect a host, and these can be carried for very long distances by aerosol in our windy city. The DEIS models only model escape of pathogens using the Gaussian Plume Model; are there other ways that aerosols can escape the proposed facility, via fomites or withinrespiratory tracks of workers? That hasn't dechlorination(forenvironmentaldischarges),waterreusesystem,effluentholdingponds,andsludgedryingbeds. Itisanticipatedthattherewouldbeminimaleffectsfromwater-bornetransmission.\" It appears that the NBAF facility will have holding ponds and sludge-drying beds: where would these be located ? They are not on the facility plans. Will these be in the open air? Underground? How safe are they? Also, to ap r io r i say that these would have \"minimal effects\" biases your data outcome. I.)

This is not good for the public. J.) Appendix E, E 4.0: \"assumingthatthereareontheorderofhundredsof opportunitiestomishandlepathogensinagivenyearperperson,thisyieldsontheorderof6/g110 5opportunitiesperemployee-year.\" Isn't this a very high rate to encounter and potentially infect a lab worker/employee with pathogens? Or, did I misread this passage? K.)AppendixE.4.3.1,onlysmallaircraftweremodeled in terms of external accidents to the facility and potential release of pathogens. What about large aircraft? It is assumed that sucha small crash would burn up the pathogens, but the Pentagon wasn't completely destroyedduring 9/11, and if so, how would the proposed NBAF fac ility stand up to such a horrible attack? This was not modeled, and given that the media has suggested that such a facilitycould be the siting of a terrorist attack, it should be modeled for our public knowledge andsafety. L.) I appreciate that the DEIS modeled three of the worst-case scenarios using FMDV, Nipah, and African Rift Fever. Based on the table, p. E-165, Georgia appears to be like all the other sites (except Plum Island), which is entirely suspect given that it is in a very different climate zone and potentialvectors/hazards compared to the other sites (except perhaps North Carolina). If all the dataresults are the same, there is something wrong with the model or the model was not runproperly. M.) Site security. Site security is not really mentioned; how will the site be secured? What types of security clearance do people have to have to work on such a facility? How long dothose clearances take (one fellow said at the Public meeting it took him a year to gainclearance). More worrisome is why two pages of \"site security\" are blacked out on the NBAFsiting 25 2008.3Cont.|25.2 23|8.2 22|21.0 22|21.0 22|21.0 10Cont.|23.0WD0674 Walker, Sally No: 22 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. The section of Appendix E cited by the commentor explains how the number of animals and staff that could be handling or exposed to pathogens were estimated. This information was used to determine the number of opportunities to mishandle pathogens for the operational accident scenarios. The assumptions used in calculating the number of employees provided a conservative number of employees as not to underestimate the number of opportunities. The NBAF Feasibility Study does not have the same amount of information with regard to items like freezer rooms, break rooms, or changing rooms for the BSL-4 laboratory because these items are not included in the BSL-4 laboratory. There is actually much information and detail on the BSL-4 laboratory in the Feasibility Study. DHS notes the commentor's statement. The risk assessment and methodology described in Appendix E and Section 3.14 represents a reasonable, conservative, and well-thought approach to determine hazards associated with potential accidental releases. DHS Notes the commentor's question. Level of difficulty associated with weaponization of the pathogen refers to the process of going from acquisition of a pathogen to the ability to use it to infect suseptible species. Comment No: 22 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's question. The complete text in the paragraph states, \"Thus, given roughly 600 employees handling pathogens in a facility operating a nominal 2,000 hours per year (50 weeks per year at 40 hours per week) and assuming that there are on the order of hundreds of opportunities to mishandle pathogens in a given year per person, this yields on the order of 6\u00d7105 opportunities per employee-year. Controls such as proper training, qualification, procedure use, PPE use, and quality assurance, to name just a few, significantly mitigate (reduce the frequency of human errors) the number accidents that actually happen given this high number of opportunities that exists. Comment No: 23 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. All pathogenic wastes will be sterilized prior to being discharged into the municipal sewage treatment systems, but no holding ponds or sludge-drying beds are anticipated with the final design of the NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2568 21. Environmental justice . This is not discussed in the proposal, although it is listed in Table ES-3. \"The priorities assigned to the pathogens identified in these recommendations (FMD, Nipah and Hendra viruses, and emerging pathogens) were based on the following criteria: Economic impacts; Virulence and potential for pathogen spread; Morbidity or lethality of disease; Likelihood that pathogens will spread to other species; Ability of terrorists to naturally acquire or otherwise manufacture a particular pathogen; and Level of difficulty associated with weaponization of the pathogen.\" What does \"Level of difficulty associated with weaponization of the pathogen\" mean? Please explain. Finally, if Plum Island is closed, where does this facility get relocated? \"North American FMD Antigen Bank [located at Plum Island]. This bank stores concentrated FMD antigen that can be formulated into a vaccine if an FMD introduction occurs. The bank is owned by Canada,Mexico, and the United States. FADDL employees are responsible for safety and potency testing of new lots of antigen and periodic quality testing of stored antigen. \" Thank you! Please do not bring NBAF to Athens.22|21.0 23|5.1WD0674 Walker, Sally Page 14 of 14 Comment No: 23 Issue Code: 5.1 DHS notes the commentor's question. At this time, no change in the status of the North American FMD Antigen Bank is indicated. However, if the NBAF is constructed and PIADC is closed, PIADC assets would be assigned to appropriate facilities. The North American FMD Antigen Bank would likely be transferred to the NBAF due to its connection with FMD research to be conducted at the NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2569 Wallace, Blake Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.5 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Flora Industrial Park Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2570 Wallace, Peggy Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2571 Walters, John Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2572 Warner, Janet Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site, Texas Research Park Site, and Manhattan Campus Site Alternatives due to their location near livestock. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.0 The NBAF would be designed and constructed using modern biocontainment technologies, and operated by trained staff and security personnel to ensure the maximum level of worker and public safety and least risk to the environment in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.0 The potential effects to livestock-related industries is discussed in Section 3.10. As noted in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D, the major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites The mainland sites have similar economic consequences regardless of the livestock populations in the region.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2573 Waters, John C and Charlotte Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative in favor of the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.1 See response to Comment No: 1. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's views on risk. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, would enable the NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. DHS cannot guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident; however, the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extremely low. The economic impact of an accidental release, including the impact on the livestock-related industries, is presented in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a potential ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and acknowledges regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is expected to be approximately 0.76% of Athens 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes' annual potable water usage. Section 3.7.3.1.1 describes the 3 onsite surface water stream segment features including the adjacent Middle Oconee River. Sections 3.7.3.2 and 3.7.3.3 describe the potential construction and operational consequences including standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 13.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding negative environmental impacts of siting the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1, DHS notes the commentor's concern and acknowledges the proximity of the South Milledge Avenue Site to the State Botanical Garden. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, 80% of the site consists of pasture, and the adjacent lands consist of forested lands and small, perennial headwater streams. Approximately 30 acres of open pasture, 0.2 acres of forested habitat, and less than 0.1 acres of wetlands would be affected by the NBAF. However, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden as indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3. Further, itChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2574 has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF.
