When living with persistent pain, it is important to recognise its impact on various aspects of your life as well as the factors that can contribute to your experience of pain. It may be that you have tried a number of different interventional treatments with the aim of reducing or controlling pain, with varying degrees of success. However, there is a large body of evidence to show that by developing a better understanding of pain, and utilising a variety of physical and psychological strategies, that pain can have less of an impact on your life. Our services include: - Pain education days: Often the first appointment for all patients referred for pain management physiotherapy, psychology or a pain management programme. During this 2-hour, group appointment, you will hear presentations regarding the nature of persistent pain and the types of services we offer. You will then have the opportunity to opt in for one-to-one assessment. - One-to-one assessment: This individual appointment gives you the opportunity to sit down with a physiotherapist and a psychologist to discuss your pain problem. We will then decide together what the most appropriate service for you is. - Pain Management Programmes (PMPs): These are group programmes, facilitated by a physiotherapist and psychologist, where patients are invited to attend once a week for a number of consecutive weeks. Pain management programmes aim to teach participants a range of physical and psychological strategies to better manage their pain and reduce its impact on their everyday life. - Autogenic Training Programme: This programme is designed for people who have particular difficulties sleeping. Autogenic Training is a deep relaxation technique that can help to rebalance the impact of stress and can applied to everyday life, independently and on demand. - Mindfulness Programme: This programme combines mindfulness meditation with cognitive therapy (a talking therapy that helps you look at your thoughts and behaviours). It aims to help you to develop effective ways to manage the difficult thoughts and feelings that can come with living with pain.
