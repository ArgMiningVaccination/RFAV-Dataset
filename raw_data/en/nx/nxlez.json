Monitor Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative Revised: 22 September 2021 10 management. Information is not yet available about potential long- term sequelae. The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/clinical - considerations/myocarditis.html ). Syncope may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine.

Store between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F). Discard any unused vaccine 6 hours after dilution. Revised: 22 September 2021 21 PREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF PFIZER -BIONTECH COVID -19 VACCINE Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single -use antiseptic swab, and withdraw 0.3 mL of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine preferentially using low dead- volume syringes and/or needles . Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Administer immediately. 2.2 Administration Information Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The vaccine will be an off -white suspension. During the visual inspection, verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL. confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed. do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter. Administer the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine intramuscularly. After dilution , vials of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Low dead -volume syringes and/or needle s can be used to extract six doses from a single vial . If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 m L of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 m L, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. 2.3 Vaccination Schedule Primary Series : The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a primary series of two doses (0.3 mL each) three weeks apart in individuals 12 years of age and older . A third dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine (0.3 mL) at least 28 days following the second dose is authorized for administration to individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. Revised: 22 September 2021 22 Booster Dose: A single Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine booster dose (0.3 mL) may be administered intramuscularly at least 6 months after completing the primary series to individuals : 65 years of age and older 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID -19 18 through 64 years of age whose frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS -CoV -2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID- 19 including severe COVID -19 The FDA -approved COMIRNATY EUA -authorized Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID -19 vaccination series.5 There are no data available on the interchangeability of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY (COVID -19 Vaccine, mRNA) with other authorized COVID -19 vaccines . 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine is a suspension for injection. After preparation, a single dose is 0.3 mL [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine [see Description (13)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Monitor Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical -considerations/managing -anaphylaxis.html ). 5.2 increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among females and old er males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long- term sequelae. The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/clinical -considerations/myocarditis.html ). 5 The licensed vaccine has the same formulation as the EUA -authorized vaccine and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns . The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness . Revised: 22 September 2021 23 5.3 Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. 5.4 Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine . 5.5 Limitation of Effectiveness The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. 6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multi syste m Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID -19 following vaccination with the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine . 6 To the extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to Pfizer Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS and Pfizer Inc. In clinical studies of participants 16 years of age and older , adverse reactions following administration of the primary series included pain at the injection site ( 84.1%), fatigue (1.1%), malaise (0.5%) , and lymphadenopathy (0.3%). In a clinical study in adolescents 12 t hrough 15 years of age , adverse reactions following administration of the primary series included pain at the injection site (90.5 %), fatigue (77.5%), headache (75.5%), chills (49.2%), muscle pain (42.2%), fever (24.3%), joint pain (20.2%), injection site swelling (9.2%), site redness (8.6%), lymphadenopathy (0.8%), and nausea (0.4%) . In a clinical study of participants 18 through 55 years of age, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (10%) following administration of a booster dose were pain at the injection site (83 .0%), fatigue (63.7%), headache (48.4%), muscle pain (39.1%), chills (29.1%), and joint pain (25.3%). Severe allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. 6 Vaccin ation providers administering COMIRNATY (COVID- 19 Vaccine, mRNA) must adhere to the same reporting requirements. Revised: 22 September 2021 24 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Primary Series The safety of the primary series Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162 -01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, two- part, dose -escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants , 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase 1/2/3, multicenter, multinational, placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose vaccine candidate- selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/ 3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants , 12 years of age or older . Of these, approximately 43,448 participants (21,720 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine ; 21,728 placebo) in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 adolescents are 12 t hrough 15 years of age (1,131 and 1 ,129 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) . In Study 2, all participants 12 to <16 years of age, and participants 16 years of age and older in the reactogenicity subset, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medic ation after each vaccination in an electronic diary . Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination ]. Tables 1 through 6 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine and placebo . Participants 16 Years of Age and Older At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 (18,801 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 18,785 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older had been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years and older enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and et hnicity among participants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine or placebo , 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White , 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0% were Hispanic/Latino , 4.3% were Asian , and 0.5 % were American Indian /Alaska N ative. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Across both age groups , 18 through 55 years of age and 56 years and older , the mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.3 days (range 1 to 34 days) for participants in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine group. Solicited r eactogenicity data in 16 and 17 year -old participants are limited .

From an independent report ( Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covi d-19 vaccine in solid -organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med) , in 99 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas) 97\u00b18 months previously who received a third Revised: 22 September 2021 29 vaccine dose, the adverse event profile was similar to that after the second dose and no grade 3 or grade 4 events were reported in recipients who were followed for one month following post Dose 3. Unsolic ited Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 t hrough 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo ( Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851 ), serious a dverse e vents from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients . In a similar analysis , in participants 56 years of age and older ( Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine = 7,960, placebo = 7,934), s erious a dverse e vents were reported by 0.8 % of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 V accine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine or placebo , respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow -up af ter Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available inf ormation is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro- inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Non- Serious Adverse Events In Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 t hrough 55 years of age received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non- serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine, non- serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of partic ipants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow -up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non- serious adverse events among P fizer-BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was pr imarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, r eports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 V accine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow -up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (parti cipant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro- inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. Revised: 22 September 2021 30 Adolescents 12 T hrough 15 Years of Age In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of March 13, 2021 , 2,260 adolescents (1,131 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine; 1 ,129 placebo) were 12 t hrough 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 (660 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 648 placebo) adolescents have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among adolescents who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the adolescents who received the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female, 85.9 % were White , 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino 6.4% were Asian , and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska N ative. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 1 was 2.4 days (range 1 to 10 days), for redness 2.4 days (range 1 to 16 days), and for swelling 1.9 days (range 1 to 5 days) for adolescents in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group.

Unsolic ited Adverse Events In the following analys es of Study 2 in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo) , 98.3% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow -up af ter Dose 2 . Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a c ausal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine . Non- Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported by 5.8% of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy plausibly related to the study intervention were imbalanced, with notably more cases in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine group (7) vs. t he placebo group (1). There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non -serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Booster Dose A subset of Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 through 55 years of age received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after completing the primary series . Additionally, a total of 23 Study 2 Phase 1 participants (11 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 12 participants 65 through 85 years of age) received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Revised: 22 September 2021 33 Vaccine approximately 8 months (range 7.9 to 8.8 months) after completing the primary series. Safety monitoring after the booster dose was the same as that in the reactogenicity subset who received the primary series. Among the 306 Phase 2/3 participants , the median age was 42 years (range 19 through 55 year s of age), 45.8% were male and 54.2% were female, 81.4% were White, 27.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 9.2% were Black or African American, 5.2% were Asian, and 0.7% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Among the 12 Phase 1 participants 65 through 85 years of age, the median age was 69 years (range 65 through 75 years of age), 6 were male and all were White and Not Hispanic/Latino. Following the booster dose, the median follow -up time was 2.6 months (range 2.1 to 2.9 months) for Phase 1 participants and 2.6 months (range 1.1 to 2.8 months) for Phase 2/3 participants. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Table 7 and Table 8 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine for Phase 2/3 participants 18 through 55 years of age . In participants who received a booster dose, the mean duration of pain at the injection site after the booster dose was 2.6 days (range 1 to 8 days), for redness 2.2 days (range 1 to 15 days), and for swelling 2.2 days (range 1 to 8 days) .

No participant in this age group reported a severe systemic event or fever after the booster dose. Unsolicited Adverse Events Overall , the 306 participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2.6 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (June 17, 2021) . In an analysis of all unsolicited adverse events reported following the booster dose, through 1 month after the booster dose, in participants 1 8 through 55 years of age (N = 306) , those assessed as adverse reactions not already captured by solicited local and systemic reactions were lymphadenopathy ( n = 16, 5.2% ), nausea ( n = 2, 0.7% ), decreased appetite ( n = 1, 0.3%) , rash (n = 1, 0.3%), and pain in extremity (n = 1, 0.3%) . Serious A dverse Events Of the 306 participants who received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine , there were no serious adverse events reported from the booster dose through 30 days after the booster dose. One participant reported a serious adverse event 61 days after the booster dose that was assessed as unrelated to vaccination. Revised: 22 September 2021 36 6.2 Post Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.

Revised: 22 September 2021 38 11 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 11.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study , 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of nucleoside -modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No vaccine -related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development , or postnatal development were reported in the study. 11.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 11.3 Pediatric Use Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age is based on safety and effectiveness data in this age group and in adults . Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than 12 years of age. 11.4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine include participants 65 years of age and older who received the primary series and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1) and Clinical T rial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18.1) ]. Of the total number of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine (N= 20,033), 21.4% (n= 4,294 ) were 65 years of age and older and 4.3% (n= 860) were 75 years of age and older . The safety of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on safety data in 12 booster dose recipients 65 through 85 years of age and 306 booster dose recipients 18 through 55 years of age in Study 2. Th e effectiveness of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on effectiveness data in 306 booster dose recipients 18 through 55 years of age in Study 2. 11.5 Use in Immunocompromised From an independent report ( Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid- 19 vaccine in solid -organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med) , safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the Revised: 22 September 2021 39 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine have been evaluated in persons that received solid organ transplants. The administration of a third dose of vaccine appears to be only moderately effective in increasing potentially protective antibody titers . Patients should still be counselled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID- 19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated as appropriate for their health status . 13 DESCRIPTION The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine is supplied a s a frozen suspension in multiple dose vials; each vial must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use to form the vaccine. Each dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine contains 30 mcg of a nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS -CoV -2. Each dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine also includes the following ingredients: cholesterol), 0.01 mg potassium chloride, 0.01 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.36 mg sodium chloride, 0.07 mg dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and 6 The diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP ) contributes an additional 2.16 mg sodium chloride per dose. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine does not contain preservative . The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. 14 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 14.1 Mechanism of Action The modRNA in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SAR S-CoV -2 S antigen . The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen , which protect s against COVID -19. 18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA 18.1 Efficacy of Primary Series in Participants 16 Years of Age and Older Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo- controlled, observer -blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate -selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older . Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older , with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56- year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring si gnificant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the P hase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days . Particip ants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months , for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19. Revised: 22 September 2021 40 The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older ( 18,242 in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 days after the second dose.
