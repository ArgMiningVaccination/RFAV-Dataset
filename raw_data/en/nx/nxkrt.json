So I believe it's perfectly normal to live around the corner from a shoe store that doubles as an art gallery and exhibits oil paintings alongside the Dansko clogs. I blithely walk my first grader to school past storefronts with signs that say ''traditional Thai massage,'' ''mineral makeup'' and ''Angel of Healing.'' It did not even surprise me, after a swarm of stinging insects took over the sidewalk, to see the city's response: a sawhorse with a blinking light that warned against disturbing the honeybees' hive. But sometimes the local culture still manages to sneak up on me. At a recent annual physical exam, I was waiting under the usual paper drape and flipping through back issues of celebrity gossip magazines when the internist sailed into the room. Nothing about her appearance -- the customary white lab coat, sensible shoes and cheery smile of a person preparing to palpate -- seemed unusual. Then she looked at me, dug into a coat pocket and said, ''Stick out your tongue and your wrist.'' The next thing I knew she was squirting a glass dropper of a concoction called Bach's Rescue Remedy under my tongue and dabbing lavender oil on my wrist. She told me to swallow and sniff. ''Do you feel more relaxed now?'' she asked. Curiously, yes. I love California. Sure, I was vaguely aware even before I moved here of the existence of such so-called natural approaches to health care. You can buy them nationwide, after all. But it wasn't until I stumbled out of the doctor's office, clutching a prescription on which was written ''2 drops lavender oil on pillowcase to prevent insomnia,'' that I felt the urge to look up words like ''aromatherapy'' and ''homeopathy.'' On my way home, I stopped at one of the many local natural-organic-unprocessed-straight-from-the-earth stores to stock up. Shelf after shelf had an amazing array, from little vials of ''essential oils'' to ''dilutions'' and ''hydrosols.'' Prices were all over the map. In haste, I grabbed a tiny bottle identical to my doctor's. In the checkout aisle I realized I had a lot to learn. ''That will be $23.95,'' the checker said. Nothing arouses my curiosity like sticker shock. So I rushed home to investigate on the Internet the universe of natural therapies that have been in use for centuries. My first stop was the National Institutes of Health's site at www.nih.gov, where I learned that aromatherapy (the use of fragrant substances to improve mood or health) is a complementary treatment used in conjunction with conventional medical approaches. But homeopathic treatments (which rely on remedies that encourage rather than suppress symptoms like, say, a cough, in an effort to speed the body's attempts to heal itself) are an alternative approach. Clinical trials are under way at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, but for now the upshot is this: if you follow the directions on the packages, the products aren't considered harmful. Next I visited homeopathic.org and abchomeopathy.com, which defined oodles of terms. At aromaweb.com were profiles of 90 ''essential'' oils produced by plants, as well as information on 15 ''carrier'' oils (like avocado and hazelnut) that you can use for blends, a list of 23 hazardous oils to avoid and a Profile of the Day that taught me more than I ever dreamed possible about rosemary oil. (Color: clear. Constituency: thin. Common method of extraction: steam distilled.) After hours of sniffing at the lavender on my wrist, I was starting to fantasize about branching out and amassing a wide collection of little bottles to cure all my imbalances -- or at least to look and smell nice on the bathroom shelf. Shopping for aromatherapy products, I started at simplers.com, which sells more than 100 kinds of ''essential'' oils distilled from volatile plant oils that evaporate. There I found treatments for acne (bergamot), cellulite and fatigue (grapefruit), and even joint pain (wild scotch). Prices varied, from $5.55 for 5 milliliters of spearmint essential oil to $51.53 for 1 milliliter of white rose oil. ''Rose petals are too fragile to distill,'' said Jim Williams, co-owner of Simplers Botanical Company. ''When you're making essential oil, it takes a lot of plant material, about 4,000 rose petals, to get the exact ratio.'' In general, products that cost less are more likely to be diluted, Mr. Williams said. At aromatherapyoutlet.com, which sells essential oils in three sizes (5, 10 and 30 millileters), there was a wide range of lavenders to choose from: Bulgarian-grown lavender, Spanish lavender spike, even French lavender grown at a high altitude. Product descriptions carried helpful warnings for some oils like cinnamon (may cause skin irritation) and clove (a powerful skin irritant). Turning my attention to ingestion, at bachessences.com I learned that Rescue Remedy was part of a system of 38 ''flower essences'' that people have been squirting under their tongues since the 1930's to manage emotions ranging from fear to despair. The essences, discovered by a British physician named Nelson Bach, are brewed like sun tea, said Nancy Buono, the North American coordinator for the Bach education program. ''You take a bowl of flowers, float them in the sun, then drain out the plant material and what's left can be diluted to make flower essences,'' she said. Unlike aromatherapy products, Bach's essences have no scent. ''They work on an energetic level, like music,'' Ms. Buono said. Plus you can give them to pets. Seriously. What started as a word-of-mouth trend among owners of out-of-sorts dogs and cats has grown into such a popular use of the products that the company now prints a brochure on pet usage. Back to humans. At the site, a 20-milliliter bottle of Rescue Remedy (a blend of five flower essences marketed as a natural stress reliever) costs $15.95. The product is also available at cvs.com ($16.69) and at drugstore.com ($15.99). By this time, I could not resist the lure of Bach's online Remedy Chooser. After I pointed and clicked my way through lists of such mood imbalances as ''feel self-absorbed,'' ''have feelings of extreme jealousy'' and ''live in the past,'' the Remedy Chooser suggested that I buy several flower essences -- including hornbeam, centaury, chicory, beech and rock water -- and place two drops of each into a mixing bottle with distilled water, then take four drops, four times a day. ''What do you think of my blend?'' I asked Ms. Buono. ''Interesting,'' she said cautiously. ''What does it tell you about me?'' I asked. ''Interesting,'' she said. ''I see,'' I said. ''Will it cure me?'' ''Cure is not a word I would use,'' she said. ''It would put you back into balance.'' Where I live, we know exactly what "}
