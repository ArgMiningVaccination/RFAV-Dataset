Calculus is simple: Non-Maleficence (Do No Harm) + Beneficence (Do Good) yields Utility & Value for You, the Individual. TMS has nearly zero side effects and helps to stabilize important brain regions. Therefore, TMS is helpful for a variety of diagnoses - not just depression, as many are led to believe. Stated differently, TMS helps the brain to learn new information. So if you're currently in therapy, TMS can complement your efforts. To borrow a term from Economics, TMS is likely to enhance your \"marginal utility\" from Psychotherapy.

Stimulant medications such as Adderall and Ritalin work by altering levels of neurotransmitters in the brain; higher levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are known to improve attention and focus. Therapy works by helping people with ADHD understand the condition, discuss their areas of difficulty, and develop behavioral strategies to manage their symptoms. In some cases, modifying one's diet and exercise can also help improve symptoms. Are there specific medications for ADHD?

There are two categories of used as an alternative if stimulants aren't effective or viable for a particular patient. How long does treatment for ADHD take?

It may take time to identify the right medication and dosage, but the medication itself is fast-acting. In terms of therapy, it takes time to develop skills and put them into practice, but you will likely see improvements within a few weeks or months. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
