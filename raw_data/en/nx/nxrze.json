Adding water therapy into your life can help relax both body and mind, leading to less stress overall. The soothing effect of flowing water promotes calmness. Even a 20-minute bath will lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with increased stress and anxiety. Lifts Your Spirit Being in water can release endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.

It's no surprise that artists flock to the oceans, lakes or rivers to seek inspiration for their work. Connects You with Nature. In water environments, it's easy to let go of the hustle and bustle of everyday life and focus on the beauty of nature instead. Immersion in or even observing water can also remind you of the interconnectedness of all things and how we are all a part of the natural world. Best Ways to Enjoy Water Therapy Here are some of the best ways to use water therapy: Hot Tub Experience If you're looking to add water therapy to your life but don't have a pool or hot tub, there are other options. You can try visiting a local spa or gym where water treatments are available, or even just taking a long bath home (see below).

Natural Bodies of Water There's something about the sound of waves crashing against the shore, or waterfalls cascading down rocks, that can instantly calm and relax us. There are many different ways to soak in the beauty of water: - Spend time by the ocean: The movement of waves is incredibly soothing and almost immediately reduces stress levels. Take a walk along the beach, go for a swim, or simply sit and relax while taking in the natural beauty and nourishing salt air - Visit a lake or river: Fresh water can be equally therapeutic, and often creates a more intimate experience than the sea. Spend some time fishing, canoeing, or kayaking. Wade in a stream and feel the flowing water massage your feet and legs. Or simply find a quiet spot to sit and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. If you don't live near the water, bring the water to you! Place a small fountain in your home or office and listen to the sound of the water flowing whenever you need a break. Add some plants to your space \u2014 the very act of watering them provides an interaction with water and connection to its life-giving properties. Further, plants help purify the air around you and create a more peaceful environment. Whatever way works for you, bring more water into your life and you're sure to bring more health, calm and vibrancy as well.
