We have challenged our perceptions, understanding, and approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion resulting in a sustainable framework and intentional action. This DEI Year in Review provides a window into how we as individuals, teams, and departments have challenged assumptions and taken action to help ensure a more equitable health care system for all. Highlighted in the following pages are just a snapshot of the wide range of initiatives across our organization. Our goals remain steadfast: to keep growing and learning, keep having the tough conversations, and keep working toward an inclusive environment where everyone feels seen, heard, and celebrated. Despite our long history working towards inclusion, we know that our journey is far from finished and we have more important work ahead of us. I look forward to continuing to collaborate with and learn from all of you as we continue to take steps to create meaningful change for each other and the people we are privileged to serve. WELCOMEA Look Back... Reflections from Kate Walsh It's hard to believe that 2021 is coming to an end soon. In reflecting on the last year, I'm encouraged by how Boston Medical Center Health System has continually risen to meet numerous challenges including our commitment to advancing health equity in our work on behalf of our patients, members, and the broader community. While equity has always been at the core of our mission, we've continued to evolve our focus, initiating conversations - and action - on race and inequity across our organization. LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER, OUR PATIENTS, MEMBERS, AND OUR COMMUNITY AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN INVALUABLE. \" \" 02 TOGETHER @ BMCHSPresident & CEOFor more than 100 years, Boston Medical Center has been driven by a commitment to care for all people, providing traditional medical care and programs and services that enhance overall health. All of this supports our mission to provide exceptional care, without exception. Our vision is to make Boston the healthiest urban population in the world by 2030. This internal benchmark sets the tone for our growth and a successful future and drives our culture, activities, and strategy.MISSIONOUR VISIONOURVALUESOURAt BMC, our mission guides us, our values sustain us, and our stance sets our intentions and accountabilities for how we engage with each other and the communities we serve.Empower and Enable Everyday ActionCultivate and Support Model LeadershipAchieve and Celebrate Breakthrough Performance1 2 3 Bridging the ActivatingAccountabilityandOutcomes DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKLIVINGOURVALUESSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 04 TOGETHER @ BMCHSDiversity, Equity & Inclusion BMC's DEI Strategic Framework allows the organization to assess DEI initiatives through a critical and all encompassing lens. These dimensions are foundational elements to achieving our mission and vision at BMC. The wellbeing of employees patients, and community depends on this holistic approach and fuels DEI efforts throughout our Health System.Laying the groundwork for employees to safely speak up and address concerns of bias Ensuring DEI is woven into the fabric of our organization meant making it a permanent agenda item at Kate Walsh's monthly Leadership for Change (LFC) meeting attended by 300+ leaders. LFC keeps leaders informed about organizational priorities and initiatives, as well as, key updates to communicate to their teams. A DEI Moment is presented at every LFC, showcasing DEI initiatives and outcomes from across the health system. The aim is to share practical ideas and empower leaders to incorporate DEI within their teams. Establishing a regular cadence directly reflects the importance of DEI within the health system and the important role it plays in the organization's success.A moment of education and dialogue around DEI for leaders BMCHS is committed to creating a healthy, productive work environment free from bias, discrimination, or harassment of any form. A key part of ensuring a safe and welcoming workplace is through clear processes to raise and address concerns. This means having a plan of intentional action for correcting issues when we, or those around us, misstep. The Raising and Addressing Concerns guide allows employees to connect and correct situations safely without judgment. It offers multiple outlets for employees to seek support and guidance during the process to successfully navigate their experience. The guide also includes support resources to encourage our employees to speak up; emphasizing that retaliation is prohibited against those who report a concern. With its rollout, we anticipated an uptick in reports - an indication that the guide is empowering individuals to use their voice. This guide is more than a commitment to compliance - it's about living our values.Raising and Addressing Concerns Monthly DEI Leadership Moments 05See The Other Person (S.T.O.P.)

Listening, sharing, and speaking up help us learn from mistakes and do better going forward. CULTURE The Culture Code brings to life BMC's core value of Many Faces Create Our Greatness, making it actionable and apparent in how we do our work every day. It distills large and seemingly abstract DEI concepts into five elements: 06 TOGETHER @ BMCHS Click here to email!ALEGNA ZAVATTI Director, Interpreter Services An interactive hour-long workshop that explored the five Culture Code elements Monthly team activities highlighting topics ranging from privilege, identities, communication and beyond 6 Culture Code Ambassadors - leaders across the organization identified providing peer support to embedding the Culture Code into the Health System A robust online resource library providing additional DEI-related team activities CODE Living the \"Code\" continues to help BMCHS evolve in its understanding of diversity, health equity, and inclusion, and nurture an environment where everyone is seen, heard, and celebrated.The intention behind the Culture Code is to ensure we are taking targeted actions and measures where every employee views diversity, equity, and inclusion as part of the organizational DNA and operates thoughtfully, considerately, and intentionally. The Code helps us see and honor the humanity in our patients, our members, the community, and in each other. A multitude of specific actions were implemented educational resources were rolled out to support and enhance employees' DEI journey: 07Supporting our Transgender Colleagues and Community The Transgender Taskforce expanded supporting transgender colleagues by creating a comprehensive Transgender Guide for Employees. This was an extension of the Workplace Transition Policy, created in 2018, which was designed to establish guidelines of how to support employees who are transitioning. The new guide provides resources for transgender employees, support options if an employee is in the process of transitioning, and resources on educating colleagues and family members. It exists as a tool for all colleagues to utilize and be able to better ensure that we are fostering an inclusive environment for all employees in the health system. The Transgender Taskforce and LGBTQIA+ employees and allies, participated in the second annual Trans Resistance Vigil and March for Black Trans Lives in June, 2021. The day included tabling, live performances, an art installation in remembrance of transgender community leader Jahaira DeAlto, onsite COVID vaccination, and food trucks to top off an empowering day. In January, 2021, the Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery began conducting a monthly Nurse Chat to bring together nurses from across the country who work in gender-affirming care. This is a new initiative in collaboration with NYU Langone Medical Center. The forum provides nurses the opportunity to learn from, network with, and support each other. As of October, 2021, the Nursing Professional Development team began offering Continuing Education Units (CEU) credit for those who participate in the program. Embracing and acting on how to support our transgender employees 08 TOGETHER @ BMCHSEach June, BMCHS pauses to celebrate PRIDE - the global event highlighting the importance of self-acceptance, inclusivity, respect, visibility, and support for legal protections and equal rights for the LGBTQIA+ community worldwide. This year, the hospital hosted a PRIDE Week Refresh Station with allies and LGBTQIA+ colleagues to celebrate the community.They also hosted a screening of Gen Silent, a film that follows the lives of six older adults in the Boston area as they navigate the struggles of aging, their LGBTQIA+ identities, and the search for equitable healthcare from people who accept them. BMCHS is proud to celebrate our LGBTQIA+ team members and their contributions to the exceptional care we provide to all our patients and communities. We are grateful for the Many Faces Create Our Greatness and the invaluable perspectives, experiences, and talents they bring to the BMCHS community.Celebrating and educating the health system on the importance and contributions of the LGBTQIA+ community 09The Public Health Team in the Infectious Diseases department saw a meaningful opportunity to further support their Peer Navigators - a pivotal role that help patients navigate HIV diagnoses - through the philosophy of peer connections. By creating a safe space, team members used the power of storytelling to share their own life experiences - covering topics such as immigration, HIV, LGBTQIA+ identities, addiction, and family life. Their stories showcased a shared humanity that exists among us all regardless of our status or background. These conversations fostered empathy and helped Peer Navigators form deeper connections with each other and their patients. \"At BMC, Diversity plays a major role in achieving success with our patients. We are well equipped with employees from different countries who speak multiple languages that help better serve our community.

Composed of operations leaders representing diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and organizational roles, the D&I Council identified data-informed priorities, in alignment with BMC diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals. The flagship initiative under this portfolio is the Ambulatory Leadership Acceleration Program (LEAP), aimed at providing individuals from under-represented backgrounds with the opportunity to strengthen skills and gain experience that A LEAP IN AMBULATORYwill prepare them for operations management roles. Through a 6-month curriculum, cohorts will participate in personalized mentorship, an action- oriented capstone project, and networking opportunities amongst the LEAP Cohort and members of the Ambulatory team. In order to foster a management team that better reflects the composition of the patient populations that the health system serves, this program specifically targets developing individuals who identify as Black/African-American or Latino/a/x. LEAP kicked off their inaugural cohort in October with 12 participants. We are seeing the early impact of the emphasis and communication associated with this work. Various leaders on the Ambulatory Operations team have actively contributed to the development of Ambulatory LEAP reinforcing the root understanding that DEI is and must continue to be woven into the fabric of BMCHS. DEI IS AND MUST CONTINUE TO BE WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF BMCHS. \" \"LEAPs and bounds toward developing future Operations Managers through an accelerated leadership program for employees of color 12 TOGETHER @ BMCHSExpanding growth and education for nurses through various development programs and initiatives DEI IN NURSING The Nursing Department created Experienced Nurse Residency Programs to increase access for nurses from underrepresented communities to train and transition into specialty areas such as Case Management, Operating Room, and Critical Care. Additional DEI initiatives include the Infection Control Fellowship Program and the New Graduate Programs, targeting nurses from underrepresented communities for specific growth opportunities. The dedicated support for the new graduates has proven positive and has been crucial for the confidence and success of new nurses following their initial onboarding period. Through a multitude of strategic partnerships with local nursing schools, BMC continues to expand their reach for acquiring exceptional talent. 13Increased and first-time DEI representation through science and educational opportunities PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE Pathology and Laboratory Medicine worked together on a foundational effort to grow the base of faculty, trainee physicians, and graduate students who are under- represented in medicine, particularly in Pathology. Beginning with two women as clinical leaders in the department, one of them is the first woman leader in Anatomic Pathology since 1864. Reggie Thomasson, MD, Medical Director of Blood Bank and Transfusion Medicine, focused awareness around the recruiting and promotion process of underrepresented groups. In both 2020 and 2021, 25% of the entering Pathology residents came from underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Yachana Kataria, PhD, Medical Director of Clinical Chemistry, serves as the Principle Investigator on an important grant assessing serological (examining blood serum and the immune system's response related to pathogens) response to COVID-19 in a longitudinal cohort at BMC. She is the Laboratory Director and accreditation license holder (CLIA) for the Codman Square Community Health Center and Dorchester House Multi-Services Center, working closely with these organizations to ensure the quality of laboratory services in the Boston community. 14 TOGETHER @ BMCHSElizabeth R. Duffy, MA led the department Recruitment and Steering committee for the Masters of Science in Pathology Laboratory Sciences (GMS, BUSM), working with Drs. Jones and Kataria. The committee's efforts resulted in recruiting 10 incoming Masters' program students: One student from Cameroon was awarded a department scholarship named for Adrianne E. Rogers, MD who was a co-founder of the Master's program and an active supporter of women and URM students interested in science and medicine. These activities only scratch the surface of an already inclusive, diversity-focused department that continues to grow their team and support each other in a mission- focused direction. 20% US-based students underrepresented in STEM50% FemaleCountries represented 6 15Pathways: A Leadership Acceleration Program graduated their third cohort of 21 leaders in October 2021. This initiative aims at increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the leadership level across BMCHS. The program's goal is simple but transformative: to help fast track career advancement for high-potential employees of color within the institution. Pathways is an intensive six-month leadership acceleration program that approaches professional development holistically through 360 assessments, customized career development plans, and wrap-around career development support. Each Pathways participant is connected with a career coach, mentors, and a career navigator to help identify job opportunities within the health system. PATHWAYS \"Pathways was a place of support and provided a space for people of color to discuss the challenges they were facing in the hospital. The curriculum introduced concepts I didn't learn in graduate school, such as 'The Platinum Rule,' cultural competence, and emotional intelligence. Pathways taught me how to lead across differences.\" Andrea Nicholson, 7 East Menino Nurse Director Pathways AlumniFast-tracking career advancement for high-potential employees of color within the health systemAmy Thai, MEd, Associate Director, Employee Experience and Workforce EffectivenessThe curriculum is carefully curated focusing on topics like improving leadership communication, leading across differences, and resiliency to set participants up for success as rising leaders at BMCHS. \"Pathways pinpoints many of our top- performing team members and prepares them as they take that first step toward management level. Pathways is part of our DEI strategy and aims to holistically cultivate the next generation of leaders of color, resulting in sustainable change and impact.\" Pathways gave me the boost of confidence within myself to say \"that I'm smart enough, good enough, and that I can help BMC achieve their Mission, Vision, and Values by bringing my true authentic self every day. Pathways made me step outside of my comfort zone, bring executive presence, and practice being more mindful. The friendships I formed will forever hold a special place with me because it made me realize that only alone we can move rocks, but together we can move mountains. Employees' current managers also play an active role in their career growth plan during and beyond the length of the program. Participants credit their managers' support in identifying their potential and nominating them to Pathways, illustrating how the program improves the dynamic between managers and their teams and prioritizes career mobility within the health system. It's a culture shift that also greatly benefits the institution by mobilizing current employees familiar with BMCHS systems who can carry their institutional knowledge to better problem solve and advance ideas at the manager level.Sina Thimas, Operation Supervisor, Otolaryngology, Pathways Alumni 3 c o h o r t s 6 m o n t h s25 p r o m o t i o n s 17While BMCHS continually demonstrates remarkable creativity in meeting the unmet social needs of our patients, the Development team is now moving the needle from filling gaps to eliminating them through a shift toward an equity model of fundraising. The pivot from charity to equity as a focal point ensures economic mobility of the surrounding community and the health system. A significant example of the above work is how we are building out partnerships - one of which is a collaboration with Devin and Jason McCourty, NFL players and social advocates. Over the past few years, they have lent their names, voices, and platforms to raise noteworthy funds for the BMC Center of Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle Cell is a genetic disease that affects a large portion of individuals with African-American descent and currently has no cure. Devin and Jason are working with our researchers and doctors to build awareness and drive impact at BMC and beyond in this field of medicine. The Development Team is aligning themselves with the goals of the institution in an empowering way while continuing to support existing programs and fund new, innovative work across the health system.DEVELOPMENT TACKLES SICKLE CELL Modeling equity through fundraising and philanthropy by joining forces with the community to raise awareness about sickle cell disease 18 TOGETHER @ BMCHSIn 2020, Juneteenth became an official holiday in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. To honor this new holiday, the HR department hosted a special guided discussion about the importance of Juneteenth for our patients, employees and members led by L'Merchie Frazier, Director of Education and Interpretation at the Museum of African American History. The inaugural raising of the Juneteenth flag took place on the Moakley Lawn to commemorate this significant day.JUNETEENTH 19On March 8, 2021, BMCHS celebrated the 110th International Women's Day showcasing a gallery of legendary women from around the world as an opportunity to learn about the fundamental impacts women have had in our world history. BMCHS is also part of the 100% Talent Compact with the City of Boston striving to ensure that Boston is the #1 city in the US for working women. The health system provides data bi-annually to the Boston Women's Workforce Council (BWWC) to maintain accountability and acknowledge the role it plays in eliminating gender and racial wage gaps.HONORING WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE As of May 2021, BMCHS partnered with Kahilla, a digital women's resource group designed to provide participants an opportunity to expand their professional and personal growth with women across the globe. One hundred female leaders across the health system gained access to c-suite level executive coaching, curated content, connection to community, and both live and on-demand sessions, all within a digital platform. BMCHS' partnership with Kahilla demonstrates the organization's commitment to talent development and DEI for women in the workforce.BMCHS honors women for their personal strength, wealth of knowledge, and unwavering leadership through various programs and initiativesIntroducing the medical realm virtually to local high school students via leaders of BMCHS BMC's 2021 Junior Summer Volunteer Program brought 40 high school students together to virtually explore careers in healthcare, to learn firsthand about BMC's mission of exceptional care, without exception. Students were assigned a hypothetical patient to follow over the course of the summer. Each week, they directly heard from BMC staff members who might interact with the hypothetical patients during their care. This included a wide range of medical specialties and Public Safety, Interpreter Services, Patient Advocacy, and other BMC departments. Students were able to immerse themselves in BMC's mission from the patient perspective and learn valuable career advice.JUNIOR SUMMER VOLUNTEER PROGRAM \"I learned that there were so many more career opportunities in a hospital than the general public thinks there are. To work in a hospital, you don't just have to be a nurse or doctor.\" 2021 Junior Summer Volunteer Program Participant \"I didn't know that there were so many roles in the healthcare system outside of nurses and doctors. It was really interesting to learn about the pharmacy liaison, medical interpreter, cancer patient navigator, and more.\" 2021 Junior Summer Volunteer Program Participant 21COVID-19 VACCINE ROLLOUT One word defines BMC's vaccine rollout process - equitable. Internally, BMC hosted various initiatives like tabling and physician one-on-ones for employees who had vaccine hesitancy. Dialogues for specific groups of individuals who have experienced systemic marginalization also occurred resulting in over 98% percent of our workforce being vaccinated as of October, 2021. In addition to internal communication, there were a variety of initiatives to provide accurate information and encouragement to the surrounding community to get vaccinated. Using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), BMC hosted over 100 pop up events with schools, churches, community groups, and immigrant centers in specific areas of Boston where 71% of the top three SVI indicators reside. BMC operated multiple vaccination sites in Boston to help serve communities that were hit hardest by the pandemic.The health system took an equitable approach for employees and patients to obtain the vaccine confidentlyOne of these initiatives was the Mobile Vaccine Operations led by Alicia Peterson, Principal Investigator. Funded for one million dollars by the Health Resources & Services Administration, the purpose was to improve vaccine access and equity. The COVID-19 Vaccines team does pop up vaccine events with minority groups, immigrant centers, faith-based organizations, and schools. The team represents many different races, cultures, religions and speaks different languages so that patients feel represented in the healthcare system. Eighty-five percent of the team identifies as people of color, and 65% of the team is multi- lingual. This grant brings vaccine education and access in a culturally competent, intentional way to vulnerable populations. The work even supported a local high school wanting to bring the vaccines to their community thus broadening BMC's impact.

During the two-year program, residents will graduate having gained vast leadership experience while also earning their MBA degree in Health Care Administration from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University's (FAMU) online program, a Historically Black University (HBCU). PHARMACY RESIDENCY PROGRAM This inaugural program, set to begin July 2022, will expose pharmacy residents to a solid clinical experience their first year, followed by a second year of a heavy concentration with pharmacy operations and health system administrative leadership teams. Learning from some of the best programs in the region, residents will develop relevant clinical pharmacy competencies and work on pharmacy and health-system corporate/business strategy initiatives. \"The clinical and leadership exposure from arguably some of the best minds in New England, makes this a highly sought after program on its own. Adding in the intentionality of seeking a diverse pool of candidates, excites and humbles me as its Program Director.\" Sebastian Hamilton, PharmD, MBA, RPh, Associate Chief Pharmacy Officer, Outpatient Pharmacy ServicesPharmacy Residency Program in Health-System Pharmacy Administration & Leadership (HSPAL) 24 TOGETHER @ BMCHSBMC's clinical research growth strategy includes the vision of becoming a national center of excellence conducting diverse and inclusive science by developing a novel model that identifies access to clinical research as one essential component of exceptional care. This stemmed the creation of the Clinical Research Network (CRN) through a partnership with the Clinical Trial Office, Department of Medicine, BMC's Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL), and funding from National Institutes of Health (NIH).CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK A new network focused on designing an equitable model for workforce development, internship, and full-time opportunities \"The best science requires diverse voices, and the time has come to include research equity as a part of BMCHS's clinical care model. It is the responsibility of researchers, scientists, and physicians to engage our communities, rebuild trust, and offer clinical research opportunity to all people.\" Dr. Benjamin Linas, Principal Investigator of BMC's Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) 25It is a model that provides excellent clinical care to under-served communities infused with broad clinical research opportunities. As part of their goals, the CRN strives to break down systemic, siloed recruitment practices and open opportunity by developing a community engaged network through trust building and fostering dialogue between BMC and its community partners. In doing so, the CRN will increase community awareness around research, and ultimately improve population health reporting and advance access to medical care for all. The CRN intends to develop a model for workforce development, utilizing internships and long-term, full-time roles that attract a racially and linguistically diverse workforce, who live in the communities they serve and will become trusted ambassadors for equity in research.GME URiM The Office of Minority Physician Recruitment is committed to the recruitment, engagement, retention, and advancement of the underrepresented in medicine (URiM) within the GME's residency and fellowship programs. National outreach efforts continued at medical school programs of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The recruitment team also attended URiM focused local and national events hosted by both the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA) and the Student National Medical Association (SNMA) resulting in a consistent climb in the number of URiM trainees. BMC continues to measure higher in URiM trainees than the national average of 13.8% according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).The Graduate Medical Education (GME) - Office of Minority Physician Recruitment continues to expand their reach 26 TOGETHER @ BMCHSURiM Resident and Fellow Steering Committee works to create and support a URiM cross-program trainee community at BMC. They leverage social media to promote opportunities and engage current URiM trainees and future students interested in BMC. Be sure to check them out! The GME Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Council consists of BMC trainees and GME physician leadership.

This multi- faceted initiative leverages existing programs at Boston Medical Center (BMC) and Boston University (BU) by working with three levels of trainees loosely defined as: A BRIGHT IDEAAAReducing the stigma of addiction medicine through education and mentorship opportunities beginning as early as secondary school For Approach 2, IDEAAA also collaborates with 7 existing addiction medicine training programs at BU and BMC to determine specific needs around DEIB and to expand URG recruitment strategies for these programs. Finally, Approach 3 supports junior faculty and trainees from URGs to obtain research funding and career mentorship to support successful careers within the field of addiction research. Because IDEAAA targets learners at what may be their first exposure to the field of addiction medicine, the program has the opportunity to introduce this field as a compelling and viable career path and reduce the stigma associated with these diseases. IDEAAA Team Top left - Sophia Ly, Top right - Kaku So-Armah, Bottom left - Emily Hurstak, Bottom right - Jules CanfieldApproach 1 introduces addiction-related topics, case studies, and learning opportunities that are infused into existing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) training programs for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (URGs). 28 TOGETHER @ BMCHSThe Clinical Research and Advocacy team has been working diligently in collaboration with people from across BMC and BU to learn how to make substance use disorder treatment more appealing and effective for Black patients. Set to begin in fall 2021, this initiative includes hosting a working group that meets weekly through the year and 6 focus groups. In addition, monthly daylong meetings are planned for summer, 2022 to address the major factors that affect the ways that addiction treatment may need tailoring for Black patients. GRAYKEN CENTER FOR ADDICTION This interdisciplinary team, comprised of a majority of people who identify as Black and includes individuals who have experienced a substance use disorder, will drive research for equity. All of this is an effort to improve the addiction treatment offered to Black patients at BMC and eliminate disparities in treatment and outcomes by identifying key unanswered questions regarding how to improve treatment for Black patients and developing actionable steps to improve equitable care through ongoing research.Finding solutions to support Black patients in need of substance use disorder treatment 29On an annual basis, EVI administers the Clinical Vitality Survey to physicians, advanced practice providers and trainees. EVI, in partnership with the Wellness and Professional Vitality Advisory Council, analyzes the data by race, gender, and other variables to understand how professional experiences vary. From the survey results, EVI works with BUMG, BMC, and BUSM to address the system factors and culture that drive clinical burnout and professional fulfillment. This year's survey included new feedback statements like, \"I feel that I belong here\" and \"There are good systems in place to ensure that I am treated with respect and dignity.\" The survey had the highest response rate to date of 71% and furthered the understanding of how experiences across the institutions differ by social identity and affect professional quality of life. Approaching wellness through an equity lens is essential to improving experiences of professional fulfillment and burnout. OFFICE OF EQUITY, VITALITY, AND INCLUSION (EVI) The Office of Equity, Vitality, and Inclusion provides strategic leadership for campus-wide gender equity, racial equity, and professional vitality pursuits. They develop guidelines, tools, and initiatives that promote structural change and enhance institutional alignment. They are comprised of three faculty- led advisory councils: Diversity and Inclusion, Wellness and Professional Vitality, and Women's Leadership.Boston University Medical GroupDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion CLINICIAN VITALITY SURVEY 30 TOGETHER @ BMCHSTo explore! To explore!The Glossary for Culture Transformation is a tool designed to build common understanding on issues of justice, equity, and belonging through shared language. It was developed by EVI in partnership with all levels of staff, students, faculty, and leadership from Boston University Medical Group (BUMG), Boston Medical Center (BMC), Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), and all schools on the Boston University Medical Campus. GLOSSARY FOR CULTURE TRANSFORMATION INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE PRACTICES Inclusive Language Practices (ILP) is a living tool that provides practical recommendations and resources to incorporate and operationalize the terms defined in the Glossary for Culture Transformation. This tool was created by the Women's Leadership Advisory Council in partnership with the Office of Faculty Development and Glossary development team. The language used to talk and write about race, gender, sexuality, disability, socio- economic status, and other identities can marginalize people or engender belonging. As one of the Culture Code elements says, \"Missteps happen, so can growth\" - the ILP helps the organization grow in understanding the diverse and intersecting social identities that make up our workforce, patient population, and community.bmc.org/glossary-culture-transformation The Glossary includes over 100 terms and aims to promote mindful use of language that affirms and centers those who have been historically and currently marginalized due to unfair systems. The interactive website was launched fall of 2021. The Glossary for Culture Transformation is another tool that connects to BMCHS's Culture Code, as well as another way of living Many Faces Create Our Greatness. Created by everyone, and for everyone, The Glossary exists to reinforce the foundation and prioritization of diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the health system. 31The Commitment to Operationalize Racial Equity (CORE) is a tool for clinical departments to integrate racial equity into decision-making. It was created by EVI in partnership with the Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council and other key stakeholders. Using CORE, departments establish Racial Equity teams, review data, and complete an assessment to identify their racial equity goals and actions. In 2021, 18 of 28 departments submitted racial equity goals and EVI will continue to coach and consult with departments. Additionally, all 28 departments have identified Racial Equity Champions, leaders of racial equity work within their department. Champions meet monthly to discuss the integration of racial equity into practice and build a community of support and learning. Equity is as much about the process, as it is the outcome - CORE is an example of that.

As 2021 wanes, it paves way for a moment of reflection on what has been a gratifying year. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are words that carry serious weight.
