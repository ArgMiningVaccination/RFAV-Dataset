Most breakthroughs in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with cancer exist because of clinical trials. Clinical trials have specific treatment plans with specific eligibility criteria. Criteria differ from study to study, and are frequently based on age, sex, type/stage of cancer, medical history, and current health status. Participation in a trial requires the ability to travel to the clinical trial center (in this case, the Disney Family Cancer Center).
