In fact, more and more scientific studies are proving its effectiveness both on it's own and in conjunction with Western medicine. At Saint Lucie Acupuncture & Integrative Medicine, we use our extensive experience to determine each individual patient's needs and challenges, we create customized plans to regulate your cycle and/or improve fertility results, whilst being mindful of where Western medicine would be useful as well.

Fertility Whether you just started trying, or have been given a diagnosis of infertility, acupuncture can help. Our Acupuncturist specializes in improving fertility and reproductive health. We provide treatments for the whole person/couple from symptoms to the root cause. Our treatments are personalized to you and aim to encourage optimal wellness. Pregnancy Acupuncture is a safe and gentle way to optimize your health during your pregnancy. From preventing some types of miscarriage to relieving pain, nausea, constipation, and preparing you for labor and delivery, our skilled practitioners will safely help you through any stage of your pregnancy. Labor Acupuncture may help the body to get ready and ease up the process of labor, shortening the labor hours, reducing pain, reducing common risks during labor time. Acupuncture have been shown to stimulate uterine contractions and, while these points are avoided throughout most of the pregnancy, they work wonderfully for signaling the body to go into labor at full term. This type of treatment is completely safe and should be started at around week 37. Labor induction with acupuncture was recently shown in a study to reduce medical inductions by 35-43%, the use of epidurals by 31% and emergency Cesareans by 32%. BREECH BABY At around 34 to 37 weeks gestation, a fetus becomes positioned for birth with its head down. When not positioned this way, it is considered a breech presentation. By using moxibustion (the warming of a specific acupuncture point with an herbal incense), babies turn into correct position 69-85% of the time. Post-Partum POST PARTUM RECOVERY Women experiencing any symptoms after giving birth can benefit greatly from acupuncture. At Saint Lucie Acupuncture & Integrative Medicine we often help women who are experiencing constipation, urinary and pelvic floor problems, insomnia, back pain, hip pain, low milk supply, carpal tunnel, insomnia, night sweats, post partum depression, or fatigue associated with the post partum time. POST PARTUM DEPRESSION After giving birth, the body goes through hormonal changes that can manifest both physically and mentally. Acupuncture can help moderate these hormonal changes and smooth this transition. Our experienced practitioners can also prescribe safe Chinese herbs to help speed recovery and stabilize the mood. LACTATION SUPPORT There are specific acupuncture points and Chinese herbs that can increase the milk supply in lactating women. Our experienced Acupuncturist can also discuss dietary and lifestyle changes to support healthy milk supply. "}
