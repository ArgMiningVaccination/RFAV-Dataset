Frightening stories regarding the progressions of science have been Some parental concerns persist that vaccines may cause Autism. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed throughout the years. There is a major worldwide increasing rate of Autism diagnoses. Theories have centered on measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines being administered. Studies have showed that The topic of the article is the connection (or lack of) between childhood vaccines (MMR) and autism. Contrary to popular opinion, vaccines are not linked to autism in any shape or form and there is no scientific evidence to support it. Countless deem that the definite reason for autism is not the dead or live virus found in vaccines but the derivatives' within them. \"Exposure to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that is used in vaccines and immunoglobulin preparations, has been hypothesized to be associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\" (Price, et al., 2010). This continues to remain merely speculation. The Centers for Disease Control research analysis' do not corroborate toxicity of these preservatives. Mercury produces verified detrimental effects on children when absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Vaccinations are not absorbed in the GI tract and are instead absorbed in the muscles or subcutaneous tissues, depending on the route of injection. Science or Pseudoscience? I. Vaccines & Autism Do Vaccines cause Autism? II. Abstract Do vaccines cause autism is a question that has been bouncing around for over twenty years. The increase in the number of diagnosed cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder has increased significantly and due to the impact this has in people's lives Summary of \"Vaccines and Autism\" In the journal of \"Vaccines and Autism\" author Bernard Rimland looks at the possible role of vaccines in autism. Rimland provides crucial data in understanding autism, the possible role of vaccines in autism, and the risks of vaccines in certain children. Rimland states before Today, parents are not vaccinating their children for a number of reasons, whether it is religious beliefs, it is not natural, and some parents are even trying to link vaccinations to the rise in autism. This however has been proven false and stated in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The increase in vaccinations and the increase in children with autism happened at the same time, which leads some parents to believe that is why their child was diagnosed with autism, but this is correlation not causation. There is no real scientific test to diagnose autism and it is based off of the child's social and communication skills and their behavior. A retrospective study was done from 1980 to 1994 where scientist recorded the amount of children receiving the measles vaccination and the amount of children diagnosed with autism. Over this time span, there was only a 10% increase in the amount of children receiving the MMR vaccine and 572% increase in children with autism. If the MMR vaccine was the cause of autism, then they should have increased at the same rate and therefore concluding that autism is caused by other unknown factors. Many believe the measles mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine triggers autism spectrum disorder in some children. Many Hollywood celebrities in the acting community that have birthed children that suffer from autism spectrum disorder have concluded that this is how their child developed autism. These celebrities being very vocal about this link between vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders and have in turn influenced the increase in many ordinary middle-class parents refraining from getting the medically recommended vaccinations for their children. The medical community has done extensive research on this theory. However, to this date no reliable study shows a link between autism spectrum disorder and the measles mumps-rubella vaccine. In fact, the medical community have continued to recommend childhood vaccinations and continue to emphasis the danger of a non vaccinated child catching and spreading serious diseases like whooping cough (pertussis), measles and mumps (Mayo Clinic, 2012). The whole MMR vaccination and Autism inspiration was first brought about by three key points. In the book \"The Everything Parent 's Guide To Vaccines: Balanced, Professional Advice To Help You Make The Best Decision For Your Child\" the author told what they were in an authentic way. It stated \"The first was an observation that the number of children diagnosed with Autism increased dramatically right around the same time the MMR combination vaccine became introduced in the United States and Great Britain. The second was based on a study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield in 1998 Published in the respected scientific journal Lancet. The third is based on the fact that children with Autism were first diagnosed with the condition right after they received the MMR vaccine.\" (Leslie 67). However, these three points didn't gain an exceptional start since Dr. Wakefield was later found not credible, and his license is under legal indictment (Leslie 69). Since Dr. Wakefield did not follow through with a credible study, it severely damaged his followers opinions and did not help the theory that Autism and vaccinations are linked. The risk of Autism through vaccination theory was once again disproved by a study conducted in 2013 by the Journal of Pediatrics. At the head of the study was Dr. Frank DeStefano, who is the director of the Immunization Safety Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was conducted using 256 children who had autism and 752 children who did not (Lindeman para 3). By looking at \"antigens, the substances in vaccines that cause the body's immune First, studies and research have shown that In 1988, it was falsely stated by Dr. Wakefield in his series featured in a journal that the MMR vaccine was the potential cause of autism. Ever since, many people have believed vaccinations have some connection with autism, especially parents with autistic children. However, science and research have shown that his claim was false and that there is no evident link between vaccines and autism. Scientists studied vaccines, and their data showed that there was no relationship between autism and vaccinations, autism and MMR, vaccination and thimerosal, and vaccination and mercury. The data also showed that there is no evidence of increased risk of developing ASD after taking the MMR vaccine. This doesn't mean that doctors have cancelled out the connection between vaccines and all disorders, but autism definitely has no link. Also, if parents think not vaccinating their child will prevent them from getting autism, research has shown that kids who are vaccinated have the same rates of getting autism than those who haven't. So if you are a parent deciding whether or not to vaccinate your child, autism isn't something you should consider. Vaccinations have been by far one of the most important medical practices in history. At one time, some of the most lethal diseases in the world were common place. With the initiation of vaccines, these diseases have been mostly eradicated. Unfortunately, there are some parents who are now refusing to Dr. Temple Grandin was diagnosed with autism in the early 1950s. Although autism was discovered decades before this, the disorder wasn't truly understood as people were panicking and blaming it on whatever seemed logical at the time. Grandin's mother was labeled a \"refrigerator mother,\" which means she was thought to Vaccines; a more than spectacular development of science which has prevented countless numbers of diseases by giving one's body an immunity to a microorganism by stimulating the body's immune system and giving it the ability to recognize the pathogen as it enters the body to be more easily and readily The MMR Vaccine: Examining the Evidence In 1963 the Noble Peace Prize winning virologist John F. Enders finally licensed his vaccine for measles. Prior to this vaccine the United States alone reported 4 million cases of the measles each year. With more scientific discoveries the measles vaccine today has evolved "}
