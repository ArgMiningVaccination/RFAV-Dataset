CLINICAL APPLICATIONS - Revitalizes Liver Health and Supports Natural Detoxification Mechanisms - Focuses on Both Phases of Liver Detoxification - Provides Micronutrients, Phytonutrients, and Cofactors that Support Detoxification of Xenobiotics and Xenoestrogens - Supports Healthy Estrogen Metabolism - Increases Antioxidant Protection and Glutathione Production - Promotes Gastrointestinal Health -- OVERVIEW Core Restore is a strategic system designed to safely enhance and promote the primary pathways of detoxification in the liver. The Core Restore kit provides three active formulas - Core Support, Alpha Base, and PhytoCore - which function synergistically to support Phase I and Phase II pathways of liver detoxification to help neutralize environmental pollutants, hormone disruptors, unhealthy estrogen metabolites, xenoestrogens (synthetic compounds that imitate estrogen), and other harmful toxins. This powerful trio of specialized formulas provides essential micronutrients, phytonutrients, and a source of easily digested, low-allergen protein that purifies the liver and fuel optimal biotransformation. The Core Restore kit is an easy-to-follow, 7- or 14-day program, complete with an in-depth Patient Handbook, designed to reduce the incoming burden of toxins and help restore optimal health. Suggested Use Mix 2 scoops of Core Support with 8 oz. of water or the beverage of your choice two times daily or as recommended by your health care professional. INGREDIENT BENEFITS Core Support powder is a primary component of the Core Restore program, and provides key nutrients needed to support Phase II liver detoxification. Core Support Core Support powder enhances Phase II detoxification by providing clean protein, gentle fiber, and specific nutrients which help eliminate toxins during the seven-day detoxification program. Core Support provides nutrients needed for Phase II detox including N-acetyl cysteine, glycine, taurine, lipoic acid, green tea extract, ellagic acid, and a unique blend of vegetable phytonutrients. The antioxidant activity of this unique blend of nutrients is protective against cell damage by free radicals and helps induce Phase II enzymes which facilitate the removal of toxins from the body and scavenge free radicals. Research has shown that glutathione and the amino acid cysteine help to regulate Phase II conjugation reactions and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, has also been shown to induce expression of glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. Core Support provides organic brown rice protein as a satisfying and hypoallergenic energy source, as well as 6-7 g of fiber per serving, essential for binding toxins for elimination. "}
