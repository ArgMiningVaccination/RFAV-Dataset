The plant kingdom has been the main source of his investigation for this Elixir of Life, with some additional interest in minerals. In the search for health, the field of herbs has had a long history. Winston J. Craig, Ph.D. , gives a cursory review of ancient civilizations involvement with herbs and minerals in his text The Use and Safety of Common Herbs and Herbal Teas. An herb is a plant that is valued for its flavor, scent, medicinal properties and often for its perceived spiritual values. Records found from ancient civilizations such as from Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, have revealed the use of various herbs as medicinals. The oldest records date to near 3000 B.C. These oldest records show a rational approach to treatment of disease, but by 1500 B.C. almost all civilizations had reverted to an irrational and mystical approach. The emphasis for herb use became primarily spiritual and/or mystical combined with astrology in application as therapy for disease, without understanding of biochemical action. The same combination of spiritual, magical, and astrological relationships is a common belief in herb use today. The belief in a combination of properties of plants has led to a concept that plants have a personality, a spirit, a consciousness, which is on a very high plane\u2014electrical magnetic frequency, and in turn, has a pronounced effect upon the human mind and emotions. [1)] Tisserand, Robert B., The Art of Aromatherapy, Healing Arts Press, Rochester, VT, (1977) pp. 45-49. The use of herbs has been a fundamental practice in all ancient health and healing systems. Herbs are considered helpful in bridging the cosmic energies which are said to be internal and external to the body. In Ayurvedic practice, herbs are always to be used in conjunction with meditation, diet, and other Ayurvedic approaches to health. Benefit from herbal therapy in Ayurveda from herbal therapy in Ayurveda medicine will depend upon its being added to other therapies. Little to no benefit is to be expected when it is used alone. The herbal remedies of the past were not chosen for medicinal use because of their biochemical properties, but for their supposed properties to bring about positive or negative effects on universal energy, or due to their relationship to the zodiac, so as to bring balance to an unbalanced individual. Out of this use, however, it was recognized that certain plants had a variety of effects upon people, and over time, many plants began to be used as a result of their biochemical effects. Many present-day medicines are derived from herbs. More will be found by ongoing research. The use of some herbs in small amounts (such as turmeric) is of value as they contain many powerful chemicals that are healthful. Ayurveda also used minerals in its treatment methods for thousands of years. Substances such as arsenic, antimony, and mercury were in common use until this past century. Mercury was the most popular mineral used and was given almost as a universal antidote for illness. Mercury, in the Hindu's understanding, is \"semen from Shiva\" one of their prominent gods. The ancient apothecary, or pharmacy, had minerals and a variety of plant substances. Some of these pharmacies grew their own plants and prepared minerals for administration. Of particular note in alchemy is the mineral mercury, a silver white element derived from the red cinnabar ore, and is a deadly poison. The use of mercury continued down through the centuries, and in the early 1800's mercury, in the form of mercurous chloride (calomel), was given for almost all ailments. When I began the study of medicine in 1955, there were several forms of mercury still being used in medical care. It was quite effective as an ointment to treat fungus infections of the skin. Injections of mercuhydrin were used as a diuretic. Gradually, physicians began to understand its long-term toxicity and its use faded. Plant lore and much of herbal use is based on the doctrine of pantheism, \"one is all, all is one\"; \"as above, so below.\" The pagan's story of creation is that a blending of a two-part (yin and yang) universal (life force) energy to a point of perfect balance created all material things. It also supposedly gave to living plants a high-level frequency of cosmic energy, a soul. It is this teaching that is believed in the neo-pagan culture to give plants and herbs ability to have an influence upon the mind of man. For millennia herbologists have believed that there is a spiritual power connected with herbs. In more recent years this spiritual power has been expressed as electric-magnetic energy with a high wave frequency. There is always this attempt to explain mystical power, life force energy, in the terms and concepts of modern physics, making it more acceptable to the nonbeliever of mysticism. Such teaching is also more deceptive to the unwary. In chapter 5 of this book, Universal Energy, explanation is given to the teaching promoted in New Age/Neo-Pagan belief systems concerning seven levels of perceived vibrational\u2014 frequencies of universal energy. Energy traveling at the speed of light is said to become material substance forming the cosmos, earth, and all that is on it. The higher (hypothesized) frequencies (subtle energies) are said to promote higher levels of consciousness. Herbs are believed to possess high frequency energy; therefore herbal treatment is believed to be most effective on the mind of man and is useful for therapy on emotions and mental conditions. [2)] Ibid., pp. 10-12, 92-103. The field of herbalism has much that is good but also opens a chasm that many fall into, thinking they are following a \"natural\" method. User beware, one can easily be led into a spiritual trap, accepting a false science, that of Satan's counterfeit system of healing and so giving him homage. The emphasis in this book's section on herbal use will be to expose this counterfeit of God's healing methods. Some of these false aspects are very difficult to ferret out, as the explanation of the application and use of certain methods sounds so beneficial and can blend so closely with the true. This is especially so in aromatherapy. Most people will make their judgment as to whether a method is proper to use or not by whether they receive apparent benefit. This is never a test to be used to determine if a therapy is free of being Satan's counterfeit. Satan is not going to waste his efforts on a therapy that does not bring changes or apparent improvement. The Bible tells us he has power to do miracles, not just fake miracles; is given power to bring about real miracles. Author, E.G. White, makes an interesting observation of Satan's ability to perform miracles. No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan's agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do. [3)] White, E.G., The Great Controversy, Pacific Press Publishing Association, Mountain View, California, (Now Nampa, Idaho) (1888, 1939, 1950), p. 553. The greatest use of herbs in the past was guided mainly by a world view that saw their influence upon humans not by biochemical action, but as substances containing life-forces by which man supposedly increased his own life-force. The New Age Movement of today looks to herbs both as a spiritual power\u2014energy and as active biochemical agents. This will be better demonstrated in the following comments on flower and aromatherapy therapy. \"INTRODUCTION TO A PAGAN PHILOSOPHY OF HERBS\" Herbs are 'Magick.' They have been the primary source of medicines for people of every culture and were considered 'magickal' or spiritual by many of them. An ancient earth based spiritual belief system concerning herbs appears in many ancient cultures and civilizations such as Celtic, Chinese, Indian, and Native American philosophies just to name a few. Their religious beliefs shaped their view and relationship with the 'Great Spirit,' and the relationships between their citizens. This was a belief system which also demonstrated a wholistic view of illness and utilized herbs according to religious belief. You could say that an earth centered-nature religion still permeates herbalism today. We believe that herbalism is part of the RELIGION of NATURE, representing a balance of mind, body, and spirit and relies on intuition as well as science. (Emphasis added) Pagans work with Nature, respecting and worshipping the spiritual forces they observe. Nature is perceived as the domain of the gods and of spirits. Nature religions teach a philosophy of divine linking between all of the earth's inhabitants. [4)] [http://www.purifymind.com/PhilosophyHerb.htm](http://www.purifymind.com/PhilosophyHerb.htm) Exploring what Pagans believe about relationships said to exist between plants and man gives us more understanding as to why they have interest in the use of herbs, plant essences, essential oils, and aromatherapy for healing. This relationship is said to be that all plants have souls and spirits that guard and protect the species. Many plants are said to have also animal spirits attached. Cachora (Indian Shaman) is quite plain about the underlying principle of healing herbs. He says that healing takes place when a person connects into the plant spirit, becoming the plant and understanding its personality. Using spirit as the method of transference, the plant's energy or healing properties are transmitted to the person....healing can take place by calling on the spirit and taking into one's mind the spiritual essence of the plant. [5)] Worwood, Valerie Ann, Aromatherapy for the Soul, New World Library, Navato, California, (1999), p. 9. In following paragraphs we will explore more concerning the belief in and use of plants, their essences, essential oils, and aromas as used by many today for health and healing. Herbs have a proper use for their taste and biochemical properties. I recommend the book Nutrition and Wellness, A Vegetarian Way to Better Health, written by Winston J. Craig, Ph.D., R.D. , Professor of Nutrition at Andrews University, which covers much of the presently known benefits and information on the biochemical properties of herbs. [6)] Craig, Winston J., Ph.D., R.D. , The Use and Safety of Common Herbs and Herbal Teas, Second Edition, Golden Harvest Books, 4610 Lisa Lane, 'Berrien Springs, MI, (1996). A second book I recommend is Drugs, Herbs, & Natural Remedies, by Mervyn Hardinge M.D. , Dr. P.H., Ph.D., long-time instructor in pharmacology at Loma Linda School of Medicine, and also founder of the School of Public Health at Loma Linda. [7)] Hardinge, Mervyn G. , A Physician Explains Ellen White's Counsel on Drugs, Herbs, & Natural Remedies, Review and Herald Publishing Association, Hagerstown, MD (2001). FLOWER ESSENCE THERAPY Flower therapy is a component of herbalism. Various flower remedies are also typically involved in the world of the occult, such as the Vita Florum and Bach Flower Remedies which claim to operate on the basis of cosmic forces and permit psychic diagnosis, prognosis, and other forms of guidance.... [8)] Ankerberg, John, Weldon, John, Can You Trust Your Doctor? Wolgemuth & Hyatt, Publishers, Inc. Brentwood, Tennessee, (1991), p. 260. The occultist Douglas Baker discusses the underlying theory in the use of flower remedies in his book, Esoteric Healing. He states that: Dr. Bach had discovered that dew which accumulated on the petals of wild flowers before sunrise, was changed dramatically by the presence of sunlight so that it now had an energy potential within it...each plant's dew had a quality of its own, a type of energy absorbed into the dew that could be used as a specific remedy. We should not be surprised, after our careful examination of the occult forces, a plan...that these could be applied to correct imbalances in the astral and mental auras of Man. [9)] Baker, Douglas; Esoteric Healing Vol. 3, part 2, of \"The Seven Pillars of Ancient Wisdom: The Syntheses of Yoga, Esoteric Science and Psychology, Herts, England, (1976). Reported in Ankerberg, Can You Trust Your Doctor? Wolgemth & Hyatt, Publishers, Inc., Brentwood, Tennessee,(1991), p. 260. Flower essences are prepared by placing the petals in water and in the sunlight. The water is then said to contain the flower's essence. The water is administered by placing drops of it on the tongue at various times each day over an extended period of time. It may be that the person prescribing the flower essence will make the diagnosis and then choose the proper flower for treatment by use of a pendulum. [10)] Pfeifer, Samuel M.D., Healing at Any Price, Word (UK) Ltd. Milton Keynes, England , (1980), p. 124-125. Reported in Ankerberg, op. cit., p. 259. Applied kinesiology is another method of choosing the proper flower essence to prescribe. This is done by having the person being tested hold a flower essence vial in one hand and with the other arm outstretched, downward pressure is made on the arm. The arm will increase in strength when the best essence is held. It is a popular form of divination. Dr. Bach, an English homeopathic physician, a psychic, a believer in subtle energies, started the use of flower remedies. He developed thirty-eight different flower essences which are still available after more than eighty years. Since the death of Dr. Bach in 1936, many other flower essences have been added to the treatment protocol. At least five hundred different essences are available for treatment of a variety of maladies. How are these flower essences discovered for use in a specific ailment? Richard Gerber in his book Vibrational Medicine, page 512 explains: ...The information guiding their usage, like the information on previous Pegasus Products, comes from channeled sources. [11)]Gerber, Richard, M.D., Vibrational Medicine, the # 1 Handbook of Subtle-Energy Therapies, Bear and company, One Park Street, Rochester, VT, (2001), p. 512. ... Flower essences are directed mainly at treatment of emotional imbalances and personality dysfunctions. ...Unlike conventional drug therapies which impact solely at the level of physical cellular pathology, the energetic patterns contained within the flower essence work at the level of the emotional, mental, and spiritual vehicles. [12)] Ibid., p. 247. ... Bach believed that the illness-personality link was an out-growth of dysfunctional energetic patterns within the subtle bodies. He felt that illness was a reflection of disharmony between the physical personality and the Higher Self or soul....Bach links this relationship of the physical personality to the Higher Self (Godhood of man) via a re-incarnational philosophy. [13)] Ibid., p. 244. ESSENTIAL OILS & AROMATHERAPY Another part of herbology that has grown very popular is that of Aromatherapy. It, too, has its ancient origin in Ayurveda medicine. Its use is an attempt to heal through use of fragrances of botanical origin. The fragrances are extracted from plants by removing oils, called essential oils. Oils are obtained from plants by compression or by various distillation methods. Life force, universal energy, is believed to be contained within the oils and fragrance. By the application of the fragrance internally or externally this life force is believed to be transferred to an individual. The scientifically non demonstrable concept of electrical magnetic frequency or vibration of a plant is proclaimed to be within the fragrance and is said to be of a frequency faster than light, affecting the higher consciousness of an individual so as to be useful for healing emotional and mental faculties. The fragrance is considered to be the personality or spirit of the plant. It is believed to balance subtle energy flow (universal energy of high frequency). Aromas are used in Ayurveda to calm aggravated doshas (vata, pitta, kapha), three forces, taught in Ayurveda, that govern biological processes. Topical application with oil or creams containing the fragrance is said to affect the organ or organs in close proximity to where the application was made, imparting increased flow of energy. The fragrances are also used in baths and by inhalation. [14)] Tisserand, op. cit., p. 8. The chemistry of the fragrances is complex, consisting of alcohols, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and terpenes. They do not dissolve in water, only in oil, ether or alcohol. Aromatic oils are used in three classes of consumer goods: food, toiletries, and medicines. Foods: as natural flavorings, such as oil of lemon, lime, and orange; Cosmetics: perfumes, tooth paste, etc.; Medicine: for flavoring of medicinals, as therapeutics of their own right, such as oil of wintergreen, clove oil, peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil used in steam inhalations and ointments for topical applications. [15)] Ibid., p. 13. I can hear your thoughts! First, you tell me in the first paragraph above that use of essential oils and the fragrances they contain is spiritistic, and then you list many common scents and fragrances used in foods, cosmetics and medicinals. Are you trying to tell me that their use is spiritistic also? You just lost me! Bye. No! No! No! There is a difference, a distinct difference. Yet, this is a very difficult subject to make clear and of which to have a correct understanding. I am not sure I can give an answer applicable in all situations discerning which use is proper and which is not. I will try to give principles, and each person will have to use caution, wisdom and prayer to make that choice. Let us look first at the principles of use for these scents, flavorings and therapeutic substances that are not considered a part of aromatherapy. The reason for their use is to utilize their biochemical properties. The chemicals in an aroma such as eucalyptus oil are soothing to an irritated throat and bronchus and are used for respiratory infections. We are not using it because of some vibration of high frequency or due to its spirit connection. Oil of peppermint is useful for simple gastrointestinal distresses, due to its biochemical properties. Most anesthetics are gasses used for their effect on the central nervous system to allow painful procedures to be done without experiencing pain. Using these substances would not come under the definition of aromatherapy as the term is understood by holistic medicine practitioners. The above-mentioned examples and many other substances have been safely used for ages totally apart from any religious spiritistic connotation. Let us go back and look again at principles proclaimed in the use of aromatherapy by holistic healers. The following quotation is taken from the text The Art of Aroma Therapy by Robert Tisserand , a frequently quoted author on the subject of aromatherapy: Aromatherapy belongs to the realm of natural therapeutics. As such it is based on certain principles which are shared by acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, etc. These principles are complementary, and are based on man's interpretation of nature from his understanding of life. Surely the universe was created and is sustained on one set of principles, so there can only be one truth. .The main principles of our therapy are: Life Force, Yin\u2014yang, Organic foods [16)]Ibid., p. 45. Life Force: synonyms are chi, prana, mana, logos, orenda, the innate, animal magnetism, odic force, bio plasma, monism, self, higher self, divine self, purer consciousness, creative principle, essence, supreme ultimate, etc., etc. I refer the reader back to chapter 5 on Universal Energy. Tisserand continues elaborating on life force by telling us it is the same all-pervading force that is continually bringing about a state of health and harmony in the body. He tells us that it is the only power which can produce health for us. What the author does here is to describe the sustaining power of the Creator God, but separates God from His power and makes the power god itself. It is part of the pagan's counterfeit story of creation in contrast to the true creation by the Son of God, Jesus Christ, in harmony with the Holy Spirit and God the Father. Yin-yang: Yin and yang are words taken from the Chinese and used since there are no English words for direct translation. They are intrinsic to the Chinese story of creation, a story that removes a personal Being as the Creator and applies credit to a force, or as now referred to as an energy. This is seen in the following quote. The physical universe was created when Oneness became duality, and we can see this duality, this yin and yang, everywhere in the universe, in every atom, every action, and in every function of the human body. Yin and yang are manifest everywhere, except at the very centre of being, the perfect point of balance, at that infinite moment when the future becomes the past.\" \"Every single function of a living organism manifests these two forces\" ...\"To know which oil is predominantly yin or yang gives a basic guide to their application in sickness. [17)] Ibid., p. 49. Organic foods: When we think of people choosing to purchase and/ or eat only \"organic\" food, our understanding is that this involves a desire to avoid as much as possible contaminants in food such as the chemicals used in insect control, etc. It is also a thought that organic foods will have a better balance of the constituents of which they are made when not pushed in growth by various added minerals. The reason for choosing organic by many is all of the above, but also for some people there is a pagan religious belief involved. They believe that any interference with the growth of the plant will alter its Life Force. The fragrances\u2014essences of a plant are considered organic and work in harmony, to organize the body and its chemistry. They recognize the Life Force as the only power which can produce health. Aromas are a constituent of plants and are considered to be a concentration of Life Force I wish to share with the reader a few more comments made from a text on aroma therapy: Essential oils contain this mystery of life; they have powerful inexplicable energies too....Plants are the interface between cosmic energies and the earth, upon which we depend. [18)] Worwood, op. cit., p. xviii. From a brain biochemistry point of view, the pursuit of spirituality through aroma makes a great deal of sense, as the mechanics of smell are but one short biological step away from consciousness, including higher consciousness (godhood). Thinking of it in terms of light, essential oils are captured light, passed from the heavens, by plants, to us. From a vibrational, electromagnetic, and energetic point of view essential oils are in harmony with life. [19)] Ibid., p. XIX. I wish to share one more comment from this text of Aroma Therapy for the Soul: Twenty years ago in aromatherapy, there was an unwritten rule that we would not be open about the spiritual side of the essential oils we worked with. We talked about their anti-infectious qualities and their beautifying effects on the skin or about any number of benefits to body and mind. The positive spiritual changes were recognized, but silently. It seemed far too bold to suggest light and wisdom of the universe flowed through them, their fragrance like messengers from heaven, aromatic angels that come and touch us with the positivity and love of the deity.... With an etheric quality, essential oils activate the receptors of love, compassion, and empathy. They are an informational network, carrying messages and crossing boundaries, operating on many different levels. Through them, we can contact the wisdom of nature, the power of light, the energy of the universe and the love in our hearts. [20)] Ibid., p. XIX.. This comment opens to us the deceptiveness of the holistic movement. These healers capture the minds of people by the teachings that holistic healing therapies are actually effective on the biochemistry and physiological functioning of our bodies, that their actions can be explained by the sciences of physics and chemistry. This is a charade. That which gives power to these holistic methods, is the act of giving our will (power of choice) to that power. The physical methods of therapy are meaningless; it is the acceptance of the method and its perceived power which then allows Satan to exercise his control over us. Ayurvedic medicine and the Hindu religion of which Ayurveda is a component were established more than 3500 years in the past. Aromatherapy is an integral part of Ayurveda and Hinduism. The aromas are used to pacify aggravated doshas. Doshas (rajas\u2014tamas), the dualism of prana is the equivalent words in Sanskrit language to yin\u2014yang in Chinese. Aroma therapy is used to balance doshas. [21)] Gerson, Scott M.D., Ayurveda, The Ancient Indian healing Art, Element Books Limited (1997), p. 104. A question arises, how and by what means are these different aromas selected for use in treatment of various disorders? An answer comes from the book Vibrational Medicine, The Handbook of Subtle-Energy Therapies. Here in Dr. Gerber, the author is speaking of flower essences, but his words apply to aromas as well. Note the following quote: A number of flower-essence practitioners are learning to combine the knowledge and techniques of acupuncture, herbal medicine, and homeopathy with their use of flower essences, some practitioners use flower essences potentized as high homeopathic dilutions in order to release a higher energy and stronger life-force pattern to the patient.\"...He is now producing a new class of vibrational tinctures that are made from the captured light of stars and planets. Most flower essences and gem elixirs are produced utilizing the light of our local star, the sun, to imprint the various life-energy patterns into the storage medium of water (and alcohol). However, unlike conventional vibrational essences, these intuitively created star elixirs carry the energy and informational patterns of various stars and planets that can be ingested for particular vibrational and healing benefits. The information guiding their usage, like the information on previous Pegasus Products, comes from channeled sources (by spirits through mediums). [22)]Gerber, op. cit., pp. 511,512 (Emphasis added) Clearly, there are two purposes in use of aromas that come to us in oils or a tincture. One uses them to utilize their biochemical properties in foods, cosmetics, and medicinals; the other use seeks to use them so as to partake of their spiritual power. I think that after considering all of the information presented in this chapter, few Christians are going to choose to use aromas in order to gain a higher spiritual experience. We would not desire to have contact with spirits in our quest to secure healing. However, it is not uncommon for sincere devout Christians to seek out flower essences, essential oils, and aromas to find healing for some discomfort and or ailment. Often the purchase of these substances is done from a shop carrying all sorts of New Age merchandise. By entering into aromatherapy do I place myself in a position to be deceived even if I am aware of Satan's counterfeit and my desire is to only use the biochemical properties of the essential oil or aroma? Important question! How can I know that I am not choosing the power of spirits when I partake of aromatherapy? If I am a person who seeks to be a consultant or therapist in natural healing and wants to be sure of avoiding entanglement in a method that is a counterfeit and is one of Satan's deceptions, how can I recognize and avoid such? People tell me that when they purchase the essential oil containing a certain aroma, that they in no way believe in, or accept the spiritistic background associated with aromatherapy. They just want to get the good out of it and do not accept it as being spirit-discovered and/or empowered for its effectiveness. They use it because it works and they want no part in the rest of its trappings. They say they are strictly partaking of its biochemical properties to treat their malady. How do we know if an essence, essential oil, or its aroma really is able to do what we take it for? Has it been tested on thousands of people for those same symptoms, tested against a placebo? Has the aroma been tested by being exposed to the patient without his or her awareness and it gave the same relief even when one was not aware of receiving it? Does it do the same for most everyone with the same symptoms? Does it create the same response in animals when it is feasible to so test? Does it give immediate results when we are exposed to it or does it take time and repeated application for it to begin to give relief? These are a few of the questions we need to ask when considering as to whether the relief we receive from its use is really physiologic or an influence from a spirit. Am I spiritually safe to go to the New Age store to buy, to try out the different essences, from the many varieties of aromas to find the one that heals me? Has someone chosen the aroma for my therapy by use of the pendulum, the sway test, or muscle testing? I believe that there are spirits and that they have power but I am not going to have anything to do with them, I just want to get the substance that is helpful for me and I reject any spirit connection. That should prevent any spirit influence over me I ask: is that possible? Let us consider the first great deception in the Garden. Adam and Eve were told to avoid going near the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, as that was the only place Satan could tempt them; which was his ground. If they stayed away from there, Satan would have no influence on them. When Eve found herself near the tree she reasoned that she was capable of recognizing and resisting this fallen angel. She had no concept that the voice speaking to her was from Satan, the foe of God. Her protection vanished as she began to parley with the serpent. We, too, have been warned to stay off Satan's ground, as our protection will be diminished. Satan, the fallen prince, was jealous of God. He determined through subtlety, cunning, and deceit to defeat God's purpose. He approached Eve, not in the form of an angel, but as a serpent, subtle, cunning, and deceitful. With a voice that appeared to proceed from the serpent, he spoke to her. . . . As Eve listened, the warnings God had given faded from her mind. She yielded to the temptation, and as she tempted Adam, he also forgot God's warnings. He believed the words of the enemy of God [23)] White, E.G., Truth Triumphant, Page 26.2 (E.G. White Writings DVD 2007 Edition) . . . . The lie that Satan told Eve, \"Ye shall not surely die,\" has been sounding through the centuries from generation to generation. Thus Satan tempted our first parents, and thus he tempts us today [24)] Ibid., p. 26.4. is Satan's ground? It was my understanding that he is able to roam the whole earth. Yes, that is true, but there are places we may visit or frequent, attitudes we harbor, mistrust of God's leading, looking outside of His plan for aid, etc., that causes our guardian angel to separate from us. At that point, the warnings for our protection that God has given may well fade from our memories, leaving us on our own to face the tempter. And we are no match, no match at all. In Appendix H are listed many situations and conditions, but by no means all, that are said to be Satan's ground. It would be well to review them. As we near the close of this chapter I wish to quote a paragraph from a book that contains an excellent review of the source and power behind aromatherapy: But in almost all these systems which claim to utilize herbs, plants, and their etheric energies for diagnosis, healing, psychic development, altered states of consciousness, etc., the herbs and plants themselves possess no mystical power. As in crystal healing and similar methods, they are merely implements behind which spirit powers can work. They are no different than dowsing rods, crystals, radionic devices, Tarot cards, I Ching sticks, rune dice, or the Ouija board. No power resides in any of these implements themselves; they merely become a focal point behind which the spirits secure their goals. [25)] Ankerberg, op. cit., p. 261. Can Christians, safely, partake of a healing method that Satan invented for his use, and for 3500 years has been an integral part of pagan religions as a component of his counterfeit healing system, then give it a new face of proclaimed scientific properties, and incorporate it into our healing system, by saying \"I do not take of the belief system, I just take the good from it?\" The answer for me is No! The reader will make his or her own decision. Postscript: The writing of this chapter had been concluded and I was planning to send it to the editor for a professional touchup. I received email correspondence from an individual unknown to me, asking me to defend my position of naming the alternative therapeutic discipline of essential oils\u2014aromatherapy as being spiritistically deceptive. This individual was a spokes-person for a large company which grew various herbs and plants from which they extracted essential oils and in turn marketed them. She had displeasure with me because my book Spiritualistic Deceptions in Health and Healing had a few paragraphs that referred to essential oils and aromatherapy. She felt that my stand on this subject was detrimental to their company's \"mission\" of teaching people of the benefits of essential oils as medicinals for health. I will share with you some of our correspondence as it did bring up a few issues I had not included in this chapter. I believe it to be important to write a brief of our interchange of correspondence. Points she used to justify use of essential oils\u2014aromatherapy were presented to me in a way that I had not previously heard from individuals attempting to justify their use of aromatherapy. Covering some of these teachings and beliefs may be of value to others. It is not unusual for proponents of and especially marketers of various holistic therapeutic disciplines and/or products to attempt to tie in their use as being Biblical. So did my correspondent, I was informed that the Bible referred to essential oils 188 times. Frankincense and myrrh were aromatic oils and were given as gifts to the infant Jesus. (Actually they are resins not oils.) Twelve different aromatic oils are mentioned in the scriptures, with references to different uses for oils, cooking oils, oil for lamps, anointing, incense, etc. I checked all those verses. Out of l88 references to oil there was one mention of being used as a medicinal and that was the parable of the man who was beaten and robbed on his way to Jericho. The scriptures tell us that the Good Samaritan who took care of him placed oil on his wounds. It did not state which type of oil. Many medical therapeutic practices have been standard over time, yet that does not establish that they were effective. I searched the writings of E.G. White for comments about the Twelve Oils of Ancient Scripture listed in the web site of this company that the young lady represented. These oils are aloes/sandalwood, cassia, cedar, cypress, frankincense, galbanum, hyssop, myrrh, myrtle, onycha, rose of Sharon/cistus, and spikenard. When God directed the style of treatment to be used in Western Health Reform Institute in 1865 there was no mention of essential oils\u2014 aromatherapy. Yet aromatherapy had been used in Ayurveda for 3500 years prior. In the website given to me to check out, I found a very interesting article on essential oils entitled Twelve Oils of Ancient Scripture. The author Judy DeRuvo elaborated on each of the twelve. Listed in the next paragraph is a brief of the proclaimed uses and effects of using these aromatic oils. It is interesting that in the first sentence on the first oil, aloe/sandalwood, she refers to India, and thereafter the explanations are tied into Ayurveda (Hindu) vocabulary and principles. I will list some of her quips below, referring to the actions of these twelve oils she listed as being mentioned in Biblical scripture. Enhancement to meditation; allows mind to move into the deepest states of meditation; connects with the great cosmic prayer; affects chakra energy; links the kundalini energy at the base chakra with the crown chakra; aligns all the chakras and subtle bodies; keeps you grounded, close to your divine essence; empowers the will; supports the sacral chakra; helps release emotional toxins lodged in the subtle bodies; aligns the heart chakra of the mental body to the physical; cypress has frequencies that are in transition between the physical and spiritual (etheric) plane; clears blockage in energy flow; cypress oil disconnects spleen energy attachments.; spiritual and karmic implications; operates beyond the auric field; frankincense helps each of us to connect to that part of us which is eternal and divine; promoting clairvoyance; it opens the 3rd eye for connection; sheds light on life's purpose and on the inner self; it clears the aura and energy fields; it transmutes dense thought forms.

My first response to give answer to the question as to how I could include essential oils in my book on exposing spiritualistic deceptive practices in the medical field was to send this book's chapter on Mystical Herbology to the individual contesting my writing. The response back was that my chapter is only \"RHETORIC writing.\" \"It did not line up with scripture.\" Another teaching that seems common in aromatherapy lore is that at the time of the great Black Plagues in the fourteenth century, physicians put certain essential oils in a face mask in such a way that air breathed through a cloth soaked in essential oils which would protect from the infectious plague. This practice did occur but it was to offset the stench of death. Medical history books records this practice. There are no comments in the history books that it was protective from infection by destroying bacteria. The cause of the plague was then totally unknown. Bacteria were not discovered until the nineteenth century, 500 years after the plagues. I have a copy of an ancient drawing of this practice of a physician using a nose piece soaked in perfume. In the above dialogue two books were recommended in support of essential oils and aromatherapy being based in Judeo Christian scripture. The Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple: God's Love Manifest in Molecules, and Healing Oils of the Bible by David Stewart, Ph.D. Recently I received an e-mail request to give my opinion on these two books by an individual who has dabbled in essential oils and has a serious question, as to where is the border between the mystical aspect of use of essential oils and aromatherapy and a non-mystical use. This question is not new and has been difficult to answer. I have just finished reviewing the book on chemistry of essential oils. The author David Stewart has had significant education in physics and chemistry and lays out the chemical structures of many aromatic molecules and gives a synopsis of organic chemistry in an attempt to make clear to students of essential oils their molecular structure. He shares that he also is a Methodists minister. Stewart expresses his belief in a Creator God, One that made man in the image of God. I did not find a sentence establishing for certain his belief in a six day creation yet I gathered that such is his belief. There are direct comments made, however, that reveal a belief akin to pantheism (panentheism) concept of God's creation\u2014i.e., a spark of divinity in man and all creation. His discourse on the action of essential oils influence on the chemistry and physiology of man definitely include the concept of plants and their oils containing a divine attribute. When molecules of essential oils are inhaled, swallowed, applied to the skin, or internalized into your body in any way, they resonate with your bodily tissues at the frequencies intrinsic to their molecular spectrum as well as their resultant harmonic and beat frequencies. This will increase your own natural electromagnetic vibrations and restores coherence to your electric fields to produce healing and maintain wellness.... [27)] Stewart, David, Ph.D., The Chemistry of Essential Oils: God's Love Manifest in Molecules, Care Publication, Marble Hill, MO, (2005), p. 181. Science does not recognize such harmonic and beat frequencies. Such expressions are found only in the writing of New Age\u2014Neopagan literature. Essential oils also are said to respond to prayer/words and negative\u2014positive thoughts, demonstrated by their changing frequencies. Even the intent of the therapists or patient will guide the molecules of essential oils to the location in the body where they are to restore health. [28)] Ibid., p. 183. Molecules of essential oils are purported to contain subtle electromagnetic properties which allows them to communicate directly with cellular intelligence, similar to homeopathy remedies. [29)] Ibid., p. 229. Stewart presents support for these concepts by referring to the book Vibrational Medicine by Richard Gerber M.D. If you read \"Appendix C\" in this book, which is a critique on the book, Vibrational Medicine, mentioned above, you will read a comment made by its author Dr. Gerber, wherein he states that much of the information in that book came from channeling of spirits. Some other books that David Stewart recommends are from authors with similar beliefs. As I read further in Dr. Stewart's writings it seemed to me he has attempted to blend pantheistic concepts with Christianity and applied it to the scientific world. There is nowhere in the book any reference to scientific studies that substantiate his concepts. Healing Oils of the Bible another book by David Stewart follows a similar pattern of thought as the first book. I share with you my analysis of that text. In response to requests for me to write an appraisal of the book, Healing Oils of the Bible by David Stewart Ph.D. , it is necessary to again understand the author's world view as expressed throughout the text of his book. Vocabulary used by authors of different world views may be similar but with significantly different meanings. This is especially true of religious terms. David Stewart, says he is a Methodist minister who has had advanced education in biology, chemistry and physics. He freely expresses belief in creation by a God of the universe, by the breath of His mouth as recorded in the Bible. However he blends the Biblical account with the panentheistic concept\u2014God in everything\u2014divinity in all; that even plants have divinity within of which they can impart. He attempts to blend Eastern view of Reality with Biblical world view and they do not mix. In the Introduction of the book, a statement is made that plants and their essential oils contain an essence, have Life force, divine intelligence, and vibrational energy. Words that at first view might not be recognized for what the author is saying. The correct understanding of his use of these terms is ascertained more clearly as one reads through the book. They have definitely been used in the setting of a pantheistic world view. Stewart's intrigue continues as he explains that plants were brought into existence by the Thought and Word of God. No argument, however, he then tells us that the plants are also responsive to our thoughts and will respond accordingly. [30)] Ibid., p. XXI. Essential oils are said to have: Theological applications: - purification from sin [31)]Ibid., p. 19. - spiritual up lifting [32)]Ibid., p. 34. - possess divine intelligence [33)]Ibid., p. 92. - Impossible for God to lie therefore essential oils are truth [34)]Ibid., p. XVI. - demons are repulsed by essential oils' molecular high vibrational energies [35)]Ibid., p.. XXI. Psychological responses: - enhance spiritual state in worship [36)]Ibid., p. XXI.. - bring emotional releases [37)]Ibid., p. 26. - essential oils can release, unblock emotional congestion stored in various tissues other than brain [38)]Ibid., p. 79. - open up subconscious mind to release deep seated emotional trauma [39)]Ibid., p. 79.. - elevate spiritual consciousness [40)]Ibid., - balance electrical energies within the body giving courage, confidence, and selfesteem [41)]Ibid., p.80. Paranormal influence: - cause growth up to one inch in height of person [42)]Ibid., p. 90. - rapid correction of scoliosis and or kyphosis [43)]Ibid., p. 80.. - able to repulse demons [44)]Ibid., p. 19.. - able to be directed by thought or word to the part of body desired [45)]Ibid., p. 51.. - possess divine intelligence [46)]Ibid., p., 19. - use of oil by priests in ceremonial cleansing of a leper purported to be reflexology practice in Bible days [47)]Ibid., p. 51. - able to determine disease causing bacteria, virus, or parasite, from non-disease causing and eradicate the pathogenic (disease causing) ones [48)]Ibid., p. 77. Dr. Stewart blends science with Eastern religious concepts to the degree it is hard to know which he is relating to. He gives zero references to back up any conclusions he makes. Never did I find any reference to scientific studies to support his hypothesis and conclusions. He did mention that science at times has to use supposition and that he is free to do the same. The difference here is science gathers all the evidence that it is able to secure which came about by rigorous testing and evaluation and then makes a judgment call, willing to change with new evidence. I do not find such trend in his text. Is use of essential oils medically dangerous? Not likely. However, there needs to be an accurate diagnosis made before treatment with any method. To not treat a serious illness with a known beneficial treatment method presents a danger, especially when we seek out medically untrained to give us care. The most danger of all, however, is the participation in a proclaimed healing technique that has its roots in the Eastern dogma of reality. This association over time blurs our concept of origins and the mind more easily accepts the explanations given for healing by Eastern thought. We get caught in the web of false theory and give Satan homage and think we are honoring the Creator God. I believe it leads us into Satan's trap. Also the chemicals shown to have biological beneficial effects in animal and man as outlined in the book can be found in a variety of foods. It is not necessary to extract them by distillation to have access to such; they are referred to as phytochemicals. I close this chapter with a short quote from David Stewart and then you decide if use of essential oils is Biblical. Oil molecules are both receivers and transmitters of thought. They can receive and respond to our thoughts and, in turn, broadcast messages back to us and to our bodies. In fact, the best way to learn about essential oils is to talk to them and let them teach you as you use them. Sleep with them and pray with them and they will reveal their secrets to you...\" [49)] Stewart, op. cit., Chemistry of Essential Oils, p. 733. Mystical Herbology Video "}
