The study was conducted by researchers at the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and was published in the Journal of Acupuncture and Tuina Science. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of acupuncture on intestinal fibrosis in cases of Crohn's disease. The researchers measured the effects of acupuncture on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and type I collagen (Col I) in the intestines of laboratory rats with Crohn's disease. After the use of acupuncture, the expressions of Col I and bFGF reduced markedly in rats with Crohn's disease. The research proved that acupuncture treatment reduces abnormally high levels of these substances. By reducing the abonormally high levels of Col I and bFGF, acupuncture prevents fibrosis in the intestines of those with Crohn's disease. Acupuncture Points Acupuncture was applied at points St25 (Tianshu) and CV6 (Qihai). Electroacupuncture and moxibustion were applied in different groups. A separate control group did not receive acupuncture. The electroacupuncture and moxibustion groups showed marked improvement whereas the control group did not. The study shows that acupuncture and moxibustion reduce excessive deposition thereby treating fibrosis in patients with Crohn's disease. About Crohn's Crohn's disease (regional enteritis) is an inflammatory disease of the intestines. It can affect any area of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal bloating and pain, vomiting, weight loss, eye disorders, arthritis, dermatological disorders, and fatigue. Crohn's disease is considered to be an autoimmune system disorder of the GI tract. Genetics may play a role in its etiology, however, there is significant evidence that environmental factors contribute to this pathology. Smokers are approximately twice as likely to develop Crohn's disease. No western medicine cure exists for Crohn's disease and therefore most MD's focus on controlling the symptoms. Crohn's disease may cause growth failure in children and increases the risk of cancer in the affected regions of the intestines. Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's disease is often confused with ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease commonly affects the terminal ileum and the colon. Ulcerative colitis rarely affects the terminal ileum and always affects the colon. Crohn's disease commonly affects the anus and ulcerative colitis rarely affects the anus. Crohn's disease causes patchy or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcerations of the intestines whereas ulcerative colitis causes a continuous area of ulceration. Ulceration is shallow with ulcerative colitis but is deep with Crohn's disease. As a result, Crohn's disease may cause stenosis of the intestines. The study shows that acupuncture prevents fibrosis of the intestines thereby helping to prevent stenosis.

The California Acupuncture Board has released updates concerning applications for new California acupuncture schools. Oversight of acupuncture education is under the purview of the California Acupuncture Board and many new schools are applying for approval. There are approximately 20,000 acupuncturists in the USA and about half of them are practicing in California. New Acupuncture Schools: Overview Nine Star University in Sunnyvale, CA has had a recent site visit by the California Acupuncture Board and the application is pending final approval. The Institute of Clinical Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in Honolulu, Hawaii has completed the application review process and requires a site visit. The Hongik International University in Los Angeles, CA has completed the application review process and further information has been requested by the California Acupuncture Board. The Health Medicine University in Palo Alto, CA has submitted an application and a review is pending. The Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine & Acupuncture in Phoenix, Arizona is waiting on a California Acupuncture Board decision regarding out of state site visits. The Golden State University located in Downey, CA has just completed the site visit process. Oikos University in Oakland, CA and Finger Lakes School of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine located in New York are both pending review. Nine Star University (NSUHS) Nine Star University in Sunnyvale takes up a total of 10,921 square feet of space in a series of three buildings. It has 10 classrooms that can seat 15-20 people per room plus an additional 8 clinic rooms, an herb dispensary, a reception area, faculty and administrative offices, a computer lab, an event center that seats up to 150 people, and a library. The treatment rooms have space for between one to two acupuncture treatment tables. The library houses 2,600 books and the large event center is used for acupuncture continuing education classes for acupuncture CEUs, school events, and Tai Chi classes. Nine Star University is a non-profit organization and began operations in 2008. It is waiting for approval by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. Mr. Yang owns the building and is the only licensed acupuncturist practicing at the Nine Star University (NSUHS) location. Enrollment is 25 students in the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine program. NSUHS offers its program in English and Chinese but currently there are only students in the Chinese language acupuncture program. NSUHS employs 16 faculty members, 13 of whom are licensed to practice acupuncture in California. Golden State University (GSU) GSU takes up approximately 2,000 square feet including 2 acupuncture classrooms, a library, 3 clinic rooms, an herb dispensary, a reception area, and administrative offices. Ms. Kim is the only acupuncturist practicing at this location. GSU has 6 faculty members in its Master of Science in Oriental Medicine program that is offered in the Korean language. A bill to require California based health insurance policies to provide acupuncture coverage has been introduced into the California State Assembly by Assemblyman Mike Eng. The bill includes all healthcare insurance policies, including disability insurance policies, with the exception of HMOs (Health Maintenance Organization) and those that are \"specialized health care service plan contracts.\" If signed into law, the bill will take effect on January 1, 2012. A similar acupuncture bill was shot down with a veto in 2008 by then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger was also responsible for dissolving the California Acupuncture Board, leaving the profession without oversight for nearly an entire year until public pressure forced him to reinstate the California Acupuncture Board. Now, with Governor Jerry Brown in office, the bill may survive the legislative process. In 1975 during his first term, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law legalizing the practice of acupuncture by licensed acupuncturists and the California Acupuncture Board was created. Assemblyman Eng notes that acupuncture is an \"effective treatment for a number of conditions\" and further states that acupuncture is \"cost effective and typically much cheaper than the surgeries for which it is often an alternative.\" Assemblyman Eng's statements are supported by substantial research including studies showing that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of plantar fasciitis1, cramps21-22, tennis elbow23-24, and knee pain25-26. Assemblyman Mike Eng represents the cities of Alhambra, El Monte, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, San Marino, and South El Monte. The civilian population is slowly gaining access to acupuncture health insurance coverage. On the other hand, the military has been one area of the government which has been an early adopter of acupuncture as part of standard health care. The US Air Force runs a full time acupuncture clinic at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Col. Richard Niemtzow, an Air Force physician, first offered acupuncture in 1995 at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington now recommend acupuncture for the treatment of physical pain due to injuries. Dr. Stuessi (a Navy sports medicine physician who works in a special concussion restoration care center that utilizes acupuncture) notes, \"I've found phenomenal, off-the-charts results doing acupuncture for sleep, for dizziness and headaches.\" Also, the Navy has an acupuncture training program for doctors at Camp Pendleton in California. Dr. (Maj.) Ronald White, director of pain services at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, performs acupuncture in the US military and comments on its usefulness, \"There's no risk; it gives you benefit. Our goal \u2014 my end result \u2014 is function. If you come to me complaining that you can't play with your kids, you can't sleep at night, you can't work... six months later, I have you playing, sleeping and back to work....\" References: 1 Shi Ping Zhang, Tsui-Pik Yip, and Qiu-Shi Li.

New research proves that acupuncture relieves the pain of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is a painful inflammatory condition of the foot. Plantar fasciitis pain is usually perceived on the underside foot/heel and is often most painful with the first footsteps of the day. Also, plantar fasciitis may cause pain upon dorsiflexion (raising the ankle so that the foot is lifted towards the shin). This randomized, controlled study is interesting in that only one acupuncture point was tested for efficacy. In most studies, a combination of points are used to determine whether or not acupuncture is effective for reducing pain. The study tested point P7 (Daling, \"Big Tomb\"). P7 is located in the middle of the transverse crease of the wrist between the tendons of the m. palmaris longus and m. flexor carpi radialis on the palmer side of the body. P7 is a Shu-Stream point and Yuan (Primary) acupuncture point that is known for the treatment of Heart and Spirit related issues including myocarditis, palpitations, insomnia, mental illness, irritability, and cardiac pain. P7 is also used for Stomach related conditions, however, nearby point P6 is a more common point for the treatment of Stomach issues such as stomachache, nausea, and vomiting. According to Chinese medicine and acupuncture theory, Shu-Stream points treat a heavy sensation of the of the body and painful joints. P7 is therefore a common point for the treatment of wrist pain because it is a Shu-Stream point located at the wrist . However, the researchers have chosen P7 for the wrist's distal relationship to the ankle and heel region. In this study, P7 was needled bilaterally if the pain of the heel/foot was bilateral. Contra-lateral acupuncture needling was used if the pain was unilateral. The needles were 15mm long with a 0.25mm gauge. The acupuncture needles were inserted perpendicularly to a depth of approximately 10mm with slight rotation and thrusting to achieve the Deqi sensation. Deqi is often reported as a dull ache, numbness or heaviness. The needles were then manipulated every 5 minutes to maintain the Deqi sensation and the needles were retained for a total time of 30 minutes. A total of five treatments per week at a rate of one per day (Monday through Friday) for two weeks were administered for a grand total of 10 acupuncture sessions. All acupuncture needling was performed by experienced acupuncturists. At a six month follow-up examination, the P7 acupuncture group showed a significant improvement over the control group.

Mounting evidence suggests that acupuncture is an effective treatment for retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative eye disorder that may to lead to blindness. A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Acupuncture and Moxibustion concludes that acupuncture treatment protects the optic nerve from damage caused by intraocular pressure by alleviating stresses on retinal and optic nerve axonal ultrastructures.1 The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine published that the use of Chinese medicine improved retinal cone activity for patients with retinitis pigmentosa, even in cases of advanced retinal degeneration. Using electroretinograms for the investigation, the study also concludes that, \"TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) treatment could also enhance the bioactivity of (the) nerve network and therefore have a definite significance in retarding the progression of disease and keeping the central vision.\"2 In another study, injections of She Xiang into acupuncture points UB18 and UB23 helped patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The study concludes that injection of She Xiang into Ganshu (UB18) and Shenshu (UB23) \"can improve effectively the function and metabolism of optic cells, promote blood circulation of the retina, enhance the visual acuity, and protect the central vision for the patient of retinitis pigmentosa.\"3 Yet another study of retinitis pigmentosa patients receiving acupuncture (ranging from ages 7 - 75 years) showed significant improvement and a halting of deterioration of the visual field.4 Acupuncture points generally include a combination of local and distal points to brighten the eyesight and to treat the patient's underlying disharmonies per differential diagnosis. One study notes that retinitis pigmentosa patients with Spleen and Kidney Yang deficiency respond particularly well to Chinese Medicine.5 Although a genetic disorder, the progression of eyesight deterioration can be ameliorated by supplementation of the internal systems responsible for the homeostatic balancing of the retina. Local acupuncture points including St2, Yin Tang, Tai Yang, GB20, and Yu Yao are helpful in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. Distal points include GB37, triple needling of Du24. LI11 is added for heat with inflammation and Sp10 is added for patients with blood stagnation. Tonification and sedation of the point selection varies according to the differential diagnosis. Often, the peaceful technique is employed in the application of local points in order to harmonize the flow of blood and fluid in the eye and to avoid overstimulation.

The Colorado legislature has passed a bill allowing ear acupuncture to be performed by psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, licensed professional counselors, MDs, chiropractors, nurses, physician assistants, and addiction counselors. The bill, if signed into law by the governor, would require these professionals to obtain NADA (National Acupuncture Detoxification Association) certification so that they may perform ear acupuncture. The goal of the bill is to allow more professionals to use ear acupuncture for the purposes of treating mental and behavioral health issues and chemical dependency. Quantity and Quality Rep. Claire Levy, D-Boulder, supports the measure because she notes that it will make acupuncture \"more widely available and make it available at a lower cost.\" The Acupuncture Association of Colorado has not taken a stance on the bill. Acupuncturists have expressed concern that minimally trained healthcare professionals may deliver acupuncture at a lower cost but also with lower quality control and with less efficacious results. Proponents seek to create an inexpensive workforce to deliver basic supplementary care especially in the field of drug addiction recovery. Loopholes The unusual aspect of the Colorado bill is that it gives NADA certified healthcare professional wide latitude to treat numerous mental and behavioural disorders. The NADA certification involves only 70 hours of training. There is a concern that the Colorado law extends the scope of practice for non-acupuncturists performing acupuncture beyond the intent of NADA training. The Colorado bill also lacks language preventing non-acupuncturists from advertising and representing themselves as trained acupuncture professionals. Under the new Colorado bill, counselors and therapists would be able to use signage and advertising to represent their clinics as acupuncture clinics although no licensed acupuncturists may be present. Acupuncture CEUs toughen in the USA. Many changes to acupuncture CEU requirements have caused a great deal of confusion. Acupuncturists seeking to renew their licenses may learn that they have not completed new requirements for acupuncture CEUs. The largest concern is over new NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) requirements. NCCAOM acupuncture diplomates have learned of recent requirements for 'safety and ethics' courses but may not realize that even newer requirements have emerged. The NCCAOM now requires CPR certification in addition to four hours of 'safety and ethics' acupuncture CEUs. Last year, CPR certification was not a requirement and the recent confusion has been caused by last year's acceptance of CPR certification towards the 'safety and ethics' acupuncture CEU requirement. The NCCAOM has separated these requirements and CPR no longer counts towards the 'safety and ethics' requirement. CPR has become an additional standalone requirement. Another source of confusion is that NCCAOM acupuncture diplomates are not sure whether or not they need PDAs or CEUs to fulfill their acupuncture license renewal requirements. This is purely semantic and one acupuncture PDA (professional development activity point) is equal to one acupuncture CEU (continuing education unit). On the state level, some areas of confusion have emerged over California, Massachusetts, and Florida acupuncture CEUs. In Massachusetts, there is a 10 hour herbal medicine CEU requirement for licensed acupuncturists. Acupuncturists in Massachusetts express confusion as to which courses count towards this requirement. Adam White, HealthCMI President, spoke with the Massachusetts Committee on Acupuncture concerning this issue. White states, \"The confusion exists because no category exists for herbal CEU pre-certification in the NCCAOM system.\" White further noted that the Massachusetts Committee on Acupuncture has clarified that it is the individual acupuncturist's responsibility to determine how many hours of a course's CEUs count towards the herbal requirement. For example, if a course is taken (online or in-person) and is worth 15 acupuncture CEUs, the individual acupuncturist documents the amount of hours in that course material relevant to herbal medicine. If 10 hours of the course materials are determined to count toward the herbal requirement, then the acupuncturist has met the Massachusetts Acupuncture Committee requirements for re-licensure. Essentially, this is a self-monitored acupuncture continuing education requirement. California acupuncturists have expressed concern over the two-year 50 hour acupuncture CEU requirement. Unlike the NCCAOM which allows all CEUs to be taken online, the California Acupuncture Board allows only 25 acupuncture CEUs to be taken online. Also, the creation of 'category 1' and 'category 2' course delineations has caused some concern. All 'category 1' acupuncture CEUs are unlimited towards fulfilling acupuncture requirements. These are Chinese medicine core curriculum courses and all medicine related courses. However, only 5 hours of 'category 2' courses count towards acupuncturist license renewal. These are courses that, according to the California Acupuncture Board, are \"unrelated to clinical matters or the actual provision of health care to patients.\" The California Acupuncture Board further clarifies that Qi Gong, Tai Ji Quan, business classes, insurance billing classes, and practice management classes are all 'category 2' courses. Florida acupuncturists require several categories of CEUs (CEs) towards acupuncture license renewal. Of the 30 hours total required by the Florida Board of Acupuncture, two hours must be related to 'medical errors', two hours towards 'laws & rules', and five hours towards 'biomedical sciences'. For the first renewal period after initial licensure, requirements are for two hours of 'medical errors' acupuncture CEUs and 3 hours of 'HIV/AIDS' acupuncture CEUs. Lastly, the State of Illinois has officially barred any course with any mention of herbal medicine from counting towards acupuncture CEUs. Acupuncture for the treatment of concussions, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, and post traumatic stress syndrome gets increased use in the US military. In the most recent issue of Stars and Stripes, Dr. Stuessi (a Navy sports medicine physician who works in a special concussion restoration care center) notes, \"I've found phenomenal, off-the-charts results doing acupuncture for sleep, for dizziness and headaches.\" The US military has documented the usefulness of acupuncture since 1967 when an Army surgeon wrote an article on the efficaciousness of acupuncture in Military Medicine magazine. Since that time, doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington now recommend acupuncture for the treatment of physical pain due to injuries. The Air Force runs a full time acupuncture clinic at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Col. Richard Niemtzow, an Air Force physician, first offered acupuncture in 1995 at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Later, he founded the acupuncture clinic at Andrews in Maryland. In addition to clinical care for patients, they also train doctors to bring acupuncture therapy to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. The focus is on the treatment of pain and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Also, the Navy has an acupuncture training program for doctors at Camp Pendleton in California. Dr. (Maj.) Ronald White, director of pain services at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, performs acupuncture in the US military and comments on its usefulness, \"There's no risk; it gives you benefit. Our goal \u2014 my end result \u2014 is function. If you come to me complaining that you can't play with your kids, you can't sleep at night, you can't work, and six months later, I have you playing, sleeping and back to work....\" A recent randomized, double-blind study concludes that both auricular acupuncture and body acupuncture are effective in reducing pre and post-operative anxiety. Pre and post-perative anxiety has been identified in approximately 80 percent of patients, which prompted this investigation. The study was conducted by experienced acupuncturists at the Xi Jing Hosptial (Xi'an, China). The ear acupuncture group received needle stimulation at point ear Shenmen. The body acupuncture group received needle stimulation at Du20, SiShenCong, Yin Tang, Liv3, and St36. The needles were 0.25-.30 mm in diameter and ranged between 25-40 mm in length. Needle depth ranged from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm. Acupuncture therapy was administered for a period of four weeks at two sessions per week for a total of eight acupuncture treatments. The treatment principles were to increase lucidity, tranquilize by nourishing the Heart, calm the nerves, and regulate the Qi.

The final California Acupuncture Board exam results have been released for late 2010. Passing the California Acupuncture Board exam is a requirement for acupuncture licensure in the State of California. Looking at the statistics, South Baylo University sent the largest number of students to sit for the acupuncture exam. A total of 84 first time takers and 120 total takers (including re-takers) represented South Baylo University. The passage rate was 77% and 63% respectively. The number two slot for the sheer number of students sitting for the acupuncture exam was very close between the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (26 first time takers and 35 total with a pass rate of 88% and 74% respectively), the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (33 first time takers and 48 total takers with a passage rate of 64% and 65% respectively), and the University of East West Medicine (28 first time takers and 40 total with a pass rate of 86% and 72% respectively). Next in line for the sheer number of students sitting for the California Acupuncture Board exam came from Five Branches University (18 first time takers and 24 total with a passage rate of 89% and 72% respectively), the Acupuncture & Integrative Medicine College, Berkeley (19 first time takers and 29 total with a pass rate of 74% and 62% respectively), and Samra University (17 first time takers and 32 total with a pass rate of 65% and 41% respectively). The statistics were similar when comparing English, Chinese, and Korean language versions of the exam. The first time takers has a pass rate of 70% in English, 71% in Chinese, and 82% in Korean. Looking only at re-examinees, the pass rate was 35% in English, 31% in Chinese, and 34% in Korean. The combined total pass rate for the California Acupuncture Board exam for all languages was 59%. A special section labeled \"location note\" is included with most acupuncture points. This section makes finding acupuncture points a highly accurate and straightforward process. The commentaries on acupuncture points are highly detailed with rich historical clinical references and quotes from classical Chinese medicine texts. Moreover, an ample list of acupuncture point combinations for various applications accompanies most acupuncture points. There are several sections covering interesting acupuncture topics. One section, for example, covers cun measurements, point location, and the location of major organs. Another section covers the cutaneous regions and the 8 Extraordinary Vessels. It is nicely illustrated and accessible to everyone from the student to the expert. This book is also available on CD-ROM. The CD provides an easy process to lookup acupuncture information by a numerical point index, point name index, indication index, combination index, general index, and it also includes a glossary. This acupuncture book gets a top rating. It is accurate, well documented, and beautifully designed. A new clinical study examined acupuncture for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Rhinitis is nasal congestion usually accompanied with post-nasal drip. There is irritation and inflammation of nasal tissue. In western medicine, this is ascribed to a viral or bacterial infection (or other antigen such as pollen) that stimulates mucus production. The study examined a test group of 85 patients and notes that chronic rhinitis is due to wind-cold or wind-heat obstructing lung Qi. These perspectives, both from Chinese medicine and allopathic medicine, are reconcilable in that wind-cold and wind-heat typically involve either a microbial infection or another antigen-antibody response. If untreated, chronic rhinitis can last many years. Rhinitis can involve many complicated patterns such as epistaxis (nose bleeding), thick yellow or profuse white phlegm in the sinus and throat, coughing, insomnia, unclear thinking, difficulties with olfaction, dyspnea, asthma, and many other clinical complications. Acupuncture Effective Rate This recent clinical study had an effective rate of 96.5 percent with 61 persons obtaining total recovery, 21 with marked improvement, and 3 with no effect. To achieve the standard of total recovery, the resolution of all of the patient's symptoms required resolution. Rhinoscopy and absence of symptomology was used to confirm the results. A two year follow-up confirmed total recovery. At a rate of one treatment per day, fifteen acupuncture sessions consisted of one course of treatment. The 96.5 percent effective rate was achieved after two courses of treatment (30 acupuncture appointments) unless total recovery was achieved prior to completion of the second course of acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture Treatment Protocol The needles were 0.35 mm (28 guage) in diameter and 40-50 mm in length. The acupuncture chosen were: GB20 (Fengchi), LI4 3), and Du14 (Dazhui). Supplementary acupuncture points were chosen dependent upon differential diagnostics. In many cases, 20 minutes of manual needle manipulation were applied at each acupuncture visit. Tonification and reduction acupuncture needle techniques and moxa were chosen dependent upon excess, deficient, heat, and cold diagnostics. Etiology and Analysis of the Study In one analysis, the initial response to the pathogenic attack begins to linger as a residual pathogenic influence that never fully clears from the bodily system. In western medicine, a pathogen lodges in the body and stimulates the inflammatory chemicals of the complement cascade. In Chinese medicine, chronic rhinitis usually begins as a Wei or Qi level attack (Wen Bing, 4 levels) or a Tai Yang Shan Han, Tai Yang Zhong Feng, Tai Yang Su Xue, or Tai Yang Su Shui attack (six stages of cold induced illness). The lung Qi becomes compromised and the bodily system may develop a complex of excess and deficient patterns lodging in the Taiyin and Yangming acupuncture channels. There is no inconsistency with the modern medicine view that a microbial pathogen or other antigen is the cause of the chronic rhinitis. An antigen is sufficient to cause chronic rhinitis, however, other factors may initiate the inflammatory response absent invasive antigens. Therefore, antigens are not necessary to initiate rhinitis. In that sense, allopathic medicine measures some, but not all, of the etiological factors contributing to chronic rhinitis. In Chinese medicine, the overall physiological strength of the lungs and the pathways leading to the nasal system are equally as important as the immunological responses to antigens. Further, environmental conditions such as dryness, heat, dampness, coldness, etc... are important factors. Moreover, dietary and emotional factors play important roles in balancing the respiratory pathways.

A recent controlled study published in the Journal of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery notes that acupuncture is effective for restoring the sense of smell. The researchers studied participants with dysosmia (loss of sense of smell) due to viral infections. Acupuncture was applied to acupuncture (Tai Xi). The needles were manipulated by an expert acupuncturist with more than ten years of professional experience and were retained for 30 minutes. Several acupuncture treatments were administered over a 10 week period. A statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in the acupuncture patients. A control group receiving standard vitamin B complex therapy did not improve greatly. Acupuncture and Pharmaceutical Drugs Also of interest is that the patients chosen for this study had already tried standard western medical therapies but did not recover the sense of smell. Yet, these patients enjoyed a significant improvement in their olfactory senses with acupuncture treatment. Western medicine approaches include systemic and topical steroids, vitamin B therapy, caroverine, alpha lipoic acid, and several other medications. Scalp Acupuncture Scalp acupuncture was employed in this study by choosing Du16 and Du20. Scalp acupuncture is especially well suited for both head injuries and post-viral neurological dysfunction. Hopefully, future studies will choose to include Du24 (Shenting) in the acupuncture point selection. Use of triple needling, also referred to as ranked needling, at acupuncture point Du24 is a powerful method for benefiting the sense of smell. Du24 is known to eliminate wind, calm the spirit and benefit the brain, nose, and eyes. It is the meeting point of the Governing vessel with the UB and Stomach meridians. Its actions to expel pathogenic head wind make it an excellent choice for the treatment of post-viral dysosmia. Commonly used to treat rhinitis, this acupuncture point is well regarded for its ability to benefit and stimulate the nose.

New research shows that acupuncture reduces crying in infants with colic. A randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 90 infants ranging from 2 - 8 weeks of age were given six acupuncture treatments over a three week period. Acupuncture was applied to acupuncture point LI4 for 2 seconds to the treatment group of infants during each acupuncture session. The results conclude that \"acupuncture shortened the duration and reduced the intensity of crying in infants with colic.\" [1] Approximately 10 percent of newborn children experience colic. In western science, the etiology is often attributed to gastrointestinal disorders and allergic reactions to milk from cows. In some cases, colic may be behavioral manifestations from emotional imbalances due to parent-infant interaction difficulties. The latter western etiology may be interpreted as Liver Qi stagnation and the former diagnoses involve Spleen and Stomach disharmonies and food stagnation. The importance of acupuncture in the treatment of colic cannot be underestimated in that some of the western medicine treatments for colic have potential severe side effects including seizures, asphyxia and death.[2],[3],[4] The acupuncture study also points to two other studies showing the positive outcome for acupuncture in the treatment of infant night crying.[5],[6] In addition, the acupuncture study notes that a reduction in colic also reduces the chances of child abuse. The infants chosen for the acupuncture study met basic criteria. All infants were born after the 36th week of the pregnancy, did not receive treatment with dicyclomine, and exhibited crying or fussing for no less than three hours per day and no less than three days per week. Additionally, cow's milk needed to be excluded from the diet prior to inclusion in the acupuncture study to ensure that this was not the sole causative factor of colic. A registered nurse skilled in the application of acupuncture applied the acupuncture point to the infants. A 0.20 x 13mm uncoated, all stainless steel needle was applied to acupuncture point LI4 for 2 seconds at an approximate depth of 2mm, unilaterally. Next, the same acupuncture procedure was applied to acupuncture point LI4 on the other hand. Total time in the treatment room was approximately 5 minutes. Six acupuncture treatments were applied over a three week period using this procedure. The study notes that bilateral stimulation of acupuncture point LI4 for a longer duration of 20 seconds has a more immediate effect but that the role of this study was to show that even modest stimulation reduces colic. The study concludes, \"Standardized, light stimulation of the acupuncture point LI4 twice a week for 3 weeks reduced the duration and intensity of crying more quickly in the acupuncture group than in the control group.

A recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of laser acupuncture applied to acupuncture point P6 in the treatment of postoperative vomiting in children concludes that laser acupuncture reduces vomiting by 60% for children undergoing strabismus surgery. Laser acupuncture at P6 (Neiguan) was applied for 15 minutes before anesthesia and 15 minutes after arriving in the recovery room with a low-level laser diode for a period of 30 seconds each time. The output of the laser is a continuous 10mW with a wavelength of 670nm. The study concludes that the \"incidence of vomiting was significantly lower in the acupuncture group.\" The study also notes that the timing of the acupuncture treatment is of key importance. The authors cite that stimulation with the laser acupuncture must precede induction of anesthesia to achieve optimum results. The researchers reviewed several studies that did not find acupuncture and electro-acupuncture at P6 effective for several types of postoperative vomiting and note that these studies failed to apply acupuncture prior to induction of anesthesia. They suggest that all new research uses the protocol of applying acupuncture prior to anesthesia and following completion of the surgical procedure.

(1998) 81(4): 529-532 doi:10.1093/bja/81.4.529 A recent study shows that acupuncture as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has immediate effects in reducing nocturnal respiratory events, sleep disruptions, and desaturations (low oxygen levels in the blood). The researchers hypothesize that this improvement is due to acupuncture's effects on serotonergic pathways and also acupuncture's anti-inflammatory effects. Both manual acupuncture and 10Hz electro-acupuncture techniques were found effective. Both techniques produced superior clinical outcomes compared with 2Hz electro-acupuncture. Acupuncture Technique used by Acupuncturists The researchers used classical acupuncture techniques and acupuncture points in their study. The acupuncture points chosen for the the hyoid bone). Copper-handle 40 X 0.25mm needles were used and inserted to traditional depths. Electro-acupuncture was applied to the neck points CV23 and Shanglianquan and a separate pair were connected to LI4 and St36. Electro-acupuncture stimulation had wave pulses of 0.45 ms2 at 10Hz and increased to an intensity of between 0.6 - 0.8 mA which produced a mild twitch. The manual acupuncture group receive manual stimulation to the needle until deqi (sensation of heaviness or numbness) was achieved at each acupuncture point. The needles were retained for 30 minutes. Acupuncture Testing Procedures Laboratory findings used electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrocardiography. This tested respiration, mouth flow, and pulse oximetry with the use of an oximeter. Subjects were chosen for the study from a randomized process. Blinded independent researchers followed four groups: manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture at 10Hz, electro-acupuncture at 2Hz, control group. The researchers note that the electro-acupuncture was not tested for analgesia but rather for its effects on the lack of motor competence as a result of inflammation and other mechanisms responsible for reducing the activity of airway muscles. Discussion of Acupuncture and Airflow The researchers note that the acupuncture points of the neck are of specific interest because they stimulate the genioglossus muscle (secondarily, the mylohyoid muscle) on deep insertion. They note that stimulation of this lingual muscle affects airflow dynamics and may be a key reason as to why acupuncture is effective for improving the symptoms of patients with sleep apnea.

A new study shows that acupuncture is an effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). Nocturnal enuresis is involuntary urination during sleep and is most typical among children. Most children overcome this disorder by age seven but clinical conditions may persist indefinitely in some patients if left untreated. In a surprising finding, acupuncture was shown to be more effective than bedwetting alarms. Bedwetting alarms, a standard in conventional medicine, detect moisture and wake the patient with an audible tone. The study also concluded that electro-acupuncture achieved better clinical results than acupuncture without electricity. The researchers note that, \"Acupuncture can influence spinal micturition centers and parasympathetic innervation to the urinary tract and is known to modulate brain function via the descending serotonergic system.\" Nocturnal Enuresis According to Chinese Medicine Theory Nocturnal enuresis is caused by deficiency of Kidney Qi leading to the inability of the urination bladder to regulate urination. The kidneys form urine and the bladder stores and excretes urine. If the kidneys are deficient they are unable to support the function of the bladder in regulating urinary output. Chronic nocturnal enuresis typically exhausts the patient and leads to the inability to properly distribute nutrients to the body. In Chinese medicine theory this is referred to as Spleen Qi deficiency. As a result, this condition often presents with a pale complexion and a low appetite. Classic acupuncture points for this 28 October 2010 (Vol. 157, Issue 1, Pages 63-67) New research demonstrates that a session of 12 acupuncture visits using electro-acupuncture improves functions in children with autism. Electro-acupuncture caused improvements in language comprehension and self-care ability for the children in this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, clinical trial of acupuncture for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Electro-acupuncture also caused significant improvements in social initiation, receptive language, motor skills, coordination, and attention span. Improvements in motor coordination include better writing ability. Participants were better able to write words within set lines and squares. One participant had significant improvements in swimming ability and improvements in paper cutting were also noted. Interesting motor improvements include better walking posture, speed of walking, and ability to ascend and descend stairs. Over 70% of the children with ASD were compliant and adapted easily to the acupuncture therapy while 8% were not compliant. This was the first study ever conducted using electro-acupuncture for ASD using a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects from ages 3-18 participated in the study and children who had been taking anti-epileptic drugs or who had recently had acupuncture were excluded from the study. Classic acupuncture points for the treatment of autism were chosen for the study. Sishencong (EX-HN1), YinTang (EX-NH3), Ear naodian (AT3), and Ear (H7), TaiChong (Lv3), and Sanyinjiao (Sp6) were selected as complementary acupuncture points. Children were in either in a supine or sitting position for the 30 minute acupuncture treatment. Sterile disposable .3 X 4cm (30 gauge) acupuncture needles were used and points were connected with a portable electro-acupuncture device. The investigational sham acupuncture points were chosen at a 3-5mm distance from the real acupuncture points. The treatment principle was to \"to make the heart 'unobstructed,' regulate the liver, correct derangements or imbalances, enforce the emotion, dredge stasis, invigorate the spleen and kidney, and facilitate the source of vital function.\" References: Altern Med Rev. 2010 Jul;15(2):136-46.

HealthCMI Book Review Diagrams of Acupuncture Manipulations by Professor Liu Yan is an acupuncture needling technique book featuring everything from basic needling skills to expert acupuncture techniques. The diagrams are simple drawings that clearly delineate the information needed to understand the acupuncture methods presented. The text accompanying the diagrams is written in both English and Chinese making this book accessible to a very wide audience. The text is both clear and concise and is successful in communicating the acupuncture methods and their clinical applications for most of the acupuncture procedures presented. This is definitely a book specifically designed for practicing acupuncturists. We would like to have seen the acupuncture points labeled with letter-number combinations but only the Chinese characters and English pinyin names are presented. We do like that needling sensations are carefully described along with exact needling methods for each clinical application presented. There is something in this book for all acupuncturists from the beginning student to the veteran expert. The book starts with very basic acupuncture practice techniques and quickly shifts to many highly advanced methods for treating disease processes. 30 supplementary, 8 strengthening and reducing, 20 complex, 30 penetrating, and 23 types of artistic needling techniques are presented. Finally, the author presents an additional 11 special acupuncture techniques. However, several of the special acupuncture techniques are beyond the scope of an acupuncture practice unless situated in a hospital setting. A simple, clear, and concise presentation style makes this book an easy read for acupuncturists. This book is well suited for the acupuncturist interested in needling manipulation techniques and varying acupuncture procedures for treating specific ailments. Professor Liu Yan is well respected for his publications and this textbook represents an important effort to teach many important acupuncture approaches to internal medicine. Diagrams of Acupuncture Manipulations makes an important contribution to acupuncture continuing education. The NIH (National Institutes of Health) has awarded funding for the study of the safety, effectiveness, and functions of herbs including Da Suan (garlic), Dang Gui, Qing Hao (Artemisia), Gan Cao (licorice), and Shan Yao (yam). Acupuncturists have used these substances for over a thousand years but now three divisions of the NIH have funded research to better understand the role of these herbs. The garlic research will map the molecular pathways in which garlic stimulates cell function. Artemisia research will explore its molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in preventing metabolic syndrome which is a risk factor for diabetes and heart disease. The licorice research takes a close look at the impact of licorice on women's estrogenic hormones. The yam research investigates its effects on bone, uterus, breast tissue, breast cancer metastasis, and brain activity. The medical benefits of these herbs have been utilized by acupuncturists for their patients for over a thousand years. Now, the NIH supports research and documentation as to how such botanicals achieve clinical results. The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and the National Cancer Institute are taking a closer look to determine the clinical efficacy and mechanisms of action of these Chinese herbs. Five research centers receive the funding and are together known as the Botanical Research Centers (BRC). The research centers are located at Louisiana State University, University of Illinois (Chicago and Urbana-Champaign locations), University of Missouri, and Wake Forest University of Health Sciences. Other partner institutions include Oregon State University, Rutgers University (NJ), University of Colorado Health Sciences, Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts), John's Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland), and the Bent Creek Institute (Asheville, North Carolina).
