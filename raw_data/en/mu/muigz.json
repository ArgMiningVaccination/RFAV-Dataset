How does our balance system function? The vestibular organ, which controls balance and eye movements, is located in the inner ear. Our vestibular, or balance, system detects the position and movement of the head in relation to gravity, relaying sensory information from the eyes, bones, and joints to the brain and nervous system to maintain our sense of balance. If disease or injury disrupts these signals, it could result in a balance condition. What is dizziness? Dizziness is a general term used to describe how we feel when our balance system is impaired. Other words people may use to describe dizziness include \"feeling off balance,\" \"unsteadiness,\" \"vertigo,\" or \"light-headedness.\" What causes dizziness? There are many causes for dizziness that are not related to the ear or the balance system including but not limited to low blood sugar, thyroid conditions, and circulatory problems. Because there are many causes of dizziness, correctly identifying the underlying cause is a complex process that can require several doctors and clinicians working as a team to diagnose and properly treat the case. Why do I need to get my hearing tested too? Dizziness problems are often tied to, or lead to, hearing problems. A comprehensive evaluation of dizziness symptoms includes hearing testing, part of a complete vestibular evaluation. What is a vestibular evaluation? We offer a comprehensive vestibular evaluation consisting of diagnostic testing to determine if there is a dysfunction of the inner ear or higher processing structures. These tests help identify possible causes of dizziness/vertigo and guide treatment options. What takes place during a vestibular evaluation? - Testing typically takes up to 90 minutes to complete. - The audiologist will direct you through various head and body movements that may or may not provoke a sensation of dizziness. - Throughout testing the patient wears video goggles or electrodes to record and analyze eye movements.
