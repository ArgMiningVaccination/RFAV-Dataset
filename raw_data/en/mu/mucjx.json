(NASDAQ:MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced that it has completed submission of a regulatory application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its updated COVID-19 vaccine containing spike proteins for the XBB.1.5 sublineage of SARS-CoV-2 (mRNA-1273.815). \"The agility of our mRNA platform has enabled us to update Spikevax, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, to target XBB variants with speed clinical rigor,\" said St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna. \"We have been working diligently for months to build ample supply, with doses ready to ship in time for the fall vaccination season in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, our preliminary clinical testing has demonstrated that mRNA-1273.815 is effective in generating an immune response against the current XBB variants of concern. Over the past three years, Spikevax has consistently reduced hospitalizations and severe disease outcomes from COVID-19, and we encourage individuals to speak to their healthcare providers about receiving an updated vaccine.\" The submission is based on guidance from the U.S. FDA, which advised that COVID-19 vaccines should be updated to a monovalent XBB.1.5 composition. This is in alignment with other regulators and global public health agencies who have likewise recommended a monovalent XBB composition. At the recent VRBPAC, Moderna was the only company to submit preliminary clinical data comparing monovalent and bivalent vaccines and showing robust human immune responses across multiple XBB descendent sublineages such as XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3.2. The most common solicited local adverse event for Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccine was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events include headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills. The company is initiating additional applications to regulators around the globe and is prepared to deliver updated COVID-19 vaccines in time for the fall vaccination season. About Moderna In over 10 years since its inception, Moderna has transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA), to an enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio and integrated manufacturing facilities that allow for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale. Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators, which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing. Most recently, Moderna's capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use and approval of one of the earliest and most effective vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moderna's mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases and auto-immune diseases. Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past eight years. To learn more, visit [www.modernatx.com](https://pr.report/W62pwLUg).
