The following version is almost the same as appeared there, with a few [updates](#acu). Some of the later sections are self-plagiarised from earlier posts. Picture: Getty The age of enlightenment was a beautiful thing. People cast aside dogma and authority. They started to think for themselves. Natural science flourished. Understanding of the natural world increased. The hegemony of religion slowly declined. Eventually real universities were created and real democracy developed. The modern world was born. People like Francis Bacon, Voltaire and Isaac Newton changed the world for the better. Well, that's what most people think. But not Charles, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall. In 2010 he said \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment,\" he told a conference at St James's Palace. \"I felt proud of that.\" \"I thought, 'Hang on a moment'. The Enlightenment started over 200 years ago. It might be time to think again and review it and question whether it is really effective in today's conditions.\" It seems that the Prince preferred things as they were before 1650. That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society, a venture that got its Royal Charter from King Charles II in1622. I suppose that the Prince cannot be blamed for his poor education. He may have been at Trinity College Cambridge, his 2.2 degree is the current euphemism for a fail (it seems that he even failed to learn the dates of the enlightenment). His behaviour has brought to the fore the question of the role of the monarchy. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\". These are real powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. The Prince of Wales has been unusually public in expressing his views. His views bear directly on government policy in many areas: medicine, architecture, agriculture and the environment. These are mostly areas that involve at least an elementary knowledge of science. But that is something that he lacks. Worse still, he seems to have no consciousness of his ignorance. The Royal family should clearly have no influence whatsoever on government policies in a democracy. And they should be seen to have no influence. The Queen is often praised for her neutrality, but the fact is that nobody has the slightest idea what happens at the weekly meetings between the Prime Minister and the Queen. I doubt that she advises the prime minister to create a National Health Service, or to tax the rich. We shall never know that. We should do. Almost the only light that has been thrown on the secret activities of Charles was the release, on 13 May, of 27 letters that the Prince wrote to government ministers in the Blair government between 2004 and 2005. It has take 10 years of effort by the Guardian to get hold of the letters. It was ike getting blood from a stone. When the Information Commissioner ruled that the letters should be made public, the decision was vetoed by the Conservative attorney general, Dominic Grieve. [He said](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters). of the \"particularly frank\" letters, \" Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is precisely why the documents should be revealed. If Charles' ability to perform his duty as King is damaged, should his subjects be kept unaware of that fact? Of course not. In this case, the law prevailed over the attorney general. After passing through the hands of 16 different judges, the Supreme Court eventually ruled, in March, that the government's attempts to block release were unlawful. The government spent over \u00a3400,000 in trying, and failing, to conceal what we should know. The Freedom of Information Act (2000) is the best thing that Tony Blair did, though he, and Jack Straw, thought it was the worst. I expect they are afraid of what it might reveal about their own records. Transparency is not favoured by governments of any hue. What do the letters say? You can read all the letters on the [Guardian web site](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2015/may/13/read-the-prince-charles-black-spider-memos-in-full). They give the impression of being written by a rather cranky old man with bees in his bonnet and too much time on his hands. The problem is that not all cranky old men can write directly to the prime minister, and get an answer. Not all the letters are wrong headed. But all attempt to change government policy. They represent a direct interference in the political process by the heir to the throne. That is unacceptable in a democracy. It disqualifies him from becoming king. Some letters verged on the bizarre. | | 21 October 2004 I particularly hope that the illegal fishing of the Patagonian Toothfish will be high on your list of priorities because until the trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old albatross. No doubt illegal fishing is a problem, but not many people would write directly to a minister about the Patagonian Toothfish. Others I agree with. But they are still attempts to influence the policies of the elected government. This one was about the fact that supermarkets pay so little to dairy farmers for milk that sometimes it's cheaper than bottled water. | | To Tony Blair 8 September 2004 \". . . unless United Kingdom co-operatives can grow sufficiently the processors and retailers will continue to have the farmers in an arm lock and we will continue to shoot ourselves in the foot! You did kindly say that you would look at this . . . \". Yours ever, Charles He wrote to the minister of education to try to influence education policy. | | 22 February 2005 \"I understand from your predecessor, Charles Clarke, that he has spoken to you about my most recent letter of 24th November, and specifically about the impact of my Education Summer School for teachers of English and History. This Programme, which involves up to ninety state school teachers each year, has been held over the past three years in Dartington, Devon, at Dunston, in Norfolk and at Buxton, in Derbyshire. I believe that they have added fresh inspiration to the national debate about the importance of English Literature and History in schools.\" Despite having made substantial progress, as you may be aware I remain convinced that the correct approaches to teaching and learning need to be challenged It's interesting that the meeting was in Dartington. That's near Totnes (\" [twinned with Narnia](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/)\") and it's a centre for the bizarre educational cult promoted by the mystic and racist, [Rudolf Steiner](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/06/the-true-nature-of-steiner-waldorf-education-mystical-barmpottery-at-taxpayers-expense-part-1/). Then we get a reference to one of Charles' most bizarre beliefs, alternative medicine. | | 24 February 2005 Dear Prime Minister, We briefly mentioned the European Union Directive on Herbal Medicines, which is having such a deleterious effect on complementary medicine sector in this country by effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts. I think we both agreed this was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. You rightly asked me what could be done about it and I am asking the Chief Executive of my Foundation for Integrated Health to provide a more detailed briefing which I hope to be able to send shortly so that your advisers can look at it. Meanwhile, I have given Martin Hurst a note suggesting someone he could talk to who runs the Herbal Practitioner's Association. Yours ever, Charles In this he opposes the [ EU Directive on Herbal Medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). All this directive did was to insist that there was some anecdotal evidence for the safety of things that are sold to you. It asked for no evidence at all that they work, and it allowed very [misleading labels](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). It provided the weakest form of protection from the deluded and charlatans. It was put into effect in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). They even allowed products that were registered under this scheme to display an [impressive-looking \"kite-mark\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/) Most people would interpret this as a government endorsement of herbal medicines. This got a sympathetic response from Tony Blair, someone who, along with his wife, was notoriously sympathetic to magic medicine. | | 30 March 2005 Dear Prince Charles Thanks too for your contacts on herbal medicines who have been sensible and constructive. They feel that the directive itself is sound and the UK regulators excellent, but are absolutely correct in saying that the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy. We can do quite a lot here: we will delay implementation for all existing products to 2011; we will take more of the implementation upon ourselves; and I think we can sort out the problems in the technical committee - where my European experts have some very good ideas. We will be consulting with your contacts and others on the best way to do this we simply cannot have burdensome regulation here. Yours ever, Tony Note \"absolutely correct in saying that the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy. We can do quite a lot here: we will delay implementation for all existing products to 2011\". Government support for [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/) and herbal medicine was made explicit in [a letter from](http://www.dcscience.net/DH_Herbal_Medicine_Scanned_Letter.pdf) Health Secretary, [John Reid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reid,_Baron_Reid_of_Cardowan) (February 2005). He assures the prince that government is taking action to \"enhance the status of the herbal medicine and acupuncture professions\". Nothing could reveal more clearly the clueless attitude of the then government to quackery. In fact, after 15 years of wrangling, the promised recognition of herbalism by statutory regulation [never happened](http://www.dcscience.net/2015/03/30/herbs-get-the-push-no-statutory-regulation-for-western-herbalists-or-traditional-chinese-medicine/). One is reminded of the time that an equally-clueless minister, [Lord (Phillip) Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hunt,_Baron_Hunt_of_Kings_Heath), referred to [ 'psychic surgery' as a \"profession\"](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/05/22/lord-hunt-thinks-psychic-surgery-is-a-profession/). We got a preview of the Prince's letters a month before the release when Max Hastings [wrote in the Spectator](http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/diary/9487542/max-hastingss-diary-the-joys-of-middle-age-and-prince-charless-strange-letters/) I have beside me a copy of a letter allegedly written by him some years ago to a cultural institution, asserting the conviction that 'there is a DIVINE Source which is ultimate TRUTH... that this Truth can be expressed by means of numbers... and that, if followed correctly, these principles can be expressed with infinite variety to produce Beauty'. You can't get much barmier than that. Are the letters harmless? That has been the reaction on the BBC. I can't agree. In one sense they so trivial that it's amazing that the government thought it was a good use of \u00a3400,000 to conceal them. But they are all the evidence that we'll get of the Prince's very direct attempts to influence the political process. The Prince of Wales is more than just a crank. He has done real harm. Here are some examples. When the generally admirable NHS Choices re-wrote their advice on homeopathy (the medicines that contain no medicine) the new advice took two years to appear. [ It was held up in the Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/02/13/policy-based-evidence-department-of-health-and-princes-foundation-censor-accurate-information-about-magic-medicines/) while consultations were made with the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. That's Charles' lobby organisation for crackpot medicine. (The word \"integrated\" is the euphemism for alternative medicine that's in favour with its advocates.) If it were not for the fact that I used the Freedom of Information Act to find out what was going on, the public would have been given bad advice as a direct result of the Prince's political interference. The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) [folded in 2010](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/04/30/the-end-of-the-princes-foundation-for-magic-medicine/) as a result of a financial scandal, but it was quickly [reincarnated as the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/29/dont-be-deceived-the-new-college-of-medicine-is-a-fraud-and-delusion/). It was originally [going to be named the College of Integrated Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/), but it was soon decided that this sounded too much like quackery, so it was given the deceptive name, College of Medicine. It appears to be [financed by well-known outsourcing company Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/). It's closely connected with Dr Michael Dixon, who was medical advisor to the FIH, and who tried to [derail the advice given by NHS Choices](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/02/13/policy-based-evidence-department-of-health-and-princes-foundation-censor-accurate-information-about-magic-medicines/). Perhaps the worst example of interference by the Prince of Wales, was his [attempt to get an academic fired](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/12/hrh-\"meddling-in-politics\"/). Prof Edzard Ernst is the UK's foremost expert on alternative medicine. He has examined with meticulous care the evidence for many sorts of alternative medicine.Unfortunately for its advocates, it turned out that there is very little evidence that any of it works. This attention to evidence annoyed the Prince, and a letter was sent from Clarence House to Ernst's boss, the vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter, Steve Smith. Shamefully, Smith didn't tell the prince to mind his ow business, but instead subjected Ernst to disciplinary proceedings, After subjecting him to a year of misery, he was let off with a condescending warning letter, but Ernst was forced to retire early. In 2011and the vice-chancellor was rewarded with a knighthood. His university has lost an honest scientist but [continues to employ quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/). Not just interfering but costing taxpayers' money The Prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his Patients' Guide (I produced [a better version](http://www.dcscience.net/magic-medicine-the-short-version/) for nothing). And he was paid an astonishing \u00a3900,000 by DH to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods. And when his business branched into selling quack \"detox\" and herbal nonsense he found himself censured by both [the MHRA](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/duchy-originals-pork-pies.html) and the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/5/Duchy-Originals-Ltd/TF_ADJ_46199.aspx) (ASA) for making unjustifiable medical claims for these products. It runs in the family The Prince of Wales is not the only member of the royal family to be obsessed with bizarre forms of medicine. The first homeopath to the British royal family, Frederick Quin, was a son of the Duchess of Devonshire (1765-1824). Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 he conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. The RLHIM is a [great embarrassment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) to the otherwise excellent UCLH Trust. It has been repeatedly [condemned by the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6089#follow) for making false claims. As a consequence, it has been forced to withdraw all of its patient information. The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. The royal warrant for a firm that sells \"meningitis vaccine\" that contains nothing Ainsworth's homeopathic pharmacy is endorsed by both Prince Charles and the Queen: it has [ two Royal Warrants](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/04/yet-another-incompetent-regulator-the-general-pharmaceutical-council-is-criminally-negligent/), one from each of them. They sell \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, measles, rubella and whooping cough. These \"vaccines\" contain nothing whatsoever so they are obviously a real danger to public health. Despite the fact that Ainsworth's had already been [censured by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/7/Ainsworths-(London)-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_148070.aspx) in 2011 for selling similar products, Ainsworth's continued to recommend them with a \" [casual disregard for the law](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/ainsworths-pharmacy.html)\". The regulator (the MHRA) failed to step in to stop them until it was eventually stirred into action by a young BBC reporter, Sam Smith who made a [programme for BBC South West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI&feature=c4-overview&list=UUei35H3nu7bduw-6DBJFGrQ). Then, at last, the somnolent regulator was stirred into action. The MHRA \"told Ainsworths to stop advertising a number of products\" (but apparently not to stop making them or selling them). They still sell Polonium metal 30C and Swine Meningitis 36C, and a booklet that recommends homeopathic \"vaccination\". Ainsworth's sales are no doubt helped by the Royal Warrants. The consequence is that people may die of meningitis. In 2011, the MHRA Chief Executive Professor Kent Woods, was knighted. It was [ commented](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html), justly, that \"Children will be harmed by this inaction. Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator \" But the regulator has to fight the political influence of the Queen and Prince Charles. They lost. The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the Prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. The Prince's petulant outbursts not only endanger patients. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. It would help if they refrained from using their influence on matters that are beyond their intellectual grasp.. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any other question I'd ask someone with more education. Follow-up The letters have made headlines in just about every newspaper. The Guardian had extensive coverage, of course. The Times had a front page story \"Revealed: how Charles got Blair to alter health policy\" [ The British Medical Journal wrote \"Prince Charles delayed regulation of herbal medicines\" [ For me, the most shocking item was an interview given by Jack Straw, on Radio 4's Today Programme. He was Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Tony Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he was Lord Chancellor. His response to the letters sounded like that of a right-wing conservative. Like Blair. he deplored the Freedom of Information Act that his own government passed. He defended the secrecy, and supported the Conservative attorney-general's attempt to veto the release of the letters. Perhaps his defence of secrecy is not surprising, He has a lot to hide, His involvement in the mendacity that led to the Iraq war, the dodgy dossier, his role in covering up torture (the \"rendition\" scandal). And He was [suspended by the Labour party](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/22/jack-straw-malcolm-rifkind-cash-for-access-channel-4-dispatches-telegraph) in February 2015 due to allegation of cash bribes. He is certainly a man with plenty of things to hide. This article has appeared, in nearly identical form, [on the UK Conversation](https://theconversation.com/quacktitioner-royal-is-a-menace-to-the-constitution-and-public-health-16448) . You can leave comments there or here. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\" These are not inconsiderable powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. Charles, Prince of Wales, has been unusually public in expressing his views. [He told a conference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7147870/Prince-of-Wales-I-was-accused-of-being-enemy-of-the-Enlightenment.html) at St James's Palace \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment\" \"I felt proud of that.\" That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society. I have no doubt that Prince Charles means well. He can't be blamed for his lack of education. But his views on medicine date from a few centuries ago, and he has lost no opportunity to exploit his privileged position to proclaim them. Euphemisms for quackery He set up the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (PFIH) to promote his views. ( \"Integrated\", in this context, is, of course, just the latest euphemism for \"alternative\" or \"quack\".) When the Foundation collapsed because of a financial scandal in 2010, it was replaced by the \"College of Medicine\". The name changed, but [not the people](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) behind it. Initially this phoenix was to be named the \" [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263)\", but by this time the prince's views on medicine had become sufficiently discredited that the word \"integrated\" was quickly dropped. This might be thought less than frank, but it is just employment of the classic [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) technique, beloved by used car salesmen. His views were well publicised in a PFIH publication, \"Complementary Healthcare: a Guide for Patients\". That volume either omitted or misrepresented the evidence about the one question that matters most to patients - does the treatment work or not? It caused me to write a much shorter, but more accurate, version, the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). The PFIH guide was arguably a danger to public health. When, very properly, it was criticised by Edzard Ernst, [a letter was sent](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/11/health.monarchy) from from the prince's private secretary to Ernst's vice-chancellor, Steve Smith. Instead of defending Ernst's public spirited action, Smith [instituted disciplinary proceedings](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89) against Ernst that lasted for a year. The prince had intervened directly in the affairs of the university. Steve Smith was rewarded with a knighthood in 2011. None of this criticism has dimmed the prince's enthusiasm for barmy medical ideas. He is well known to write many letters to government ministers to try to persuade them to adopt his ideas in a whole range of areas. In July 2013, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, visited the prince at Clarence House. The visit was reported to be to persuade the minister to defend homeopathy, though it was more likely to have been to press the case to confer a government stamp of [approval on herbalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners by giving them statutory regulation. This is a matter that was recently raised again [in parliament](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0) by Charles' greatest ally, [David Tredinnick MP](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6007) (Con, Bosworth) who got into trouble for charging astrology software to expenses. We shall never know what pressure was applied. A ruling of the Information Commissioner judged, reasonably enough, that there was public interest in knowing what influences were being brought to bear on public policy. But the Attorney General [overruled the judgement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters) on the grounds that \"Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is exactly what we are worried about. Influence on politics The prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his guide, and an astonishing \u00a3900,000 to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). When NHS Choices (itself set up by DH to assess evidence) tried to rewrite its web page about that most discredited of all forms of quackery, homeopathy, officials in DH [referred the new advice to Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), the medical director of the Prince's Foundation and, were it not for the Freedom of Information act, the DH would have caused inaccurate information to be provided. The DH has a chief medical officer and two scientific advisors, but prefers to take the advice of the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods.

Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. | | The RLHIM is a The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. | | The Queen and Peter Fisher Observer 8 April 2007 The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value tradition and how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any question concerning science or medicine I'd ask someone with more education. Here is some more interesting reading Michael Baum's \" [An open letter to the Prince of Wales](http://dcscience.net/?p=645#baum): with respect, your highness, you've got it wrong\" Gerald Weissman's essay [Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales](http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/20/11/1755).

The Queen loves it. But alternative medicine centre's future looks uncertain as more NHS trusts axe funding\" Follow-up A recent post, [A right royal cock-up](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5966), got a lot more press attention than I'd expected. Perhaps I should have realised that the mainstream media are fascinated with anything that involves royalty. Here is my last word on that topic. My reasons for writing about it had very little to do with royalty. I was elected to the Royal Society in 1985 and I've tolerated the odd voting forms, and the election of Royal Fellows, in silence for the last 27 years. What made me speak out this time was almost entirely to do with Andrew's record of dubious behaviour. For me, it was a moral question, not a question of royalty per se. The election of Prince Andrew (as a \"Royal Fellow\", not on scientific grounds) attracted 171 votes and 1128 non-responders. I was curious to know why so many people failed to vote. I was also curious about [the statement](http://www.dcscience.net/Royal%20Society%20bust-up%20over%20Andrew%20_%20The%20Sunday%20Times.pdf) made to the Sunday Times \"David's [Colquhoun] views about our royal connections are very much in a minority\" Since I don't recall being asked, I'm baffled about what data (if any) on which that statement was based. There was only one way to find out. To ask. The following email was sent at around 5 pm on Friday 17 May. | | Subject: A very quick question about the election of Royal Fellows In the light of the recent publicity surrounding the \"election\" of Prince Andrew as a Royal Fellow, I thought that, because so few people voted, it would be interesting to know the views of all fellows on this tradition. This mail is being sent to the 1197 fellows whose email address is given in the Year Book. All you need to do is to hit reply and put YES or NO next to the following two questions. Only the total numbers are interesting. I promise not to reveal how anyone voted. 1) Do you think that the time has come to discontinue the tradition of electing Royal Fellows? 2) Do you think the election of Prince Andrew, in particular, has harmed the reputation of the Royal Society? NB These questions do not refer to the monarch as patron (but if you have an opinion about that. please say so). Best regards David Colquhoun The intention was to word it as neutrally as possible. Few people expressed an opinion about the monarch as patron. I see no harm in continuing that tradition myself. What happened? First, the Year Book is out of date. 106 emails bounced, several were \"out of office\", and a few recipients had died. So about 1080 emails should have arrived. I have no way of knowing how many were opened and read. After one week, 324 replies had arrived, almost twice as many as the 171 votes cast in the original ballot. A couple of responses were surprisingly abusive. More were supportive. Most made no comment. 70% of those mailed didn't respond. The 30% return rate is certainly a flaw, tnough not as big a flaw as the 13% return rate in the orginal poll, Perhaps 30% isn't so surprising. A weekly newsletter goes out to all UCL staff, and it has interesting information, though a bit too PR-like for my taste. But I'm told that 50% of emails sent out are never even opened, never mind read. The results were as follows. Of 302 who answered question 1, 131 (43%) said YES Of 284 who answered question 2, 151 (53%) said YES It was noticeable that those who work outside the UK were distinctly more likely to say NO. Perhaps they are unaware of the extensive press coverage about Andrew in the UK? 54 answers were received from people with .edu addresses, 32% yes for question 1, and 38% yes on question 2. If these are excluded on the grounds that they are unlikely to be aware of the problems, the results are Of 248 who answered question 1, 114 (46%) said YES Of 239 who answered question 2, 134 (56%) said YES It might also be relevant almost half the fellows are 70 years old or older and 80% of fellows are 60 or older. That's not surprising because very few people are elected at younger than 40, many are much older, and once in, you are in for life. What can we conclude? (1) 70% of those mailed have little interest in the politics of the RS, and there is no way to know whether they even opened my mail, (2) Roughly half of those who expressed an opinion agreed with me so (3) it is not true that \"David's [Colquhoun] views about our royal connections are very much in a minority\". It seems to me that these numbers provide a good case for the RS Council to consider whether or not it is a good idea to continue to nominate Royal Fellows. One more thing The Sunday Times was also told \"The Duke of York is beloved by the tabloids but he has always had a robust defence in these issues . . . I think David is quite wrong to raise that\" It is most certainly not true that Andrew's reputation is bad only in tabloid newspapers. Try this leader in the Times (March 2011) \" [Undiplomatic Envoy. Prince Andrew's friendship with a convicted US financier is an embarrassment.

And of course it was the Guardian who published [the cables ](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/175722) that revealed Andrew's curious attitude to bribery in arms deals. These are not tabloids. The fact that every newspaper has written this sort of thing is what caused me to worry that his election would not go down well with the public. One of the most alarming aspects of the affair was the comments left by readers on the various newspaper articles. They did not give the impression that the public was as impressed by the Royal Society as its fellows tend to be. That is bad for everyone because the society does much good work, in funding science (in particular the excellent University Research Fellowships which give young scientists five years of independence). Postscript I do sometimes wonder about the value of prizes and honours. My attitude to them is very much like that of one of my great scientific heroes, Richard Feynman. Watch this. Follow-up 26 May 2013 The Sunday Times was onto the story quickly again, with a short piece. The cartoon isn't totally appropriate (for me) since I've said repeatedly that it is Andrew's morals that worry me, far more than his royalty. | | \"In causing NHS Choices to publish content that is less than completely frank about the evidence on homeopathy, the DH have compromised the editorial standards of a website that they themselves established\". . . \". . . they have failed the general public, by putting special interests, politics, and the path of least resistance (as they saw it) before the truth about health and healthcare.\" [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx) is usually a good source of information for the public. But there is one exception: the information they provide about alternative medicine is poor. A Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the attempt of NHS Choices to rewrite their pages more accurately was censored by the Department of Health in conjunction with the late Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The Department of Health (DH) has misled the public. The earliest version of the homeopathy information page recorded by the Wayback Machine was [November 12 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112004009/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx). It was still there on [December 5 2010](http://web.archive.org/web/20101205113830/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx). The comments were mostly critical. One said, quite correctly, | | I find it most regrettable that the way NHS has covered this subject is to give uncritical voice to the claims of homoeopathy without giving readers the information they need to evaluate those claims.

Throughout 2011, and up to [October 2012](http://web.archive.org/web/20121017183301/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx) the information page on homeopathy read | | Introduction Content on homeopathy has been removed from the website pending a review by the Department of Health policy team responsible for complementary and alternative medicines.

For more information about homeopathy see the Then, at the [end of 2012](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/pages/introduction.aspx), the page reappeared. It was a bit better than the original, but not much. Many of the comments criticise the misleading nature of the information (as well as the usual \"it worked for me\" comments). The \"useful links\" still has six links to flat-earth organisations like the Society of Homeopaths, and only one to a sensible source, the [excellent pamphlet](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/data/files/resources/54/Homeopathy.pdf) from Sense about Science. They do link at the end to the [2010 Science and Technology Committee Report: Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 1.61Mb)](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/45.pdf), and to the [Government Response to the Science and Technology Committee Report, Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 69kb)](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf) but no comment is made on the findings. Policy-based evidence I wondered why the NHS Choices page, after an absence of almost two years, had returned in such an unsatisfactory form. So I asked them. After a reminder, I was told that my queries were being dealt with not by NHS Choices, but had been referred to Dr Sunjai Gupta \"the DH official with responsibility for this area\". [Dr Sunjai Gupta OBE](http://sites.idea.gov.uk/localinsight/2011/03/09/dr-sunjai-gupta-obe/) is Deputy Director of Public Health Strategy and Social Marketing, Department of Health. Dr Gupta is not obviously sympathetic to woo. It's hard to tell since he doesn't seem to have published much. But one is not reassured by an article that he wrote for the [Journal of Holistic Healthcare](http://www.bhma.org/pages/journal/6.2-detail.php?searchresult=1&sstring=Gupta#inline1). It appears straight after an article by fantasy herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360). Despite assurances that I'd hear from Dr Gupta shortly, nothing happened. So I sent a request for the correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act (2000). Although the request was addressed to NHS Choices, a public body, strenuous efforts were made to divert it to the Department of Health. These were resisted. Nevertheless when, after a long delay, the material arrived, it came not from NHS Choices, but from DH, who had evidently vetted it,. The emails were rather shocking [ [download all](/NHS-choices-emails-AppendixA-(redacted).pdf)]. A mail dated 1 December 2009 said This is the most direct statement I've seen that, in the Department of Health, policy dictates evidence. NHS Choices is meant to provide evidence, but what they say has to be checked by DH to make sure they \"don't clash with any policy messages\". The re-written page The original version of the re-written page was sent to me by David Mattin, who worked for NHS Choices until September 2012. You can [download the whole draft](/Homeopathy-first-draft-for-upload-a.pdf) here. It is an enormous improvement on the original page. For example, it says | | \"Does it work? Many independent experts would respond to this question 'no, homeopathy does not work' There is no good quality clinical evidence to show that homeopathy is more successful than placebo in the treatment of any type of condition. Furthermore, if the principles of homeopath were true it would violate all the existing theories of science that we make use of today; not just our theory of medicine, but also chemistry, biology and physics. This original draft was sent to Mattin on 29 January 2010. After editing it for length Mattin sent it to DH for approval. Over the next two years, DH removed much of the accurate content. Mattin's own comments on this evisceration are reproduced [below](#mattin). The DH emails All the names have been redacted. Needless to say, nobody is willing to take responsibility. But the number of people who support magic medicine is really quite small so the main players were easy to identify. During the nearly 2 year absence of the homeopathy page, dozens of changes were made by DH. It seems that the policy message with which the NHS Choices draft failed to comply were those of the [Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Prince%27s+Foundation+for+Integrated+Health%22), and its [successor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) (after April 2010), the [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), now known as the [ College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). NHS Choices sought advice about their redrafted pages from the right person, [Sir Iain Chalmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Chalmers), one of the founders of the [Cochrane Collaboration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration). On 3 Nov 2009, Chalmers advised | | The most reliable source in the country - and one of the most reliable in the world - is Professor Edzard Ernst, professor of Complementary Medicine at the Peninsular Medical School, Ernst returned his suggestions in July 2010, but it seems that few of them survived the subsequent 18 months of revisions by DH. On 2 December 2009, a mail from the NHS headquarters (Quarry House, Leeds) was sent to NHS Choices This makes it perfectly clear that DH regards the Prince's Foundation, and the equally flaky [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC: known on the web as Ofquack)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) as appropriate guides for public health policy. The fact of the matter is that regulation of magic medicine by the government has [been a total disaster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5562), because, it seems, DH regards the Prince of Wales as a reliable source. On 29 December 2009, the Prince's Foundation went on the attack. On 10th January 2010, two more letters were sent to DH by the Prince's Foundation. At 13.48 they wrote And at 22.14 on the same day, it was followed up with The references to Devon and to Thought Field Therapy, make it very obvious that these letters were written by [Dr Michael Dixon OBE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#dixon), who was medical director of the Prince's Foundation, and who is now a director of the \"College of Medicine\". And the object of Dixon's bile is obviously Edzard Ernst (the quotation is from his book, [Trick or Treatment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh)). I find it fascinating to see just how venomous quacks become when the evidence contradicts their views. The cuddly \"holistic\" veneer quickly vanishes. It gets worse. On 21 January 2010, a mail from NHS Choices to DH said The only person in the country who fits this description is the (in)famous [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22). It is simply mind-boggling that DH regards him as an appropriate person to advise on anything. After that, NHS Choices kept asking DH to sign off the documents, and changes continued to be made. Almost two years later, DH were still stalling. The admission that \"We are a bit short of doctors within DH these days\" is interesting. A bit short of anyone capable of critical thinking would be more accurate. The most interesting document that I got from DH was an intermediate draft of the rewritten page on homeopathy (undated). [Download the document](/NHS-Choices-hoemopathy-draft.pdf). Here are a couple of extracts. It's a story of two years of meddling and procrastination. The end result misinforms the public. Right at the start, the NHS Choices draft says, reasonably enough A House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos and that the principles on which homeopathv is based are \"scientifically implausible\". But a comment, added apparently by DH, says Can we remove this statement? This report is really quite contentious and we may well be subject to quite a lot of challenge from the Homeopathic community if published. What on earth? The DH seems to think that that its job is not to present the evidence, but to avoid challenges from the homeopathic community! And true enough, this piece is missing from the final version. A bit later, the NHS Choices draft was censored again \"A 2010 Science and Technology Committee report said that scientific tests had shown that homeopathic treatments don't work\" But again this doesn't appear in the final version. The comment, apparently from DH, says \"The DH response to this report (point 24) doesn't support this statement though\" That's a gross distortion of [point 24](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf), which actually concludes \"The Government Chief Scientific Adviser cannot envisage scientifically credible proposals for funding for research into homeopathy in the future\" NHS Choices was not happy with the result Shortly before the revised page was published, Paul Nuki, Editor in Chief of NHS Choicea, sent an email to DH. | | Date: 7th September 2011 Time: 3:33:42 pm Hi I've been through the CAM articles and asked that we publish them asap as requested. For the record, we will be publishing these pieces outside of the normal editorial process. Although originally signed off by a suitably qualified clinician, the time lapse and policy changes have been so substantial as to render that null and void. We also don't have a formal It doesn't need much reading between the lines to see that he was unhappy with the result. It will be interesting to see whether the [Information Standard](http://www.rsph.org.uk/en/products-and-services/Certification/rsph-certification-and-the-information-standard/index.cfm) people at the Royal Society for Public Health do anything about it. The Department of Health has not just ignored evidence but actively opposed it. That's the only possible conclusion from the documents that I was sent. And it's pretty shocking that the DH has preferred advice from the Prince's Foundation and its handful of acolytes (in particular Michael Dixon and George Lewith) to the findings of the Science and Technology Select Committee and the views of the Chief Scientific Advisor. In January this year, the Chief medical Officer, [ Dame Sally Davies, said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9822744/Homeopathy-is-rubbish-says-chief-medical-officer.html), in a rare outburst of candour | | 'I'm very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious disease,\" she said. \"I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.\" Dame Sally, who is England's most senior doctor, concluded by remarking that homeopathy \"is rubbish\". | | So one part of DH is working to contradict another part. the Chief Medical Officer. Perhaps Sally Davies should have a word with Dr Gupta. This all predates the advent of Jeremy Hunt (and known defender of homeopathy) as health minister. But the sympathies of some DH people are made obvious by the presence on the [ DH web site of an article](http://www.personalhealthbudgets.dh.gov.uk/Topics/latest/Resource/?cid=8167&excludepageid=2289) \"Personal health budgets: A new way of accessing complementary therapies?\". This astonishing piece confirms the worst fears that quacks will see personal health budgets as a commercial opportunity to peddle their wares. The article is by Jim Rogers of Lincoln University. What his paper does not mention is Rogers' conflict of interest. He's a homeopath, and he has a paper in the International Journal of High Dilution Research (yes, there is a journal for every form of make-believe). You can [download a reprint](/Rogers-paper-IJHDR,_9,32_(_2010)_JRogers.pdf) of this paper. It advocates more research into homeopathic provings, something that even George Lewith [seems to have given up on](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). It's about time that the DH started to listen to the Chief Medical Officer. As it is, some people at DH seem to prefer the advice of the Prince's Foundation, and to actively suppress employees who prefer evidence to anecdote. One thing is clear. The DH is an unholy mess. Parts of it are intent on producing policy-based evidence. Comment by David Mattin, who edited the first draft for NHS Choices David Mattin left NHS Choices in September, 2012. He edited the new version and lived through the two years of wrangling with DH during which much of the best content was eviscerated. He sent me this statement about the affair. | | As an editor at NHS Choices, I viewed it as my job to present evidence-based information to the public. The article we prepared on homeopathy stayed true to that central purpose: it made clear to readers that there is no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for any health condition, and also presented the broad scientific consensus that the supposed method of action of homeopathy is implausible. What followed was a two year story of delay, and eventual suppression, of that article. My strong impression was of DH civil servants who lacked the courage, and, frankly, the energy to stand up to the criticism from special interest groups that they anticipated would arise because of the article; and that did indeed arise when a draft of the article and other draft content on complementary and alternative medicines fell into the hands of the Prince's Foundation and other CAM groups. The attitude of DH civil servants, broadly, was simply to tell us 'we can't say this about homeopathy, people will complain'. They seemed to have no interest in making an appraisal of the evidence on homeopathy themselves to see if what we were saying was actually true or not. We repeatedly pushed back with the message: 'some people may very well complain, but if what we are saying about the evidence base is true - and it is - then we must simply weather those complaints, and stand by our content. Our duty is to supply our readers with the best information, not to please the homeopathy community.' But these arguments were disregarded. The DH civil servants were almost entirely concerned with the politics of the situation - that is, the politics as they saw them - and the possibility that this article may create new work for them, and very little concerned with the evidence itself, or the presentation of this evidence to the public. The whole episode is an insight into the way special interest groups can influence the workings of government and the public sector simply by making a lot of noise, and having a few powerful friends. In causing NHS Choices to publish content that is less than completely frank about the evidence on homeopathy, the DH have compromised the editorial standards of a website that they themselves established, and that they fund. They have sold out the NHS Choices editorial team, who work tirelessly to fulfil their remit. And, most seriously, they have failed the general public, by putting special interests, politics, and the path of least resistance (as they saw it) before the truth about health and healthcare. Follow-up 13 February 2013 The Guardian version of this story, written by Sarah Boseley, is [Prince's charity lobbied government to water down homeopathy criticism](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/13/prince-charity-lobbied-government-homeopathy). It's fine as far as it goes but it doesn't name any names. There are some good comments though. 14 February 2013. The printed Guardian gave the story full 5 column-width coverage. [ [download print version](/Guardian-DeptHealth140213.pdf)] And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). On 14 February, the Guardian version was Editor's Choice by lunchtime, and the Guardian web version already had 414 comments, mostly sensible (though this blog got far more referrals from twitter than from the Guardian) And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). 15 February 2013. The Daily Mail had very fair coverage of the story. The Guardian closed the comments on the story when it had got 642 comments, most of them very sensible. And this page got almost 6000 hits in 24 hours. The majority of the referrals came from Twitter rather than from the Guardian, despite the direct link to the page from the Guardian. 18 February 2013. The affair featured in BMJ News [ [download the reprint](/DH-homeop-bmj-news-2013.pdf)]. The item featured prominently on the BMJ news page. 19 February 2013 Only six days of this post, the [NHS Choices page](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?a=1) has been re-written again, in a much improved form. That looks like bloggers 1, DH 0. It is baffling that it's left to bloggers, working for nothing, to extract a bit of sense from the highly-paid civil servants at the Department of Health. But at least they listened this time, which is a lot more than happens often. Paul Nuki, who runs NHS Choices, deserves congratulations. Of course the revised page still doesn't call a spade a spade, but it gets close at times. I like the way it starts \"Homeopathy is a 'treatment' based\". Notice the quotation marks. Reputation management? Incidentally, NHS Choices is outsourced to the [(in)famous company, Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). And the moderation of the comments on their site is outsourced again to [Tempero](http://tempero.co.uk/), which describes itself as a \"reputation management\" company. Each of them creams off money meant of patient care. This discovery might explain why I and others have had comments rejected by NHS Choices several times. \"Reputation management\" is the antithesis of evidence. It is public relations, i.e. paid lying. That is quite wrong for a site that is meant to provide dispassionate information. 21 February 2013. Sadly a step backwards. Part of the improved page was removed. This bit. The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said there is no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent or cure diseases. She has made it clear she is particularly concerned about the use of homeopathy in developing countries as a so-called cure for malaria. We can only speculate why this was removed, because it was true. In fact she accurately described homeopathy as \"rubbish\". Why she should not be quoted beats me. The Scottish Universities Medical Journal asked me to write about the regulation of alternative medicine. It's an interesting topic and not easy to follow because of the veritable maze of more than twenty overlapping regulators and quangos which fail utterly to protect the public against health fraud. In fact they mostly promote health fraud. The paper is [now published](http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf), and here is a version with embedded links (and some small updates). We are witnessing an increasing commercialisation of medicine. It's really taken off since the passage of the Health and Social Security Bill into law. Not only does that mean having NHS hospitals run by private companies, but it means that \"any qualified provider\" can bid for just about any service. The problem lies, of course, in what you consider \"qualified\" to mean. Any qualified homeopath or herbalist will, no doubt, be eligible. University College London Hospital advertised for a spiritual healer. The \"person specification\" specified a \"quallfication\", but only HR people think that a paper qualification means that spiritual healing is anything but a delusion. The vocabulary of bait and switch First, a bit of vocabulary. Alternative medicine is a term that is used for medical treatments that don't work (or at least haven't been shown to work). If they worked, they'd be called \"medicine\". The anti-malarial, artemesinin, came originally from a Chinese herb, but once it had been purified and properly tested, it was no longer alternative. But the word alternative is not favoured by quacks. They prefer their nostrums to be described as \"complementary\" -it sounds more respectable. So CAM (complementary and alternative medicine became the politically-correct euphemism. Now it has gone a stage further, and the euphemism in vogue with quacks at the moment is \"integrated\" or \"integrative\" medicine. That means, very often, integrating things that don't work with things that do. But it sounds fashionable. In reality it is designed to confuse politicians who ask for, say, integrated services for old people. Put another way, the salespeople of quackery have become rather good at bait and switch. The wikepedia definition is as good as any. Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are \"baited\" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are \"switched\" to a costlier product. As applied to the alternative medicine industry, the bait is usually in the form of some nice touchy-feely stuff which barely mentions the mystical nonsense. But when you've bought into it you get the whole panoply of nonsense. Steven Novella has [written eloquently](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) about the use of bait and switch in the USA to sell chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine: \"The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives, the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that don't work or are at best untested and highly implausible.\". The \"College of Medicine\" provides a near-perfect example of bait and switch. It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health. The Prince's Foundation was a consistent purveyor of dangerous medical myths. When it collapsed in 2010 because of a financial scandal, a company was formed called \"The College for Integrated Health\". [A slide show](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), not meant for public consumption, said \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". But it seems that too many people have now tumbled to the idea that \"integrated\", in this context, means barmpottery. Within less than a month, the new institution was renamed \"The College of Medicine\". That might be a deceptive name, but it's a much better bait. That's why I described the College as a [fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). Not only did the directors, all of them quacks, devise a respectable sounding name, but they also succeeded in recruiting some respectable-sounding people to act as figureheads for the new organisation. The president of the College is Professor Sir Graham Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Names like his make the bait sound even more plausible. He claims not to believe that homeopathy works, but seems quite happy to have a homeopathic pharmacist, Christine Glover, on the [governing council of his college](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). At least half of the governing Council can safely be classified as quacks. So the bait is clear. What about the switch? The first thing to notice is that the whole outfit is skewed towards private medicine: see [ The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). The founder, and presumably the main provider of funds (they won't say how much) is the huge outsourcing company, Capita. This is company known in Private Eye as Crapita. Their inefficiency is legendary. They are the folks who messed up the NHS computer system and the courts computer system. After swallowing large amounts of taxpayers' money, they failed to deliver anything that worked. Their latest failure is the [court translation service](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract).. The president (Catto), the vice president (Harry Brunjes) and the CEO (Mark Ratnarajah) are all employees of Capita. The second thing to notice is that their conferences and courses are a bizarre mixture of real medicine and pure quackery. Their 2012 conference had some very good speakers, but then it had [ a \"herbal workshop\" with Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360) (see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lGhp0PNHVnc)) and David Peters (the man who tolerates [dowsing as a way to diagnose](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) which herb to give you). The other speaker was Dick Middleton, who represents the huge herbal company, Schwabe (I debated with him [on BBC Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3RZ6K0Ng0c&feature=player_embedded)), In fact the College's [Faculty of Self-care](/COM-Self-care.pdf) appears to resemble a marketing device for Schwabe. Why regulation isn't working, and can't work There are various levels of regulation. The \"highest\" level is the statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic. The General Chiropractic Council (GCC) has exactly the same legal status as the General Medical Council (GMC). This ludicrous state of affairs arose because nobody in John Major's government had enough scientific knowledge to realise that chiropractic, and some parts of osteopathy, are pure quackery, The problem is that organisations like the GCC function more to promote chiropractic than to regulate them. This became very obvious when the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) decided to sue Simon Singh for defamation, after he described some of their treatments as [\"bogus\", \"without a jot of evidence\"](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/good-day-in-court.html). In order to support Singh, several bloggers assessed the \"plethora of evidence\" which the BCA said could be used to justify their claims. When, 15 months later, the BCA produced its \"plethora\" it was shown within 24 hours that the evidence was pathetic. The demolition was summarised by lawyer, David Allen Green, in [The BCA's Worst Day](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html). In the wake of this, over 600 complaints were made to the GCC about unjustified claims made by chiropractors, thanks in large part to heroic work by two people, [Simon Perry](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/500-chiropractors-reported-to-trading.html) and [Allan Henness](http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Simon Perry's [Fishbarrel](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/fishbarrel-easy-way-to-report.html) (browser plugin) allows complaints to be made quickly and easily -try it). The majority of these complaints were rejected by the GCC, apparently on the grounds that chiropractors could not be blamed because the false claims had been endorsed by the GCC itself. My own complaint was based on phone calls to two chiropractors, [I was told](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) such nonsense as \"colic is down to, er um, faulty movement patterns in the spine\". But my complaint never reached the Conduct and Competence committee because it had been judged by a preliminary investigating committee that there was no case to answer. The impression one got from this (very costly) exercise was that the GCC was there to protect chiropractors, not to protect the public. The outcome was a disaster for chiropractors, wno emerged totally discredited. It was also a disaster for the GCC which was forced to admit that it hadn't properly advised chiropractors about what they could and couldn't claim. The recantation culminated in the [GCC declaring, in August 2010](http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf), that the mythical \"subluxation\" is a \"historical concept \" \"It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease.\". Subluxation was a product of the fevered imagination of the founder of the chiropractic cult, D.D. Palmer. It referred to an imaginary spinal lesion that he claimed to be the cause of most diseases. .Since 'subluxation' is the only thing that's distinguished chiropractic from any other sort of manipulation, the admission by the GCC that it does not exist, after a century of pretending that it does, is quite an admission. The President of the BCA himself [admitted in November 2011](http://chiropracticreport.com/portal/images/back_issues/No_%206%20-%20Nov%202011.pdf) \"The BCA sued Simon Singh personally for libel. In doing so, the BCA began one of the darkest periods in its history; one that was ultimately to cost it financially,\" As a result of all this, the deficiencies of chiropractic, and the deficiencies of its regulator were revealed, and advertisements for chiropractic are somewhat less misleading. But this change for the better was brought about entirely by the unpaid efforts of bloggers and a few journalists, and not at all by the official regulator, the GCC. which was part of the problem. not the solution. And it was certainly not helped by the organisation that is meant to regulate the GCC, the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which did nothing whatsoever to stop the farce. At the other end of the regulatory spectrum, voluntary self-regulation, is an even worse farce than the GCC. They all have grand sounding \"Codes of Practice\" which, in practice, the ignore totally. The Society of Homeopaths is just a joke. When homeopaths were caught out recommending [sugar pills for prevention of malaria](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2855), they did nothing (arguably such homicidal advice deserves a [jail sentence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661)). The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) is widely know in the blogosphere as Ofquack. I know about them from the inside, having [been a member of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) their Conduct and Competence Committee, It was set up with the help of a \u00a3900,000 grant from the Department of Health to the Prince of Wales, to oversee voluntary self-regulation. It fails utterly to do anything useful.. The CNHC code of practice, paragraph 15 , states \"Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated\". When [Simon Perry made a complaint](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html) to the CNHC about claims being made by a CNHC-registered reflexologist, the Investigating Committee upheld all 15 complaints. But it then went on to say that there was no case to answer because the unjustified claims were what the person had been taught, and were made in good faith. This is precisely the ludicrous situation which will occur again and again if reflexologists (and many other alternative therapies) are \"accredited\". The CNHC said, correctly, that the reflexologist had been taught things that were not true, but then did nothing whatsoever about it apart from toning down the advertisements a bit. They still register reflexologists who make outrageously false claims. Once again we see that no sensible regulation is possible for subjects that are pure make-believe. The first two examples deal (or rather, fail to deal) with regulation of outright quackery. But there are dozens of other quangos that sound a lot more respectable. European Food Standards Agency (EFSA). One of the common scams is to have have your favourite quack treatment classified as a food not as a medicine. The laws about what you can claim have been a lot laxer for foods. But the EFSA has done a pretty good job in stopping unjustified claims for health benefits from foods. Dozens of claims made by makers of probiotics have been banned. The food industry, needless to say, objects very strongly to be being forced to tell the truth. In my view, the ESFA has not gone far enough. They recently [issued a directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:FULL:EN:PDF) about claims that could legally be made. Some of these betray the previously high standards of the EFSA. For example you are allowed to say that \"Vitamin C contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue\" (as long as the product contains above a specified amount of Vitamin C. I'm not aware of any trials that show vitamin C has the slightest effect on tiredness or fatigue, Although these laws do not come into effect until December 2012, they have already been [invoked by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/6/Natures-Best-Health-Products-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_179089.aspx) has a reason not to uphold a complaint about a multivitamin pill which claimed that it \"Includes 8 nutrients that can contribute to the reduction in tiredness and fatigue\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This is almost the only organisation that has done a good job on false health claims. Their [Guidance on Health Therapies & Evidence](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/Guidance%20on%20Health%20Therapies%20and%20Evidence%20QA%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) says \"Whether you use the words 'treatment', 'treat' or 'cure', all are likely to be seen by members of the public as claims to alleviate effectively a condition or symptom. We would advise that they are not used\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" They are spot on. The ASA's [Guidance for Advertisers of Homeopathic Services](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/CAP/CAP/Guidance%20for%20Advertisers%20of%20Homeopathic%20Services%20September%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) is wonderful. \"In the simplest terms, you should avoid using efficacy claims, whether implied or direct,\" \"To date, the ASA has have not seen persuasive evidence to support claims that homeopathy can treat, cure or relieve specific conditions or symptoms.\" That seems to condemn the (mis) [labelling allowed by the MHRA](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) as breaking the rules.. Sadly, though, the ASA has no powers to enforce its decisions and [only too often they are ignored](http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/3rd%20Letter%20to%20Homeopathy%20Adv%203.ashx). The [Nightingale collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has produced an [excellent letter](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/images/stories/POS_advertising_of_homeopathic_products.pdf) that you can hand to any pharmacist who breaks the rules The ASA has also [judged against claims](http://nightingale-collaboration.org/news/111-working-within-the-qcranial-paradigmq.html) made by \"Craniosacral therapists\" (that's the lunatic fringe of osteopathy). They will presumably uphold complaints about [similar claims](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) made (I'm ashamed to say) by UCLH Hospitals. The private examination company Edexcel sets [exams in antiscientific subjects](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), so miseducating children. The teaching of quackery to 16 year-olds has been approved by a maze of quangos, none of which will take responsibility, or justify their actions. So far [ I've located no fewer than eight](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454) of them. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (OfQual), Edexcel, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), Skills for Health, Skills for Care, National Occupational Standards (NOS), private exam company VTCT and the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.. Asking any of these people why they approve of examinations in imaginary subjects meets with blank incomprehension. They fail totally to protect tha public from utter nonsense. The Department of Education has failed to do anything about the miseducation of children in quackery. In fact it has encouraged it by, for the first time, giving taxpayers' money to a Steiner (Waldorf) school (at Frome, in Somerset). Steiner schools are run by a secretive and cult-like body of people ( [read about it](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Steiner+Waldorf)). They teach about reincarnation, karma, gnomes, and all manner of nonsense, sometimes with unpleasant racial overtones. The [teachers are trained ](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/)in Steiner's Anthroposophy, so if your child gets ill at school they'll probably get homeopathic sugar pills. They might well get measles or mumps too, since Steiner people don't believe in vaccination. Incredibly, the University of Aberdeen came perilously close to appointing a [chair in anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261) This disaster was aborted [by bloggers](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/), and a last minute intervention [from journalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261). Neither the university's regulatory mechanisms. nor any others, seemed to realise that a chair in [mystical barmpottery](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) was a bad idea. Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading. It is the statutory duty of Trading Standards to enforce the Consumer Protection Regulations (2008) This European legislation is pretty good. it caused a lawyer to write \" [Has The UK Quietly Outlawed \"Alternative\" Medicine?\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) Unfortunately Trading Standards people have consistently refused to enforce these laws. The whole organisation is a mess. Its local office arrangement fails totally to deal with the age of the internet. The situation is so bad that a group of us decided to put them to the test. The results were published in the Medico-Legal Journal, Rose et al., 2012. [\"Spurious Claims for Health-care Products](http://www.dcscience.net/Rose-medico-legal-2012.pdf): An Experimental Approach to Evaluating Current UK Legislation and its Implementation\". They concluded \"EU directive 2005/29/EC is largely ineffective in preventing misleading health claims for consumer products in the UK\" Skills for Health is an enormous quango which produces HR style \"competences\" for everything under the son. They are mostly quite useless. But those concerned with alternative medicine are not just useless. [They are positively harmful.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215'#sfh) Totally barmy. There are competences and National Occupational Standards for every lunatic made-up therapy under the sun. When I phoned them to discover who'd written them, I learned that the had been drafted by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Magic Medicine. And when I joked by asking if they had a competence for talking to trees, I was told, perfectly seriously, \"You'd have to talk to LANTRA, the land-based organisation for that.\" That was in January 2008. A lot of correspondence with the head of Skills for Health got nowhere at all. She understood nothing and it hasn't improved a jot. This organisation costs a lot of taxpayers' money and it should have been consigned to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" (but of course there was no such bonfire in reality). It is a disgrace. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is supposed to ensure the quality of university courses. In fact it endorses courses in nonsense alternative medicine and so does more harm than good. The worst recent failure of the QAA was in the case of the University of Wales: see [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675). The university was making money by validating thousands of external degrees in everything from fundamentalist theology to Chinese Medicine. These validations were revealed as [utterly incompetent](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) by bloggers, and later by BBC Wales journalist Ciaran Jenkins (now working for Channel 4). The mainstream media eventually caught up with bloggers. In 2010, BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that [exposed the enormous degree validation scam](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) run by the University of Wales. The programme can be seen on YouTube ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)). The programme also exposed, incidentally, the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which did nothing until the scam was exposed by TV and blogs. Eventually the QAA sent nine people to Malaysia to investigate a dodgy college that had been revealed by the BBC. The trip cost \u00a391,000. It could have been done for nothing if anyone at the QAA knew how to use Google. The outcome was that the University of Wales stopped endorsing external courses, and it was soon shut down altogether (though bafflingly, its vice-chancellor, Marc Clement was promoted). The credit for this lies entirely with bloggers and the BBC. The QAA did nothing to help until the very last moment. Throughout this saga Universities UK (UUK), has maintained its usual total passivity. They have [done nothing whatsoever](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=42) about their members who give BSc degrees in anti-scientific subjects. (UUK used to known as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals). Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), soon to become the PSAHSC, Back now to the CHRE, the people who failed so signally to sort out the GCC. They are being reorganised. Their [consultation document](http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120416_-_standards_for_consultation_-_PDF.pdf) says \"The Health and Social Care Act 20122 confers a new function on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (the renamed Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence). From November 2012 we will set standards for organisations that hold voluntary registers for people working in health and social care occupations and we will accredit the register if they meet those standards. It will then be known as an 'Accredited Register'. \" They are trying to decide what the criteria should be for \"accreditation\" of a regulatory body. The [list of those interested](http://www.chre.org.uk/voluntaryregisters/421/) has some perfectly respectable organisations, like the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk/). It also contains a large number of crackpot organisations, like [Crystal and Healing International, as well as joke regulators like the CNHC](http://crystalandhealinginternational.co.uk). They already oversee the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is [due to take over Herbal medicine ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117)and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with predictably disastrous consequences. Two of the proposed criteria for \"accreditation\" appear to be directly contradictory. Para 2.5 makes the whole accreditation pointless from the point of view of patients 2.5 It will not be an endorsement of the therapeutic validity or effectiveness of any particular discipline or treatment. Since the only thing that matters to the patient is whether the therapy works (and is safe), accrediting of organisations that ignore this will merely give the appearance of official approval of crystal healing etc etc. This appears to contradict directly A.7 The organisation can demonstrate that there either is a sound knowledge base underpinning the profession or it is developing one and makes that explicit to the public. A \"sound knowledge base\", if it is to mean anything useful at all, means knowledge that the treatment is effective. If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean? It seems that the official mind has still not grasped the obvious fact that there can be no sensible regulation of subjects that are untrue nonsense. If it is nonsense, the only form of regulation that makes any sense is the law. Please fill in the consultation. My completed return [can be downloaded](CHRE-consultation.docx) as an example, if you wish. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should be a top level defender of truth. Its strapline is \"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" The MHRA did something (they won't tell me exactly what) about one of the [most cruel scams that I've ever encountered, Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/05/29/the-esperanza-scandal-office-of-trading-standards-useless-mhra-a-bit-better/), peddled for multiple sclerosis, at an outrageous price ( \u00a36,759 for 12 month's supply). Needless to say there was not a jot of evidence that it worked (and it wasn't actually homeopathic). Astoundingly, Trading Standards officers refused to do anything about it. The MHRA admit (when pushed really hard) that there is precious little evidence that any of the herbs work, and that homeopathy is nothing more than sugar pills. Their answer to that is to forget that bit about \"ensuring that medicines ... work\" Here's the MHRA's [Traditional Herbal Registration Certificate](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con134892.pdf) for devils claw tablets. The wording \"based on traditional use only\" has to be included because of European legislation. Shockingly, the MHRA have allowed them to relegate that to small print, with all the emphasis on the alleged indications. The pro-CAM agency NCCAM rates devil's claw as \"possibly effective\" or \"insufficient evidence\" for all these indications, but that doesn't matter because the MHRA requires no evidence whatsoever that the tablets do anything. They should, of course, added a statement to this effect to the label. They have failed in their duty to protect and inform the public by allowing this labelling. But it gets worse. Here is the MHRA's [homeopathic marketing authorisation for the homeopathic medicinal product Arnicare Arnica 30c pillules](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf) It is nothing short of surreal. | || | Since the pills contain nothing at all, they don't have the slightest effect on sprains, muscular aches or bruising. The wording on the label is exceedingly misleading. If you \"pregnant or breastfeeding\" there is no need to waste you doctor's time before swallowing a few sugar pills. \"Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one\". Since the pills contain nothing, it doesn't matter a damn. \"If you overdose . . \" it won't have the slightest effect because there is nothing in them And it gets worse. The MHRA-approved label specifies ACTIVE INGREDIENT. Each pillule contains 30c Arnica Montana No, they contain no arnica whatsoever. | || | It truly boggles the mind that men with dark suits and lots of letters after their names have sat for hours only to produce dishonest and misleading labels like these. When [this mislabeling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) was first allowed, it was condemned by [just about every scientific society](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30), but the MHRA did nothing.

Conclusions The regulation of alternative medicine in the UK is a farce. It is utterly ineffective in preventing deception of patients. Such improvements as have occurred have resulted from the activity of bloggers, and sometime the mainstream media. All the official regulators have, to varying extents, made things worse. The CHRE proposals promise to make matters still worse by offering \"accreditation\" to organisations that promote nonsensical quackery. None of the official regulators seem to be able to grasp the obvious fact that is impossible to have any sensible regulation of people who promote nonsensical untruths. One gets the impression that politicians are more concerned to protect the homeopathic (etc, etc) industry than they are to protect patients. Deception by advocates of alternative medicine harms patients. There are adequate laws that make such deception illegal, but they are not being enforced. The CHRE and its successor should restrict themselves to real medicine. The money that they spend on pseudo-regulation of quacks should be transferred to the MHRA or a reformed Trading Standards organisation so they can afford to investigate and prosecute breaches of the law. That is the only form of regulation that makes sense. Follow-up The shocking case of the continuing sale of \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, rubella, pertussis etc was highlighted in an [excellent TV programme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI) by BBC South West. The failure of the MHRA and the GPC do take any effective action is a yet another illustration of the failure of regulators to do their job. I have to agree with Andy Lewis when [he concludes](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html) \"Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator.\" Much has been written on this blog about [Dr Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon%22), and about the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22College+of+Medicine%22)\", which is the direct inheritor of the mantle of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. At the time of the foundation of the College it was [stated that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". Michael Dixon has also been chairman of the NHS Alliance since 1998. That was one of very few organisations to support Andrew Lansley's Health Bill. No doubt [he will be happy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295) for Crapita Capita to supply alternative nonsense at public expense. Dr Dixon took offence to a review in The Times of Mark Henderson's new book, The Geek Manifesto. . The [review, by David Aaronovitch](http://journalisted.com/article/3olf4), said, apropos of the [1023 campaign](http://www.1023.org.uk/), \" . . .there was now, almost for the first time, a group of people who were not content to see claims made for discredited treatments without making everyone aware of the science that disproved those claims. And second, what they were doing had implications for public policy.\" and \"The geeks represent, for me, one of the most encouraging recent developments in British public life.\" This excellent review evidently upset Dr Dixon, because on 20th May, his letter appeared in the Times. | | David Aaronovitch is right to argue for a robust scientific approach in medicine. However, he is not being logical or scientific when he says that if something is suspected to be placebo then it has no benefit and the NHS should not pay for it. What about scientific research on remedies that many believe to be placebo? These frequently show that there is a benefit but this is confined to those who believe in the treatment given. Surely, in such cases, it would be logical to say that the treatment was beneficial albeit in a specific group of \"believers\". From there, it would be good science to compare the safety costs of this supposed placebo remedy with its currently given alternative before deciding whether \"believers\" should be able to receive such a remedy on the NHS. The problem here is that belief and mindset play an enormous part in healing - science needs to take account of this. Patients' symptoms are frequently metaphors and effective treatment can often be symbolic and culturally dependent. The mind, in the right circumstances, can produce its own healing chemicals often mimicking those given in conventional medicine. Until science can explain healing in psychosocial as well as biomedical language, we must be cautious about \"voting for the geeks\" as Mr Aaronovitch suggests. It is far better surely that individual treatment should be tailored, within reason, to the patient and their beliefs and perspectives. Further more, might it not be wiser to direct NHS resources according to pragmatic trials of cost effectiveness and safety rather than a limited interpretation of science that excludes the effect of the mind? Dr Michael Dixon Chair of Council College of Medicine. This letter seemed remarkable to me. It is very close to being an admission that alternative medicine is largely placebo. It called for a reply. We have been here before. Many people have discussed the dubious ethics of deceiving patients by giving placebos while pretending they are no such thing. There is wide agreement that it is not only unethical, but also unnecessary. Kevin Smith has written [a scholarly essay](http://www.dcscience.net/Smith-response.pdf) on the topic. Edzard Ernst wrote [Mind over matter?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103080345/http://www.arc.org.uk/news/arthritistoday/131_1.asp) Margaret McCartney, the Glasgow GP, and author of The Patient Paradox, has [explained it](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=1071). Some views of Dr Dixon's approach are less flattering than mine. For example, from the USA, Steven Novella's [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/dr-michael-dixon-a-pyromaniac-in-a-field-of-integrative-straw-men/). And, Majikthyse, [Michael Dixon caught red-handed!](http://majikthyse.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/michael-dixon-caught-red-handed/), and Dr Aust's [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/). The list is almost endless. .Two replies were published in the Times on 26 May (and they were the lead letters -bold print). One from the excellent Evan Harris, and one from me. Here they are as text. | | Sir, Dr Michael Dixon's letter (May 21) is fascinating. He is, of course, a well-known advocate of alternative medicine. Yet he seems now to believe that much alternative medicine is just a placebo. That's something the geeks have been saying for years, and he appears, at last, to have accepted it. That being the case, it follows that we have to ask whether placebos produce useful benefits, and whether it is ethical to prescribe them. Nobody denies the existence of placebo effects. But recent research has shown that they are usually both small and transient. Often they are not big enough to provide a useful degree of relief. For example, a recent paper on acupuncture in the British Journal of General Practice showed that it had a remarkably small placebo effect. And placebos have no effect at all on the course of cancer or infectious diseases. There has been an admirable movement in medicine for doctors to be open and honest with patients. Prescribing of medicines that contain no active ingredient involves lying to patients. That is old-fashioned and unethical. It is fair to ask why so many people seem to believe in alternative medicine, if even their placebo effects are small. The answer seems to lie in the \"get better anyway\" effect (known to geeks as regression to the mean). Most of the conditions for which placebos seem to work are things that wax and wane naturally. You take the \"cure\" when you are at your worst, and next day you are better. You would have been better anyway, but it's hard to avoid attributing the improvement to whatever you took. That is why alternative medicine is advertised largely on the basis of anecdotal testimonials. And it is doubtless why Dr Dixon advocates \"pragmatic\" trials: that's a euphemism for trials without a proper control group. Psychosocial problems may indeed be very important for some patients. But deceiving such patients with dummy pills is not the proper way to deal with their problems. D. Colquhoun, FRS Professor of Pharmacology, University College London Sir, Dr Michael Dixon argues that the NHS should fund placebo treatments such as homeopathy (though he stops short of agreeing that homeopathy is a placebo) on the basis that they can offer limited help to those who \"believe\" in them. It is no part of modern ethical medical practice to deceive patients into thinking \u2014 or failing to disabuse them of the belief \u2014 that an inert substance or ineffective medicine has beneficial effects. This can not be justified by the hope \u2014 or even expectation \u2014 of deriving for that patient the limited psychologically based improvement in symptoms that may follow from the deployment of the placebo. Pedlars of homeopathy for profit in the private sector will, alas, always seek to fool people into believing the hocus pocus of \"memory of water\" and the effects of infinite dilution and a lot of bottle-shaking. But doctors have responsibilities not to deceive their patients, even out of a paternalistic wish to assist them to manage their symptoms; and public policy demands that the NHS spends its resources only on treatments that work without deception in a cost-effective way. Dr Evan Harris Oxford Follow-up The mainstream media eventually catch up with bloggers. BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that exposed the enormous degree validation scam run by the University of Wales. It also exposed the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). Both these things have been written about repeatedly here for some years. It was good to see them getting wider publicity. Watch the video of the programme ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)) \"Week In Week Out - University Challenged.\" \"The programme examines how pop stars and evangelical Christians are running colleges offering courses validated by the University of Wales.\" (I make a brief appearance, talking about validation of degrees in Chinese Medicine). In October 2008 I posted [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). With the help of the Freedom of Information Act, it was possible to reveal the mind-boggling incompetence of the validation process used by the University of Wales. McTimoney College of Chiropractic The Chiropractic \"degrees\" from the McTimoney College of Chiropractic are also validated by the University of Wales by an equally incompetent, or perhaps I should say bogus, procedure. More details can be found at [The McTimoney Chiropractic Association would seem to believe that chiropractic is \"bogus\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686), and in a later post, [Not much Freedom of Information at University of Wales, University of Kingston, Robert Gordon University or Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351). Andy Lewis has also written about chiropractic in [The University of Wales is Responsible for Enabling Bogus* Chiropractic Claims to be Made](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/university-of-wales-is-responsible-for.html). Sadly the BBC programme did not have much to say about these domestic courses, but otherwise it was excoriating. In particular it had extensive interviews with Nigel Palastanga, whose astonishing admission that courses were validated withour seeing what was taught on them was [revealed here two years ago](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). After that revelation, the vice-chancellor UoW, promoted Palastanga to be pro-vice-chancellor in charge of Learning, Teaching and Enhancement (I know, you couldn't make it up). In the documentary Palastanga said \"It's a major business. We earn a considerable amount of money.\" That was obvious two years ago, but it's good to hear it from the horse's mouth. After a section that revealed a bit about what goes on at two very fundamentalist bible colleges which gave University of Wales degrees, A. C. Grayling commented thus. \"They are there to train advocates for the biblical message and that is absolutely not, by a very very long chalk, what a university should be doing.. . . A respectable British Higher education institution like the University of Wales shouldn't be touching them with a bargepole.\" Undaunted, Palastanga responded \"That's his opinion. I would say they are validated to the highest standards. They match what are called QAA benchmark. We have serious academics looking at them, and their academic standards are established at the very highest level.\" And if you believe that, you will truly believe anything. You can [download here](/PalastangaBScChiro28082008.pdf) one of many moderator's reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. This one is for the BSc (Hons) Chiropractic. It is entirely typical of theuncritical boxticking approach to validation, Nowhere does it say \"subluxation is nonsense\", though [even the GCC now admit that](http://www.zenosblog.com/2010/05/obituary-the-death-of-the-subluxation/). Traditional Chinese Medicine The University of Wales validates several courses in what almost everyone but them classifies as quackery. As well as [chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686) and [\"nutritional therapy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), there is herbalism. For example a course at a college in Barcelona issues University of Wales degrees in Traditional Chinese medicine, a subject that is [a menace to public health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923).. I was asked to comment on the course, and on a bag of herbs that the presenter had been sold to treat depression. | Ingredients of a custom mixture. There is no good evidence that any of the ingredients help depression, in fact next to nothing is known about most of them, apart from liquorice and ginger. Swallowing them would be rather reckless. They fall right into the description of any herbal medicine, [in the Patients' Guide](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733), \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety. \" Of the degrees, I said \"There's no evidence that it [the herbs] does you any good. It may be dangerous because you have no idea of the dose. Degrees in Chinese Medicine consist of three years spent memorising myths and pre-scientific, er, untruths. That isn't a degree, it's a travesty.\" Palastanga. responded \"We've had long debates in the Health Committee about where we would draw the line about what we validate. They have to demonstrate to us that there is some scientific basis for the practice, that there is an established curriculum, that there is an established safe practice.\" The presenter asked him \"So you are confident that Chinese medicine works? Palastanga replied \" I didn't say that. I said that there is evidence that it does work . . We are trying to enforce these professions to undertake effective research.\" That statement is simply not true, as shown by the response of the validation committee to the application for validation of the course in \"Nutritional Therapy\" at the Northern College of Acupuncture, [documented previously](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). The fact of the matter is that the validation proceeded without looking at what was actually taught, and without even a detailed timetable of lectures. The committee looked only at the official documents presented to it and was totally negligent in failing to discover some of the bizarre beliefs of the people who were giving the course. Palastanga went on to raise the usual straw man argument, about how little regular medicine is based on good evidence (though admittedly that is certainly true in his own field -he is a physiotherapist). Fazley International College Kuala Lumpur This business college in Kuala Lumpur offered University of Wales degrees. Its 32-year old president is a part time pop star with impressive looking qualifications The presenter pointed out that \" His doctorate and his MBA were awarded in that citadel of education, Cambridge. Here he is, pictured at the city's prestigious business school. He was there for all of four days and walked away with a doctorate. But the degree was not from the University of Cambridge, but from the now defunct \"European Business School Cambridge\". It never had the right to award degrees.\" Neither the University of Wales nor the QAA had noticed this unfortunate fact. Once the TV team had done their job for them, the [UoW withdrew support](http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/InstitutionsAndCourses/FIC/FazleyInternationalCollege-KualaLumpur.aspx). though, as of 15 November 2010, that is not obvious from [Fazley's web site](http://www.fazleyic.com/). Mr (not Dr) Fazley seemed rather pleased about how students were attracted by the connection with the Prince of Wales. The fact that he is Chancellor of the University of Wales seems not inappropriate, given the amount of quackery they promote. Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) In 2007, I wrote, [in Nature](http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-nature-07.pdf) (see also [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19)), \"Why don't regulators prevent BSc degrees in anti-science? The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) claims that \"We safeguard and help to improve the academic standards and quality of higher education in the UK.\" It costs taxpayers \u00a311.5 million (US$22 million) annually. It is, of course, not unreasonable that governments should ask whether universities are doing a good job. But why has the QAA not noticed that some universities are awarding BSc degrees in subjects that are not, actually, science? The QAA report on the University of Westminster courses awards a perfect score for 'curriculum design, content and organization,' despite this content consisting largely of what I consider to be early-nineteenth-century myths, not science. It happens because the QAA judges courses only against the aims set by those who run the QAA, and if their aims are to propagate magic as science, that's fine.\" That was illustrated perfectly in the documentary when Dr Stephen Jackson of the QAA appeared to try to justify the fact that the QAA had, like the University of Wales, failed entirely to spot any of the obvious problems. He had a nice dark suit, tie and poppy, but couldn't disguise the fact that the QAA had given high ratings to some very dubious courses. The QAA sent nine people to the other side of the globe, at a cost of \u00a391,000. They could have done a lot better if they'd spent 10 minutes with Google at home. Universities UK (UUK) Needless to say, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has said nothing at all. As usual, Laurie Taylor had it all worked out in [ Times Higher Education (4th November)](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414124). Speaking to our reporter Keith Ponting (30), he commended UUK's decision to say absolutely nothing whatsoever about the abolition of all public funding for the arts and humanities. He also praised UUK's total silence on Lord Browne's view that student courses should primarily be evaluated by their employment returns. When pressed by Ponting for his overall view of UUK's failure to respond in any way at all to any aspect of the Browne Review, he described it as \"welcome evidence, in a world of change, of UUK's consistent commitment over the years to ineffectual passivity\". Meanwhile, a University of Wales video on YouTube Caveat emptor Follow-up A couple of days later, a [search of Google news](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22University+of+Wales%22&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=Itq&sa=G&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&prmd=nm&source=univ&tbs=nws:1&tbo=u&ei=UxvjTLTzL4SAhAf_08i2DQ&oi=news_group&ct=title&resnum=11&ved=0CHQQqAIwCg) for the \"University of Wales\" shows plenty of fallout. The vice-chancellor [ claims that](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2010/11/13/minister-s-attack-was-totally-unacceptable-91466-27651062/) \"\"The Minister's attack came as a complete and total surprise to me\". That can't be true. It is over two years since I told him what was going on, and if he was unaware of it, that is dereliction of duty. It is not the TV programme that brought the University into disrepute, it was the vice-chancellor. The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation. The link (attached to each name) gives the College's bio, My links tell a rather different story. - [Professor George Lewith](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-george-lewith)You'll find plenty about [George Lewith on this blog.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) - [Professor Mustafa Djamgoz](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-mustafa-djamgoz)Superficially respectable but seduced by 'ancient wisdom' He once wrote to me \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work. \".

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)].

[Background](#back) | | Background The CNHC was the product of the late unlamented [ Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023). The Prince's Foundation was paid a large amount of taxpayers' money, \u00a3900,000, by the Department of Health to come up with a scheme for voluntary self-regulation of various sorts of alternative medicine. There is, as usual, an enormous amount of relevant information can be found on the [ebm-first site](http://www.ebm-first.com/a-close-look-at-alternative-medicine/prince-charles-cam-news-items.html). I posted [a bit about Ofquack](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215) just before I joined them. There were two main points. One was to draw attention to the wonderful account of CNHC by Polly Toynbee, \" [Quackery and superstition - available soon on the NHS](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,331986183-107865,00.html)\", The other was to point out an obvious problem with the job they were supposed to do. \"What won't work is to insist that homeopaths are \"properly trained\". If one takes the view that medicines that contain no medicine can't work, then years of being trained to say that they do work, and years spent memorizing the early 19th century mumbo-jumbo of homeopathy, does not protect the public, it imperils them.\" On 25 September 2008, someone sent me an advertisement for a job on the conduct and competence committee. The job description seemed to fit me quite well, so I applied. I presumed they wouldn't take me, and then I could write a blog about it. But after a phone interview with co-chair Maggy Wallace, I was amazed to be offered the job. Since joining them I haven't actually done anything whatsoever, apart from offering a few general ideas, because no cases have actually reached the Conduct and Competence Committee. This was the first time I had encountered a quango at first hand. Several of the members seemed to have no great interest in medicine, or even in alternative medicine. They were more interested in regulation per se, or at least the sort of pseudo-regulation that most of these bodies mostly seem to offer. They seem to suffer from the well-known delusion that you can manage/regulate something without knowing anything about it. In cases such as this one, where what is being regulated is largely nonsense, there are bound to be problems. There were two people, whom I did come to like particularly, Maggy Wallace and [John Lant](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=60). They were both willing to talk and to listen. The anonymous emails The alternative medicine community took a surprisingly long time to notice my presence, but on 19 May 2010 a pretty vicious anonymous email arrived at the CNHC, complaining about me.

Certainly every practitioner has to be responsible for their actions and practice but since when has it been standard practice to weigh the scales against you rather than be assessed by a panel of independent peers? 2. More statements by Colquhoun ' nonsense, untrue, unnecessary, rectal obsession, mystic barmpot, fraud, theatrical placebo' In his \"Patients' guide to Magic medicine\" [ Colquhoun summarizes many of the CNHC members' professional activities (and other professions too) as follows: * Reflexology: plain old foot massage, overlaid with utter nonsense about non-existent connections between your feet and your thyroid gland. * Nutritional therapy: self-styled 'nutritionists' making untrue claims about diet in order to sell you unnecessary supplements. * Spiritual healing: tea and sympathy, accompanied by arm-waving. * Reiki: ditto. * Angelic Reiki. The same but with added Angels, Ascended Masters and Galactic Healers. Excellent for advanced fantasists. * Colonic irrigation: a rectal obsession that fails to rid you of toxins which you didn't have in the first place. * Anthroposophical medicine: followers of the mystic barmpot, Rudolf Steiner, for whom nothing whatsoever seems to strain credulity * Alternative diagnosis: kinesiology, iridology, vega test etc, various forms of fraud, designed to sell you cures that don't work; for problems you haven't got. * Homeopathy: giving patients medicines that contain no medicine whatsoever. * Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety. * Acupuncture: a rather theatrical placebo, with no real therapeutic benefit in most if not all cases. So what kind of organisation is CNHC and why have they put him on to their Conduct and Competence panel? Being a CNHC member seems to be like inflicting pain on yourself. CNHC also received funding from the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH). Yet Colquhoun regularly lambasts the FIH and Prince Charles himself categorizing him as a 'champion of endarkenment' [ Of course, no one expects that because an organisation provides funding it should be exempt from criticism but surely, if you are working for an organisation whose purpose is to represent standards in a certain field, why would you have someone on your management team who fires out carping criticism at the supporting organisation, its practitioners and its practices unless perhaps, it is your purpose to spread discord and cut the funding. No wonder the CNHC has problems. Their business plan (contingent on funding) was initially to have more than 10,000 enrolled members. This has been revised down to 2,000 and by all counts they have not even made this. Not surprising if the practitioners whom you represent don't have any trust in the organisation that is supposed to represent the standards of your profession. 3. Want some more!!! fantasists, wrong and dangerous, largely quackery, lies, mumbo-jumbo, made-up fantasies, placebo medicine On nutritional therapy It is interesting to compare the high standards of the Nutrition Society with the quite different standards of BANT (the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy).& They bill themselves as the \"Professional Body for Nutritional Therapists\". Nutritional therapists are those fantasists who believe you can cure any ill by buying some supplement pills. [ [On quotes taken from Nutritional Therapy text] That must be about as close as you can get to claiming you can prevent cancer by taking vitamin pills. It is wrong and t is dangerous, Sigh. What century are we living in? [ Everyone is for good nutrition of course, but 'nutritional medicine', or 'nutritional therapy' pretends to be able to cure all sorts of diseases by changes in diet or by buying expensive nutritional supplement pills. It has no perceptible relationship to the very important subjects of 'nutrition' or 'dietetics'.. 'Nutritional therapy' is very firmly part of alternative medicine, in other words it is largely quackery. If you don't believe that, read on. On Reflexology As usual, not many seemed to care very much about the secondary consequences of employing a 'reflexologist', namely that some poor kid has to memorise a bunch of lies to get the piece of paper demanded by HR (and the taxpayer has to fund it). What is the evidence about 'spiritual healing' ? Very little it seems. No doubt, mumbo-jumbo can make some people feel better, and to that extent it is justified. But it can and should done be honestly (for example, foot massage is fine, 'reflexology' isn't). Lies to patients should be minimised and universities should not be tempted to hand out certificates in mumbo jumbo. Michael McIntyre has the first of several long speeches, advocating more research. There was an advertisement for his web site \"promotes best practice\" (allegedly). He talks quite seriously about \"reflexology\" and so on, as though it were real subject (it isn't; its \"principles\" are made-up fantasies). Much of what they do at the Christie is straightforward massage, but they also promote the nonsensical principles of 'reflexology' and acupuncture. The hilarious Radio 4 programme, The News Quiz had a good joke. Jeremy Hardy was asked which patients are hoping for a more robust constitution?. This referred to the \u00a31m PR exercise mounted by the NHS to launch the NHS constitution. Hardy said that in the week when Barack Obama was inaugurated, and the word constitution have a whole different sort of gravitas in a week like that. \"I think the constitution should open with the words \"We hold these truths to be self-evident REFLEXOLOGY IS BOLLOCKS\" On Shiatsu Shiatsu uh? It seems the teacher is already committed to placebo medicine. 4. What to do Why join an association that condones the above? Many have never joined CNHC because of this and other issues whilst existing CNHC members do not want to remain members. 1. Contact your professional association and insist that they do not join CNHC. 2. If your association is already a member then make a complaint and insist that your personal details are not supplied to CNHC. 3. There are other associations in existence that have the same purpose as CNHC. Find out about them. You (or your professional association) have the option to join them and 4. Please pass on this information to anyone else that you know. It is important that we are represented honestly and with integrity. The actions of CNHC do not add up. ooOOoo Nobody seems to know the real name of Sara Glougan (aka Sam McGlougan. The letter is, I suppose, fair enough. I did say most of those things. What's objectionable is that the anonymous writer seems to think that my opinions disqualify me from judging dispassionately a Conduct and Competence case. What this letter really says is that \"we don't want anyone who cares about the truth of claims to have any power over us\". They just don't want to be regulated in any effective way. The co-chair, Maggy Wallace, is a bit more sensible than that. The reason that I was appointed by her was because of my knowledge about how to assess evidence. But that isn't a topic that interests alternative medicine advocates. The fact of the matter is that the CNHC has been signing up people at a far slower rate than it hoped originally. It is in dire financial trouble (see, for example, [Will the government bail out Ofquack?>, and ](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/will-government-bail-out-ofquack.html) [CNHC's report to the Department of Health](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/10409/response/34038/attach/2/FOI%20DE424504%201%20CNHC%20report%20to%20DH%20June%2008.pdf) in June 2009, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.. The last thing they can afford is anything like this letter, which might reduce the registration rate still further. So it was inevitable that they had to get rid of me. Initially I was invited to resign on grounds of bad health. I didn't, so on 10 August 2010 I was asked to appear before the board to be fired (in the nicest possible way). The CNHC now has nobody with any statistical expertise. Needless to say I'm not heartbroken about it. It was a waste of time for me, but it did provide a valuable insight into how voluntary self-regulation works, or rather fails to work. The complaints against reflexologists The CNHC has a [complaints procedure](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=36), though [its operation](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=37) is somewhat tortuous.. As soon as they started to register reflexologists, several complaints were sent by the indefatigable Simon Perry ( [read his account](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.com/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html)) \"The ad suggests that reflexology is suitable for treating babies with colic, IBS and arthritis. She also claims to have experience in treating fertility issues. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that reflexology is capable of treating [these] issues.\" This complaint never came to to the Conduct and Competence Committee. It didn't get past the preliminary Investigating Committee (chaired by John Lant), the job of which is to see if there is a case to answer. They decided that the advertisements in question did indeed breach paragraph 15 of the CNHC's [Code of Conduct, Performance and Ethics](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/assets/1-006.pdf) (see below). All 14 of Simon Perry's complaints were upheld. However the [Investigating Committee Panel's report](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/assets/7-021.pdf) went on to say, apparently on the advice of the ['Profession specific boards'](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=76) that \"The ICP found that the registrants' Fitness to Practise was not impaired, because they did not deliberately seek to mislead their clients or to exaggerate the benefits of the therapy which they described in good faith. However they found that the registrants had made claims about the therapy offered which appeared to imply more efficacy than evidence necessarily provides.\" That, presumably, is why the complaints never reached the Conduct and Competence Committee. There was no case to answer. One must admire Maggy Wallace's statement that she \"place on formal record their thanks to Simon Perry for bringing this matter to their attention.\". Never the less the problem is glaringly obvious and it shouldn't have need a complaint. Why ofquack can never work The complaint episode is fascinating. The CNHC has clearly painted itself into a corner. It has brought to the fore all the contradictions that are inherent in what they are trying to do. They have decided that reflexologists make false claims about what they can achieve. But they decided it wasn't the fault of the reflexologists because that is what they had been taught Therefore the CNHC has judged that fitness of reflexologists to practise is not affected by the fact that they make false health claims. That means that the CNHC judges that the public safety is not affected by whether their members make false health claims. That seems ludicrous enough, but it goes further In the initial publicity it was often said that the job of the CNHC was safety -their job to protect the public, not to judge whether treatments worked or not. That sort of statement is contradicted directly by paragraph 15 of their [Code of Conduct, Performance and Ethics](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/assets/1-006.pdf), which reads thus. 15. You must follow CNHC guidelines in relation to advertising your services Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated. You must not claim that your personal skills, equipment or facilities are better than anyone else's. If you are involved in advertising or promoting any other product or service, you must make sure that you use your knowledge, healthcare skills, qualifications and experience in an accurate and professionally responsible way. You must not make or support unjustifiable statements relating to particular products or services. Any potential financial rewards to you should be made explicit and play no part at all in your advice or recommendations of products and services that you give to patients, clients and users. This paragraph places on the CNHC the responsibility for judging whether or not a treatment does what's claimed for it. With my departure, there is really nobody left who is well-qualified to do that, but nonetheless, their judgement on claims made by reflexologists was quite right. The assertion by the CNHC that the false claims were OK because that is what reflexologists are taught is a direct admission that the courses that 'train' reflexologists are teaching them to say things that are not true. Of course the rest of the world knew that already, but to have it admitted by the CNHC is amazing. Part of the job of the CNHC is to judge whether registrants are properly trained. But they have just decided that courses for reflexologists teach them to say things that aren't true, That leaves the CNHC it an impossible position. By accepting reflexologists, they are saying that it doesn't really matter that they are taught to make false claims, The [criteria for entry](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=20) include \"Have undertaken a programme of education and training which meets, as a minimum, the National Occupational Standards for that profession/discipline\" This shifts the responsibility for deciding what's acceptable to National Occupational Standards and Skills for Health. Neither of these quangos is in the least concerned about what's true and what isn't. That's not surprising when you realise who drafted all the HR style nonsense to be found at Skills for Health? None other than the late Prince of Wales' Foundation. The stuff produced by them isn't worth the paper it's written on. There is something about Skills for Health [in the post where I recount](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh) a phone call with them, When I asked whether they would produce standards for talking to trees, I was referred, in all seriousness, to LANTRA, the Land based skills council. You couldn't make it up. The [National Occupational Standards (NOS) directory](http://www.ukstandards.org.uk/) leads to the [NOS for reflexology](http://www.ukstandards.org.uk/Admin/DB/0049/CNH11.pdf). The preamble says Reflexology is the study and practice of treating reflex points and areas in the feet and hands that relate to corresponding parts of the body. Using precise hand and finger techniques a reflexologist can improve circulation, induce relaxation and enable homeostasis. These three outcomes can activate the body's own healing systems to heal and prevent ill health. There is, if course, not a shred of reason to think that \"areas in the feet and hands that relate to corresponding parts of the body\". This statement alone would fail the CNHC's code of conduct. National Occupational Standards in this area are simply a farce. What will the CNHC do about these paradoxes? The complaint report said \"The ICP have asked Maggie Dunn, the CNHC Registrar, to initiate, as a matter of priority, discussions with the CNHC's Profession Specific Boards and the Professional Fora to agree advice to registrants in relation to paragraph 15.\" I was told that this might take between 3 and 5 years to do. But I have a strong feeling that it will never be done in any effective way. If the CNHC prevented training courses from teaching students to make claims that aren't justified by evidence, just about every course would close and the CNHC would crumble to dust. The result would be the ultimate irony. Alternative medicine would be abolished, not by skeptics, but by the CNHC. That follows inevitably from the complaint judgement combined with paragraph 15 of the code of conduct. It will be fascinating to see how the CNHC tries to escape from the grave that it has dug for itself. If the CNHC implements properly its own code of conduct, few people will sign up and CNHC will die. If it fails to implement its own code of conduct it would be shown to be a dishonest sham. Follow-up Interview for Pod Delusion on the CNHC case Suggested twitter tag: #buckgate | | Number 19 Buckingham Street, London WC2N 6EF.is to be the home of the proposed \"College of Medicine\" that has arisen from the ashes of the Naturally one must ask if the \"College of Medicine\" will propagate the same sort of barmy ideas as the Prince's Foundation used to do, A visit to Companies House shows the auguries are not good | | 19 Buckingham Street For one thing, the name College of Medicine has existed only since May 2010. The company was registered originally 19th November 2009 as The College of Integrated Health, but after a teleconference on 5th May 2010 it [changed its name](/col-med-name-change.pdf), presumably to make itself sound more like real medicine. This happened immediately after the [ closure of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) on April 30th. There is no doubt that the \"College of Medicine\" is the direct descendent of the Prince of Wales' Foundation. In a powerpoint show dated 9th November 2009 (before the name change) this slide is to be found. The author of the slide show is specified as \"Linda\". That, it is a fair bet, must be Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed, and is now Company Secretary for the \"College of Medicine\". The final form of the \"College\" is still being argued about, but guess who will open it? When ask about how Charles' relationship with the College, The Office of TRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall declined to make any comment, but simply referred me to Michael Dixon, who, in turn referred me to Pat Goodall. Recently a statement from Clarence House to the Guardian said that \"the Prince of Wales was aware of the college, but \"has not been involved with setting-up the college, is not launching it and has no official role with it\". That's the official line anyway. It is, of course, almost impossible to find out exactly what the relationship is between Prince Charles himself and the new \"College\". He operates largely out of sight, and the Freedom of Information Act, disgracefully, excludes his interference in the democratic process from public scrutiny. Who is paying? Flat 5 at 19 Buckingham Street was recently valued at half a million pounds. There is some serious money behind this venture. The rumour is that it's from a 'private donor'. Small prize for anyone who finds out who it is. Aims of the College The stated object of the College is \"to advance health for the public benefit\". Sounds good, but what does it mean? It doesn't take long to find out. It is laid out in the [document from Companies House.](/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) To further its objects the Charity may: 7.1 engage with and develop communities of health professionals, health care providers and patients; 7.2 set standards and promote excellence in the fields of health and care; 7.3 lead, represent, train and support stakeholders so that they are better equipped to serve the public in improving the health ofthe public; 7.4 establish an evidence base for integrated health and for individual complementary modalities; 7.5 promote, foster and advance an integrated approach to health and care; 7.6 raise public, professional and political awareness and cultivate a sentiment in favour of an integrated approach to health and care by publishing and distributing books, pamphlets, reports, leaflets, journals, films, tapes and instructional matter on any media; and so on, for 36 paragraphs. Already in paragraph 4 to 6 we see their interest is to promote \"integrated health\" and \"complementary modalities. These of course are just what most of the rest of the world calls quackery. The objects don't differ greatly from the Prince's Foundation from which this outfit sprang. What will be taught at the College? Some information about the preliminary plans can be gleaned from a letter that describes the new College ( [download the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf)). The letter says \"The College is developing two groups of courses. The first is aimed at registered professionals such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. It will familiarise them with different aspects of CAM and develop skills they can use in their day to day practice - not least techniques they can pass on to patients to help them manage their own conditions.\" In other words, the only course for doctors will be to teach them about quackery. Final judgement on that must await information about who will teach it. \"The second group of courses is aimed at non-registered practitioners and will focus on developing their understanding of conventional medicine, including 'red flag' symptoms, familiarisation with conventional therapeutics and increased awareness of critical appraisal.\" The other course, it seems, will be for quacks, to try to teach them enough real medicine to prevent them from killing too many people. The bit about teaching them about \"critical appraisal\" is hard to believe. If that were really done the clients would mostly be out of business. If you were in any doubt at all about the aims of the College, it is necessary only to look at the four directors of the Company Directors of the College of Medicine. - Dr Michael Dixon, general practitioner. Michael Dixon was Medical Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor George Lewith, is Professor of Health Research in the Complementary Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor David Peters. is Professor of Integrated Healthcare and Clinical Director at the University of Westminster's School of Integrated Health. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Mrs Christine Glover is a pharmacist who [sells homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). She was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. The company secretary is named as Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed. A request to Michael Dixon for information was deflected to Mrs Pat Goodall She is yet another connection with PFIH. Mrs Goodall acted as a spokesperson for the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. Now she is scheduled to become Director of Policy and Communications for the \"College of Medicine\". Mrs Goodall declined to say where the money came from. But she did say that the College was not the \"equivalent of a further education college,. . . or higher education college\", That being the case, it seems very odd to use the name \"College of Medicine\". It is a downright misleading name. These people are all well know advocates of alternative medicine, It is very obvious that the \"College of Medicine\", despite its misleadingly innocuous name, is simply a reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The term \"integrated\" is, of course, simply [a euphemism for alternative medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). That means those forms of medicine for which there is little or no evidence that they work. When evidence that something works is found, it is called simply medicine. It may be useful to give a bit more information about the Directors. Dr Michael Dixon OBE Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. You can read more about Michael Dixon at Dr Aust's blog ( [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/)), and, from the USA, Steven Novella's analysis in [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450) Professor George Lewith, George Lewith [has appeared quite often](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) in this blog. He first came to my attention when I [discovered in 2006](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131) that his private clinic was offering a well-known form of fraudulent allergy diagnosis, the Vega test, despite the fact that Lewith himself had written a paper that said it didn't work. Lewith is particularly keen on acupuncture and that most discredited form of quackery, homeopathy. [On More 4 News](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542#lewith), he actually claimed that there was no good sham form of acupuncture. That is simply not true: great ingenuity has gone into devising controls for acupuncture trials and 'real' acupuncture always comes out the same as sham. Professor David Peters David Peters comes from the University of Westminster, which is famous for offering more degrees than any other in [anti-scientific nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19). Westminster is home of the quite remarkable teaching that \" [Amethysts emit high Yin energy](#)\". dowsing, aura photography and other such fairground frauds. Westminster offers also a \"BSc degree\" in that quite remarkable branch of make-believe known as naturopathy, This [teaches students](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) about a totally insane form of psycho-babble called [Emo-trance](http://emotrance.com/) and they are taught (no. seriously) about diagnosis with dowsing and pendulums Westminster also teaches [about kinesiology](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812). Sounds sort of sciencey, but [Applied Kinesiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology) is actually a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor. It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf)). Westminster offers [\"BSc degrees\" in Chinese Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) that are a menace to public health. Their unfortunate students are told \"Legally, you cannot claim to cure cancer. This is not a problem because we treat people not diseases\". It is hard to imagine anything more irresponsible, David Peters, as Clinical Director at Westminster must bear responsibility for this load of irresponsible make-believe, I have no doubt that he is well-intentioned but some of the stuff on these courses is a serious danger to public health. Mrs Christine Glover Mrs Glover is an [Edinburgh pharmacist](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/). She claims She believes symptoms rarely occur in isolation but are usually linked to a persons circumstancs [sic]. Illness occurs when there are imbalances in any of the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of their life. Well, yes and no, Would you really go to her if you had cancer, or tuberculosis, or even atrial flutter? Judging by her website, what you'd get is a bottle of her Liquid Iron & Vitamin Formula (for \u00a316.25 !). Or any one of a [range of homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). There is no branch of alternative medicine that is more totally discredited than homeopathy. Yet now it i being proposed to form a College of Medicine with four directors who are all part of the dwindling band that insists you can do magic with pills that contain no medicine. Who else supports the College? There are some pretty surprising people who are listed in [the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf) as supporting the College of Medicine, though it remains to be seen how many are left once the true nature of the College is known. Some of the supporters were already Foundation Fellows of the Prince's Foundation, despite having no obvious sympathy with quackery. These include Professor Sir Cyril Chantler, Professor Adrian Eddleston and Professor Simon Gibbons. They also include [the notorious Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Karol+Sikora), and the geochemist Professor Jane Plant. Professor Jane Plant is, apparently, a distinguished geochemist, but she developed an obsession with dairy-free diets, after her own experiences with breast cancer. She has written a lot of books and, no doubt, made a lot of money from the desperate. An [extracr from one of her books](http://members.multimania.co.uk/AllThingsChildren/MilkCancer.htm) is titled \"Why I believe that giving up milk is the key to beating breast cancer\". If you want to see the 'evidence' for some of her wild claims, [her web site](http://www.cancersupportinternational.com/janeplant.com/index.asp) invites to join -at a cost of \u00a330. To get a bit closer to the truth it is only necessary to quote the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) Report on diet and cancer, ' [Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective](http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf)'. The WCRF is inclined, in my view, to exaggerate the strength of the evidence for a causal link between diet and cancer (see [Diet and health. What can you believe: or does bacon kill you?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435)) but nevertheless their assessment of dairy products is very different from Plant's. \"The strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that milk probably protects against colorectal cancer, and that diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer.\" It seems that Jane Plant's claims are thoroughly irresponsible. I'm told that two people who were also Foundation Fellows, and who were originally listed as supporters of the College seem to have already jumped ship, namely Professor Stephen Holgate and Baroness Finlay. Professor Sir Graeme Catto is to be president, and I'm told, Professor Sir Ian Kennedy has agreed to be vice president. It is incomprehensible to me why people like this should be willing to lend their names to the Prince's Foundation in the first place, or to its replacement now.. Other people listed as supporters include Sir Donald Irvine, Professor John Cox, and, on the \"scientific advisory committee, Professor Mustafa Djamgoz and Professor Ajit Lalvani. None of these people has an obvious belief in quackery. sp what are they doing mixed up with a venture like this? Graeme Catto tells me he \"knows very little about CAM\", and Cyril Chantler says the College should deal with evidence-based integrated medicine \"but not alternative medicine or homeopathy\". Since, during his time as a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation, Cyril Chantler failed totally to shake the advocacy of homeopathy by them, it seems unlikely yhat he'll be any more successful with the College. The only member of the \"scientific advisory committee\" who has answered by invitation to comment on a draft of this post is Professor Mustafa Djamgoz. It seems that he is more gullible that meets the eye He said, for example, \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work.\" \"We ourselves have already shown that natural substances like omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reseveratrol [sic] etc can produce anti-cancer effects by blocking ion channels.\" Clearly Professor Djamgoz has not been keeping up with research in these areas. Has he never read Barker Bausell's book on acupuncture, [Snake Oil Science](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell).? Apparently not. And there is, of course, not the slightest reason to think that omega-3 or resveratrol help cancer in humans. It is often said that the reason that eminent people support quackery is that they live in hopes of a peerage. That is, perhaps, a bit uncharitable. I think it more likely that they don't bother to investigate closely what it is they are signing up to, and that they are fooled by the [weasel words of \"integrated medicine\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). People like Catto and Chantler seem to think they are supporting caring, human centred, medicine. I fear they have been fooled, They are supporting sheer quackery. Patient centred medicine One of the most infuriating characteristics of quacks is their attempt to hi-jack the 'human side of medicine'. I suppose they have little else to offer, so it's understandable. But there is nothing human about deceiving desperate patients and the human side of medicine is something that is emphasised in the education of every real doctor. If you want to know more about it, there is no better exposition than [Michael Baum's Samuel Gee lecture](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095#baum). Baum has been at the forefront of thinking about supportive or spiritual care of cancer patients. His 2009 Samuel Gee lecture is available in video, [Concepts of Holism in Orthodox and Alternative Medicine](https://admin.emea.acrobat.com/_a45839050/p69282078/). It is a masterpiece. He ends the lecture thus. \"Alternative versions of \"holistic medicine\" that offer claims of miracle cures for cancer by impossible dietary regimens, homeopathy or metaphysical manipulation of non-existent energy fields, are cruel and fraudulent acts that deserve to be criminalized.\" A similar distinction has been made with beautiful clarity by [Dr James May](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095) \"The use of the term 'integrative medicine' in your editorial seems to confuse more than clarify the problem of 'holism' in medicine. Complementary therapists for example often use the term 'holistic' to blur the boundaries between the therapies used and the practitioner's interpersonal skills. It would be better, however, to keep these distinctions clear. Caring is different from curing.\" \"'Holism' is not a multifaceted approach to curing, it is a multifaceted approach to caring\" \"Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.\" I hope that the various eminent people who have lent their name to this mis-named 'College of Medicine' will look very carefully at what it actually does. And that will probably mean withdrawing their support. Follow-up The Guardian, 2nd August 2010, carried this story, written by their science correspondent, Ian Sample: [College of Medicine born from ashes of Prince Charles's holistic health charity](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/prince-charles-college-medicine-holistic-complementary). He quotes Tracey Brown of the Sense about Science charity as saying that the college's emphasis on merging conventional medicine with unproven complementary therapies \"would take society back a century\". \"Despite its mission to promote the integration of alternatives to medicine, this new body has chosen to call itself very grandly the College of Medicine. Perhaps someone thinks this will sound good with Royal in front of it? This wouldn't be a surprise given the institution's origins in the Prince of Wales's efforts to integrate his favoured traditional remedies into medicine.\" Quotation from DC This post recounts a complicated story that started in January 2009, but has recently come to what looks like a happy ending. The story involves over a year's writing of letters and meetings, but for those not interested in the details, I'll start with a synopsis. Synopsis of the synopsis In January 2009, a course in \"integrated medicine\" was announced that, it was said, would be accredited by the University of Buckingham. The course was to be led by Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson. So I sent an assessment of Rosy Daniel's claims to \"heal\" cancer to Buckingham's VC (president), Terence Kealey, After meeting Karol Sikora and Rosy Daniel, I sent an analysis of the course tutors to Kealey who promptly demoted Daniel, and put [Prof Andrew Miles](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/dofe/miles.html) in charge of the course. The course went ahead in September 2009. Despite Miles' efforts, the content was found to be altogether too alternative. The University of Buckingham has now terminated its contract with the \"Faculty of Integrated Medicine\", and the course will close. Well done.Buckingham. Synopsis - January 2009. I saw an announcement of a Diploma in Integrated Medicine, to be accredited by the University of Buckingham (UB). The course was to be run by Drs Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson of the College of Integrated Medicine, under the nominal directorship of Karol Sikora (UB's Dean of Medicine). I wrote to Buckingham's vice-chancellor (president), Terence Kealey, and attached a reprint of paper on carctol,](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf)a herbal cancer 'remedy' favoured by Daniiel. - Unlike most vice-chancellors, Kealey replied at once and asked me to meet Sikora and Daniel. I met first Sikora alone, and then, on March 19 2009, both together. Rosy Daniel gave me a complete list of the speakers she'd chosen. Most were well-known alternative people, some, in my view, the worst sort of quack. After discovering who was to teach on the proposed course, I wrote a long document about the proposed speakers and sent it to the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, Terence Kealey on March 23rd 2009.. Unlike most VCs, he took it seriously. At the end of this meeting I asked Sikora, who was in nominal charge of the course, how many of the proposed tutors he'd heard of. The answer was \"none of them\" - Shortly before this meeting, I submitted a complaint to Trading Standards about Rosy Daniel's commercial site, HealthCreation, for what seemed to me to be breaches of the Cancer Act 1939, by claims made for [Carctol](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf). Read [the complaint](/health-creation-ts-complaint v2.pdf). - On 27th April 2009, I heard from Kealey that he'd demoted Rosy Daniel from being in charge of the Diploma and appointed [Andrew Miles](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/dofe/miles.html), who had recently been appointed as Buckingham's Professor of Public Health Education and Policy &Associate Dean of Medicine (Public Health). Terence Kealey said \"You've done us a good turn, and I'm grateful\". Much appreciated. Miles said the course \"needs in my view a fundamental reform of content. . . \" - Although Rosy Daniel had been demoted, she was still in charge of delivering the course at what had, by this time, changed its name to the Faculty of Integrated Medicine which, despite its name, is not part of the university. - Throughout the summer I met Miles (of whom more below) several times and exchanged countless emails, but still didn't get the revised list of speakers. The course went ahead on 30 September 2009. He also talked with Michael Baum and Edzard Ernst. - By January 2010, Miles came to accept that the course was too high on quackery to be a credit to the university, and simply fired The Faculty of Integrated Medicine. Their contract was not renewed. Inspection of the speakers, even after revision of the course, shows why. - As a consequence, it is rumoured that Daniel is trying to sell the course to someone else. The University of Middlesex, and unbelievably, the University of Bristol, have been mentioned, as well as Thames Valley University, the University of Westminster, the University of Southampton and the University of East London. Will the VCs of these institutions not learn something from Buckingham's experience? It is to be hoped that they would at the very least approach Buckingham to ask pertinent questions? But perhaps a more likely contender for an organisation with sufficient gullibility is the Prince of Wales newly announced [College of Integrated Medicine.](http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/new_integrated.html)[but [see stop press](#fih)] The details of the story The [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/) (UB) is the only private university in the UK. Recently it announced its intention to start a [school of medicine](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/) (the undergraduate component is due to start in September 2011). The dean of the new school is [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#sikora). Karol Sikora shot to fame after he [appeared in a commercial](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms) in the USA. The TV commercial was sponsored by a far-right Republican campaign group, \"Conservatives for Patients' Rights\" It designed to prevent the election of Barack Obama, by pouring scorn on the National Health Serrvice. A very curious performance. Very curious indeed. And then there was a bit of [disagreement about the titles](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) that he claimed to have. As well as being dean of medicine at UB. Karol Sikora is also medical research director of [CancerPartnersUK](http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/). a private cancer treatment company. He must be a very busy man. Karol Sikora's attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. As well as being a regular oncologist, he is also a [Foundation Fellow](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/foundation_fellows.html) of that well known source of unreliable information, The Prince of Wales Foundation for Integrated Health. He [spoke at their 2009 conference](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#sikora). In the light of that, perhaps it is not, after all, so surprising thet the first action of UB's medical school was to accredit a course a Diploma in Integrated Medicine. This course has been through two incarnations. The first prospectus (created 21 January 2009) advertised the course as being run by the British College of Integrated Medicine.But by the time that UB issued a press release in July 2009, the accredited outfit had changed its name to the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/) That grand title makes it sound like part of a university. It isn't. Rosy Daniel runs a company, Health Creation which, among other things, recommended a herbal concoction. Carctol. to \"heal\" cancer, . I wrote to Buckingham's (president), Terence Kealey, and a reprint of paper on Carctol. ](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf) . Unlike most university vice-chancellors, he took it seriously. He asked me to meet Karol Sikora and Rosy Daniel to discuss it. After discovering who was teaching on this course, I wrote a document about their backgrounds and sent it to Terence Kealey. The outcome was that he removed Rosy Daniel as course director and appointed in her place Andrew Miles, with a brief to reorganise the course. A [new prospectus](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/prospectus.pdf), dated 4 September 2009, appeared. The course is not changed as much as I'd have hoped, although Miles assures me that while the lecture titles themselves may not have changed, he had ordered fundamental revisions to the teaching content and the teaching emphases. In the new prospectus the British College of Integrated Medicine has been renamed as the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/), but it appears to be otherwise unchanged. That's a smart bit of PR. The word : \"Faculty\" makes it sound as though the college is part of a university. It isn't. The \"Faculty\" occupies some space in the [Apthorp Centre in Bath](http://www.apthorpcentre.com/), which houses, among other things, Chiropract, Craniopathy (!) and a holistic vet, The prospectus now starts thus. The Advisory Board consists largely of well-know advocates of alternative medicine (more information about them below). Most of these advisory board members are the usual promoters of [magic medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). But three of them seem quite surprising,Stafford Lightman, Nigel Sparrow and Nigel Mathers. [Stafford Lightman](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neuroscience/research/groups/pidetails/36)? Well actually I mentioned to him in April that his name was there and he asked for it to be removed, on the grounds that he'd had nothing to do with the course. It wasn't removed for quite a while, but the [current advisory board ](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/advisory_board.php)has none of these people. Nigel Sparrow and Nigel Mathers, as well as Lightman, sent letters of formal complaint to Miles and Terence Kealey, the VC of Buckingham, to complain that their involvement in Rosy Daniel's set-up had been fundamentally misrepresented by Daniel. With these good scientists having extricated themselves from Daniel's organisation, the FIM has only people who are firmly in the alternative camp (or quackery, as i'd prefer to call it). For example, people like [Andrew Weil](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=219) and [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131). Andrew Weil, for example, while giving his address as the University of Arizona, is primarily a supplement salesman. He was recently [reprimanded by the US Food and Drugs Administration](http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/URItheFlu/16508) \"Advertising on the site, the agencies said in the Oct. 15 letter, says \"Dr. Weil's Immune Support Formula can help maintain a strong defense against the flu\" and claims it has \"demonstrated both antiviral and immune-boosting effects in scientific investigation.\" The claims are not true, the letter said, noting the \"product has not been approved, cleared, or otherwise authorized by FDA for use in the diagnosis, mitigation, prevention, treatment, or cure of the H1N1 flu virus.\" This isn't the first time I've come across people's names being used to support alternative medicine without the consent of the alleged supporter. There was, for example, the [strange case of Dr John Marks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=44) and Patrick Holford. Misrepresentation of this nature seems to be the order of the day. Could it be that people like Rosy Daniel are so insecure or, indeed, so unimportant within the Academy in real terms (where is there evidence of her objective scholarly or clinical stature?), that they seek to attach themselves, rather like limpets to fishing boats, to people of real stature and reputation, in order to boost their own or others' view of themselves by a manner of proxy? The background When the course was originally proposed, a brochure appeared. It said accreditation by the University of Buckingham was expected soon. Not much detail appeared in the brochure, Fine words are easy to write but what matters is who is doing th teaching. So I wrote to the vice-chancellor of Buckingham, Terence Kealey. I attached a reprint of [Ernst's paper on carctol,](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf) a herbal cancer 'remedy' favoured by Daniel ( [download claims, now deleted). Terence Kealey Kealey is regarded in much of academia as a far-right maverick, because he advocates ideas such as science research should get no public funding,and that universities should charge full whack for student fees. He has, in fact, publicly welcomed the horrific cuts being imposed on the Academy by Lord Mandelson. His [piece in The Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7067726.ece) started \"Wonderful news. The Government yesterday cut half a billion pounds from the money it gives to universities\" though the first comment on it starts \"Considerable accomplishment: to pack all these logical fallacies and bad metaphors in only 400 words\" He and I are probably at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Yet he is the only VC who has been willing to talk about questions like this. Normally letters to vice-chancellors about junk degrees go unanswered. Not so with Kealey. I may disagree with a lot of his ideas, but he is certainly someone you can do business with. Kealey responded quickly to my letter, sent in January 2009, pointing out that Rosy Daniel's claims about Carctol could not be supported and were possibly illegal. He asked me to meet Sikora and Daniel. I met first Sikora alone, and then, on March 19 2009, both together. Rosy Daniel gave me a complete list of the speakers she'd chosen to teach on this new Diploma on IM. After discovering who was to teach on the proposed course, I wrote a long document about the proposed speakers and sent it to Terence Kealey on March 23rd 2009. It contained many names that will be familiar to anyone who has taken an interest in crackpot medicine, combined with a surprisingly large element of vested financial interests. Unlike most VCs, Kealey took it seriously. The remarkable thing about this meeting was that I asked Sikora how many names where familiar to him on the list of people who had been chosen by Rosy Daniel to teach on the course. His answer was \"none of them\". Since his name and picture feature in all the course descriptions, this seemed like dereliction of duty to me. After seeing my analysis of the speakers, Terence Kealey reacted with admirable speed. He withdrew the original brochure, demoted Rosy Daniel (in principle anyway) and brought in Prof Andrew Miles to take responsibility for the course. This meant that he had to investigate the multiple conflicts of interests of the various speakers and to establish some sort of way forward in the 'mess' of what had been agreed before Miles' appointment to Buckingham Andrew Miles. Miles is an interesting character, a postdoctoral neuroendocrinologist, turned public health scientist. I'd come across him before as editor-in-chief of the [Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118000968/home?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0) This is a curious journal that is devoted mainly to condemning Evidence Based Medicine. Much of its content seems to be in a style that I can only describe as post-modernist-influenced libertarian. The argument turns on what you mean by 'evidence' and, in my opinion, Miles underestimates greatly the crucial [problem of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435), a problem that can be solved only by randomisation, His recent views on the topic [can be read here](/miles-sapienza-2010.pdf). An article in Miles' journal gives its flavour: \"Andrew Miles, Michael Loughlin and Andreas Polychronis, Medicine and evidence: knowledge and action in clinical practice\". Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice 2007, 13, 481-503 [ [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/Miles-Loughlin-Polychronis-2007.pdf)]. This paper launches an attack on Ben Goldacre, in the following passage. \"Loughlin identifies Goldacre [36] as a particularly luminous example of a commentator who is able not only to combine audacity with outrage, but who in a very real way succeeds in manufacturing a sense of having been personally offended by the article in question. Such moralistic posturing acts as a defence mechanism to protect cherished assumptions from rational scrutiny and indeed to enable adherents to appropriate the 'moral high ground', as well as the language of 'reason' and 'science' as the exclusive property of their own favoured approaches. Loughlin brings out the Orwellian nature of this manoeuvre and identifies a significant implication.\" \"If Goldacre and others really are engaged in posturing then their primary offence, at least according to the Sartrean perspective adopted by Murray et al. is not primarily intellectual, but rather it is moral. Far from there being a moral requirement to 'bend a knee' at the EBM altar, to do so is to violate one's primary duty as an autonomous being.\" This attack on one of my heroes was occasioned because he featured one of the most absurd pieces of post-modernist bollocks ever, in his [Guardian column in 2006. I had a go at the same paper](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/aug/19/badscience.uknews) on this blog, as well as an earlier one [by Christine Barry](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=35), along the same lines. There was some hilarious [follow-up on badscience.net](http://www.badscience.net/2006/12/338/). After this, it is understandable that I had not conceived a high opinion of Andrew Miles. I feared that Kealey might have been jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. After closer acquaintance I have changed my mind, In the present saga Andrew Miles has done an excellent job. He started of sending me links to heaven knows how many papers on medical epistemology, to Papal Encyclicals on the proposed relationship between Faith and Reason and on more than one occasion articles from the Catholic Herald (yes, I did read it). This is not entirely surprising, as Miles is a Catholic priest as well as a public health academic, so has two axes to grind. But after six months of talking, he now sends me links to junk science sites of the sort that I might get from, ahem, Ben Goldacre. Teachers on the course Despite Andrew Miles best efforts, he came in too late to prevent much of the teaching being done in the parallel universe of alternative medicine, The University of Buckingham had a pre-Miles, legally-binding contract (now terminated) with the Faculty of Integrated Medicine, and the latter is run by Dr Rosy Daniel and Dr Mark Atkinson. Let's take a look at their record. Rosy Daniel BSc, MBBCh Dr Rosy Daniel first came to my attention through her commercial web site, [Health Creation](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/). This site, among other things, promoted an untested herbal concoction, Carctol, for \"healing\" cancer. [Carctol: Profit before Patients?](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf) is a review by Edzard Ernst of the literature, such as it is, and concludes Carctol and the media hype surrounding it must have given many cancer patients hope. The question is whether this is a good or a bad thing. On the one hand, all good clinicians should inspire their patients with hope [6]. On the other hand, giving hope on false pretences is cruel and unethical. Rosy Daniel rightly points out that all science begins with observations [5]. But all science then swiftly moves on and tests hypotheses. In the case of Carctol, over 20 years of experience in India and almost one decade of experience in the UK should be ample time to do this. Yet, we still have no data. Even the small number of apparently spectacular cases observed by Dr. Daniel have not been published in the medical literature. On this basis I referred Health Creation to Trading Standards officer for a prima facie breach of the Cancer Act 1939. ]Download [the complaint document]](/health-creation-ts-complaint v2.pdf). Although no prosecution was brought by Trading Standards, they did request changes in the claims that were being made. Here is an example. A Google search of the Health Creation site for \"Carctol\" gives a link Dr Daniel has prescribed Carctol for years and now feels she is seeing a breakthrough. Dr Daniel now wants scientists to research the new herbal medicine But going to the link produces Access denied. You are not authorized to access this page. You can [download the cached version](/Health-Creation-carctol-cached.pdf) of this page, which shows the sort of claims that were being made before Trading Standards Officers stepped in. There are now only a few oblique references to Carctol on the Health Creation site, e.g. [here](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/76).. Both Rosy Daniel and Karol Sikora were speakers at the [2009 Princes's Foundation course](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/mark_atkinson.php). He is also a [supplement and he has [promoted the Q-link pendant](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html). The Q-link pendant is a simple [and obvious fraud](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. When Ben Goldacre bought one and opened it. [He found](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) \"No microchip. A coil connected to nothing. And a zero-ohm resistor, which costs half a penny, and is connected to nothing.\" Nevertheless, [Mark Atkinson has waxed lyrical](http://www.activebryantsystems.com/q-link.html) about this component-free device. \"As someone who used to get tired sitting in front of computers and used to worry about the detrimental effects of external EMF's, particularly as an avid user of mobile phones, I decided to research the various devices and technologies on the market that claim to strengthen the body's subtle energy fields. It was Q Link that came out top. As a Q link wearer, I no longer get tired whilst at my computer, plus I'm enjoying noticeably higher energy levels and improved mental performance as a result of wearing my Q Link. I highly recommend it.\" Dr Mark Atkinson, Holistic Medical Physician Mark Atkinson is also a fan of Emo-trance. [He wrote](http://dragonrising.com/reviews/dr_mark_atkinson_on_emotrance.htm), In Now Magazine, \"I wanted you to know that of all the therapies I've trained in and approaches that I have used (and there's been a lot) none have excited me and touched me so deeply than Emotrance.\" \"Silvia Hartmann's technique is based on focusing your thoughts on parts of your body and guiding energy. It can be used for everything from insomnia to stress. The good news is that EmoTrance shows you how to free yourself from these stuck emotions and release the considerable amounts of energy that are lost to them.\" Aha so this particular form of psychobabble is the invention of Silvia Hartmann. Silvia Hartmann came to my attention because her works feature heavily in on of the University of Westminster's barmier \"BSc\" degrees, in 'naturopaths', [described here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812). book [Magic, Spells and Potions](http://dragonrising.com/store/magic_spells_and_potions/?r=DR0609MSAP) \"Dr Hartmann has created techniques that will finally make magic work for you in ways you never believed to be possible.\" Times Higher Education printed a piece with the title ['Energy therapy' project in school denounced as 'psychobabble'](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409054). They'd phoned me a couple of days earlier to see whether I had an opinion about \"Emotrance\". As it happens, I knew a bit about it because it had cropped up in a course given at, guess where, [the University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) . It seems that a secondary school had bought this extreme form of psychobabble. The comments on the [Times Higher piece](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=409054) were unusually long and interesting. It turned out that the inventor of \"Emotrance\", Dr Silvia Hartmann PhD., not only wrote books about magic spells and potions, but also that her much vaunted doctorate had been bought from the Universal Life Church, current cost $29.99. The rest of the teachers The rest of the teachers on the course, despite valiant attempts at vetting by Andrew Miles, includes many names only too well-known to anybody who has taken and interest in pseudo-scientific medicine. Here are some of them. Damien Downing:, even the [Daily Mail sees through him](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1023351/The-great-autism-rip---How-huge-industry-feeds-parents-desperate-cure-children.html).

And last but not least, Karol Sikora. The University of Buckingham removes accreditation of the Faculty of Integrated Medicine The correspondence has been long and, at times, quite blunt. Here are a few quotations from it, The University of Buckingham, being private, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (2000) but nevertheless they have allowed me to reproduce the whole of the correspondence. The University, through its VC, Terence Keeley, has been far more open than places that are in principle subject to FOIA, but which, in practice, [always try to conceal material](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2747). I may post the lot, as time permits, but meanwhile here are some extracts. They make uncomfortable reading for advocates of [magic medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). Miles to Daniel, 8 Dec 2009 \" . . . now that the University has taken his [Sikora's] initial advice in trialing the DipSIM and has found it cost-ineffective, the way forward is therefore to alter that equation through more realistic financial contribution from IHT/FIM at Bath or to view the DipSIM as an experiment that has failed and which must give way to other more viable initiatives.\" \"The University is also able to confirm that we hold no interest in jointly developing any higher degrees on the study of IM with IHT/FIM at Bath. This is primarily because we are developing our own Master's degree in Medicine of the Person in collaboration with various leading international societies and scholars including the WHO and which is based on a different school of thought. \" Miles to Daniel 15 Dec 2009 \"Dear Rosy It appears that you have not fully assimilated the content of my earlier e-mails and so I will reiterate the points I have already made to you and add to them. The DipSIM is an external activity - in fact, it is an external collaboration and nothing more. It is not an internal activity and neither is it in any way part of the medical school and neither will it become so and so the 'normal rules' of academic engagement and scholarly interchange do not apply. Your status is one of external collaborator and not one of internal or even visiting academic colleague. There is no \"joint pursuit\" of an academically rigorous study of IM by UB and IHT/FIM beyond the DipSIM and there are no plans, and never have been, for the \"joint definition of research priorities\" in IM. The DipSIM has been instituted on a trial basis and this has so far shown the DipSIM to be profoundly cost-ineffective for the University. You appear to misunderstand this - deliberately or otherwise.\" Daniel to Miles 13 Jan 2010 \"However, I am aware that weather permitting you and Karol will be off to the Fellows meeting for the newly forming National College (for which role I nominated you to Dr Michael Dixon and Prof David Peters.) I have been in dialogue with Michael and Boo Armstrong from FIH and they are strongly in favour of forming a partnership with FIM so that we effectively become one of many new faculties within the College (which is why we change our name to FIM some months ago). I have told Michael about the difficulties we are having and he sincerely hopes that we can resolve them so that we can all move forward as one. \" Miles to Daniel 20 Jan 2010 \"Congratulations on the likely integration of your organisation into the new College of Integrative Health which will develop out of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. This will make an entirely appropriate home for you for the longer term. Your image of David Colquhoun \"alive and kicking\" as the Inquisitor General, radiating old persecutory energy and believing \"priestess healers\" (such as you describe youself) to be best \"tortured, drowned and even burnt alive\", will remain with me, I suspect, for many years to come (!). But then, as the Inquisitor General did say, 'better to burn in this life than in the next' (!). Overall, then, I reject your conclusion on the nature of the basis of my decision making and playfully suggest that it might form part of the next edition of Frankfurt's recent volume [\"On Bullshit] [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html]I hope you will forgive my injection of a little academic humour in an otherwise formal and entirely serious communication. The nature of IM, with its foundational philosophy so vigorously opposed by mainstream medicine and the conitnuing national and international controversies practitioners, aromatherapists, energy channelers, chinese medicine practitioners et al, can only bring the University difficulties as we seek to establish a formal and internationally recognised School of Medicine and School of Nursing. I do not believe my comments in relation to governance at Bath are \"offensive\". They are, on the contrary, entirely accurate and of concern to the University. There have been resignations at senior level from your Board due to misrepresentation of your position and there has been a Trading Standards Authority investigation into further instances of misrepresentation. I am advised that an audit is underway of your compliance with the Authority's instructions. You have therefore not dealt with my concerns, you have merely described them as \"offensive\". I note from your e-mail that you are now in discussions with other universities and given the specific concerns of the University of Buckingham which I have dealt with exhaustively in this and other correspondences and the incompatibility of the developments at UB with the DipSIM and your own personal ambitions, etc., I believe you to have taken a very wise course and I wish you well in your negotiations. In these circumstances I feel it appropriate to enhance those negotiations by confirming that the University of Buckingham will not authorise the intake of a second cohort of students and that the relationship between IHT and the University will cease following the graduation of those members of the current course that are successful in their studies - the end of February 2011.\" From Miles 2 Feb 2010 \"Here is the list of teachers - you can subtract me (I withdrew from teaching when the antics ay Bath started) and also Professor John Cox (Former President of The Royal College of Psychiatrists and Former Secretary General of the World Psychiatric Association) who withdrew when he learned of some of the stuff going on.... Karol Sikora continues to teach. Michael Loughlin and Carmel Martin are both good colleagues of mine and, I can assure you - taught the students solid stuff! Michael taught medical epistemology and Carmel the emerging field of systems complexity in health services (Both of them have now withdrawn from teaching commitments). The tutors shown are described by Rosy as the finest minds in IM teaching in the country. I interviewed tham all personally on (a) the basis of an updated CV & (b) via a 30 min telephone interview with me personally. Some were excluded from teaching because they were not qualified to do so academically (e.g. Boo Armstrong, Richard Falmer, not even a first degree, etc, etc., but gave a short presentation in a session presided over by an approved teacher) and others were approved because of their academic qualifications, PhD, MD, FRCP etc etc etc) and activity within the IM field. Each approved teacher was issued with highly specific teaching guidance form me (no bias, reference to opposing schools of thought, etc etc) and each teacher was required to complete and sign a Conflicts of Interest form. All of these documentations are with me here. Short of all this governance it's impossible to bar them from teaching because who else would then do it?! Anyway, the end is in sight - Hallelujah! \" From Miles 19 Feb 2010 \"Dear David Just got back to the office after an excellent planning meeting for the new Master's Degree in Person-centred Medicine and a hearty (+ alcoholic) lunch at the Ath! Since I shall never be a FRS, the Ath seems to me the next best 'club' (!). Michael Baum is part of the steering committee and you might like to take his thoughts on the direction of the programme. Our plans may even find their way into your Blog as an example of how to do things (vs how not to do things, i.e. CAM, IM, etc!). This new degree will sit well alongside the new degrees in Public Health - i.e. the population/utilitarian outlook of PH versus the individual person-centred approach., etc. \" And an email from a senior UB spokesperson \"Rumour has it that now that Buckingham has dismissed the 'priestess healer of Bath', RD [Rosy Daniel] , explorations are taking place with other universities, most of which are subject to FoI request from DC at the time of writing. Will these institutions have to make the same mistakes Buckingham did before taking the same action? Rumour also has it that RD changed the name of her institution to FIM in order to fit neatly into the Prince's FIH, a way, no doubt, of achieving 'protection' and 'accreditation' in parallel with particularly lucrative IM 'education' (At \u00a39,000 a student and with RD's initial course attracting 20 mainly GPs, that's \u00a3180,00 - not bad business.... And Buckingham's 'share of this? \u00a312,000!\" The final bombshell; even the Prince of Wales' FIH rejects Daniel and Atkinson? Only today (31 March) I was sent, from a source that I can't reveal, an email which comes from someone who \"represent the College and FIH . . . \".. This makes it clear that the letter comes from the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health | Dr Rosy Daniel BSc MBBCh | Director of the Faculty of Integrated Medicine Medical Director Health Creation 30th March 2010 RE: Your discussion paper and recent correspondence Thank you for meeting with [XXXXXX] and myself this evening to discuss your proposals concerning a future relationship between your Faculty of Integrated Medicine and the new College. As you know, he and I have been asked to represent the College and FIH in this matter. We are aware of difficulties facing your organisations and the FIM DipSIM course. As a consequence of these, it is not possible for the College to enter into an association with you, any of your organisations nor the DipSIM course at the present time. It would, therefore, be wrong to represent to others that any such association has been agreed. You will appreciate that, in these circumstances, you will not receive an invitation to the meeting of 15th April 2010 nor to other planned events. I am sorry to disappoint you in this matter. Yours sincerely Conclusions I'll confess to feeling almost a little guilty for having appeared to persecute the particular individuals involved in thie episode. But patients are involved and so is the law, and both of these are more important than individuals, The only unfair aspect is that, while it seems that even the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health has rejected Daniel and Atkinson, that Foundation embraces plenty of people who are just as deluded, and potentially dangerous, as those two. The answer to that problem is for the Prince to stop endorsing treatments that don't work. As for the University of Buckingham. Well, despite the 'right wing maverick' Kealey and the 'anti-evidence' Miles, I really think they've done the right thing. They've listened, they've maintained academic rigour and they've released all information for which I asked and a lot more. Good for them, I say. Follow-up 15 April 2010. This story was reported by Times Higher Education, under the title \" [It's terminal for integrated medicine diploma](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411217)\". That report didn't attract comments. But on 25th April Dr Rosy Daniel replied with \" ['Terminal'? We've only just begun](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411354)\". This time there were some feisty responses. Dr Daniel really should check her facts before getting into print. 3 March 2011. Unsurprisingly, Dr Daniel is up and running again, under the name of the [British College of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integrativemedicine.uk.com/). The only change seems to be that Mark Atkinson has jumped ship altogether, and, of course, she is now unable to claim endorsement by Buckingham, or any other university. Sadly, though, Karol Sikora seems to have learned nothing from the saga related above. He is still there as chair of the Medical Advisory Board, along with the usual suspects mentioned above.

( [BMJ 2009;339:b5415](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/339/dec14_1/b5415)). I was delighted to be asked to write an editorial about it, In fact it proved quite hard work, because the BMJ thought it improper to be too rude about the royal family, or about the possibility of [Knight Starvation](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=13#quote) among senior medics. The compromise [version that appeared in the BMJ](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/bmj.b5432?ijkey=9VXdYFuowyTRRd6&keytype=ref) is on line (full text link). The changes were sufficient that it seems worth posting the original version (with links embedded for convenience). The cuts are a bit ironic, since the whole point of the article is to point out the stifling political correctness that has gripped the BMA, the royal colleges, and the Department of Health when it comes to dealing with evidence-free medicine. It has become commonplace for people to worry about the future of the print media, The fact of the matter is you can often find a quicker. smarter amd blunter response to the news on blogs than you can find in the [dead tree media](http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=dead-tree+media&i=41015,00.asp). I doubt that the BMJ is in any danger of course. It has a good reputation for its attitude to improper drug company influence (a perpetual problem for clinical journals) as well as for clinical and science articles. It's great to see its editor, Fiona Godlee, supporting the national campaign for reform of the libel laws (please [sign it yourself](http://libelreform.org/sign)). The fact remains that when it comes to the particular problem of [magic medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733), the action has not come from the BMA, the royal colleges, and certainly not from the Department of Health, It has come from what Goldacre called the \" [intrepid, ragged band of bloggers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jul/29/simon-singh-science-chiropractic-litigation)\". They are the ones who've done the investigative journalism, sent complaints and called baloney wherever they saw it. This article was meant to celebrate their collective efforts and to celebrate the fact that those efforts are beginning to percolate upwards to influence the powers that be. It seems invidious to pick on one example, but if you want an example of beautiful and trenchant writing on one of the topics dealt with here, you'd be better off reading Andrew Lewis's piece \" [Meddling Princes, Medical Regulation and Licenses to Kill](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/12/meddling-princes-medical-regulation-and.html)\" than anything in a print journal. I was a bit disappointed by removal of the comment about the Prince of Wales. In fact I'm not particularly republican compared with many of my friends. The royal family is clearly good for the tourist industry and that's important. Since Mrs Thatcher (and her successors) destroyed large swathes of manufacturing and put trust in the vapourware produced by dishonest and/or incompetent bankers, it isn't obvious how the UK can stay afloat. If tourists will pay to see people driving in golden coaches, that's fine. We need the money. What is absolutely NOT acceptable is for royals to interfere in the democratic political process. That is what the Prince of Wales does incessantly. No doubt he is well-meaning, but that is not sufficient. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Newmarket, it might make sense to ask a royal. In medicine it makes no sense at all. But the quality of the advice is irrelevant anyway. The [royal web site](http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/HowtheMonarchyworks/Whatisconstitutionalmonarchy.aspx) itself says \"As a constitutional monarch, the Sovereign must remain politically neutral.\". Why does she not apply that rule to her son? Time to put him over your knee Ma'am? Two of the major bits that were cut out are shown in bold, The many other changes are small. BMJ editorial December 2009 | | Secret remedies: 100 years on Time to look again at the efficacy of remedies Jeffrey Aronson in his article The problems had not improved 40 years later when A.J. Clark published his As early as 1927, Clark had written \"Today some travesty of physical science appears to be the most popular form of incantation\" A 100 years on from the BMA's efforts, we need once again to look at the efficacy of remedies. Indeed the effort is already well under way, but this time it takes a rather different form. The initiative has come largely from an \" Two recent examples suffice to illustrate the problems. The first example is the argument about the desirability of statutory regulation of acupuncture, herbal and traditional Chinese medicine (the Pittilo recommendations) Let's start with a definition, taken from 'A patients' guide to magic medicine' It seems to me to be self-evident that you cannot start to think about a sensible form of regulation unless you first decide whether what you are trying to regulate is nonsense, though this idea does not seem to have penetrated the thinking of the Department of Health or the authors of the Pittilo report. The consultation on statutory regulation has had many submissions The other example concerns the recent 'evidence check: homeopathy' conducted by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee (SCITECH). First the definition In 1842 Oliver Wendell Holmes said all that needed to be said about medicine-free medicine But for pure comedy gold, there is nothing to beat the final session. The health minister, Michael O'Brien, was eventually cajoled into admitting that there was no good evidence that homeopathy worked but defended the idea that the taxpayer should pay for it anyway. It was much harder to understand the position of the chief scientific advisor in the Department of Health, David Harper. He was evasive and ill-informed. Eventually the chairman, Phil Willis, said \"No, that is not what I am asking you. You are the Department's Chief Scientist. Can you give me one specific reference which supports the use of homeopathy in terms of Government policy on health?\". But answer came there none (well, there were words, but they made no sense). Then at the end of the session Harper said \"homeopathic practitioners would argue that the way randomised clinical trials are set up they do not lend themselves necessarily to the evaluation and demonstration of efficacy of homeopathic remedies, so to go down the track of having more randomised clinical trials, for the time being at least, does not seem to be a sensible way forward.\" Earlier, Kent Woods (CEO of the MHRA) had said \"the underlying theory does not really give rise to many testable hypotheses\". These two eminent people seemed to have been fooled by the limp excuses offered by homeopaths. The hypotheses are testable and homeopathy, because it involves pills, is particularly well suited to being tested by proper RCTs (they have been, and when done properly, they fail). If you want to know how to do it, all you have to do is read Goldacre in the Guardian It really isn't vert complicated. \"Imagine going to an NHS hospital for treatment and being sent away with nothing but a bottle of water and some vague promises.\" \"And no, it's not a fruitcake fantasy. This is homeopathy and the NHS currently spends around \u00a310million on it.\" That was written by health journalist Jane Symons, in The Sun These examples serve to show that the medical establishment is slowly being dragged, from the bottom up, into realising that matters of truth and falsehood are more important than their knighthoods. It is all very heartening, both for medicine and for democracy itself. David Colquhoun. Declaration of interests. I was A.J. Clark chair of pharmacology at UCL, 1985 - 2004. 1.

A reply was called for, so I sent this (the version below has links). After a long delay, this response eventually [appeared in the BMJ](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228877) on January 15 2010. It's good to see so many responses, though somewhat alarming to see that several of them seem to expect an editorial to provide a complete review of the literature. I 'll be happy to provide references for any assertion that I made. I also find it a bit odd that some people think that an editorial is not the place to express an opinion robustly. That view seems to me to be a manifestation of the very sort of political correctness that I was deploring. It's a bit like the case when the then health minister, Lord Hunt, referred to [psychic surgery as a \"profession\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=25) when he should have called it a fraudulent conjuring trick. Anything I write is very mild compared with what Thomas Wakley wrote in the Lancet, a journal which he founded around the time UCL came into existence. For [ example](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=246) (I quote) \"[We deplore the] \"state of society which allows various sets of mercenary, goose-brained monopolists and charlatans to usurp the highest privileges.... This is the canker-worm which eats into the heart of the medical body.\" Wakley, T. The Lancet 1838-9, 1 I don't think it is worth replying to people who cite Jacques Benveniste or Andrew Wakefield as authorities. Neither is it worth replying to people who raise the straw man argument about wicked pharmaceutical companies (about which I am on record as being as angry as anyone). But I would like to reply directly to some of the more coherent comments. Sam Lewis and Robert Watson. [ [comment](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228205)] Thank you for putting so succinctly what I was trying to say. Peter Fisher [ [comment](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228128)]. I have a lot of sympathy for Peter Fisher. He has attempted to do some good trials of homeopathy (they mostly had negative outcomes). He said he was \"very angry\" when the non-medical homeopaths were caught out recommending their sugar pills for malaria prevention (not that this as stopped such dangerous claims which are still commonplace). He [agreed with me](http://www.dcscience.net/london-news-220307_NEW.wmv) that there was not sufficient scientific basis for BSc degrees in homeopathy. I suppose that it isn't really surprising that he continues to cherry pick the evidence. As clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital and Homeopathic physician to the Queen, just imagine the cognitive dissonance that would result if he were to admit publicly that is all placebo after all. He has come close though. His (negative) trial for homeopathic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis included the words \"It seems more important to define if homeopathists can genuinely control patients' symptoms and less relevant to have concerns about whether this is due to a 'genuine' effect or to influencing the placebo response\" [2]. [ [download the paper](http://dcscience.net/fisher-scott-2001.pdf)]. When it comes to malaria, it matters a lot. Adrian White [ [comment](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228414)] seems to be cross because I cited my own blog. I did that simply because if he follows the links there he will find the evidence. In the case of acupuncture it has been shown time after time that \"real\" acupuncture does not differ perceptibly from sham. That is true whether the sham consists of retractable needles or real needles in the \"wrong\" places. A non-blind comparison between acupuncture and no acupuncture usually shows some advantage for the former but it is, on average, [too small to be of much](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945) clinical significance [3]. I agree that there is no way to be sure that this advantage is purely placebo effect but since it is small and transient it really doesn't matter much. Nobody has put it more clearly than Barker Bausell in his book, [Snake Oil Science](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell) [4] White also seems to have great faith in peer review. I agree that in real science it is probably the best system we have. But in alternative medicine journals the \"peers\" are usually other true believers in whatever hocus pocus is being promoted and peer reveiw breaks down altogether. R. M. Pittilo [ [comment](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228649)] I'm glad that Professor Pittilo has replied in person because I did single out his report for particular criticism. I agree that his report said that NHS funding should be available to CAM only where there is evidence of efficacy. That was not my criticism. My point was that in his report, the evidence for efficacy was assessed by representatives of Herbal Medicine, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture (four from each). Every one of them would have been out of work if they had found their subjects were nonsense and that, no doubt, explains why the [assessment was so bad](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). To be fair, they did admit that the evidence was not all that it might be and recommended (as always) more research I'd like to ask Professor Pittilo how much money should be spent on more research in the light of the fact that over a billion dollars has been spent in the USA on CAM research without producing a single useful treatment. Pittilo says \"My own view is that both statutory regulation and the quest for evidence should proceed together\" but he seems to neglect the possibility that the quest for evidence might fail. Experience in the USA suggests that is exactly what has, to a large extent, already happened. I also find it quite absurd that the Pittilo report should recommend, despite a half-hearted admission that the evidence is poor, that entry to these subjects should be via BSc Honours degrees. In any case he is already thwarted in that ambition because universities are closing down degrees in these subjects having realised that the time to run a degree is after, not before, you have some evidence that the subject is not nonsense. I hope that in due course Professor Pittilo may take the same action about the [courses in things like homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/search/act_search_new.cfm?q=homeopathy&btnG=Search+RGU&restrict=ExternalOnly&ie=utf8&site=RGUWEB&output=xml_no_dtd&client=RGUWEB&lr=&proxystylesheet=RGUWEB&oe=utf8) that are run by the university of which he is vice-chancellor. That could only enhance the academic reputation of Robert Gordon's University. George Lewith [ [comment](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/dec15_1/b5432#228649)] You must be aware that the proposed regulatory body, the Health Professions Council, has already [broken its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) about \"evidence-based practice\" by agreeing to take on, if asked, practitioners of Herbal Medicine, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. They have (shamefully) excluded the idea that claims of efficacy would be regulated. In other word they propose to provide exactly the sort of pseudo-regulation which would [endanger patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329) They are accustomed to the idea that regulation is to do only with censoring practitioners who are caught in bed with patients. However meritorious that may be, it is not the main problem with pseudo-medicine, an area in which they have no experience. I'm equally surprised that Lewith should recommend that Chinese evaluation of Traditional Chinese medicine should be included in meta-analyses, in view of the well-known fact that 99% of evaluations from China are positive: \"No trial published in China or Russia/USSR found a test treatment to be ineffective\" [5]. He must surely realise that medicine in China is a branch of politics. In fact the whole resurgence in Chinese medicine and acupuncture in post-war times has less to do with ancient traditions than with Chinese nationalism, in particular the wish of Mao Tse-Tung to provide the appearance of health care for the masses (though it is reported that he himself preferred Western Medicine). 1.

Now they have [published their justification](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/homeopathy/ucho5302a.htm) for this claim. It is truly pathetic, as explained by Martin at LayScience: [New Evidence Reveals the MHRA's Farcical Approach to Homeopathy](http://layscience.net/node/895).

Mike O'Brien QC MP, Minister of State for Health Services I am glad that David Colquhoun was entertained by my appearance before the Health Select Committee on Homeopathy. But he is mistaken when he says, \"you cannot start to think about a sensible form of regulation unless you first decide whether or not the thing you are trying to regulate is nonsense.\" Regulation is about patient safety. Acupuncture, herbal and traditional Chinese medicine involve piercing the skin and/or the ingestion of potentially harmful substances and present a possible risk to patients. The Pittilo Report recommends statutory regulation and we have recently held a public consultation on whether this is a sensible way forward. Further research into the efficacy of therapies such as Homeopathy is unlikely to settle the debate, such is the controversy surrounding the subject. That is why the Department of Health's policy towards complementary and alternative medicines is neutral. Whether I personally think Homeopathy is nonsense or not is besides the point. As a Minister, I do not decide the correct treatment for patients. Doctors do that. I do not propose on this occasion to interfere in the doctor-patient relationship. Here is my response to the minister | | I am very glad that the minister himself has replied. I think he is wrong in two ways, one relatively trivial but one very important. First, he is wrong to refer to homeopathy as controversial. It is not. It is quite the daftest for the common forms of magic medicine and essentially no informed person believes a word of it. Of course, as minister, he is free to ignore scientific advice, just as the Second, and far more importantly, he is wrong, dangerously wrong, to say it I was mistaken to claim that \"you cannot start to think about a sensible form of regulation unless you first decide whether or not the thing you are trying to regulate is nonsense\". According to that view it would make sense to grant statutory regulation to voodoo and astrology. The The minister is also wrong to suppose that regulation, in the form proposed by Pittilo, would do anything to help patient safety. Indeed there is a good case to be made that In order to see the harm that can result from statutory regulation, it is necessary only to look at the General Chiropractic Council. Attention was focussed on chiropractic when the British Chiropractic Association decided, foolishly, to sue Simon Singh for defamation. That led to close inspection of the strength of the evidence for their claims to benefit conditions like infant colic and asthma. The It is one thing to say that the government chooses to pay for things like homeopathy, despite it being known that they are only placebos, because some patients like them. It is quite another thing to endanger patient safety by advocating government endorsement in the form of statutory regulation, of treatments that don't work. I would be very happy to meet the minister to discuss the problems involved in ensuring patient safety. He has seen herbalists and other with vested interests. He has been Both the [minister's response](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/feb02_3/c617?FIRSTINDEX=0), and [my reply](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/feb02_3/c640), were reformatted to appear as letters in the print edition of the BMJ, as well as comments on the web.. The King's Fund recently published [Assessing complementary practice Building consensus on appropriate research methods](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/document.rm?id=8425) [or [download pdf](/assessing_complementary_practice.pdf)]. It is described as being the \"Report of an independent advisory group\". I guess everyone knows by now that an \"expert report\" can be produced to back any view whatsoever simply by choosing the right \"experts\", so the first things one does is to see who wrote it. Here they are. - Chair: Professor Dame Carol Black - Harry Cayton, Chief Executive, Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence - Professor Adrian Eddleston, then Vice-Chairman, The King's Fund - Professor George Lewith, Professor of Health Research, Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton - Professor Stephen Holgate, MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology, University of Southampton - Professor Richard Lilford, Head of School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham We see at once two of the best known apologists for alternative medicine, George Lewith (who has [appeared here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=lewith) more than once) and Stephen Holgate. Harry Cayton is CEO of Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which must be one of the most useless box-ticking quangos in existence. It was the CHRE that praised the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) for the quality of its work. That is the same GCC that is at present trying to cope with 600 or so complaints about the people it is supposed to regulate (not to mention a vast number of complaints to Trading Standards Offices). The GCC must be the prime example of the folly of giving government endorsement to things that don't work. But the CHRE were not smart enough to spot that little problem. No doubt Mr Cayton did good work for the Alzheimer's Society. His advocacy of patient's choice may have helped me personally. But it isn't obvious to me that he is the least qualified to express an opinion on research methods in anything whatsoever. According to [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2003/dec/10/guardiansocietysupplement.politics) he is \"BA in English and linguistics from the University of Ulster; diploma in anthropology from the University of Durham; B Phil in philosophy of education from the University of Newcastle.\" Adrian Eddlestone is a [retired Professor of Medicine](http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Eddleston_Adrian_408544754.aspx). He has been in academic administration since 1983. His sympathy for alternative medicine is demonstrated by the fact that he is also Chair of the General Osteopathic Council, yet another \"regulator\" that has done nothing to protect the public from false health claims (and which may, soon, find itself in the same sort of trouble as the GCC). Richard Lilford is the only member of the group who has no bias towards alternative medicine and also the only member with expertise in clinical research methods His [credentials](http://www.hddt.bham.ac.uk/lilford.htm) look impressive, and his publications show how he is the ideal person for this job. I rather liked also his article [Stop meddling and let us get on](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2002/jan/27/NHS.health1).. He [has written](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Lilford+RJ+postmodern&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a) about the harm done by postmodernism and relativism, the [fellow-travellers of alternative medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=36). Most damning of all, Lewith, Eddlestone and Holgate (along with Cyril Chantler, chair of the King's Fund, and homeopaths, spiritual healers and Karol Sikora) are [Foundation Fellows of the Prince of Wales Foundation for Magic Medicine](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/foundation_fellows.html), an organisation that is at the forefront of [spreading medical misinformation](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=FIH). I shall refer here to 'alternative medicine' rather than 'complementary medicine' which is used in the report. It is not right to refer to a treatment as 'complementary' until such time as it has been shown to work. The term 'complementary' is a euphemism that, like [ 'integrative'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466), is standard among alternative medicine advocates whose greatest wish is to gain respectability. The Report The recommendations On page 10 we find a summary of the conclusions. The report identifies five areas of consensus, which together set a framework for moving forward. These are: - the primary importance of controlled trials to assess clinical and cost effectiveness. - the importance of understanding how an intervention works - the value of placebo or non-specific effects - the need for investment and collaboration in creating a sound evidence base - the potential for whole-system evaluation to guide decision-making and subsequent research. The first recommendation is just great. The rest sound to me like the usual excuses for incorporating ineffective treatments into medical practice. Notice the implicit assumption in the fourth point that spending money on research will establish \"a sound evidence base\". There is a precedent, but it is ignored. A huge omission from the report is that it fails to mention anywhere that a lot of research has already been done. Much research has already been done (and failed) The report fails to mention at all the single most important fact in this area. The US National Institutes of Health has spent over a billion dollars on research on alternative medicines, over a period of more than 10 years. It has failed to come up with any effective treatments whatsoever. See, for example [Why the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Should Be Defunded](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html); [Should there be more alternative research?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=202); [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=231), and most recently, [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031). Why did the committee think this irrelevant? I can't imagine. You guess. The report says \"This report outlines areas of potential consensus to guide research funders, researchers, commissioners and complementary practitioners in developing and applying a robust evidence base for complementary practice.\" As happens so often, there is implicit in this sentence the assumption that if you spend enough money evidence will emerge. That is precisely contrary to the experence in the USA where spending a billion dollars produced nothing beyond showing that a lot of things we already thought didn't work were indeed ineffective. And inevitably, and tragically, [ NICE's biggest mistake](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593) is invoked. \"It is noteworthy that the evidence is now sufficiently robust for NICE to include acupuncture as a treatment for low back pain.\" [p ] Did the advisory group not read the evidence used (and misinterpeted) by NICE? It seems not. Did the advisory group not read the outcome of NIH-funded studies on acupuncture as summarised by Barker Bausell in his book, [Snake Oil Science?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell) Apparently not. It's hard to know because the report has no references. George Lewith is quoted [p. 15] as saying \"to starve the system of more knowledge means we will continue to make bad decisions\". No doubt he'd like more money for research, but if a billion dollars in the USA gets no useful result, is Lewith really likely to do better? The usual weasel words of the alternative medicine industry are there in abundance \"First, complementary practice often encompasses an intervention (physical treatment or manipulation) as well as the context for that intervention. Context in this setting means both the physical setting for the delivery of care and the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient.\" [p. 12] Yes, but ALL medicine involves the context of the treatment. This is no different whether the medicine is alternative or real. The context (or placebo) effect comes as an extra bonus with any sort of treatment. \"We need to acknowledge that much of complementary practice seeks to integrate the positive aspects of placebo and that it needs to be viewed as an integral part of the treatment rather than an aspect that should be isolated and discounted.\" [p. 13] This is interesting. It comes very close (here and elsewhere) to admitting that all you get is a placebo effect, and that this doesn't matter. This contradicts directly the first [ recommendation of the House of Lords report (2000)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199).. Both the [House of Lords report](http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm) on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the [Government's response](http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm51/5124/5124.pdf) to it, state clearly \". . . we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order\". (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? (2) is the treatment safe? (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment?. The crunch comes when the report gets to what we should pay for. \"Should we be prepared to pay for the so-called placebo effect? The view of the advisory group is that it is appropriate to pay for true placebo (rather than regression to the mean or temporal effects).\" [p 24] Perhaps so, but there is very little discussion of the emormous ethical questions:that this opinion raises: - How much is one allowed to lie to patients in order to elicit a placebo effect? - Is is OK if the practitioner believes it is a placebo but gives it anyway? - Is it OK if the pratitioner believes that it is not a placebo when actually it is? - Is it OK for practitioners to go degrees taught by people who believe that it is not a placebo when actually it is? The report fails to face frankly these dilemmas. The present rather absurd position in which it is considered unethical for a medical practitioner to give a patient a bottle of pink water, but perfectly acceptable to refer them to a homeopath. There is no sign either of taking into account the cultural poison that is spread by telling people about yin, yang and meridians and such like preposterous made-up mumbo jumbo. That is part of the cost of endorsing placebos. And just when one thought that believing things because you wished they were true was going out of fashion Once again we hear a lot about the alleged difficulties posed by research on alternative medicine. These alleged difficulties are, in my view, mostly no more than excuses. There isn't the slightest difficulty in testing things like herbal medicine or homeopathy, in a way that preserves all the 'context' and the ways of working of homeopaths and herbalists. Anyone who reads [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2) knows how to do that. In the [case of acupuncture](#), great ingenuity has gone into divising controls. The sham and the 'real' acupuncture always come out the same. In a non-blind comparison between acupuncture and no acupuncture the latter usually does a bit worse, but the effects are small and transient and entirely compatible with the view that it is a theatrical placebo. Despite these shortcomings, some of the conclusions [p. 22] are reasonable. \"The public needs more robust evidence to make informed decisions about the use of complementary practice. Commissioners of public health care need more robust evidence on which to base decisions about expenditure of public money on complementary practice.\" What the report fails to do is to follow this with the obvious conclusion that such evidence is largely missing and that until such time as it is forthcoming there should be no question of the NHS paying for alternative treatments. Neither should there be any question of giving them [official government recognition](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) in the form of 'statutory regulation'. The folly of doing that is illustrated graphically by [the case of chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) which is now in deep crisis after inspection of its claims in the wake of the Simon Singh defamation case. Osteopathy will, I expect, suffer the same fate soon. In the summary on p.12 we see a classical case of the tension Controlled trials of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are of primary importance We recognise that it is the assessment of effectiveness that is of primary importance in reaching a judgement of different practices. Producing robust evidence that something works in practice - that it is effective - should not be held up by the inevitably partial findings and challenged interpretations arising from inquiries into how the intervention works. The headline sounds impeccable, but directly below it we see a clear statement that we should use treatments before we know whether they work. \"Effectiveness\", in the jargon of the alternative medicine business, simply means that uncontrolled trials are good enough. The bit about \"how it works\" is another very common red herring raised by alternative medicine people. Anyone who knows anything about pharmacology that knowledge about how any drug works is incomplete and often turns out to be wrong. That doesn't matter a damn if it performs well in good double-blind randomised controlled trials. One gets the impression that the whole thing would have been a lot worse without the dose of reality injected by Richard Lilford. He is quoted as a saying \"All the problems that you find in complementary medicine you will encounter in some other kind of treatment ... when we stop and think about it... how different is it to any branch of health care - the answer to emerge from our debates is that it may only be a matter of degree.\" [p. 17] I take that to mean that alternative medicine poses problems that are no different from other sorts of treatment. They should be subjected to exactly the same criteria. If they fail (as is usually the case) they should be rejected. That is exactly right. The report was intended to produce consensus, but throughout the report, there is a scarcely hidden tension between believers on one side, and Richard Lilford's impeccable logic on the other. Who are the King's Fund? The [King's Fund](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/) is an organisation that [states its aims](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/document.rm?id=7710) thus. \"The King's Fund creates and develops ideas that help shape policy, transform services and bring about behaviour change which improve health care.\" It bills this report on its home page as \"New research methods needed to build evidence for the effectiveness of popular complementary therapies\". But in fact the report doesn't really recommend 'new research methods' at all, just that the treatments pass the same tests as any other treatment. And note the term 'build evidence'. It carries the suggestion that the evidence will be positive. Experience in the USA (and to a smaller extent in the UK) suggests that every time some good research is done, the effect is not to 'build evidence' but for the evidence to crumble further If the advice is followed, and the results are largely negative, as has already happened in the USA, the Department of Health would look pretty silly if it had insisted on degrees and on statutory regulation. The King's Fund chairman is Sir Cyril Chantler and its Chief Executive is Niall Dickson. It produces reports, some of which are better than this one. I know it's hard to take seriously an organisation that wants to \"share its vision\" withyou, but they are trying. \"The King's Fund was formed in 1897 as an initiative of the then Prince of Wales to allow for the collection and distribution of funds in support of the hospitals of London. Its initial purpose was to raise money for London's voluntary hospitals,\" It seems to me that the King's Fund is far too much too influenced by the present Prince of Wales. He is, no doubt, well-meaning but he has become a major source of medical misinformation and his influence in the Department of Health is deeply unconstitutional. I was really surprised to see thet Cyril Chantler spoke at the [2009 conference of the Prince of Wales Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/conference_material_2009/) for Integrated Health, despite having a preview of the sort of make-believe being propagated by other speakers. [His talk there](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/conference_material_2009/conference_blogs/chronic_stress_is_a.html) struck me as evading all the essential points. Warm, woolly but in the end, a danger to patients. Not only did he uncritically fall for the spin on the word \"integrated\", but he also fell for the idea that \"statutory regulation\" will safeguard patients. Revelation of [what is actually taught](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) on degrees in these subjects shows very clearly that they endanger the public. But the official mind doesn't seem ever to look that far. It is happy ticking boxes and writing vacuous managerialese. It lacks curiosity. Follow-up The British Medical Journal published today [an editorial](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep01_2/b3335) which also recommends rebranding of 'pragmatic' trials. No surprise there, because the editorial is written by Hugh MacPherson, senior research fellow, David Peters, professor of integrated healthcare and Catherine Zollman, general practitioner. I find it a liitle odd that the BMJ says \"Competing Interests: none. David Peters interest is obvious from his job description. It is less obvious that [Hugh MacPherson](https://hsciweb.york.ac.uk/research/public/Staff.aspx?ID=926) is an acupuncture enthusiast who publishes mostly in alternative medicine journals. He has written a book with the extraordinary title \"Acupuncture Research, Strategies for Establishing an Evidence Base\". The title seems to assume that the evidence base will materialise eventually despite a great deal of work that suggests it won't. Catherine Zollman is a GP who is into homeopathy as well as acupuncture. All three authors were speakers at the Prince of Wales conference, described at [Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of 'integrated'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#zoll). The comments that follow the editorial start with an excellent contribution from [James Matthew May](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335#219657). His distinction between 'caring' and 'curing' clarifies beautifully the muddled thinking of the editorial. Then a comment from DC, [If your treatments can't pass the test, the test must be wrong](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335#219673). It concludes \"At some point a stop has to be put to this continual special pleading. The financial crisis (caused by a quite different group of people who were equally prone to wishful thinking) seems quite a good time to start.\" This post has been [translated into Belorussian](http://onlinepharmacycheck.com/~doc/cnmed-be).. Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. "}
