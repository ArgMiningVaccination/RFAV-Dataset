Even though no such pill exists, there are several herbs that can help improve your metabolism and help with weight loss. There are some herbs to boost metabolism and weight loss. They provide a thermogenic effect to increase your metabolism. Other herbs reduce hunger so you can naturally reduce your calorie consumption. As with any medication or herbal remedy, these herbal formulas must be properly used to maximize your weight loss efforts while minimizing unwanted side effects. When weight management herbs are used in conjunction with a diet and exercise program, [weight loss](https://rosewellness.com/weight-loss-program/) is achievable. How to Boost Your Metabolism Metabolism is defined as the chemical reactions that allow the body to extract energy from food and use it to fuel. Simply put, metabolism is the rate at which your calories are consumed, broken down into useable energy, and then used by the body. There are several things that can affect your metabolism. Your body size, gender, age, and genes all affect your metabolism. - Increased Muscle Mass - For example, muscle cells need more energy than fat cells, which means individuals with more muscle typically have a faster metabolism. - Sex hormones - [Testosterone](https://rosewellness.com/naturally-increase-testosterone/)generally leads to more muscle mass and less body fat, which means men often have a faster metabolism than women. - Age - As you age, you may begin to lose muscle, which can cause your metabolism to slow down. In fact, your [metabolism declines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880224/)by 5 to 10 percent each decade. One of the best ways to increase your metabolism and aid in your [weight loss](https://rosewellness.com/benefits-of-whey-protein-for-weight-loss/) efforts is to include exercise in your daily routine. As you build muscle, your metabolism gets a significant boost. Try to get at least 60 minutes of exercise each day to maximize your weight loss efforts. In the beginning, it may seem impossible to complete 60 minutes of exercise, which is why it may be better to [break your exercise](https://rosewellness.com/functional-exercises-versus-traditional-gym-routine/) down into three 20 minute bursts. Herbs for Weight Loss If you have ever tried to follow a strict diet, you know how difficult it is to stick with it. One way to ensure you can stick to a diet is to prepare foods that are delicious and nutritious. Herbs and spices not only flavor your food but can also aid in your weight loss efforts. There are five common herbs that can boost your metabolism and help you [lose excess weight](https://rosewellness.com/mistakes-when-trying-to-lose-weight/). Turmeric Turmeric is a bright yellow spice that is loved for its flavor, color, and medicinal properties. Turmeric's active compound is curcumin. Curcumin enhances fat loss, decreases belly fat, and enhances your weight loss efforts. Curcumin blocks the synthesis of fat. Turmeric is considered a warming spice, which means it increases your body's temperature to boost metabolism levels. Turmeric provides anti-inflammatory properties that reduce systemic [inflammation](https://rosewellness.com/foods-that-cause-inflammation/). It can also suppress fat tissue growth and regulate glucose levels by lowering [insulin resistance](https://rosewellness.com/insulin-resistance-weight-gain/). Finally, turmeric increases bile production, which is used by the body to emulsify fat. Ginger Ginger is a plant from Southeast Asia and has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries. The main compound in ginger is gingerol and provides many of the medicinal properties found in this potent, yet delicious herb. Ginger provides powerful anti-inflammatory effects and helps reduce oxidative stress in the body. Ginger supplements can help significantly reduce body weight and waist to hip ratio. Ginger also helps reduce BMI and insulin levels. [Research](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/FO/C9FO00293F) has shown that ginger increases metabolism while reducing systemic inflammation. Oregano Oregano is a potent, fragrant herb used in Italian cooking. This delicious herb has powerful compounds and antioxidants that can help you lose weight and feel great. Oregano contains terpenoids, terpenes, and phenols, including carvacrol, thymol, and rosmarinic acid. Carvacrol may boost your weight loss efforts. It works by affecting specific proteins and genes in the body that are responsible for controlling fat synthesis. Oregano also helps to reduce [systemic inflammation](https://rosewellness.com/types-of-inflammation/) and [reduce pain](https://rosewellness.com/inflammation-chronic-pain-management/), so you can exercise more. Fenugreek Fenugreek has been used in alternative medicine for many years and is also an herb used in a plethora of Indian dishes. This household spice gives a sweet, nutty flavor to your dishes. One tablespoon of fenugreek seeds provides iron, [magnesium](https://rosewellness.com/benefits-of-magnesium/), and manganese to support health. Fenugreek may also help with [metabolic](https://rosewellness.com/metabolic-heart-health/) conditions like [diabetes](https://rosewellness.com/signs-of-diabetes-in-women/). One study found that taking 50 milligrams of fenugreek powder with meals can improve glucose levels, improves insulin function, and [reduces bad cholesterol](https://rosewellness.com/cholesterol-control/) levels. Fenugreek helps control appetite thanks to its [fiber content](https://rosewellness.com/benefits-of-fiber-for-weight-loss/). Reduced hunger and food intake can aid in weight loss. Finally, fenugreek helps to reduce systemic inflammation, which can interfere with the body's ability to convert food into energy. Ginseng Ginseng is another herb commonly used in alternative medicine. This root plant has been studied extensively. Research has proven time and time again that ginseng can help boost metabolism and aid in [weight loss](https://rosewellness.com/weight-loss-programs/). When ginseng is combined with daily exercise and a [healthy diet](https://rosewellness.com/myths-about-eating-healthy-foods-on-budget/), you will lose more body fat and weight than those who depend on exercise and diet alone. Ginseng affects the metabolism of fat and cholesterol through its effects on adiponectin, leptin, and insulin. The active compounds in ginseng (ginsenosides) stimulate fat loss at a molecular level, which helps decrease hunger and maintain insulin levels. Finally, ginseng increases your energy levels and reduces fatigue. When ginseng is taken regularly, your body's [detoxification](https://rosewellness.com/detoxification-therapy/) system becomes more efficient at clearing free radicals from the body and reducing oxidative stress on the body. It is important to know that herbs can provide many medicinal benefits as well as enhance the flavors of foods. Herbs like turmeric, ginseng, and oregano help enhance your body's ability to burn fat, increase your metabolism, and reduce cravings. "}
