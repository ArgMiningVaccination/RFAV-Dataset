These are all [common side effects](/health/vaccinations/side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccine) of the COVID-19 vaccine. You may have also come across information about people experiencing paralysis after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. While this has certainly been documented, it's also very rare. It's important to know that the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risks of rare side effects. COVID-19 has resulted in more than [6 million deaths](https://covid19.who.int/) worldwide. Vaccines are [highly effective](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness) Continue reading below to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and paralysis. There are several potential causes of [paralysis](/health/paralysis) following a COVID-19 vaccine. We'll explore each of them in more detail below. However, before we get started, it's important to reiterate that experiencing paralysis after a COVID-19 vaccine is exceedingly rare. Of the millions of doses administered globally, only a tiny percentage of people reported paralysis. Overall, the benefits of vaccination in protecting against serious illness and death due to [COVID-19](/health/coronavirus-covid-19) outweigh the risks that may be associated with the vaccines. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)](/health/guillain-barre-syndrome) happens when your immune system attacks parts of your peripheral nervous system, which are the nerves located outside of your brain and spinal cord. This can lead to weakness and paralysis. What exactly causes GBS is unknown. However, many times, it starts following a viral infection. In very rare situations, GBS has also been documented following vaccination. In the United States, GBS has mainly been associated with the [Johnson & Johnson (J&J)](/health/vaccinations/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine) COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is different from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines in that it uses an adenovirus vector. A [2022 study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791533) GBS can affect anyone at any age. However, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) The elevated risk of GBS is one of the reasons why the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a4.htm) Bell's palsy [Bell's palsy](/health/bells-palsy) is a type of temporary facial paralysis that typically affects one side of the face. The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown, but inflammation or swelling affecting the [facial nerve](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/facial-nerve#1) plays a role. Bell's palsy has most often been reported after the [mRNA COVID-19 vaccines](/health/how-does-mrna-vaccine-work). These are the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Both large-scale clinical trials for these vaccines reported rare occurrences of Bell's palsy: - In the Pfizer-BioNTech trials, out of 43,252 participants, in the vaccine group had Bell's palsy, compared to no individuals in the control group. [four people](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) - In the Moderna trials, out of 30,350 trial participants, in the vaccine group had Bell's palsy as well as one individual in the control group. [three spinal cord becomes inflamed. The condition causes symptoms that affect the body in a band-like pattern and can include weakness, pain, and sensory changes. Transverse myelitis happens due to damage to nerve fibers in the spinal cord. While the cause of some cases can remain unknown, a variety of factors may cause transverse myelitis to develop, including: - autoimmune activity, which can include: - certain autoimmune conditions like [multiple sclerosis](/health/multiple-sclerosis) - autoimmune responses after an infection or vaccination - autoimmune activity due to a cancer - certain autoimmune conditions like - infections - inflammatory conditions that affect the spinal cord There have been case reports of transverse myelitis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination. Both the [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8860770/) [vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667257X21000176) and the [Moderna](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3841558) [vaccine](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2021/12230/acute_autoimmune_transverse_myelitis_following.167.aspx) are represented in these reports. Most, but not all, of these individuals were older in age. Transverse myelitis has also been [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8540274/) [AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine](/health/adult-vaccines/astrazeneca-vaccine), which, like the J&J vaccine, uses an adenovirus vector. However, this vaccine isn't currently authorized for use in the United States. As we mentioned, documented occurrences of transverse myelitis after COVID-19 vaccination have largely been limited to case reports and series. Compared to the number of vaccine doses administered globally, this effect is very rare. In fact, a [2021 case report](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3841558) noted that, as of April 21, 2021, only 45 reports of transverse myelitis after COVID-19 vaccination had been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Neuralgic amyotrophy [Neuralgic amyotrophy](/health/brachial-neuritis) is a rare condition that involves pain and progressive weakness in the shoulder and arm. It's also called Parsonage-Turner syndrome. Neuralgic amyotrophy is believed to be caused by an abnormal inflammatory response of the [immune system](/health/cold-flu/fun-facts). Some factors that have been linked to the condition include: - infections, particularly viral infections - recent vaccination - injury or trauma - existing autoimmune conditions Similar to transverse myelitis, reports of neuralgic amyotrophy after the COVID-19 vaccine are limited to [several](https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/114/7/503/6339673) [case studies](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2022/04/05/jnnp-2021-328182). It's been reported after all three of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved or authorized in the United States. The symptoms of paralysis to be aware of after a COVID-19 vaccine can depend on the cause. Let's break these down now. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome The potential [symptoms of GBS](/health/guillain-barre-syndrome#symptoms) are: - tingling in the hands or feet - weakness in the legs that eventually spreads to the upper body - impaired movement and coordination - difficulty with chewing and swallowing - trouble breathing - problems with bowel and bladder control - changes in heart rate or blood pressure Bell's palsy The [symptoms of Bell's palsy](/health/bells-palsy#symptoms) can include: - facial weakness or paralysis that often impacts one side of the face and comes on suddenly - trouble with blinking or making facial expressions - drooping of the mouth - drooling - changes in tearing - difficulty eating and drinking - changes to your sense of taste - increased sensitivity to loud noise - facial pain Transverse myelitis The [symptoms of transverse myelitis](/health/multiple-sclerosis/transverse-myelitis#symptoms) may include: - weakness or paralysis of the legs and arms that develops over a period of hours to days - pain that typically starts in the lower back and radiates into the legs, arms, or torso - changes in sensation, such as feelings of pins and needles, burning, or numbness - problems with bowel and bladder control Neuralgic amyotrophy If you develop [neuralgic amyotrophy](/health/brachial-neuritis#symptoms), you may experience: - shoulder or arm pain that comes on suddenly, often affecting only one side of the body - progressive muscle weakness or atrophy in the affected area - reduced reflexes - loss of sensation in the affected area When to see a doctor Contact your doctor right away if you begin to experience any general symptoms of paralysis, such as muscle weakness or numbness and tingling, after a COVID-19 vaccine. If your symptoms are severe or are getting worse rapidly, call 911 or go to the emergency room. According to the [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/guillain-barre-syndrome-fact-sheet) Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) treatment Several treatments can be including: [plasma exchange](/health/plasmapheresis)or [immunoglobulin therapy](/health/ivig-infusion) [steroids](/health/corticosteroids-what-are-they) [physical therapy](https://www.healthline.com/health/occupational-therapy-vs-physical-therapy) - supportive care, if necessary, such as heart monitoring and respiratory support Bell's palsy treatment The outlook for Bell's palsy is typically quite good. The condition is temporary and most people recover the function of their facial muscles [within 6 months](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/bells-palsy-fact-sheet) Transverse myelitis treatment While many people do recover from transverse myelitis, it can sometimes take months to years. Treatment is similar to that of GBS, often involving plasma exchange or immunoglobulin therapy, steroids, and physical therapy. Neuralgic amyotrophy treatment The treatment of neuralgic amyotrophy can involve pain management, steroids, and physical therapy. While it can resolve on its own, its outlook varies greatly between individuals. About [10 to 20 percent](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/parsonage-turner-syndrome/) of people may experience lingering pain or difficulty exercising the affected arm. Paralysis has been documented after COVID-19 vaccines. However, it happens only rarely. Overall, the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19 outweigh the potential risks associated with vaccination. Be sure to raise any concerns that you may have about COVID-19 vaccines to your doctor. They can help to address any questions you may have. If you do begin to experience symptoms of paralysis after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, contact your doctor right away. Prompt treatment can help to improve the chances of having a full recovery. "}
