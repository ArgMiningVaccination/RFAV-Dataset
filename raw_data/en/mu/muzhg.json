You should be able to get it in your own community. Now I understand a lot of people are still into this 'Not in my backyard' thing, where you don't want this sort of treatment in your community. Well, you need \u00c2 this sort of treatment in your community because your children, your sons and your daughters, your brothers and your sisters, have a disease and you need to be willing to treat them where they live,\" said Assemblymember Peoples-Stokes, speaking on legislation that requires hospitals to educate individuals about available treatment services for opioid addiction and empower professionals to administer emergency assistance to <a say that there is no question that drug addiction is a disease. It's a disease now if you are addicted to opioids or heroin. It was a disease for the people who were addicted to crack. It was a disease to the people addicted to cocaine. Addiction is a disease. And so it's important for it to be treated like a health issue and not a criminal justice issue,\" said Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes, who voted in favor of a bill that will require continued education in pain management by physicians; mandate insurance coverage for inpatient treatment services and limit opioid prescriptions from 30-day probably one of the most important topics that we've discussed of recent because there're not many of us in here who has not had a loved one in the hospital, or who has been in the hospital ourselves and had the occasion when you are actually looking for a nurse and there wasn't one available. That doesn't mean that there's a \u00c2 nurse slacking off somewhere, that means that a nurse legitimately has too many patients to see,\" said Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes while explaining her support on legislation which would enact the \"safe staffing for quality there are a number of young people out there, who really feel like they have nowhere to turn because of what they did a year ago. And we need to re-provide them that opportunity. This is what this bill does. It says you do have somewhere to turn. There are opportunities for you in this country, and we're going to help make sure that that happens for you. So I want to applaud my colleagues who are voting in support of this legislation, and say to my colleagues who think that it's still a no vote, you just don't understand. You don't understand \u00c2 how people's lives have been destroyed because they smoked a joint, and other people who smoked the same joint, lives are full. You just don't understand,\" said Assemblymember Peoples-Stokes, sponsor of a bill \u00c2 that would seal the record of in support of a resolution calling on the governor to proclaim June 19, 2016 as Juneteenth Day in the State of New historic era that we call the Michigan St. Heritage Corridor and it really focuses on the history of African Americans in the City of Buffalo through multiple centuries, one through the underground railroad\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and two the century when the NAACP was started with the Niagara movement,\" said Assemblywoman People-Stokes in reverence to a new project in her district called the Michigan St. Heritage Corridor.<br />\u00c2 ', playerName: '#plyr-1', the right to make that decision on their own,\" said Assemblymember Peoples-Stokes, discussing her support for legislation aimed at protecting rights for women to make their own reproductive healthcare choices. \"We don't have the right to impose our religious or personal beliefs on other people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We swore to support the people of this state and there are many people in this state who would like the opportunity to choose for proposed bill that aims to prevent gentrification.\u00c2 \"Our bill is focused on seniors who are over a certain age and fit within a certain income and it would prohibit the local government from raising their property tax that whatever we can do to use the sun as a renewable energy source, we should be doing that.

And I think it's one that we must pursue with vigor, and I think that this legislation helps support the need and the desire for many people to have access to solar energy. I know for a fact that the National Grid company which provides electricity in the city of Buffalo right now is entertaining the thought of actually putting solar panels on low-income families' homes and allowing them to reap the benefits of that, by not only reducing the price of electricity in their homes, but also allowing them to have extra access resources,\" said Assemblywoman People-Stokes who voted in the affirmative for a bill to mitigate the impact of climate change in New York. <a many years, abandoned properties in Buffalo eventually became demolished properties. And eventually became vacant land. And I really think that this approach to ask bankers, who are foreclosing on people whether people deserved it or not, they should have helped figure out a strategy to keep them in their home as opposed to putting them out. It's only fair for them to take care of the lawn and keep the property properly boarded up so that it isn't used for criminal activity. So I think it is fair when homeowners have property that they allow to go into disrepair, municipalities are able to charge them based on the codes that they have. So banks should be no different. If you have a property, you should be willing to maintain it or either make sure someone lives in it that will maintain it,\" said Assemblymember Peoples-Stokes, who cast her vote in the affirmative for a bill that expands the provisions relating to mandatory settlement in residential foreclosure actions. <a with a number of things that my colleagues have said, that in this country, the way that education is disseminated is different in majority communities than it is in minority communities \u00e2\u20ac\" that doesn't matter whether you're in New York City or Buffalo,\" said Assemblymember Crystal Peoples-Stokes of legislation to extend mayoral control of New York City schools. <a of legislation is happening already in some counties and some communities.
