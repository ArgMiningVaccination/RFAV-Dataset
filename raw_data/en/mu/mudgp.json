But unlike adults, kids - and especially babies - are more vulnerable due to their smaller size. Toxins and their effects can build up and make it harder for a child to stay well. Behavior changes or agitation, sensory processing glitches, gut symptoms, rashes, or more serious concerns like cough, unexplained fever, or even seizures can result from slowly built up toxic burdens or from an abrupt large exposure. Some circumstances that burden their bodies and make it harder to detoxify are... - Wildfire - including proximity to leftover dust and burnt debris - has especially toxic and lingering effects. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/HKbEpbkCbXw) to learn more. - Poor air quality from car exhaust, industrial pollutants, fracking, ozone - Regularly eating processed foods with additives, colorings, artificial ingredients, glyphosate and other pesticides (organic foods help minimize this) - Well check visits where multiple vaccines are administered at once (check here for [more detail on detoxifying vaccines](https://deeprootsathome.com/do-not-wait-to-do-this-if-your-baby-regresses-after/)) - Shampoos, fabrics, bedding, soaps, toiletries and anything used topically can contain parabens, fragrances, formaldehyde, aluminum, titanium, bisphenol-A (BPA), talc, flame retardants - these and many more toxins are in products our children put on their skin every day. - Excessive heavy metals from air, water, medications, food, or even toothpaste - which can give your child too much fluoride if they swallow some every day (avoid that with a fluoride free toothpaste). And a new twist on toxins for children concerns covid vaccines. Learn more about these concerns [here](https://mailchi.mp/nutritioncare/keep-out-of-reach-of-children?e=96df394500). At Flatiron Functional Medicine, where [my office](https://www.jillcarnahan.com/services/functional-medicine-nutrition-judy/) and practice are embedded, [Jill Carnahan MD](https://www.jillcarnahan.com/about-us/) has suggested supportive supplements to help mitigate possible negative effects of a covid vaccine dose. We recommend doing this for 4-6 weeks following a vaccine dose. These are items I have safely and effectively used over the years in my pediatric nutrition practice. Children can use these items. Check with your doctor if your child uses medications for other conditions or if you're not sure whether these options are right for your child.

Circulation Support - Myocarditis and cardiovascular events including stroke have emerged as a potential negative effect of covid vaccines, especially in teens and children. These functional foods and compounds can reduce inflammation and help prevent clots: - High potency DHA and EPA omega 3 fatty acids - at least 500 mg DHA and 500 mg EPA. Use a pure and clean brand that allows independent product testing for heavy metals and toxins. My favorites for kids: - Nordic Naturals Pro Omega 2000 Junior 2 softgels daily (chew or swallow) - Pharmax Finest Pure Fish Oil 1 teaspoon daily (good option for high potency with low volume of liquid) - Barlean's High Potency Omega 3 Key Lime (pudding like texture) If your child can swallow capsules: - Pycnogenol Douglas Labs 25 mg capsule daily. Pycnogenol has been shown to lower inflammation in children with asthma, to reduce asthma medication needed, and to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. If your child uses a medication for behavior or seizures, check with your doctor before using pycnogenol. Pycnogenol may lower blood pressure. - Allergy Research Group Nattokinase 36 mg capsule - Nattokinase is an enzyme with capability to [reduce arterial plaques and lower blood lipids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763875/). Anti-oxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Support - - DaVinci Labs ChewMelt - 1/2 chewable daily - ReadiSorb Glutathione 1/2 to 1 teaspoon daily - Empirical Labs Liposomal Curcumin / Reseveratrol 1/2 - 1 teaspoon daily - D-Hist Junior chewables - 2 (smaller children) or up to 6 chewables (kids over 50 lbs) daily - Seeking Health Optimal Vitamin D drops 2000 IU per drop - get a baseline vitamin D level at your pediatrician to discern if more than 4 drops weekly are needed. Gut and Overall Immune Support - - SBI Protect 1 scoop daily in soft food or liquid - Probiotics - Allergy Research Group Lactobacillus or ProFlora 4R Spore Probiotic - Animal sources of vitamin A: Cod liver oil 1/2 teaspoon daily for children <50 lbs and 1-2 teaspoons daily for larger children. This gives the form of vitamin A (14 hydroxy retro-retinol) that turns on T cells. Synthetic vitamin A supplements (retinyl palmitate) don't do this and neither do plant carotenoids (at least not without some metabolic transitions first). You can also use vitamin A rich foods like grass fed organic full fat dairy foods including butter, pastured egg yolks, and liver. - Cats claw - capsules or drops available: - QuickSilver Scientific Cats Claw Elite - 1 pump daily - Pure Encapsulations Cats Claw capsule 1 daily (children over 70 lbs) |To set up your own account for access to these and other products I recommend and use in practice, "}
