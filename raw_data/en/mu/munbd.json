A primary series is an initial series of vaccinations designed to give you protection against a disease. For COVID-19 this is typically two doses, but people with compromised immune systems require a third dose to complete their primary series. If your child received the Pfizer Infant vaccine for any of their initial doses, they will require a three dose primary series, and four doses if they have compromised immune systems. Booster doses help maintain and lengthen your level of protection, as immunity may decrease over time. Public Health encourages all eligible Nova Scotians to get their next dose of the COVID-19 vaccine when it is recommended. Who is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine dose at this time? - Anyone over 6 months of age who has not completed their primary series. - Anyone 5 years of age and older who has not yet received a single booster. If you have completed your primary series and have had one or more booster doses, you are not eligible to receive a dose at this time. Information about fall COVID-19 vaccines will be shared when it is available. Recommended intervals between doses: Ages 6 Months - 4 Years Moderna (Bivalent or Original) - 2 dose primary series* - Between doses 1 and 2 - 8 weeks (56 days) *Children who are [moderately to severely immunocompromised](https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirusimmunocompromised) will need an additional dose to complete their primary series. In this case, the time between the first and second dose is 4 weeks (28 days) and the time between the second and third dose is 8 weeks (56 days). Please note: Pfizer Infant is no longer available in Nova Scotia. Children aged 6 months to 4 years who received Pfizer Infant for any dose in their primary series need to receive 3 total doses (or 4 if immunocompromised), even if completing their primary series with a different vaccine. Ages 5-11 years Between primary series doses (1 and 2*) 8 weeks (56 days) *Nova Scotians who are [moderately to severely immunocompromised](https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirusimmunocompromised) will need a third dose of vaccine to complete their primary series. In this case, the time between the first dose and second dose is 4 weeks (28 days) and the time between the second dose and third dose is 8 weeks (56 days). Between end of primary series and booster 6 months (168 days) Ages 12 Years and Up Between primary series doses (1 and 2*) 8 weeks (56 days) *Nova Scotians who are [moderately to severely immunocompromised](https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirusimmunocompromised) will need a third dose of vaccine to complete their primary series. In this case, the time between the first dose and second dose is 4 weeks (28 days) and the time between the second dose and third dose is 8 weeks (56 days).

Frequently asked questions on COVID-19 vaccines Available Vaccines and Eligibility In Nova Scotia, anyone aged 6 months and older can receive COVID-19 vaccines for free. Eligibility is determined by age and other factors such as risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Vaccination with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) is strongly recommended based on the real-world evidence showing that they work well and are safe. \u00b7 Eligibility by Age - 6 Months - 4 Years - Primary Series Only - Moderna (Bivalent or Original) - 5 - 11 - Primary series - Pfizer Pediatric Bivalent or Moderna Bivalent - Booster dose - Pfizer Pediatric Bivalent or Moderna Bivalent - 12+ - Primary Series - Moderna and Pfizer Bivalent - Booster Dose - Moderna and Pfizer Bivalent Additional Information for ages 12 - 29 - People aged 12 to 29 are recommended to receive the Pfizer Bivalent vaccine for their primary series, to minimize the risk of having a rare side effect called [myocarditis and/or pericarditis](https://policy.nshealth.ca/Site_Published/covid19/document_render.aspx?documentRender.IdType=6&documentRender.GenericField=&documentRender.Id=88001)in this age group. - People aged 12 to 29 who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may choose to receive the Moderna Bivalent vaccine as an alternative to Pfizer Bivalent for their primary series, because it may provide better protection.

Vaccine Eligibility After COVID-19 Recovery You may have some short-term post-infection immunity, however your immunity decreases as time goes on. Vaccination after infection (also known as hybrid immunity) helps improve the immune response and provides better and longer-lasting protection than infection or vaccination alone. - If you had COVID-19 and require your primary series doses, you should wait at least 8 weeks (56 days) to get the vaccine. - If you had COVID-19 and have completed your primary series, you should wait 6 months (168 days) to get your next dose. How to access your COVID-19 vaccine proof of vaccination If you have not received a digital record of your COVID-19 vaccine(s), you can access your COVID-19 proof of vaccination by visiting: [novascotia.flow.canimmunize.ca/en/portal](https://novascotia.flow.canimmunize.ca/en/portal). Proof of COVID-19 vaccination is also available on VaxRecordNS - learn more at [www.nshealth.ca/vaxrecordns](https://www.nshealth.ca/vaxrecordns). If you are unable to access your record online, you can call your [local Public Health office](https://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices) to request that your proof of vaccination be mailed to you. Allergies A confirmed allergy to the COVID-19 vaccines is rare. If your health care provider has questions regarding allergies and COVID-19 vaccines s/he can contact an allergist. Pregnancy and breastfeeding The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) strongly recommends that people who are pregnant stay up-to-date on their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Getting vaccinated at any point during your pregnancy helps protect you and your baby. It is safe for you and your baby to be vaccinated while you are breastfeeding. Immunosuppression or immunocompromised status People who are immunocompromised (have a weak immune system) were not included in the trials testing COVID-19 vaccines. However, immunocompromised people have received Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines during the pandemic. There have not been any unique safety concerns raised about negative health effects from vaccine for immunocompromised people. If you're immunosuppressed from disease or treatment, you may have a reduced immune response to any COVID-19 vaccine. Recent data suggests that people with an autoimmune condition and normal immune system have a similar response to a COVID-19 vaccine than people without these conditions. There have not been any unique safety concerns raised about negative health effects from vaccine for autoimmune individuals. Immunosuppression, auto-immune disorders, pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications to COVID-19 immunization.

Medical Contraindications to COVID-19 vaccination Medical contraindications against COVID-19 vaccines are limited in number, and include: - a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after previous administration of a COVID-19 vaccine using a similar platform (mRNA or viral vector); - an allergy to any component of the specific COVID-19 vaccine or its container [polyethylene glycol (PEG) for Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines]; - a history of major venous and/or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine; - a history of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) following vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine As a precaution, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that people who experienced myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) should wait to get their next dose of mRNA vaccine until more information is available. If you have a history of myocarditis or pericarditis and are still being followed by a doctor for related heart issues, please follow up with your healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine. Nova Scotians who are concerned about their personal medical history and the available mRNA vaccines should speak with their healthcare provider. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines It is safe for people ages 6 months and over to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine, or at any time before or after other vaccines. No waiting period is necessary. "}
