It is very calming. I held back 1 star as it does not last as long as I would like. That may be the nature of the beast, and even so, I will still buy it again when this one runs out. I really do Love it :) Lovely scent and beautiful container!! love!! It is so pretty and smells fantastic! I ordered two crystal infused rollers as a Christmas present. Had to smell them before wrapping and they smell amazing. Can't wait for Christmas morning. Might have to order one for myself. This is a beautiful and lovely smelling piece of Heaven! It would make a beautiful Christmas gift! But be sure to keep one "}
